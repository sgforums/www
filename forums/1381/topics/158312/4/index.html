            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">As for all non Jews, nothing is said about God speaking to them in any way, until the gospel was preached to the gentile by Paul. Tribes living around the red sea worshipped their own God and idols, like the Baals, the egyptians, the indians had their own gods. There were much records about the ancient chinese worshipping the heaven but nothing is heard about God speaking to them. So I believe the non jews, pin fan ren or not, were guided by their own conscience, their cultures and traditions, and their religions, not by God, the creator of the heaven and the earth.<br></div></blockquote>I have always wondered why God only chose to "speak" to selected people in the middle East. How about the rest of the people in the world? Don't they matter to God?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My remarks in the following reply may be quite harsh and direct, but please bear in mind that it is not personally directed at you but just to challenge your thinking and belief.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by breytonhartge:</div><div class="quote_body">What is the point of being a Christian if we do not then have that assurance that we are saved. It is the whole crux of Jesus dying on the cross for our salvation!That is why we believe in Him and therefore have this very very strong assurance of our salvation!</div></blockquote>Is this the real reason why you are a Christian - to be saved and have a "guaranteed" place in heaven? If Christianity does not promise salvation and entry to heaven, and instead promotes spiritual peace, harmony and good works like Buddhism, will you "subscribe" to it?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Jesus is the only way to God, hence to Heaven. We are saved by Grace and not works... works cannot save you....<br></div><div class="quote_body">Ephesians 2:8-9<br>8 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, 9 not of works, lest anyone should boast. </div></blockquote>I've always wondered about this. If a person is very faithful to God but mean to everyone else and doesn't perform good works. Would u like this guy to be your neighbour in heaven? Do u think it's fair if God favours such a person but turns away someone else is many times better and nicer than this fellow?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">To answer the question, no i do not think that it is grossly unfair to non-christians who have led a fair life... if these people have heard the gospel and have rejected it, they have already been given the choice and they have chosen not to believe, if you reject Jesus, He will also reject you before the Father....  if you think that works can save you, then you are grossly mistaken.  That is why we are saved by grace... for a non-christian to be saved by works, he must keep the full extent of the law.... perfectly. Unless he can, he will definitely not be saved because all non-christians will be judged according to the law.... and none of us are sinless.[/quote]<br><br>Well, if God is fair, he should look closely to understand why the non-Christian rejected the gospel and did not convert. If the reason is valid, possibly because of bad examples set by some Christians, should God just turn him/her away?<br><br>I believe that, regardless of your religion, you will still have to abide by the ten commandments. In fact, it is said that Christians will be judged more harshly than non-Christians because they are expected to be fully aware of the "laws of sin". So it is advisable not to assume preferential treatment because of Christian membership.<br><br><blockquote>Christians will also stand before the judgement throne, but because we have accepted Jesus as our saviour, the things recorded against us will be blotted out... </blockquote>This is what some Christians think and it is a dangerous thought. By virtue of such a belief, some Christians knowingly commit sins, then confess their sins and assume they will still go to heaven because they're saved as a Christian. How very wrong.<br></div><div class="quote_body">[quote]One thing I have to make clear to you is that Christianity is not a religion, it is a personal relationship with GOD.THE WHOLE CRUX ABOUT BELIEVING IN JESUS IS THE GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL BE IN HEAVEN. If you think that this is not the way for you, you can choose to disagree, but for any Christian, we have this assurance because we believe! Wouldn't you want that kind of assurance? </div></blockquote>This is the meaning of religion:<br>- Belief in and reverence for a supernatural power or powers regarded as creator and governor of the universe.<br>- A personal or institutionalized system grounded in such belief and worship.<br>- The life or condition of a person in a religious order.<br>- A set of beliefs, values, and practices based on the teachings of a spiritual leader.<br>- A cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion.<br><br>Doesn't Christianity fit the meaning of religion?<br><br>Yes, who wouldn't like to be assured a place in heaven. But I'm skeptical - is there such a place, how could everyone who's Christian go to heaven despite all our sins just cos Jesus died for us, who can prove that every Christian will end up in heaven.<br><br>To be a Christian so as to be saved and go to heaven, is the wrong reason to believe in Christianity. The love for God or whoever He/She is, should not be based on what He/She can give you. If so, should you realise one day that He/She cannot or did not give you what you expected from Him/Her, you would lose faith in Him. That is precisely how former Christians fell away from Christianity, because they did not get what they prayed for.</div>
