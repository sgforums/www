Namely, that the erroneous belief that ‘science’ insists that evolution and long ages are ‘fact’ is the most serious challenge to biblical authority, and thus to the faith in general, that Christendom has ever faced.

                      thing is very clear from all this. Namely, that the erroneous

                      â€˜factâ€™ is the most serious challenge to biblical authority, and
                      thus to the faith in general, that Christendom has ever faced. If
                      even Jesusâ€™ words in Scripture canâ€™t be trusted on some issues, how
                      are we supposed to trust anything in the Bible at

              <p>The thing I see exposed is your contempt for the plain meaning of Scripture as you clearly subject God's infallible revelation to man's fallible reason, elevating the words of men above the Word of God. Appealing to the Bible is of course an appeal to authority, God's authority no less! Everyone appeals to some kind of authority, question is, which authority? The truth is that anyone who believes in evolution or that God used evolution has placed man above God, trusting what man says instead of what God says, exchanging the authority of God's Word for a pottage of intellectual respectability from the unbelieving world.

              <p>Where did Jesus say that it was 4000 yrs ago? Dr Hasel said that? By saying I did not read the footnotes reveal that you did not read it yourself. I read just to unravel these fallacies.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #2d2d2d; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;">Dr Hasel rightly assumed that there were no gaps in the genealogies, as will be justified below."</span></p>

              <p>Unfortunately you failed to unravel fallacious arguments, but you certainly betrayed your disbelief in the Word of God.</p>
              <p>Must Jesus explicitly says "The earth is 4000 years old" before we can rightly conclude that this is what He believe? You questioned Hasel's "rightly assumed" but apparently failed to read what you yourself quoted. You missed the "as will be justified below" part.</p>
              <p>Where does the table come from? Had you read the article you would not have asked such a silly juvenile question! The heading says it loud and clear that it is a tabulation of the "Chronogenealogies of the Patriarchs according to <strong>different textual traditions</strong>". Which traditions? Go find out for yourself, am not spoon-feeding you.</p>
              <p>Where did the chart come from? This is another silly juvenile question, as silly as asking where the creeds of the early church come from. Such information is taken from the Bible and presented in graphical format lah! You got a problem with this? That's YOUR problem.</p>
              <p>Your picture about Jesus not wanting 4 different versions is an indictment against people like you who compromise God's Word. There is only ONE version of creation in the Bible. A six day creation. Six times Genesis 1 says at the end of each day of creation that there was "an evening and a morning". Six times! Each time that phrase appears, and comes attached with a number it ALWAYS means an ordinary day. How you can squeeze billions of years into 6 days is beyond human logic. It's insane.</p>

              Once again yoy show yourself to be incompetent in seeing your own errors. Tell me, what in the world is an exegrete? Exegete I know but exegrete? Duh.
              
              <p>Again there is no issue of out of context for Jesus' words. A good exegete will not fail to draw the conclusion that Jesus was talking about a real historical Adam and Eve who were created from the beginning i.e. day six of creation week. The Jews have no notion of an earth that is billions of years old. And you obviously teh gong about the Jewish calendar.
              
              </p><p>Not necessary means not necessary lah! Again a good exegete would know that the time from Abraham to Jesus spans about 2000 years and this is not disputed at all. Problem is when compromisers (like you) believe in evolution and must deny the plain truth that the Bible teaches about a literal Adam who was created and a literal Eve who was fashioned from his rib, all on a single day.

              And when you do respond at all I see the very same things you accused others of. Not only do you deny the veracity of Scripture you endorse the irrational, and stupidly believe that God used evolution to create the universe, oblivious to the fact the evolution is a theory thought up to deny the need for God, even His very existence. You would see God's handwork in an undirected, random, naturalistic process that began in a big bang which after billions of years evolved and somehow we came to be? Such is completely anti-thetical to the plain teaching of Scripture yet you would heartily embraced it.

              The issue is not about being selective, but what is the BASIS of selection. To blindly think that ALL commands in the OT must be applied today is silly, if not dangerous. Good exegesis must come before proper application.
