              <p>But you could before you left the faith, how did you do it at that time?</p>
              <p>No I do not find it weird that there are things in the Bible that are not practised by Christians today. 100% of the Bible is taken as truth, but not 100% of the Bible is meant to be applicable. Like I said, Christians do not each go about building an Ark. You know why?</p>
              <p>Doing and not just listening also depend on proper handling of the Word. The Bible says we must rightly divide the Word of God. The way you did so is wrongly distorting the Word of God.</p>
