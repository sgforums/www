              <p>This impression you have reflects your lack of knowledge of Biblical hermeneutics.  But for those who train themselves in rightly dividing the Word of God, they will know that not every command in the Bible is applicable to Christians today. The Bible must be read with common sense. Do you believe every Christian should read Genesis 6 and start building a three storeyed Ark today? Why not? Should every Christian seek to be circumcised today? Again why not?</p>
              <p>Christian author Roy Zuck presents several guidelines for determining which biblical examples, commands, and practices apply today: �</p>
              <p>1. Some situations, commands, or principles are repeatable, continuous, or not revoked, and/or pertain to moral and theological subjects, and/or are repeated elsewhere in Scripture, and therefore are permanent and transferable to us.</p>
              <p>2. Some situations, commands, or principles pertain to an individual's specific nonrepeatable circumstances, and/or nonmoral or nontheological subjects, and/or have been revoked, and are therefore not transferable to today. �</p>
              <p>3. Some situations or commands pertain to cultural settings that are only partially similar to ours and in which only the principles are transferable. �</p>
              <p>4. Some situations or commands pertain to cultural settings with no similarities but in which the principles are transferable.</p>

              <p>1. The link you gave is one big excuse not to take the Bible in its plain straightforward manner. Worse still it committed the fallacy to motive by saying that YEC have agenda to interpret the text to fit young earth view. It says "Some young earth theorists, including Jonathan Sarfati in his book Refuting Compromise, have addressed this verse in Zechariah an Hosea. Although his argument sounds impressive, you have to recognize it for what it is...he is arguing for his young earth agenda, thus any rules that he espouses must be examined by true Hebrew scholars who are impartial.

              the true intent of the Hebrew author (a questionable deduction, as   
              will be presently shown), this seems to run counter to modern scientific
               research,   which indicates that the planet Earth was created several

              <p>This impression you have reflects your lack of knowledge of
              Biblical hermeneutics.  But for those who train
              themselves in rightly dividing the Word of God, they will know that
              not every command in the Bible is applicable to Christians today.
              The Bible must be read with common sense. Do you believe every
              Christian should read Genesis 6 and start building a three storeyed
              Ark today? Why not? Should every Christian seek to be circumcised
              today? Again why not?</p>
              <p>Christian author Roy Zuck presents several guidelines for
              determining which biblical examples, commands, and practices apply
              today:</p>
              <p>1. Some situations, commands, or principles are repeatable,
              continuous, or not revoked, and/or pertain to moral and theological
              subjects, and/or are repeated elsewhere in Scripture, and therefore
              are permanent and transferable to us.</p>
              <p>2. Some situations, commands, or principles pertain to an
              individual's specific nonrepeatable circumstances, and/or nonmoral
              or nontheological subjects, and/or have been revoked, and are
              therefore not transferable to today.</p>
              <p>3. Some situations or commands pertain to cultural settings that
              are only partially similar to ours and in which only the principles
              are transferable.</p>
              <p>4. Some situations or commands pertain to cultural settings with
              no similarities but in which the principles are transferable.</p>

              <p>In book of matthew, Jesus told disciples to cut off their limbs and gouge out their eyes if they sin. Mind you, it is the words of Jesus himself, of the Christian God himself..</p>
              <p>If you read in context that passage, nowhere in the passage does it hint that what he said was metaphorical. If you read in context, in fact, the whole passage, he was talking about how to deal with life's situations practically.</p>

              <p>3. Then read it to understand. Ask what you don't understand. I may answer. Which concludes you didn't read and just throw a random link....</p>

              <p>Begging the question, on what basis do you say that Jesus was not teaching in hyperbole?</p>
              <p>As for me, my evidence is that none of Jesus' hearers started amputating themselves and gorging out their eyes. His hearers did not take it literally, so why you pushing it? The Jews know what is hyperbolic teaching, you don't. It is your ignorance at work here, not my problem. I understand the Scriptures, you don't. </p>
              <p>Bottom line: Yours is the kind of wooden literalism that is DANGEROUS. Yet this is precisely the strawman argument you are using.</p>
