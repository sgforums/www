              <p>Wow, the way you can twist yourself out of a situation is really something! A clear case of wrongly calling it exegrete you can weasel out and say you were trying to combine excrete with exegete. How hard is it to admit you were wrong? Duh.</p>
              <p>Like it or not, the worldview of the Jews in the Bible has no place for billions of years. Evolution put man at the end whereas Biblical creation has man "from the beginning of creation". It is not about putting words in Jesus' mouth, but understanding the Hebrew worldview, of which you FAILED to take the initiative to find out. Must spoon feed you, say ahhhhhh.....</p>

              <p>You accused me of misinformation by omission, yet you utterly failed to prove where the misinformation is and what. Just accuse can liao. Duh. You certainly do not believe in Biblical creation, so what view of origins do you hold then? I look forward to yet another ambiguous non-committal answer from you.</p>

              picking) to tabulate it as 4000yrs but went on to assert it as
              such(appeal to believe). The link took Jesus words to meant Jesus
              believe in what they believe(quoting out of context). You can
              believe it true by blindly following what they want you to believe.
              I'm asking for biblical proofs and you give me none... but referred
              to Jewish beliefs(red herring). So are you arguing on Christians
              beliefs or on Jewish beliefs? </p>

              You are simply using your ignorance to argue against the article, or else you lack the initiative to check things out for yourself. I have already supplied the information that the time between Abraham and Jesus was about 2000 years. Unless you have some good evidence that it should be far longer than a couple of thousands of years, your objection is simply another silly juvenille attempt to deny a clear teaching of the Bible. And it wasn't a case of making Jesus believe what we did, but believing in what Jesus did believe. You got things all wrong! Biblical proofs have been given but for those not in tune with the Boble it is no wonder that they failed to see it. And your fallacy of false dilemma is noted. The Bible is a book steeped in the Hebrew-Jewish mindset, so I am free to use both Newish and Christian beliefs as they do not necessarily conflict at all points. Again you should not use your ignorance of Bible knowledge to invalidate the argument made based on knowledge of the Bible.

                  Wrong again. Please know that the Bible has a verse that says God loves a cheerful giver but not a verse that says be cheerful when you give and not happy then don't give. You do not have to fake joy when giving. Rather the context is that Christian giving is never reluctant or under pressure but entirely up to the discretion of the giver.

              Unbelievers may not take the Bible seriously but believers ought to. If you bother to read the relevant passage you will see that it has nothing to say about happy give not happy then don't give. Your happiness is not the precondition for giving. A person who gives as he has determined for himself to give is a cheerful giver because such giving is not coerced or pressured.

              <p>I'm not against their Scriptures but their rejection to Jesus.

              you lack the initiative to check things out for yourself. I have
              already supplied the information that the time between Abraham and
              Jesus was about 2000 years. Unless you have some good evidence that
              it should be far longer than a couple of thousands of years, your
              objection is simply another silly juvenille attempt to deny a clear
              teaching of the Bible. And it wasn't a case of making Jesus believe
              what we did, but believing in what Jesus did believe. You got
              things all wrong!</span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;"> "</span></p>
              <p>No you did not supply the information, you merely said it as so.
              No link, no source, no credential.  Your claim "<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">the time
              between Abraham and Jesus was about 2000 years", </span>so
              take up the burden of proof. Where is the information that shows
              the chronologe from Abraham to Jesus? The Jewish link has no such
              information. Christian source please since the Jews rejected Jesus
              Christ as Saviour and will not endorse what you claim Jesus to
              believe. Nice try shifting the burden of proof. </p>

              proofs have been given but for those not in tune with the Boble it
              is no wonder that they failed to see it. And your fallacy of false
              dilemma is noted. The Bible is a book steeped in the Hebrew-Jewish
              mindset, so I am free to use both Newish and Christian beliefs as
              they do not necessarily conflict at all points. Again you should
              not use your ignorance of Bible knowledge to invalidate the
              argument made based on knowledge of the Bible."</span></p>

              was quite taken aback that you used their beliefs to back you

                  <p>Your choice to link to Jewish beliefs is... puzzling. If Jews
                  accepted Christ, they would be Christians primarily...</p>
                  <p>Still that link you linked to argue that Jesus believed in a
                  young earth still has this deliberate omission. If the jews
                  rejected Christ, I have no reasons to believe in what they say
                  about what Christ believed. </p>
                  <p>Oh... are we arguing that the Jews believe in a young earth
                  now(red herring)? That's not my concern... </p>

                  Apparently you have no idea why they called it the Judaeo-Christian worldview. Fact is that there are Jews who believe in Jesus. And it is a fallacy of yours to harp about them not being primarily believers of Jesus when the issue was about what they believe about the age of the earth from their Hebrew Scriptures. You said it is not your concern that Jews believe in a young earth. This is simply your refusal to accept the evidence that supports a young earth view. Ignoring the truth does not make it go away.

              Why? Problem? With what? The Jews? Their rejection of Christ? But do all Jews reject Christ? The first believers were largely Jewish. Today there are many Jewish who believe in Jesus too.  Jesus was a Jew. No wonder your knowledge of the Bible is so shallow, you completely ignored the Jewish roots of the Christian faith.
