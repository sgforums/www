              <p>Remove it from the Bible? </p>
              <p>Only if you think Christianity is man made and the Bible was made by man. There are specific (and strongly worded) warnings not to add or remove anything from the Bible. Would you do it, if you believe the Bible (the whole thing) are the Word of God?</p>
              <p>The Bible is a complete whole. People just need to be taught the difference between OT and NT.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately even some ministers do not know how to "correctly divide the word". The Bible is like one big lawyer's contract of inheritance. There are terms and conditions and legal rights. You have to know how those can be effected. Like any legal doument, it is not easy to interpret - there are clauses upon clauses and secondary claims.</p>
              <p>A good lawyer will become a good Bible scholar, although not necessarily a good teacher and imparter of the Word.</p>

              <p>I am well aware of Bible canon and Textual Criticism.</p>
              <p>I have asked this question and prayed to God about this before and I got my answer - No pastor taught me this, although he contributed greatly to the foundations.</p>
              <p>I know the basics of how the Bible can maintain its integrity. Which books are canon, which aren't. Why the "Gospel of Thomas", "Gospel of Mary", etc  is not part of the canon.</p>
              <p>Maybe it's my background in law enforcement and my exposure to law. It has to do with witnesses. A crime happened at a scene in which the judge was not there to see it, how can one possibly make a claim that what was presented in court is legit and true? Evidences and supporting witnesses, and intent.... There are also other things which are crucial but I don't have the terms and name for it.</p>
              <p>Paul is a key central figure and holds many things together, which is also why the Pauline epistles comprises of 2/3 of the NT, and why they are not written by the original 11 (12 minus Judas).</p>
              <p>It is also the reason why the Bible can interpret itself without a need for any external commentary written by other men. A key verse would be "in the mouth of 2 to 3 witnesses, every word shall be established." This verse also provides "commentary" on the mystery of the Trinity. Jesus spoke about the 3 witnesses often - the water, the blood, the word. He also speaks of the witness the Holy Spirit bears and that he does not bear witness of Himself (which is to say His Word is not His own - "If I testify about myself, my testimony is not valid." John 5:31) Like in court, you cannot just say anything and then use yourself to back it up. It doesn't stand.</p>
              <p>There is also gematria (number value of the hebrew words), word pictures and bible code which all bear witness to each other, all written by "secretaries to God" - men who lived and died with many years in between them - there is no mathematical possiblity of comparing notes because of this. Because of the mathematical probability or improbability, the Bible is inspired, and not a product of man, because no man is smart enough to orchestrate such complex "coincidences". How can they? They lived so many centuries apart in different places with different circumstances, yet the the hidden codes, the language, the prophecies, the pieces all fall together like a jigsaw.</p>
              <p>I have seen great architecture, music and art... Swiss watchs with great complications. But the Bible is truly something else. It's a beauty if you see it.</p>

              <p>I am well aware of Bible canon and Textual Criticism.</p>
              <p>I have asked this question and prayed to God about this before
                  and I got my answer - No pastor taught me this, although he
                  contributed greatly to the foundations.</p>
              <p>I know the basics of how the Bible can maintain its integrity.
                  Which books are canon, which aren't. Why the "Gospel of Thomas",
                  "Gospel of Mary", etc  is not part of the canon.</p>
              <p>Maybe it's my background in law enforcement and my exposure to
                  law. It has to do with witnesses. A crime happened at a scene in
                  which the judge was not there to see it, how can one possibly make
                  a claim that what was presented in court is legit and true?
                  Evidences and supporting witnesses, and intent.... There are also
                  other things which are crucial but I don't have the terms and name
                  for it.</p>
              <p>Paul is a key central figure and holds many things together,
                  which is also why the Pauline epistles comprises of 2/3 of the NT,
                  and why they are not written by the original 11 (12 minus
                  Judas).</p>
              <p>It is also the reason why the Bible can interpret itself without
                  a need for any external commentary written by other men. A key
                  verse would be "in the mouth of 2 to 3 witnesses, every word shall
                  be established." This verse also provides "commentary" on the
                  mystery of the Trinity. Jesus spoke about the 3 witnesses often -
                  the water, the blood, the word. He also speaks of the witness the
                  Holy Spirit bears and that he does not bear witness of Himself
                  (which is to say His Word is not His own - "If I testify about
                  myself, my testimony is not valid." John 5:31) Like in court, you
                  cannot just say anything and then use yourself to back it up. It
                  doesn't stand.</p>
              <p>There is also gematria (number value of the hebrew words), word
                  pictures and bible code which all bear witness to each other, all
                  written by "secretaries to God" - men who lived and died with many
                  years in between them - there is no mathematical possiblity of
                  comparing notes because of this. Because of the mathematical
                  probability or improbability, the Bible is inspired, and not a
                  product of man, because no man is smart enough to orchestrate such
                  complex "coincidences". How can they? They lived so many centuries
                  apart in different places with different circumstances, yet the the
                  hidden codes, the language, the prophecies, the pieces all fall
                  together like a jigsaw.</p>
              <p>I have seen great architecture, music and art... Swiss watchs
                  with great complications. But the Bible is truly something else.
                  It's a beauty if you see it.</p>

              <p>That is not even great. If you really want to pick us Christians apart, you should use Macabees in the Catholic Bible and why Gospel of Thomas is not canon in the Protestant Bible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>NIV, KJV, etc are English translations of the original scrolls. The Bible was originally written in Hebrew in the OT and Greek in the NT (although some scholars claim that Aramaic was the original even before the Greek scrolls were around)</p>
              <p>English texts are secondary, even tertiery sources of scripture.</p>

              <p>No. I am just following your logic of "thou should not remove any books from the bible".</p>
              <p>So why did protestants remove the books a few hundred years ago?</p>
              <p>And similarly like what you asked, how do they know what is supposed to be in and what is not supposed to be in? How can they just remove chunks of chapters like that?</p>

              <p>Again I am throwing back the question at you, which are the books that should have been in there which should not have been thrown out? When you accuse others of removing or throwing things away, it presupposes that you know what should have been there to begin with. So tell me, what is it? If you don't know, then just say so, and your allegation will be thrown out as well.</p>

              <p>Facts are proven. Beliefs are another story. Get these two right.</p>
              <p>In fact, I have asked Catholics regarding protestants removing books, verses from the canonised bible. To Catholics, that is a grave sin, in accordance to the revelation verse.</p>
              <p>But when I ask protestan christians, its either most of them don't even know about the canonised bible, or they justify removing of books from the catholic bible, but are against removing of books from the protestant bibles.</p>
              <p>To me as a bystander, that is just confusing.</p>

              <p>Do you find it distasteful that evolutionists push their beliefs
              as universal fact to everyone, as though they have proven that life
              came from nonlife, and that all living things came from one common
              ancestor, aka particles to profesors?</p>

              <p>Joe,</p>
              <p>Facts are proven. Beliefs are another story. Get these two
                      right.</p>
              <p>In fact, I have asked Catholics regarding protestants removing
                      books, verses from the canonised bible. To Catholics, that is a
                      grave sin, in accordance to the revelation verse.</p>
              <p>But when I ask protestan christians, its either most of them
                      don't even know about the canonised bible, or they justify removing
                      of books from the catholic bible, but are against removing of books
                      from the protestant bibles.</p>
              <p>To me as a bystander, that is just confusing.</p>

              <p>From what I know is that the good Christians says that it is not necessary to give at all, and if want to give, give as you wish, not necessary 10%, can be more can be less, up to you.</p>
              <p>It is the kia see, kia su Christians that say must give 10% or more, in order to be true, blessed or correct.</p>
              <p>Of course then there is the businessman, who says you must give a).10%  b). alms  c). the first fruits (i.e. first pay, first bonus, increment) and d). love gift and lastly e). your shirt and trousers and throw in your flat.</p>
