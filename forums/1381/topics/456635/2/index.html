              <p>Wrong. I am not discounting the Scriptures, but properly understanding it. Just because something is no longer relevant under the New Covenant does not mean you take it out. Everything in the Bible is there for our instruction. The ritual and civil laws of Israel are not applicable to us, but they teach us about God's holiness.</p>

              <p>Which fact of "molecules to microbiologists" evolution is proven?</p>
              <p>Fallacy of hypothesis contrary to fact. Is anyone pushing Snow White as fact?</p>
              <p>But let's just take your argument for now. Would you be angry if someone pushes his belief that kissing a frog can instantly turn it into a prince as fact? I supposed you would, if you are consistent. It's fiction, a fairy tale. But how come you can add "millions of years" i.e. kiss the frog for a million years to get a prince you get to call it fact and science? You get the drift?</p>
              <p>No amount of kisses can change a frog to a prince. Likewise, no amount of time can turn nonliving matter to life, or simple organisms to complex human beings. From where does the new genetic information come from for each supposed gradual step of evolution? Mutations presuppose the existence of genetic information, where did that come from? Natural selection is more a culling effect than a creative mind selecting "good" mutations to evolve higher and higher.</p>

              <p>Atheists also disagree among themselves, so why don't you laugh at fellow atheists?</p>
              <p>Disagreements are inevitable, it's how we disagree that matters more. Disagreement presupposes the existence of objective truths. So either tithing is Christian or it is not. Disagreement does not mean both views are right. In any case, this issue is not a basic issue or a core tenet of the faith. You don't lose your salvation by disagreeing on tithing. Salvation is not tied to tithing.</p>

              <p>Bikeforceful,</p>
              <p>You are saying to read the bible in context. And because the first fruits verse is 4000 years ago, it's not applicable.</p>
              <p>THen the whole bible is not applicable, going by your logic. The new testament is 2000 years old. And the writers were talking about things that happen 2000 years ago.</p>
              <p>So it shouldnt be applicable too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am going by your logic of texts becoming not applicable because it's old.</p>

              <p>If you claim that Jesus death has done away the old testament and old laws, why still use the ten commandments?Why still obey the sabbath? Why still use anti-gay laws in the OT? Why still quote from the OT if the laws are not applicable?</p>

              <p>Jesus only survived 3 years of his noble preaching to benefit mankind
                   before being murdered. It's doubtful that Jesus will prescribe a

                  there are more less fortunate than affordable to fulfil that 10% for end
                   to meet in a capitalism and materialism world. Besides, heaven is 
                  beyond dollars &amp; cents, Jesus knows very well. Noble lord like Jesus

                  descend into hell chancelessly for heavenly bliss and suffering in hell 
                  eternally, for both believers &amp; non believers? Bible is saying that

              <p>It's 
              strange because either this god is telling the two groups differently or
               the same infallible book can have multiple interpretations (and
