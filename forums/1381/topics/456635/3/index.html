              <p>Precisely! The point is not whether Christians agree on everything or not, the point is whether Christianity is true or false. The only justifiable reason for rejecting Christianity is because it is false, not because Christians fail to agree. Like I said, it is lame to use this as a reason to leave the faith. Our disagreement reflects our fallen human nature, we do not know everything which is why we disagree on lots of things. Also, failure to understand each other also accounts for disagreements. So don't be so simplistic to think that disagreement among Christians mean Christianity is false and thus must be rejected.</p>
              <p>God's Word is objective. God is not telling us different things. Everyone reads the SAME text. But we interpret things differently. Why? Because no two persons are alike and each comes to the text with their own background and presuppositions and bias and prejudice etc etc. You would have known all this had you been better taught during CE lessons, or had you at least read some good books on Bible interpretation.</p>

              <p>Sure. your way of "properly understanding" is to pick out those
              OT verses you think are applicable and convenient and then chuck
              those inconvenient OT verses away.</p>
              <p>If you claim that Jesus death has done away the old testament
              and old laws, why still use the ten commandments?Why still obey the
              sabbath? Why still use anti-gay laws in the OT? Why still quote
              from the OT if the laws are not applicable?</p>

              <p>That's why I say your Bible knowledge is pathetic. I already told you that the 10 commandments are restated in the NT as "Love God, Love Neighour". Paul in the NT spoke against immorality including homosexuality. Again you need to read the Bible again, and intelligently. Seek help, don't Kay Kiang and think you can just read the Bible and know everything and understand everything. Consult Bible commentaries or read some good books, that should have been the things you did when you have doubts or problems with understanding the faith. You give up too easily. Or your roots were shallow and you were an easy target for the evil one to lead you astray.</p>

              for 10 percents, so that those contributed ascend to heaven and

              <p>There's a whole world of difference between God and a loanshark!</p>
              <p>If you give freely and voluntarily it is more likely that you are happy doing so, rather than if you were under compulsion to. The Bible is saying that God loves cheerful givers because such givers are not compelled to. I mean, even you would love a cheerful giver as compared to a long-faced grumpy one, isn't it? Giving in the Bible is about giving what you have.</p>
              <p>But a loanshark is not about you giving what you have cheerfully, but about you paying back what you owe to them. Loansharks do not give a hoot whether you are cheerful or not. You are under compulsion to pay what you borrowed from them.</p>

                                   death. Scientists disagree with each other too. Not every scientist 
                                  agree with Einstein's theory too, and it doesn't stop them from 
                                  continuing their research and finding out the answer to their 
                                  thesis.</p>
              <p>Small things you can disagree. Big things you cannot. 
                                  Things like salvation by faith, not by works. This is the basic, because 
                                  if you don't know this, everything can be a basis for "hellfire" and 
                                  will warp your theology. (If I don't tithe, will I go to hell?) Once you are sure that salvation is by faith in
                                   Jesus's finished work and nothing can add to it, then can you move on 
                                  to other things.</p>
              <p>The things of God are spiritually discerned -
                                   that means it takes a spiritual person with spiritual eyes to see them.
                                   If you will open your heart, God will find you and let you see the 
                                  answers you are looking for. You don't find truth, truth will find you. 
                                  That's when the conviction is real. And you know for sure and you don't 
                                  really need anyone to tell you.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">God has more leeway than you 
                                  think</span>, although he is absolute. There is such a thing as grace in 
                                  theology. (from where we get the word "gracious"). How can God be 
                                  absolute and "flexible" at the same time? I cannot explain it all in 1 
                                  sitting, but if you will open your heart and take step-by-step in faith,
                                   more answers will come to you.<br><br><strong>To answer your question</strong> why "the 
                                  same god can tell different christians that different part of the OT are
                                   applicable". By that I take it that you mean why Christians don't 
                                  agree?</p>
              <p>A few reasons, I will talk about the main ones. Because the
                                   Bible is a very thick tome of writings that nobody can finish in one 
                                  go. It takes a length of time to read all of it. It took me 4 years to 
                                  finish it. Reading it is one thing, processing what you read and 
                                  understanding it is a different thing. There are times you can read 
                                  something, but not really reading - kind of like your wife is talking to
                                   you, but you are not really listening, although you hear the words.</p>
              <p>Because
                                   of this, most Christians rely on a Bible teacher (like a pastor) to 
                                  preach and teach the word and sometimes this just produces people who 
                                  only regurgitate what their pastor tell them. They need to double check 
                                  it with the Bible to make sure if it tallies. (The Bereans in the Bible 
                                  did this and so Scripture teaches us to do this, though not everyone 
                                  obeys this scripture. Hence, sometimes incorrect things are passed down -
                                   as church tradition, etc.). You have every right to throw away anything
                                   that is taught that does not conform to scripture.</p>
              <p><strong>Another reason is:</strong> not everybody interprets the Bible correctly... because some verses *appear* to contradict one another.<br><br>First
                                   of all, you must acknowledge that the book (Bible) as being of 
                                  supernatural origin. Although penned down by men, the content is 
                                  inspired. Just because someone is a Minister (like a pastor), has a Phd,
                                   or has attended Bible college doesn't mean his interpretation is right,
                                   you still have to check it. Because if the book is supernatural in 
                                  origin, it will take a supernatural force to unlock its secrets and to 
                                  understand it.<br><br>You have to understand. The Bible is hidden. To a 
                                  normal person, you will read it and find nothing meaningful and even 
                                  come to the wrong conclusions. So, one has to rely on the true Author to
                                   reveal to him what it really means. What this means is that YOU HAVE TO PRAY. And God Himself will open your eyes to see. There's no description of this experience - it's like riding a bicycle. How do you know you have balance? It's just something natural.<br><br><strong>Lastly, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nobody knows 
                                  everything</span> about the Bible.</strong> At most people know sizable chunks of the 
                                  truths in it. And the really really important ones. There are an inexhaustible amount of things hidden in the 
                                  Bible waiting to be revealed. If everyone knew everything, then He will 
                                  be exactly like Jesus, because He is the Word made flesh and that person
                                   will know 100% what the book of Revelations is all about - the truth 
                                  is, no one knows all of the things, what some of the symbols mean in 
                                  Revelations. God reveals truths in stages, not all in one go. When you 
                                  are ready, He will bring you to the next stage (milk vs. solid food). 
                                  But salvation by faith in Jesus is the foundation. You cannot go on, 
                                  until you really know that one.</p>
              <p>I cannot explain everything on this forum. It takes time to slowly 
                                  uncover the scriptures bit by bit. The Bible is known to be like bread 
                                  (man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from
                                   the mouth of God), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you don't eat 1 year's worth of food in one go. You 
                                  eat it in portions</span>, and then you grow, from toddler (needing milk) to 
                                  young child (who can take solid food), to a full grown adult. It's the same way. I
                                   hope I am making sense. And I pray Jesus reveals Himself to you in a 
                                  personal way so you are acquainted with Him and His presence. Then, you 
                                  don't need to be convinced by anyone and you won't be tossed to and fro 
                                  (like the Bible says). You will have faith for yourself.</p>

              <p><br>Of course I take issue with his interpretation. Any good exegete would. The context was entirely missed. This text had nothing to do with tithing, or giving to the church to fund buildings or pastoral salaries etc. The context was Paul's collection for the needy Christians in Jerusalem. The Corinthian believers were rich in spiritual gifts and Paul hopes that they will be rich and generous in their giving to the fellow saints in Jerusalem. But Paul wanted each believer to give freely and decide for himself how much to give, not under compulsion or with reluctance, so that their giving is done cheerfully. There is no joy in compulsion. Mandatory tithing is compulsion which would violate the notion of teaching that Paul taught. Note that Paul did not teach or say "Not happy then don't give." Instead he taught, "Give what you have decided to give."</p>

              <p>2. broinchrist and I had to deal with that as well. It's ok to

              <p>Small things you can disagree. Big things you cannot. Things
              like salvation by faith, not by works. This is the basic, because
              if you don't know this, everything can be a basis for "hellfire"
              and will warp your theology. (If I don't tithe, will I go to hell?)
              Once you are sure that salvation is by faith in Jesus's finished
              work and nothing can add to it, then can you move on to other
              things.</p>

              That's when the conviction is real. And you know for sure and you

              it all in 1 sitting, but if you will open your heart and take
              step-by-step in faith, more answers will come to you.<br> <br> <strong>To answer your question</strong> why "the same god can tell
              different christians that different part of the OT are applicable".
              By that I take it that you mean why Christians don't agree?</p>
              <p>A few reasons, I will talk about the main ones. Because the
              Bible is a very thick tome of writings that nobody can finish in
              one go. It takes a length of time to read all of it. It took me 4
              years to finish it. Reading it is one thing, processing what you
              read and understanding it is a different thing. There are times you
              can read something, but not really reading - kind of like your wife
              is talking to you, but you are not really listening, although you
              hear the words.</p>
              <p>Because of this, most Christians rely on a Bible teacher (like a
              pastor) to preach and teach the word and sometimes this just
              produces people who only regurgitate what their pastor tell them.
              They need to double check it with the Bible to make sure if it
              tallies. (The Bereans in the Bible did this and so Scripture
              teaches us to do this, though not everyone obeys this scripture.
              Hence, sometimes incorrect things are passed down - as church
              tradition, etc.). You have every right to throw away anything that
              is taught that does not conform to scripture.</p>
              <p><strong>Another reason is:</strong> not everybody interprets the
              Bible correctly... because some verses *appear* to contradict one
              another.<br> <br> First of all, you must acknowledge that the book (Bible) as being
              of supernatural origin. Although penned down by men, the content is
              inspired. Just because someone is a Minister (like a pastor), has a
              Phd, or has attended Bible college doesn't mean his interpretation
              is right, you still have to check it. Because if the book is
              supernatural in origin, it will take a supernatural force to unlock
              its secrets and to understand it.<br> <br> You have to understand. The Bible is hidden. To a normal person,
              you will read it and find nothing meaningful and even come to the
              wrong conclusions. So, one has to rely on the true Author to reveal
              to him what it really means. What this means is that YOU HAVE TO
              PRAY. And God Himself will open your eyes to see. There's no
              description of this experience - it's like riding a bicycle. How do
              you know you have balance? It's just something natural.<br> <br> <strong>Lastly, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nobody
              knows everything</span> about the Bible.</strong> At most people
              know sizable chunks of the truths in it. And the really really
              important ones. There are an inexhaustible amount of things hidden
              in the Bible waiting to be revealed. If everyone knew everything,
              then He will be exactly like Jesus, because He is the Word made
              flesh and that person will know 100% what the book of Revelations
              is all about - the truth is, no one knows all of the things, what
              some of the symbols mean in Revelations. God reveals truths in
              stages, not all in one go. When you are ready, He will bring you to
              the next stage (milk vs. solid food). But salvation by faith in
              Jesus is the foundation. You cannot go on, until you really know
              that one.</p>
              <p>I cannot explain everything on this forum. It takes time to
              slowly uncover the scriptures bit by bit. The Bible is known to be
              like bread (man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word
              that proceeds from the mouth of God), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you don't eat 1 year's worth of food
              in one go. You eat it in portions</span>, and then you grow, from
              toddler (needing milk) to young child (who can take solid food), to
              a full grown adult. It's the same way. I hope I am making sense.
              And I pray Jesus reveals Himself to you in a personal way so you
              are acquainted with Him and His presence. Then, you don't need to
              be convinced by anyone and you won't be tossed to and fro (like the
              Bible says). You will have faith for yourself.</p>

              <p>2. broinchrist and I had to deal with that as well. It's ok to
              disagree on some things. Even broinchrist and I disagree with some
              things. For me the tithe is voluntary, for him the tithe is 100%
              gone. But It's a small thing. Not a matter of life and death.
              Scientists disagree with each other too. Not every scientist agree
              with Einstein's theory too, and it doesn't stop them from
              continuing their research and finding out the answer to their
              thesis.</p>
              <p>Small things you can disagree. Big things you cannot. Things
              like salvation by faith, not by works. This is the basic, because
              if you don't know this, everything can be a basis for "hellfire"
              and will warp your theology. (If I don't tithe, will I go to hell?)
              Once you are sure that salvation is by faith in Jesus's finished
              work and nothing can add to it, then can you move on to other
              things.</p>
              <p>The things of God are spiritually discerned - that means it
              takes a spiritual person with spiritual eyes to see them. If you
              will open your heart, God will find you and let you see the answers
              you are looking for. You don't find truth, truth will find you.
              That's when the conviction is real. And you know for sure and you
              don't really need anyone to tell you.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">God has more leeway than

              Christians in Jerusalem. The Corinthian believers were rich in
              spiritual gifts and Paul hopes that they will be rich and generous
              in their giving to the fellow saints in Jerusalem. But Paul wanted
              each believer to give freely and decide for himself how much to
              give, not under compulsion or with reluctance, so that their
              giving is done cheerfully. There is no joy in compulsion. Mandatory
              tithing is compulsion which would violate the notion of teaching
              that Paul taught. Note that Paul did not teach or say "Not
              happy then don't give." Instead he taught, "Give what you have

              <p>Interpreting the Bible in context is not to be confused with the implication or application of it. Interpretation comes before application. Only when you have properly exegeted the text, in its immediate context and the larger context of the Bible, then can you ask the next question, is this applicable today? Problem for you is that you did not even get the interpretation step right. Did anyone teach you about inductive Bible study? Did you read books like "How to Read the Bible For All It's Worth" by Gordon Fee? Go read it.</p>

              <p>Interpreting the Bible in context is not to be confused with the
              implication or application of it. Interpretation comes before
              application. Only when you have properly exegeted the text, in its
              immediate context and the larger context of the Bible, then
              can you ask the next question, is this applicable today? Problem
              for you is that you did not even get the interpretation step right.
              Did anyone teach you about inductive Bible study? Did you read
              books like "How to Read the Bible For All It's Worth" by Gordon
              Fee? Go read it.</p>

              <p>Yea i don't know about how christians "officially" interpret verses to see if they are applicable or not (I am sure many christians do not know how to too) But i see a trend in how christians interpret the verses. Correct me if i am wrong.</p>
              <p>To christians, what I have noticed is basically there 3 reasons why they do not obey/practice certain verses, The 3 reasons are not applicable, not literal or out of context.</p>
              <p>I noticed also that verses in the OT or NT that are inconvenient or "extreme" in nature are mostly considered irrelevant, not applicable or not literal. Example: Verses in the OT include those those that talk about tithing 10%, stoning, warring against unbelievers etc. Verses in the NT include cutting off limbs if one sins, giving all away to pick up the cross of jesus, turning the other cheek for enemy to hit are all irrelevant, not applicable or not literal.</p>
              <p>Do you notice this trend too?</p>

              <p>You dont see that trend??</p>
              <p>Why dont you read your bible, try to pick out those verses that are "extreme in nature" or "inconvenient" and find out for yourself how many of these verses are still being practised today.</p>
              <p>Then pick out those verses that are more moderate and generally easy to practice and see how many of these verses are still being practised?</p>

              <p>Anyway, I started this topic just to say that CHC as christians has a right to practice 10% tithing because they are merely obeying what is written in their Holy Book, the Bible.</p>
              <p>So I don't see why other christians should be so offended by them practicing tithing and offering their first "fruits" to God.</p>
