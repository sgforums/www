              <p>I started this topic just to say that CHC as christians
                                      has a right to practice 10% tithing because they are merely obeying
                                      what is written in their Holy Book, the Bible.</p>
              <p>So I don't see why other christians should be so offended by
                                      them practicing tithing and offering their first "fruits" to
                                      God.</p>

              <p>Sorry. I am not in the habit of doing such things, to see which verses I like or dislike, or which I think is extreme or moderate, to see whether I want to obey or not.

              <p>I have no issue if anyone wishes to set aside 10%, 20%, 30%, 1%, or even 99% of his income to give, so long as he has decided this for himself, and not under compulsion. What I am against is Christians putting other Christians under some legalistic yoke by appealing to a faulty interpretation of Scripture. And mind you, in the NT giving was NEVER for building dedicated church buildings to house thousands of believers and to pay salaries for pastors.</p>

              <p>If your definition of conclusion is that all must agree on one thing, then no. But if you are asking if there is any conclusion, then yes. There are conclusions, question is which conclusion is the best conclusion to conclude with.</p>
              <p>Point is, one has to make up his mind and evaluate the arguments of both sides, don't just ask "So what's the conclusion?" because even if everyone conclude one view it still doesn't mean it is necessarily the right view. The right conclusion is not necessarily that which is endorsed by the majority.</p>

              <p>Why shouldn't the Bible be taken literally? I would argue that the Bible should be taken literally, in a plain and straightforward manner, to take history as history, poetry as poetry, allegory as allegory, figure of speech as figure of speech, according to the norms of the language being used. This is also known as the historical-grammatical approach. See <a href="http://creation.com/why-do-you-take-the-bible-literally">http://creation.com/why-do-you-take-the-bible-literally</a></p>

              I am well aware of that fact. Genesis is the most attacked book of the Bible. The critics know that if they can destroy the foundational book of Genesis, on which rests all the major doctrines of the faith, they can destroy the faith of believers. Sad to say many believers have compromised and even attack God's Word in this area.

              <p>Firstly, that is an ad hominem charge and leaves the issue unaddressed. The issue is whether Genesis is to be taken as literal history or as metaphor, and not that the person taking a stand is considered prideful. I have come across people who condescendingly called those who take Genesis literally as obscurantist fundamentalists. Do you consider that prideful? If not, why?</p>
              <p>Secondly, you are not doing justice to me. I never said that just because someone's beliefs differed from mine therefore they are wrong. This has NEVER been my position. If that had been so, then there would have been no need for me to argue for my views at all! Yet my approach has always to show WHY the beliefs I hold is true and WHY the opposing views are not.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, why would a metaphorical Genesis be inspiring? And in what sense? If one reads the Bible one will realise that Jesus and the writers of the NT take Genesis to be literal history. Jesus' lineage was traced to Adam as a REAL person, He did not have a metaphor for a human ancestor! There also a host of other implications if one takes Genesis as mere metaphor, not least of all is the question, "So if Genesis is metaphor, can one really know what REALLY happened since we should not take Genesis as literal history?"</p>
