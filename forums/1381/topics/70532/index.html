Does it mean they have no faith? What is meant by faith anyway? Faith for healing and prosperity or faith for salvation? Faith as a Person in Jesus Christ because he is the Author of faith and as seen in these verses: Galatians 3:23, 25 which says of faith as Jesus Himself? If faith depends on Jesus and not ourselves, can we be blamed? At the moment when someone prays for God to forgive him thru Jesus Christ, he is saved, but can he be unsaved? Let's say a Christian commits a sin and before he prays for forgiveness, he dies suddenly from accident. Is he saved or not? Similarly for suicide. If our sins are completely forgiven, does it include future sins? Or we are forgiven halfway? Aren't we reborn completely and become a new creation? Can this new resurrected being with Jesus inside go to hell in any way? Will Jesus leave us when He promised never to leave us nor forsake us? What is the criteria for salvation anyway? Isn't it on what Jesus did and not what we do?</div>

We need to get reborn with a new spirit. We need to stay faithful to God all our days. We are all born with a dead spirit although we still have our souls, which is our mind and emotions, and body intact. We need to be born again with an alive spirit. Only our spirit and soul can get to heaven. Our bodies die.<br><br>At least I know heaven has no pain and disease like on earth. We will all be laughing there everyday. I believe God can get you a cable tv if you want and you can view the whole universe for yourself.</div>

I think He won't forget the few good deeds that the person did. Anyway, all the bad deeds are forgotten and the only bad deed remaining I think would be the suicide bcos he can't repent from it. If he confessed everything before he jumped that is. Like you said there is no clear indication in the bible as with other issues. It's like gambling with salvation. Bcos He judges everything. Christians are also judged but not in the sinners' sense when it comes to rewards. If we build our foundations on gold, silver and precious stones, we will have glory. But if we build it on wood, hay or stubble, we will be burnt and chow tar but we will be saved thru the fire. I wonder if it's the same for that person who committed sucide.</div>

There's the problem of election. Who to save and who not to save. God says he will have compassion on whom he will have compassion and he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy. And many other unfair verses on grace. I know he is unfairly good to some but this also shows that he is unfairly bad to others. According to Calvin, we are predestined to be saved or not saved. Same as with Paul. So how can God blame those who are not saved by him if it doesn't depend on themselves? I think there should be some balance here about grace. There are many verses warning also that a born again Christian can be lost too. For eg : Hebrews 10:29 "Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, counted the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing, and insulted the Spirit of grace?" In the next verse, God says He will judge His people. I don't think it's referring to non christians bcos this person has been "sanctified by the blood of the covenant" and yet sinned greatly. God will judge him and give him "worse punishment". And again in 2 Peter 2:20-22. It's too long. Pls read for yourself. Those people mentioned are those who have been saved but returned to their old ways. They are not non believers bcos they have escaped the pollutions of the world thru Jesus Christ and the last verse says it very well - "a sow, <span style="font-style: italic;">having washed</span>, to her wallowing in the mire". Now aren't christians washed with the blood of the Lamb? I think there should be some balance here or a catch to grace for those who abuse it.</div>
