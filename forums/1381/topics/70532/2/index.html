Can anyone tell me whether a Christian who commits suicide can go to heaven? Since we are saved by grace, I presume it should be yes right?</div></blockquote>Yes we are saved by grace. Grace that allows us to be reconciled with God in spite of our sin. Grace that spurs us to obey God and repent, thus turning away from our wicked ways.<br><br>Committing suicide has nothing to do with grace. It is taking away something that was not yours to begin with (Your very life). Did you choose to come into this world? No right? Similiarly you do not have the right to choose to take your life away. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>By the way, do you know that committing suicide or attempted suicide is a crime?

No where in the Bible was an example given that a true Christian has ever commited suicide. Murdered, yes, not suicide.<br><br>If a so-called Christian commits suicide, there is a question that we won't be able to answer - Is the person saved in the first place? There is an example of a man who is close to Jesus Christ, also one of His 12 disciples, who committed suicide - Judas Iscariot.<br><br>In the case of Judas Iscariot, he committed suicide out of remorse for his deed, and not of his sinful nature. However, he was one of those so-called "Christians" that was ministering together with the Lord Jesus Christ. Yet, he has not the salvation of God in his soul. (Mathew 27:3,4,5; Luke 22:3)<br><br>My belief is that when a Christian is truly saved, the Holy Spirit dwells in him. It is not possible for a truly saved Christian, who consistently obeys God, to commit suicide. Job, in the book of Job of the old testament, is a great example.<br><br>The tendency here is that people think that they can use this Grace given by God as a fire-escape for their own soul. However, those people to think this way can never be more wrong.<br><br></div></blockquote>How do you know a Christian was truly saved then? I know of a man who was very sincere in believing Jesus at his salvation and prayed the salvation prayer with all his heart and was baptised with the Holy Spirit and spoke with tongues, but betrayed God for some time and lived with the devil. Pls read the parable of the prodigal son. Mind you - it is talking about a Christian son of God who rebelled and live like the devil in sin although he came back to God. This son of God could have given up and died in a foreign land. So is he still God's son? It doesn't matter where and how you die bcos you are still flesh and blood of God or the begotten of God.<br><br>Job might not represent every Christian and as you have said, not all Christians lead pure, consistent lives. So could one of these unpure and inconsistent Christians choose to die before his time? Nobody can say.</div>

If Jesus died for all, how come all are not saved? Pls read Romans 9:11-29 for it speaks of Sarah and Rebecca and "children not yet being born, nor having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to <strong>election</strong> might stand, not of works but of Him who calls". It goes on to say God hated Esau before he was born! So could God have hated some people here on earth before they are born? So unfair? Then it goes on to say about Pharaoh being used by God and as you all know God hardened pharaoh's heart. So unfair? Then Paul scolded us for saying why God still find fault with us when He wills everything. He said we are in no position to reply against God to say why God made us this way. Then came the clay and potter issue. Romans 9:21: "Does not the potter have power over the clay from the same lump to make one vessel for honor ad another for dishonor?" Romans 9:22 goes on to say about "vessels of wrath prepared for destruction". So are some people already being prepared for hell? Can we blame them totally for not accepting Christ?<br><br>From all these verses and others in the Bible, we know there is election. Nobody can deny it. It's in the scriptures. Grace is by no means fair! Bcos it's undeserved mercy.<br><br>NB. Anyway how did you link the bible verses to HTML tags on website? Saves my typing. Pls help.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's an abstract from the website www.christiananswers.net no the topic of suicide.<br><br>What does the Bible say about taking your own life?<br><br><strong><br>1. God has a great plan for your life.</strong> God has created us in His image (Genesis 1:26-27). He created us for a purpose. God has a specific plan in mind for everyone.<br>"For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future." (Jeremiah 29:11)<br><br><strong>2. God's plan is for life, not death. </strong>The Bible teaches that both physical and spiritual death are the result of our sin and disobedience to God, but eternal life is a gift to those who receive it.<br><br>For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Romans 6:23)<br><br><strong>3. Jesus taught that death and destruction are the work of "the thief" (Satan).</strong> He said, "The thief comes only to steal and destroy;" (John 10:10). John 8:44 says that Satan is a "murderer" and the "father of lies". The feelings of despair that lead to suicide are caused by some of his lies.<br><br><strong>4. Jesus wants us to have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">life</span>. </strong>He said:<br><br>The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">life</span>, and have it to the full.<br>(John 10:10)<br><br><strong>5. Life belongs to God.</strong> It is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never </span>our place to take our own life or someone else's life.<br><br>Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own, you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body. (1 Corinthians 6:19-20)<br><br></div>

Have you ever considered that if God would want to be really fair, all of us would be in hell?<br><br>I personally believe that God's love for man surpasses any creature in his creation domain. Strictly speaking, God did not require us to know if any other person is truly saved or not. It is not our business to know otherwise He would have told us so. Therefore, whether a person is truly saved is purely a knowledge between that person and God. No third party will have knowledge of the result of this relationship.<br><br>Our task as Christians in the world is to bring the message of salvation and guide those who wants to know Jesus Christ to the path of salvation. We ourselves are not in the position nor power to save a soul, but we can be instrumental in the salvation process by the grace of God. Even if we have witness to a person and led the person to pray the sinner's prayer, we would not know for certain if the person is truly saved. Fortunately there are some signs which if we are observant we could observe.<br><br>As is mentioned in the Bible, a truly born again Christian will bear the fruit of love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, temperance, and meekness.

Then it goes on to say about Pharaoh being used by God and as you all know God hardened pharaoh's heart. So unfair? Then Paul scolded us for saying why God still find fault with us when He wills everything. He said we are in no position to reply against God to say why God made us this way. Then came the clay and potter issue. Romans 9:21: "Does not the potter have power over the clay from the same lump to make one vessel for honor ad another for dishonor?" Romans 9:22 goes on to say about "vessels of wrath prepared for destruction". So are some people already being prepared for hell? Can we blame them totally for not accepting Christ?<br><br>From all these verses and others in the Bible, we know there is election. Nobody can deny it. It's in the scriptures. Grace is by no means fair! Bcos it's undeserved mercy.<br><br>NB. Anyway how did you link the bible verses to HTML tags on website? Saves my typing. Pls help.[/b]</blockquote>sorry i haven't been logging as i was occupied.<br><br>i guess what the rest has posted has answered some part of your question.<br><br>i had the chance to ponder about what you said.<br><br>it's true that in the verses you quoted, Paul mentions about God's choice of blessing people He chooses to.  But i'd still say God is a fair god.<br><br>If you believe God is the creator and life-giver, it is in His judgment to give whatever He pleases, but in His wisdom.<br><br>However, blessings and salvation are two separate issues, isn't it? Also, if you read the account of Esau, he did despise his birthright when he was starving.<br><br>Some might argue why God chose to bless Jacob, he was a sly and cunning person.  God has a way of using undeserved people on the bible and transforming them into people He can use.  Jacob after stealing the blessings, ran away.. but he came back transformed and humbled (he wrestled with God and submitted to Him).  Isn't this what grace is about?  To be blessed and changed even though we don't deserve it?<br><br>That said, what happened on the Cross has opened doors to God's blessings.  He has not withdrew any of it on the Cross.  It's up to us to gaze upon it's loveliness and wondrous work.  To submit everything under His feet and take upon our cross.</div>

Have you ever considered that if God would want to be really fair, all of us would be in hell?<br><br>I personally believe that God's love for man surpasses any creature in his creation domain. Strictly speaking, God did not require us to know if any other person is truly saved or not. It is not our business to know otherwise He would have told us so. Therefore, whether a person is truly saved is purely a knowledge between that person and God. No third party will have knowledge of the result of this relationship.<br><br>Our task as Christians in the world is to bring the message of salvation and guide those who wants to know Jesus Christ to the path of salvation. We ourselves are not in the position nor power to save a soul, but we can be instrumental in the salvation process by the grace of God. Even if we have witness to a person and led the person to pray the sinner's prayer, we would not know for certain if the person is truly saved. Fortunately there are some signs which if we are observant we could observe.<br><br>As is mentioned in the Bible, a truly born again Christian will bear the fruit of love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, temperance, and meekness. (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=GAL+5:21-23&amp;language=english&amp;version=KJV&amp;showfn=on&amp;showxref=on" rel="nofollow">Gal 5:21-23</a>)<br><br></div></blockquote>I think you are contradicting your beliefs as a Christian. Then all Christians shouldn't preach the gospel bcos you can't even know for sure whether someone who confesses is saved or not! Anyway, according to God's stds, anybody who doesn't believe in Jesus are doomed to hell so how can you say we don't know who are saved and who aren't?? This means all those who died without confessing Jesus as Lord are condemned to hell! That includes all those who died before Christ and those who never heard of Jesus. So is God fair I ask again? Grace I repeat is UNFAIR. God chooses to extend grace to anyone he likes and people tend to abuse it bcos they didn't work for it.<br><br>Anyway, I want to say is God being fair for sending all to hell just bcos of Adam?</div>

Calvin condemns the Augustinian theory and calls him a dog! But it's very long man and hard to understand. I wish someone could summarise it and tell us. It seems like predestiny or fate to me for someone to be saved. It is God who chooses and not men. We don't choose Christ but Christ chooses us. That's why I say some are not elected to be saved. Christians are very fortunate to be chosen. Narrow is the gate to heaven.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Free Behind the Fence<br><br>A village was situated on a hilltop. Surrounding it was a fence, which covered a fairly large perimeter. The fence had only one gate through which the villagers moved in and out. It kept the citizens in and kept strangers out. Houses had no doors because people trusted one another. The fence also kept children from falling off sharp cliffs. Little ones were free to play in the open fields. The community was busy and there was much laughter and joy. One day at a village council meeting, some people complained that the fence was restrictive. They felt they could not roam freely. Others disagreed. After many days of hot debate and deliberation, the council finally decided to tear down the perimeter fence.<br><br>When it was removed, the village changed significantly. Strangers came to the village and many things were reported stolen from homes. People began to build doors to safeguard their property. They became less trusting and open. Some boys almost fell off a cliff while at play. Parents began to forbid their children to go outside. The village became much quieter and no laughter was heard in the fields.<br><br>We often think that freedom means no limits. But ironically, we enjoy true freedom only behind the fenceÂ—one that is established by the omniscient and omnipotent God to protect us and not just to bind us. These limits are found in GodÂ’s Word and are to be observed in our lives.<br><br>As Christians, we have found freedom in Jesus, but it is not without boundaries. We are not free to do anything we like. The exercise of our Christian freedom must not become a stumbling block to the weak. In 1 Corinthians 6:12, we see that our freedom should not cause us to act without self-control or respond in the wrong way. LetÂ’s enjoy our freedom and letÂ’s also appreciate GodÂ’s fence! Â—Lim Chien Chong<br><br>bottom line: Christians are free from sin, but not free to sin.</div>
