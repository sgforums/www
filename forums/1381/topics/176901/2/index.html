For the benefit of those who want salvation,  'With the blood of Jesus Christ i am part of his family' means accepting that the blood that Jesus Christ shed on the cross was necessary to cleanse me of my sin and be reconciled with God, and believing that I will now be accepted as child of God. To acknowledge that we need salvation means we acknowledge that we are sinners and the need to repent.<br><br>A gift is given FOC, unless you accept it the gift is not yours and is of no use to you. If ppl do not acknowledge that they are sinners, then they will not see the need for salvation. If ppl see no need for salvation, Christ can be crucified a hundred times, his death and resurrection means nothing to them. What does "automatically" mean?<br><br>To your last question, unless ppl acknowledge God, accept that we need salvation and believing in Jesus and what he did, Christ's sacrifice on the cross is just another great thing done by another great man.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ironside:</div><div class="quote_body">i hope this thread will be a healthy exchange amongst Christians and non-Christians about Christ's Second Coming and what must they do to be prepared.<br><br>And i hope Christians will spend more typing time as to how to be prepared and i hope that those who have delayed their repentance and faith in Chrsit will be awakened by our discussions here.<br><br>a follow question for believers: What has the truth and reality of Christ SEcond coming any moment done to your daily living?<br>thanks.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div></blockquote> Has this thread been a "healthy exchange amongst Christians and non-Christians about Christ's Second Coming"? I hope it has. It is interesting to find ppl like McSquare who would stay faithful to the old rugged cross, love and worship the Lord till end of his days but said he is not a christian, do you think that was enough for Jesus's second coming?<br><br>If being in Christ is good enough for Christ's second coming, what preparation do Christians need to do?? or should Christians change our daily living because of the second coming of Christ? If I am 70 years old and believe that Jesus will come after I RIP, then should I live a different life?<br><br></div>

This blessed hope of Christ Second Advent has a purifying effect  to the Christian.<br><br></div>
