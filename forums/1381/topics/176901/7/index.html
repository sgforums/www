            <div class='col-md body'>Boy, it is difficult to juggle my responsibility here and the real world I live in. I apologise for not being here the whole of yesterday.<br><br>As most of you should know, EH is a Christian forum. Most of the opinions we state here are from the Christian context. There will be things that we say here that may offend some people. But I appeal to all fellow believers to exercise discernment to the things you post here. I ask that seek wisdom before you speak out all your thoughts.<br><br>EH will continue to be a place for discussing the Christian faith. It will still be a place where we will make know our identity in Christ. We will strive to be a place where we confess our faith bravely. But we will and have to exercise the need to be sensitive to other religions/race.<br><br>Brey and Laurence, there will be no end to this if we do not take a step back.<br><br>Laurence, you have knack in taking one issue, blow it up, turn it personal and continue poking it. And sometimes, it is brought to other forums, in particular your forum. You are always on the prowl to spot mistakes and find fault in it. You know it is a public forum, there will be things you disagree. If you disagree, you disagree. Full stop. And yes, if you disagree with my points, I will not defend further.<br><br>Brey, as a moderator, we need to wear two hats. One as a member of the forum, another a moderator of the forum. It has to be distinct. I agree that our faith must be defended unabashedly. But sometimes we need learn to hold our tongue.<br><br>If we can agree, let this issue rest ok? If you have said your peace, I will lock this thread.</div>
