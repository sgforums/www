Still despite all these, you cannot prove that they are the anti-christ spoken in revelations.<br><br>My choice of words? No misunderstanding here..... if they cut, they were chosen to cut.</div></blockquote>Old man, you have your views and I have mine. You read the Koran and you tell me whether they preach the same gospel as Jesus. If they do then they are not anti-christ. My opinions are based on the bible. I may have misstated my opinion in an earlier post, but I believe that i have clarified it sufficiently for it to be clear to you, unless you don't understand and require further clarification?<br><br>The fight between the muslims and the Jews who will ultimately be restored to their rightful position and who still ARE Gods people and our brothers and sisters, have been going on since Hagar and Sarah.

Unless you cannot see this link? My opinion.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I am not trying to incite racial hatred or say that I hate muslims. You judge me when you do not even know the situation.

We are discussing this in the context of the end times and revelation in a Christian forum. Did I ever state that I hate muslims. I just merely pointed out that they have been speaking against Christians and that they have a different gospel. DO NOT PUT WORDS IN MY MOUTH.

If by being a Christian I have to acknowledge that Jesus is the only way and that all others are not, then I have to, my whole being demands it.<br><br>I do not condemn other peoples religions and do not hate other religions, I just do not believe in other religions.

I speak for Christ and Christ alone. Do not forget EH is a Christian forum. If by me speaking with a very strong bias for Christ in a Christian forum is wrong, then I am wrong, but I will not think or speak different. If you want to ridicule me and say that I incite religious hatred go ahead. That was never my meaning or my intention. If you cannot take your head out of the water long enough to see clearly, then I have nothing else I can say.<br><br>God Bless. </div></blockquote>Sure you are correct, if you are just a regular fervent Christian guy contributing to this forum.

You know, if I am a non-Christian and you are a judge, I will be very afraid, because you are not objective as a judge (moderator?)<br><br>Don't forget, you are wearing two hats. Yes EH is a Christian forum, but it is not a Christian forum like, say, Agora in Antioch.com. EH still falls under the broader public forum arena, no church owns EH.<br><br>If you cannot be impartial, then I'd say you violated one of the responsibilities of being a moderator.</div>
