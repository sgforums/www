This is due to a faith so feeble and so small. This particular Christian is often beset with fears and doubts regarding salvation. May God comfort and grant this type of Christian full assurance.<br><br>2) There is a Christian who is tottering from being sure of being saved to doubting his salvation. One time he is sure he is saved, another he is cringing in fear because of doubts and fears. I belong to this category.<br><br>3) There is the fully assured Christian. I envy this Christian. He is usually up there in the ladder of holiness, for full assurance of salvation results in increased holiness. He is the indefatigable worker in the field of evangelism. He is the Christian who does great exploits for our Lord.<br><br>REad the biographies of the giants in the faith, they are usually the ones fully assured of their salvation.<br><br></div>

His Second Coming is a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">period of time </span></strong>, just like His first coming here two thousand years ago. When He first came He did not just stay here for about two to three hours, no He,  stayed here for about 33 years.
