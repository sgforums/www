End times events are important to all Christians, so just because I disagree with your assessment I am trivializing the issue? Let me state that if I get a buck for every time i hear an allegation fo so and so being the anti-Christ I will be a very rich man now.<br><br>[b]If there is one thing I am against Christians doing is to spread baseless rumour, unless, brey you can confirm what you believe to be true, you are part of a rumour-mongering crowd, and what does the Bible say about your "yea be a yea and a nay be a nay"!</strong> is this trivializing the issue, to give to rumour mongering and religiously insensitive statements.....?<br><br>So I ask again: you are sure that the Anti-Christ is a muslim? very very sure?<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Muslims are antichrist. What is so wrong with that? They themselves have stated to be antichrist. It is a known fact. I state the obvious. Whether THE antichrist is eventually a muslim, who can say but it is definitely a possibility. If you read the article, the writer does make some valid points.<br><br>I say you trivialise the issue not because you disagree with me. I say you trivialise the issue because I think your attitude towards this whole thing is one of indifference and is judgemental. The end times are an important issue that all Christians should be aware about, a discussion of possible antichrists is a natural progression of a study of the book of revelation. If you want to sit there and not search and find out and are content to wait... then so be it but please do not call the rest of us who want to discuss the issue a band of rumour mongers. Have we called you any names? Or have you forgotten how to be civil. We are discussing it in a CHRISTIAN forum where the context is certainly not to rumour monger! Yes we may have focused on the Al madhi in this discussion, but you need not make light of the situation by your posts on this topic. MY opinion. So what is so wrong with discussing it? You think we are rumour mongering just by discussing it? Please.<br><br>You say that I need to rethink how to phrase my statements in a public forum, maybe you should do likewise. You certainly do give an impression whether you choose to or not.<br><br>The muslims are religiously insensitive, they hold the world at ransom and they terrorize the world and make such a big fuss about cartoons about their saviour... but when we speak out against them, we are being religiously insensitive?We are talking about this in the context of a Christian forum. I did not go to a muslim forum and say it, now that would be insensitive.</div>

Obviously a certain person does not have clean hands like they claim. I get insulted, called names and ridiculed by this person even though i have asked him time and again not to do so, and when there is evidence that he does the same to other people all you can say is back off? I did not start this. A certain person here persisted in wanting to insult me and taunt me. even pmed me with his taunts. So who is trying to cause trouble?

They themselves have stated to be antichrist. It is a known fact. I state the obvious. Whether THE antichrist is eventually a muslim, who can say but it is definitely a possibility. If you read the article, the writer does make some valid points.<br></div></blockquote>Any writer can make points to suit his flavour. Yes, you can say that the muslims are antichrist, my point is why stop there.... the whole world is anti-Christ. They say they are anti-western, whom they call the great Satanist. Theological, within the muslim teaching, they CANNOT be anti-Christ because Christ is one of their greatest prophet.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by breytonhartge:</div><div class="quote_body">I say you trivialise the issue not because you disagree with me. I say you trivialise the issue because I think your attitude towards this whole thing is one of indifference and is judgemental. The end times are an important issue that all Christians should be aware about, a discussion of possible antichrists is a natural progression of a study of the book of revelation. If you want to sit there and not search and find out and are content to wait... then so be it but please do not call the rest of us who want to discuss the issue a band of rumour mongers. Have we called you any names? Or have you forgotten how to be civil. We are discussing it in a CHRISTIAN forum where the context is certainly not to rumour monger! Yes we may have focused on the Al madhi in this discussion, but you need not make light of the situation by your posts on this topic. MY opinion. So what is so wrong with discussing it? You think we are rumour mongering just by discussing it? Please.<br></div></blockquote>So are you saying that because, in your opinion, that you THINK my attitude towards this is of indifference and is judgemental, therefore you are saying that I am trivialising the issue? So your opinion is important while others ain't?<br><br>There is a very thin line between "discussion" and a inflammatory thread that openly lambast another faith. If you are "discussing" and issue and the result of that so-called discussion is to label another group, or individual, with a negative tag, that is rumour mongering. I can always start a discussion and say that perhaps Brey is the false prophet (just as an example), the discussion can go on for a while, be very fruitful, and still remains as rumour mongering thread.<br><br>So that the question that begs and answer is: what is a discussion? One that is one sided? I sensed your displeasure did not start here, but in the El Mahdi thread which you closed (really for no good rhyme or reason). What was it closed? Perhaps I am deemed to have "trivialised" the issue by point out that many public figures also fall into the category of the anti-Christ? So what is a discussion. Can't I not agree with your statements? Can't I not inject a little humour in it? Do I need to seek your approval if I decided to inject a little humour in it?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by breytonhartge:</div><div class="quote_body">You say that I need to rethink how to phrase my statements in a public forum, maybe you should do likewise. You certainly do give an impression whether you choose to or not.<br><br>The muslims are religiously insensitive, they hold the world at ransom and they terrorize the world and make such a big fuss about cartoons about their saviour... but when we speak out against them, we are being religiously insensitive?We are talking about this in the context of a Christian forum. I did not go to a muslim forum and say it, now that would be insensitive. </div></blockquote>here's where your judgment is clouded by your apparent hatred for muslims. yes there are radicals in the muslim world, but isn't there the same radicals within Christiandom? Ain't you now guilty of judging the muslim world because of a small number of insane individuals leading a bunch of misinformed or ill-informed followers. Still despite all these, you cannot prove that they are the anti-christ spoken in revelations.<br><br>My choice of words? No misunderstanding here..... if they cut, they were chosen to cut.</div>

I think ratings will go up this month.<br><br>Don't be mistaken, I am ally to nobody.<br><br>Christians fight all the time over opinion of doctrine.... nothing shocking. When passionate people are put together and there are differences of opinion, sh it happens.<br><br>But i want to state very clearly that I AM NOT ANGRY WITH BREY. I have my stand on what we can say and what we cannot say, especially on the issue of religious sensitivity, I also have a very strong stand on what are truths and what are half-truths.<br><br>Having said that, I do not think that Brey, in his current state of mind is doing a good job as a mod. One need almost to be emotionally detached from the issues to be fair. A mod is not there to expound one's doctrine but to encourage the fair spirit of discussion. Of course, along the way, there will be detractors, and some of these detractors can be a pain in the rear. So the maturity of the mod can be seen from how, when such hiccups happen, the mod handles it. I believe sillyme have gone through his own baptism of fire and came out a better man.</div>
