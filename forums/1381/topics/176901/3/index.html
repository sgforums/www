I hope it has. It is interesting to find ppl like McSquare who would stay faithful to the old rugged cross, love and worship the Lord till end of his days but said he is not a christian, do you think that was enough for Jesus's second coming?<br><br>If being in Christ is good enough for Christ's second coming, what preparation do Christians need to do?? or should Christians change our daily living because of the second coming of Christ? If I am 70 years old and believe that Jesus will come after I RIP, then should I live a different life?<br><br></div></blockquote>1) Actually my friend, the Lord through Paul exhorted us in the light of the Second Coming of Christ to be sober and be watching for His Second Coming.<br><br>This means we are to live lives consistent with our exalted position.<br><br>1Th 5:4 But you, brethren, are not in darkness, so that this Day should overtake you as a thief.<br><br>5 You are all sons of light and sons of the day.

We will all stand before the Judgement seat of Christ were our service here will be reviewed according to the amount and quality of our service here on earth as a Christian.<br><br>Having Experiential knowledge of the Lord's return my friend motivates us to live godly lives.<br><br>1Jo 3:3 <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure.</strong></span><br><br>How do i know if i really have this hope in me as a Christian?

And these revivals are really revivals......God's slumbering people, churches who have grown cold have been set aflamed by the Spirits fire.<br><br>John Edwards Revivals, though it also resulted in the salvation of lost souls...it was also a stirring up and awakening of the church.<br><br>However, it is also true that there are churches who are highminded and got hoodwinked about their true condition in Christ. We in a sense are guilty of these. That is sad indeed, but what is of good note is that we are growing and making adjustments as we grow.<br><br>Of course, the church here is not perfect with regards to practical holiness and Christlikeness. No one single church is.<br><br>There are also Christians who expect soo much from other fellow Christians that when their fellow Christians fail and fall.........they would be swift to condemn and judge, looking only to what negative things they could see in them.<br><br>I am glad that our Lord is one who will not break a bruised reed nor quench a smoking flax.<br><br>I can see a Christian failing and faltering before the Lord as he tries to obey.......over and over again he fails..... and many a time he just sinks his head in the pillow and get discouraged. Thinking that the Lord may have folded up his arms and looked away sighing in disappointment.<br><br>but the Word said: A bruised reed He will not break, a smoking flax, He will not quench.<br><br>I can somehow picture Him as a camper trying to start a fire for the night. He keeps blowing and blowing until He sees a spark. at that point He will not stumped the spark out in disgust and resignation seeing only a little spark. No. I can see His face lit up and His heart leaping for joy as He all the more blows that little spark so that it wil turn into a flame and then into a huge bon-fire.<br><br>I am glad He doesn't give up on us imperfect saints. Yes, He sees our weaknesses but He also sees our potentials and works on it.<br><br></div>

Saved and Christian are synonymous.<br><br>2) there is no such thing as half-baked salvation. Either he is saved fully or not.<br><br>3) third, it's not the quantity of faith that saves us. It's the quality. If you indeed have true faith in Christ, then you are saved no matter how small.<br><br>Some can approach Christ and embrace him fully and totally and be healed from their sin, others may only slightly touch the hem of his garment but still  is saved.<br><br>yes, you are saved if you have faith in Christ no matter how small, as long as it is true faith, it still saves. It will grow by the way the more you know Him and His work on the cross.<br><br>How do you know that you have true faith?<br><br>If you can answer "yes" to this question then you have true faith:<br><br>Are you relying or trusting in Christ's work on the cross alone for salvation?<br><br>P.S. please do ask questions if there's still anything that troubles you....you can PM me if you like............i'll be glad to help you.<br><br>i can somehow feel your apprehensions my friend.<br><br>Remember you don't need to have some overwhelming conversion experience for you to be saved. Some people do not know if they are really saved just because they did not experience a salvation experience as othes have.<br><br>Do not despair......... the sole condition is that if you trust in Christ alone for salvation then you are saved my friend.

            <div class='col-md body'>Even your own 'bluff' has been called at times by others, including your fallacious post on Albert Einstein the last time round.<br><br>When pointed out that the Al Mahdi issue has no basis, with many past and current identifications of the AntiChrists pointed out, you claim its no brainer that Al Mahdi is the Antichrist while stating in another post that you are not making claims.

Its disturbing that a fellow mod dont take the cue or apply the level of maturity required.<br><br>I pointed out issues as they come, but you arent able to do so, or even support your argument. Look at ur post to me, without factual backup, they reflect personal bias.<br><br>As I have already predicted back then, your style would be contrary to the spirit of discussion, by attempting to moderate others on unsupported basis that they are troublemakers. This forum will then become like the other Christian forum, where Huaiqing, the founder, attempts to edit forumers' post because they disagree, and with tonnes of evidence for backup, on his view that Catholics are not followers of Christ.<br><br>Way back then, I have already stated that three people, ie, Chin Eng, MCsquare, and Icemoon have every ability to contribute by being mods, mainly because they know the Christian scripture well, and more importantly, they understand and have shown what the is the spirit of discussion.<br><br>Its my only regret right people arent available for the right job, possibly at the right time.<br><br>My advice, reflect on your personal biasness and inconsistency.<br><br>PS: In forums, character assasination have been the contemporary style for retaliation once people find themselves unsupported in their argument. This include calling people 'troublemakers'. 'gay', 'idiot' and many others labels.

Antichrist means to be against Christ, in the bible it is mentioned that there will be many antichrists who have already come and still more will come. Anybody who is not for Christ is antichrist.<br><br>Well then ask you so called right people to step up to the plate and be a mod. Being a moderator does not mean that I have to be impartial. I am a CHRISTIAN moderator in a CHRISTIAN forum. I will have a personal bias, to be a CHRISTIAN IS TO HAVE A PERSONAL BIAS. If you do not like it tough.<br><br>Consider this, I have not warned anyone else except you and RJ2, ever wonder why? Your actions speak clearly for themselves. You seriously cannot post anything that is constructive or edifying. All you want to do like I have said before is to cause problems. Ever reflect on your own inconsistency and bias?<br><br>The thead about the antichrist was closed for a reason, yet instead of opening another thread, you deliberately posted in this one.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An impartial Christian moderator is possible, but only if you have show yourself to strive for it, rather than, for example, posting some erroneous stuff, deny, and when confronted, relented by apologising, and ignoring the pages of stuff emphasising that there is a need to be be consistent and backing your argument up.<br><br>Being a Christian moderator is still no defence for fallacious statements. You have your personal bias, there was never an argument on whether you are one or not, but whether did you strive, like i said above, to be a good one?<br><br>Past examples have shown evidence to the contrary. Another fallacious remark from you this time. How would a Muslim = Antichrist, when Christ is regarded as one of their prophets? Antichristian, yes, but antichrist? Do you then, call him a Muslim then? I wouldnt mind if you call him an Iranian for example, but a Muslim?<br><br>Again, time and time, as the issue or thread crop up, I have pointed out the very erroneous statements some people made, and they were not constructive?<br>I am very sorry if pointing out your mistakes hurt your pride and ego, but as you can see, i am able to point to past issues to be able to reach a conclusion about you. Are you going to post the next ten posts merely just calling me unconstructive and unedifying? I can do the same, but i choose not to.<br><br>And pray, what have you warned RP2 about? On the same grounds as mine, if you call it 'constructive' in the first place? One good question, what have you warn and not do to him, that you have warn and did to me? For example, editing my posts?<br><br>By the way, second coming topic is not good enough to post a post about antichrists? As far as I know, antichrists is related to second coming, but there are many more topics that have gaps wider than that, for example, calling onto saints as intermediaries in a topic that discusses St Valentine Day?<br><br>Again, have you strive to be an impartial CHRISTIAN mod?<br><br>*shrugz*<br><br></div>

The muslims preach that there will be another saviour, one they call the al mahdi, this is a contrary gospel to one that even Jesus himself preached when He was here, Jesus said that He would come back again. So therefore any contrary gospel to the one that Jeuss preached is antichrist. Therefore Muslim = Antichrist. FYI, Jesus is a JEW. The jews are half brothers to the arabs.<br><br></div>
