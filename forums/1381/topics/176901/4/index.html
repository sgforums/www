All that was said by me was that to pick a muslim to be an antichrist would be a logical choice, they have been at war with the infidels and lets face it, the infidels here that the muslims are referring to are the Christians and the Jews and any nation that cares to support isreal.<br><br>There was nothing from us that said we were going to provide support for the statement made by the writer of the article. You just twisted the facts again.<br><br>The muslims call for all out war and call destruction on the rest of the world and hold the world hostage, yet when Christians speak out against them,the muslims call hellfire and all out war against any who dare make fun or speak against their religion, but when the muslims do it, nothing is done? Have Christians bombed any buildings during recent times? All the terror that is happening in the world today is caused by the muslims extremeists. If by saying in a Christian forum that all things that are not for Christ is being anti-christ is trying to make enemies then i say you have a seriously warped mind. If I had gone to a muslim or any other religious forum to say this, then yes I would be trying to make enemies, but by saying it in my own forum where the context of it would be understood, is another matter altogether.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by breytonhartge:</div><div class="quote_body">CE, please do not trivialise the issue here, we all know what we are talking about. If you feel differently about the end times issues which i feel that you do, you are most certainly entitled to your opinion, but don't trivialise this issue which may matter and is important to some of us. Thank you.<br><br>But as you put it, anybody that is not for Christ is anti-christ, this is to put the net at its broadest. Ultimately, it boils down to this, you are either for Christ or against Him. That choice is up to each individual to decide. </div></blockquote>.... now how am I trivializing the issue? You ARE SURE that the anti-Christ is a Muslim? End times events are important to all Christians, so just because I disagree with your assessment I am trivializing the issue? Let me state that if I get a buck for every time i hear an allegation fo so and so being the anti-Christ I will be a very rich man now.<br><br><strong>If there is one thing I am against Christians doing is to spread baseless rumour, unless, brey you can confirm what you believe to be true, you are part of a rumour-mongering crowd, and what does the Bible say about your "yea be a yea and a nay be a nay"!</strong> is this trivializing the issue, to give to rumour mongering and religiously insensitive statements.....?<br><br>So I ask again: you are sure that the Anti-Christ is a muslim? very very sure?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now, let's compare this:<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by breytonhartge:<br>The thread starter pointed us in the direction of an article. All that was said by me was that to pick a <strong>muslim to be an antichrist would be a logical choice</strong>, they have been at war with the infidels and lets face it, the infidels here that the muslims are referring to are the Christians and the Jews and any nation that cares to support isreal.<br></blockquote>The above being the newer statement and<br>this, the older statement in the closed thread<br><blockquote>Originally posted by breytonhartge:<br><strong>To pick a muslim to be the antichrist is a no brainer</strong>, they already hate the Christians and are very anti jews and isreal and anti zionists. Take the recent elections in Iran, their new leader is already proclaiming war on isreal and the jews etc...<br></blockquote>I think there is a marked difference between the phrase "logical choice" and "no brainer". The first one is "possibility" the second one is "definitely".<br><br>So I am kinda confused now, just because you think a thread is being trivialised, you are gonna close it? Your issue with lau notwithstanding, I don't see any reason why you need to close that El-mahdi thread with it going less than one full page.<br><br>I also confused now because I now ask myself: do I need to emphasize the same thing and give the same priority weightage with brey in order not to be accused of trivializing his pet issues?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone.<br><br>I am disturbed that things should come to this state.<br><br>From the beginnings of EH till now, we faced several stingy issues. We also had a hard time resolving it. It is definitely not easy to moderate a faith-based forum without having disagreements or bias. But we certainly need to exercise restrain in speaking out our minds/hearts.<br><br>I think we need to phrase our words properly when we post in a public forum. It is certainly that same thing when we interact with other people.<br><br>I am trying to bridge the differences between laurence and brey right now. Please pray that I may used as a peacemaker. Other than that, I shall refrain from commenting on other issues.</div>
