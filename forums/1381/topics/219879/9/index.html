And for God to give prophecies mean He must not be confined by time. Duh! </blockquote>See earlier argument on giving prophecies.  There is no proof that such a thing as 'outside of time' exists.  Time is merely a means of measurement.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Icemoon:<br><strong>Salvation is not for everyone.</strong> Your quote does not disagree with my view because the elect has already been predestined. As a Christian, you are to spread the gospel. The Holy Spirit convicts the elect. Obviously it can't be the Holy Spirit convicts everyone because not all will respond.<br><br><strong>Salvation is never for everyone.</strong> Heard of total depravity? There is no way mankind will respond to the gospel because he is fallen. It is not his nature to accept the gospel and Christ due to his sinful and fallen state. Hence it is fallacious to state salvation is for everyone when no-one can receive it on their own. It is not a "please claim your gift" kind of thing (this version of <strong>salvation is cheapo</strong> and mocks the sovereignity of God, don't you think so?) </blockquote>If i gave you an expensive gift free, does it become "cheap"?  What kind of logic is this?  As for "salvation is never for everyone" i believe the others can draw their own conclusions...<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Icemoon:<br>I know what you will reply. Biblical basis right?

Verse 29 onwards applies to prominent people mentioned in the bible.  Please refer to Ironside's comments on the bible being written for you, but not all of it about you.<br><br>Summary:<br>Essentially what Icemoon pointed out is a very elitist view of salvation.  He claims that salvation is only for chosen ones who are predestined to be saved.

You came out with the 'expensive' label which is not found in the bible or theology, so I'm cautioning you on the danger. The danger is expensive gifts are never free for everyone. In the real world, only a selected people get the expensive gifts, the rest get 'consolation' prize.<br><br><blockquote>So you appointed yourself the judge on the value of salvation?</blockquote>Only those with an incorrect view of salvation have judged salvation, not me. So how have they judged? By presenting salvation as a <strong>number game </strong>- the more the merrier. By presenting salvation as a <strong>marketing ploy </strong>- using cheap tricks to attract people to church. By presenting salvation as the <strong>work of man </strong>- pestering people, even Christians, on the streets or outside their house to convert.<br><br><blockquote>See earlier argument. The choice is ours to accept the gift, not God's.</blockquote>How can fallen mankind receive the gift? Is it not our inborn tendency to turn away from the gift which is contrary to the sense? It does not make sense to put the gift in the same league as other 'gifts', wordly philosophies and religions. By saying the choice is yours to accept the gift, how are you different from one who has accepted the other gifts? How can you tell who is right? Using your fallen/post-Eden faculty of reason?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>From the way you reply, I don't think you understand what I'm talking about, neither can you appreciate the richness of this perspective.<br><br><blockquote>Ad hominen style character assassination? Earlier name-calling me a gnostic and now a hypercalvinist? You still haven't say why it does not absolve...when it is clear that it does.</blockquote>I never call you a hypercalvinist. OMG .. you know what is hypercalvinism or not? Read my reply (which I acknowledge was composed badly in the heat of the moment). I said the position you accused me of IS hypercalvinism and hypercalvinism is something not accepted by most Christians. Or at least Christians who should have known better.<br><br>It does not absolve. You can read more if you are interested. From the url I quoted:<br><br><blockquote>The hyper-Calvinist position at this point amounts to a repudiation of the very gist of 2 Corinthians 5:20: "Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God." The whole thrust of the gospel, properly presented, is to convey an offer (in the sense of a tender, a proffer, or a proposal) of divine peace and mercy to all who come under its hearing. The apostle's language is even stronger, suggesting <strong>the true gospel preacher begs sinners to be reconciled to God</strong>Â—or rather he stands "in Christ's stead," pleading thus with the sinner. <strong>Hyper-Calvinism in essence denies the concept of human responsibility</strong>, and so it must eliminate any such pleading, resulting in a skewed presentation of the gospel.</blockquote></div>
