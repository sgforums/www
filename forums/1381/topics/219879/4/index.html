For example, i have to power to go to work tomorrow.  Does that mean i can foretell the future by telling everyone that i will go to work tomorrow?  And if i do go to work tomorrow - my prediction has come true?</div>

IMO the idea that God can foresee the future is a <strong>pagan view</strong>.  Lucifer wants people to believe this idea so that they will see God as the source of evil.<br></div>

Does this help to answer your question?<br><br>Why did he let humans eat? Simple! Because he wasn't in the garden when they ate!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
