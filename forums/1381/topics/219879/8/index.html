And for God to give prophecies mean He must not be confined by time. Duh!<br><br>Salvation is not for everyone. Your quote does not disagree with my view because the elect has already been predestined. As a Christian, you are to spread the gospel. The Holy Spirit convicts the elect. Obviously it can't be the Holy Spirit convicts everyone because not all will respond.<br><br>Salvation is never for everyone. Heard of total depravity? There is no way mankind will respond to the gospel because he is fallen. It is not his nature to accept the gospel and Christ due to his sinful and fallen state. Hence it is fallacious to state salvation is for everyone when no-one can receive it on their own. It is not a "please claim your gift" kind of thing (this version of salvation is cheapo and mocks the sovereignity of God, don't you think so?)<br><br>So the only way is for God to make the first move, so to speak. So before you can receive salvation, you must be regenerated (by the Holy Spirit).<br><br>Seen in this light, suddenly a lot of things make more sense. Like the question who did Jesus die for? How come he die for the world (your claim) but we still must believe in him? Did Jesus shed His blood to try his luck hopefully many people will respond? How come salvation is so easy? Why Christianity so "cheap"?<br><br>To the last question, Christianity is not "cheap" because Jesus shed His blood for His sheeps. Every drip from Calvary counts. Nothing is wasted.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I know what you will reply. Biblical basis right? Ok, here's it. Notice this was what you quoted, but you ignored the later parts!<br><br><blockquote>Romans 8:<br><br>28And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him,[j] who[k] have been called according to his purpose. 29For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. <strong>30And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.</strong> </blockquote></div>
