            <div class='col-md body'>Law of Grace?<br><br>I suppose if this is what you want to call it you could... but I think it hardly helps the English language nor rightfully describes the revolution that it is.<br><br>I'm sure if I am using my laptop now I am adhering to a certain set of a 'law of laptop using', but obviously the observation of this law is not my main concern.<br><br>This is quite different when you say that you have to actually pay a lot of attention to observing a particular set of laws to the point which the observation of the law itself becomes the primary point of the action itself. It would be more fitting to describe such a condition as being 'under the Law'.<br><br>Grace is something, so obviously it is also not something else. The consolidation of what Grace is can indeed be considered it's character, it's law. For example there's only one way to receive it, it comes free but not cheap, it entails certain changes in a life once somebody is under itÂ… these could be considered a 'law' in the sense of a law. But I doubt this is a helpful observation at all.<br><br>Obviously it has to be applied to any kind of concept for that concept to make sense; otherwise all our ideas would be formless and ungraspable.<br><br>Of course this is also not mentioning the fact that when Christians say that they are not 'under the Law' and under grace, they are obviously not saying that they are lawless. One can only draw such a conclusion if they haven't applied sufficient thinking to that issue or are just trying to be difficult or naughtyÂ… or perhaps honestly confused.<br><br>In any way, making the statement to this context refers to the fact that one can no longer rely on the system of legalistic law to earn his reconciliation with God. He instead has to rely on the grace that has been given that actually pays off all the debt that the law entails, but I think you already know this.<br><br>Indeed, why may I ask you pointed it out? Was it to point out a question or expose what you thought was an inconsistency on the part of the Christians?<br></div>

Christians here never do that?<br><br>I thought they always like to urge believers not to live under law, which implicitly means other believers, for example Jews, or even Brey-like Christians, are living under the law.<br><br>I really don't see any difference. Instead of 613 commandments, you now have 1 commandment - thou shall not live under the law.</div>
