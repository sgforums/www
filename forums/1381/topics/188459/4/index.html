Icemoon.<br><br>One of the moral/ ethical aspects of Christianity I find objectionable is the absolute (and non-negotiable) requirement to kowtow to God and Jesus Christ.

            <div class='col-md body'>1. No...u meant it was an ordinary sacrifice (same as slaughtering lambs in the OT) and I have to tell u that it was no ordinary sacrifice. Though many die thru crucifixion, Christ's sacrifice was unique becoz it was his work on the cross that take away sins.<br><br>2. To put it simple, when Christ was crucified, imagine all of men's sins, past, present, future were all put on him, so that when he die he was able to redeem these sins for us. Imagine the whole weight of human sin from beginning of time till the end, all on one person. Do u still not get it?<br><br>3. So my example's (abt damien) is no big deal....but is Christ cruxificion a big deal to u? Is it not a big deal?

Christians like to say Christ, or rather God in human flesh, suffered. So please explain in human terms the nature of the suffering with regards to the weight of sin of mankind.<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Ans: Can u type for me the chinese name?
