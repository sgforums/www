Repent with a contrite heart and seek forgiveness from God or the person whom you sinned against.</div></blockquote>Indeed it is (King David did it so). In fact I think this is the basis of how to get right with God in any case, even in Christianity.<br><br>Of course the Christians have this curious idea that indeed this forgiveness has bodily come through a period known as the incarnation. And what's more it in the direction of the incarnation's sacrifice that the contrite heart and seeking of forgiveness must be directed.<br><br>Why it is so I have yet to comprehend, and perhaps even ask this question 'Did you really have to die for me?'. It's a strange question for a man drowining in sin such as myself to ask, when the safety bouy and rope is finally thrown to me that I start to ponder the rationale of method of my rescue.<br><br>If you ask me if why can't God just simply forgive any offense, without having to make any of that complicated thing as the incarnation. I shall say I don't have any idea beyond the fact that he seemed not only concerned with simply pardoning us, but also in showing that pardon in such a concrete way as to become incarnate, be torn apart by His very own creation, stripped naked and hung up to die.<br><br>It's just my guess but maybe He wasn't just interested in showing us His forgiveness, but also to show and help us understand a small bit of His measure of Love. And perhaps also to provide a specified direction to which all of humanity can now move, a living, breating example for the renewed state of man to which we will all one day become.<br><br>The humble and contrite heart is made perhaps even more humble and contrite when it realizes that God crazily (in human terms) decided to do something seemingly quite unnecessary for it. And perhaps it's just the start of something new.</div>

The Law [old covenant] was placed there to led them [israel] to Christ.<br><br>Other religions cannot practice the Law for they know nothing of it. they are not in it. Yes, they may practice some things contained in the Law for they have the law of conscience but God does not see them in the covenant. So we Christians do not say that their religion is trying to observe the Law so that they will be saved. They [we] are not in it in the first place.<br><br>what we are saying is this: all other religions are based on salvation by works  [works does not necessarily mean LAW] only one is not: Christianity.<br><br>The LAW served as a mirror. It will show that they cannot be perfectly righteous in thtemselves and so they need a Savior.  Christ.<br><br>The Law was temporary. [when we say 'Law'.....it always refers to the old covenant made by God to israel].<br><br>Ga 3:19  What purpose then does the law serve? <strong>It was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">added</span> because of transgressions, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">till</span> the Seed should come</strong> to whom the promise was made; and it was appointed through angels by the hand of a mediator.<br><br>notice the Law's purpose was to show them that they are transgressors. Compare this  verse to Romans 7:13, Romans 3:19-20. It was added. meaning it was not there before. it is temporary. notice the 'tll' word. it was there until Christ would come [Galatians 3:23-24].<br><br>The law of conscience was never there to be relied on to be saved. Salvation requires atonement for sins. No conscience can cover for sins committted. only through Christ death and resurrection. The only Savior i see on the cross is Christ.<br><br>i do not see any law of conscience crucified there.<br><br></div>
