              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">1) Matthew 1:23 says that Jesus (the messiah) would be called Immanuel, which means "God with us."  Yet no one, not even his parents, call him Immanuel at any point in the bible.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">2) The Messiah must be a physical descendant of David (Romans 1:3 &amp; Acts 2:30).  Yet, how could Jesus meet this requirement since his genealogies in Matthew 1 and Luke 3 show he descended from David through Joseph, who was not his natural father because of the Virgin Birth. Hence, this prophecy could not have been fulfilled.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">3) Isaiah 7:16 seems to say that before Jesus had reached the age of maturity, both of the Jewish countries would be destroyed.  Yet there is no mention of this prophecy being fulfilled in the New Testament with the coming of Jesus, hence this is another Messiah prophecy not fulfilled.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;"><strong style="font: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Prophecies Christians Use to Verify Jesus as the Messiah, Yet Clearly Fail:</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">4) The gospels (especially Matthew 21:4 and John 12:14-15) claim that Jesus fulfills the prophecy of Zechariah 9:9.  But the next few verses (Zechariah 9:10-13) show that the person referred to in this verse is a military king that would rule <em style="font: inherit;">"from sea to sea"</em>.  Since Jesus had neither an army nor a kingdom, he could not have fulfilled this prophecy.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">5) Matthew (Matthew 2:17-18) quotes Jeremiah (Jeremiah 31:15), claiming that it was a prophecy of King Herod’s alleged slaughter of the children in and around Bethlehem after the birth of Jesus.  But this passage refers to the Babylonian captivity, as is clear by reading the next two verses (Jeremiah 31:16-17), and, thus, has nothing to do with Herod’s massacre.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">6) John 19:33 says that during Jesus’ crucifixion, the soldiers didn’t break his legs because he was already dead.  Verse John 19:36 claims that this fulfilled a prophecy: <em style="font: inherit;">"Not a bone of him shall be broken."</em>  But there is no such prophecy.  It is sometimes said that the prophecy appears in Exodus 12:46, Numbers 9:12 &amp; Psalm 34:20.  This is not correct.  Exodus 12:46 &amp; Numbers 9:12 are not prophecies, they are commandments.  The Israelites are told not to break the bones of the Passover lamb, and this is all it is about.  And Psalm 34:20 seems to refer to righteous people in general (see verse Psalm 34:19, where a plural is used), not to make a prophecy about a specific person.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">7) <em style="font: inherit;">"When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt."</em>  Hosea 11:1.  Matthew (Matthew 2:15) claims that the flight of Jesus’ family to Egypt is a fulfillment of this verse.  But Hosea 11:1 is not a prophecy at all.  It is a reference to the Hebrew exodus from Egypt and has nothing to do with Jesus.  Matthew tries to hide this fact by quoting only the last part of the verse (<em style="font: inherit;">"Out of Egypt I have called my son"</em>).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">8) <em style="font: inherit;">"But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting." </em> Micah 5:2 The gospel of Matthew (Matthew 2:5-6) claims that Jesus’ birth in Bethlehem fulfils this prophecy.  But this is unlikely for two reasons.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">    A) "Bethlehem Ephratah" in Micah 5:2 refers not to a town, but to a clan: the clan of Bethlehem, who was the son of Caleb’s second wife, Ephrathah (1 Chronicles 2:18, 2:50-52 &amp; 4:4).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">    B) The prophecy (if that is what it is) does not refer to the Messiah, but rather to a military leader, as can be seen from Micah 5:6.  This leader is supposed to defeat the Assyrians, which, of course, Jesus never did.  It should also be noted that Matthew altered the text of Micah 5:2 by saying: "And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Judah" rather than "Bethlehem Ephratah" as is said in Micah 5:2. He did this, intentionally no doubt, to make this verse appear to refer to the town of Bethlehem rather than the family clan.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;"><strong style="font: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Statements Jesus Made Which Are False:</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">9) Jesus in John 14:12 &amp; Mark 16:17-18 said: <em style="font: inherit;">"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth in me, the works that I do shall he also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father." </em> This implies that Jesus’ true followers should be able to routinely perform the following tricks: 1) cast out devils, 2) speak in tongues, 3) take up serpents, 4) drink poisons without harm, and 5) cure the sick by touching them and MANY other of Jesus’ "works".  Curiously I have yet to see a Christian that can do any of the above on demand.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">10) In John 14:13-14 Jesus stated: <em style="font: inherit;">"And whatsoever ye ask in my name I do, that the Father may be glorified in the son.  If ye ask any thing in my name, I will do it."</em>  In reality, millions of people have made millions of requests in Jesus’ name and failed to receive satisfaction.  This promise or prophecy has failed completely.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">11) Paul says Christianity lives or dies on the Resurrection (1 Corinthian 15:14-17). Yet Jesus said in Matthew 12:40 that he would be buried three days and three nights as Jonah was in the whale three days and three nights.  Friday afternoon to early Sunday morning is only one and a half days, so he could not have been the messiah by his own and Paul’s admission.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">12) Jesus’ prophecy in John 13:38 (<em style="font: inherit;">"The cock shall not crow, till thou</em> [Peter] <em style="font: inherit;">hast denied me three times"</em>) is false.  Mark 14:66-68 shows the cock crowed after the first denial, not the third.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">13) In Mark 10:19 Jesus said: <em style="font: inherit;">"Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, do not steal, do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother."</em> Jesus needs to re-read the Ten Commandments.  There is no Old Testament commandment against defrauding.  The only relevant statement about defrauding is in Leviticus 19:13 , which says : <em style="font: inherit;">"Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor."</em>  This is an OT law, but is not listed with the Ten Commandments.  Surely, if Jesus was god incarnate he would know the commandments.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">14) <em style="font: inherit;">"And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven" </em>(John 3:13). If Jesus is in heaven, how can he be down on earth speaking?  Moreover, according to 2 Kings 2:11 (<em style="font: inherit;">"and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven"</em>) Jesus was not the only person to ascend into heaven, nor was he the first.  Elijah preceded him and apparently Enoch did also (<em style="font: inherit;">"And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him"</em>--Genesis 5:24).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">15) In Luke 23:43 Jesus said to the thief on the cross, <em style="font: inherit;">"Today shalt thou be with me in paradise."</em>  This obviously has to be false, for Jesus was supposed to lay dead in the tomb for three days following his crucifixion.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">1 6) Jesus says : <em style="font: inherit;">"Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy" </em>(Matthew 5:43).  This statement does not exist in the OT either.  In fact, Proverbs 24:17 says, <em style="font: inherit;">"Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth…"</em></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">17) Jesus is reported to say: <em style="font: inherit;">"The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it"</em> (Luke 16:16).  Certainly every man is not pressing to enter the kingdom of God.  The very fact that I am an atheist (one third of the world’s population does not believe in a god) proves this verse to be false.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">18) <em style="font: inherit;">"Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the Sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are blameless?"</em> (Matthew 12:5) Nowhere does the OT state that the priests in the temple profaned the Sabbath and were considered blameless.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">19) <em style="font: inherit;">"Yea; have ye never read, 'Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise'" </em>(Matthew 21:16).  Jesus is quoting Psalm 8:2, which says, <em style="font: inherit;">"Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies…".  "Perfect praise"</em> has little to do with <em style="font: inherit;">"ordaining strength because of thine enemies."</em>  Another misquotation!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">20) <em style="font: inherit;">"But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him"</em> (Mark 9:13).  There are no prophecies in the OT of things that were to happen to Elijah.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;"><strong style="font: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Jesus, in all his "God incarnate" wisdom, contradicts himself:</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">21) Jesus consistently contradicts himself concerning his Godly status.  <em style="font: inherit;">"I and my father are one." </em> (John 14:28) Also see Philippians 2:5-6  Those verses lead us to believe that he is a part of the trinity and equal to his father being a manifestation of him. Yet, Jesus also made many statements that deny he is the perfect men, much less God incarnate.  Take the following for example: <em style="font: inherit;">"Why callest thou me good?  There is none good but one, that is God"</em> (Matthew 19:17).  <em style="font: inherit;">"My father if greater then I."</em>  (John 14:28)  Also see Matthew 24:26 Clearly, Jesus is denouncing the possibility of him being the Messiah in those three verses.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">22) Jesus said, <em style="font: inherit;">"whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire"</em> (Matthew 5:22).  Yet, he himself did so repeatedly, as Matthew 23:17-19 and Luke 11:40 &amp; 12:20 show.  Clearly Jesus should be in danger of hell too?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">23) Does Jesus support peace, or war?  Matthew 5:39  <em style="font: inherit;">"Resist not evil, but whoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also." </em> Also note Matthew 6:38-42 &amp; 26:52 where Jesus teaches non-resistance, Non-violence.  Now read (Luke 22:36-37) Where Jesus commands people to take arms for a coming conflict.  (John 2:15)  Jesus uses a whip to physically drive people out of the temple.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">24) Matthew 15:24  Jesus said, <em style="font: inherit;">"I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of lsrael,"</em>.  This would of course mean that he is here only to save the Jews.  The scriptures repeatedly back up this notion that Christ is savior to the Jews and not the gentiles (see Romans 16:17, Revelations 14:3-4 &amp; John 10).  The contradiction lies in what Jesus later tells his followers: <em style="font: inherit;">"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations"</em> (Matthew 28:19).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">25) Can we hate our kindred?  Luke 14:26 Jesus says <em style="font: inherit;">"If any man come unto me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brother, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he can not be my disciple."</em>  John 3:15  <em style="font: inherit;">"Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer."</em>  Also see Ephesians 6:22, 5:25, &amp; Matthew 15:4</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">26) Even many of the staunchest defenders of Jesus admit that his comment in Matthew 10:34 (<em style="font: inherit;">"I came not to send peace but a sword"</em>) contradicts verses such as Matthew 26:52 (<em style="font: inherit;">"Put up again thy sword into his place: for all that take the sword shall perish with the sword"</em>).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">27) Deuteronomy 24:1 &amp; 21:10-14 all say that divorce is allowed for the simple reason if a <em style="font: inherit;">"man no longer delighteth in his wife"</em>.  Yet Jesus comes along and breaks his father’s law by saying in Matthew 5:32 that adultery is the only way one can be divorced.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">28) In Mark 8:35 Jesus said: <em style="font: inherit;">"...but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s the same shall save it."</em>  How could Jesus have said this when there was no gospel when he lived?  The gospel did not appear until after his death.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">29) Matthew 6:13 Jesus recites a revised prayer and states, <em style="font: inherit;">"Don’t bring us into temptation." </em> God is the cause of everything, even Satan.  God has been leading people into temptation since the Garden of Eden.  Otherwise, the trees of life and knowledge would have never been there.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">30) Matthew 12:1-8 Jesus thinks it’s okay to break his father’s laws, by breaking the Sabbath day.  He states that he is basically exempt for such fiascoes and that he is Master of the Sabbath.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">31) John 3:17 Jesus contradicts himself when he says, <em style="font: inherit;">"God didn’t send his son into the world to condemn it, but to save it."</em> Jesus seems to forget his own stories.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">32) James 4:3  If your prayers are not answered, it’s your own damned fault. This is in direct contradiction to where Jesus says <em style="font: inherit;">"seek and ye shall find, ask and it shall be known to you"</em>.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">33) <em style="font: inherit;">"If Jesus bears witness of himself his witness is true"</em> John 8:14, <em style="font: inherit;">"If I bear witness of myself it is not true."</em>  John 5:31</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">34) <em style="font: inherit;">"I am with you always, even unto the end of the world"</em> (Matthew 28:20), versus <em style="font: inherit;">"For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always"</em> (Matthew 26:11 , Mark 14:7, John 12:8) and <em style="font: inherit;">"Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am thither ye cannot come"</em> (John 7:34).  Is this the kind of friend one can rely on?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">35) <em style="font: inherit;">"And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her"</em> (Mark 10:11 &amp; Luke 6:18), versus <em style="font: inherit;">"And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery"</em> (Matthew 19:9).  In the book of Matthew, Jesus said a man could put away his wife if one factor-- fornication--is involved.  In Mark and Luke he allowed no exceptions.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">36) Jesus is quoted: <em style="font: inherit;">"Judge not, and ye shall be not judged; condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven" </em>(Luke 6:37 &amp; Matthew 7:1), versus <em style="font: inherit;">"Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment"</em> (John 7:24).  Jesus stated men are not to judge but, then, allowed it under certain conditions.  As in the case of divorce, he can’t seem to formulate a consistent policy.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">37) <em style="font: inherit;">"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" </em> Matthew 27:46, (also note the time before crucification where Jesus prays for the<em style="font: inherit;">"cup to passeth over me"</em>) versus <em style="font: inherit;">"Now is my soul troubled.  And what shall I say?  ‘Father, save me from this hour?’  No, for this purpose I have come to this hour"</em> (John 12:27 RSV). Jesus can’t seem to decide whether or not he wants to die.  One moment he is willing; the next he isn’t.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">38) In Luke 23:30 (<em style="font: inherit;">"Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, fall on us, and to the hills, cover us"</em>) Jesus quoted Hosea 10:8 (<em style="font: inherit;">"...and they shall say to the mountains, cover us; and to the hills, fall on us"</em>).  And, like Paul, he often quoted inaccurately.  In this instance, he confused mountains with hills.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">39) <em style="font: inherit;">"And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.  But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they know him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed.  Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.  Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist"</em> (Matthew 17:11-13).  John the Baptist was beheaded, but Jesus was not.  And what did John the Baptist restore?  Nothing!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">40) We are told salvation is obtained by faith alone (John 3:18 &amp; 36) yet Jesus told a man to follow the Commandments-Matthew 19:16-18 (saving by works)-if he wanted eternal life.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">41) In Luke 12:4 Jesus told his followers to <em style="font: inherit;">"Be not afraid of them that kill the body."</em> But Matthew 12:14-16, John 7:1, 8:59, 10:39, 11:53-54, &amp; Mark 1:45 show that Jesus consistently feared death.  Jesus went out of his way to hide, run, and attempt escape from the Roman and Jewish authorities.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">42) Matthew 5:28 says to sin in <em style="font: inherit;">"your heart"</em> is considered a sin in itself.  The messiah is supposed to be God incarnate, not able to sin, yet in Matthew 4:5 &amp; Luke 4:5-9, Jesus was tempted by Satan in the desert, which is sinning in his heart.  Jesus also took upon all the sins of the world during his crucifixion, so how can it be said that <em style="font: inherit;">"Jesus was the perfect man without sin"</em>?  This would lead one to believe he was not the Messiah.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">43) Jesus told us to <em style="font: inherit;">"Love your enemies; bless them that curse you,"</em> but ignored his own advice by repeatedly denouncing his opposition.  Matthew 23:17 (<em style="font: inherit;">"Ye fools and blind"</em>), Matthew 12:34 (<em style="font: inherit;">"0 generation of vipers"</em>), and Matthew 23:27 (<em style="font: inherit;">". . . hypocrites . . . ye are like unto whited sepulchres. . ."</em>) are excellent examples of hypocrisy.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">44) Did the people of Jesus’ generation see any signs?  (Matthew 12:38-40)  Jesus announced that no signs would be given to that generation except the Resurrection itself.  (Mark 8:12-13)  Jesus announced that no signs would be given to that generation.  (Mark 16:20)  They went out preaching, and the Lord confirmed the word through accompanying signs. (John 20:30)  Jesus provided many wonders and signs. (Acts 2:22)  Jesus provided many wonders and signs.  (Acts 5:12 &amp; 8:13) many signs and wonders were done through the apostles.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">45) Jesus commands the disciples to go into Galilee immediately after the resurrection. Matthew 28:10  Jesus commands the disciples to<em style="font: inherit;">"tarry in Jerusalem"</em> immediately after the resurrection.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">46) Matthew 28:18 &amp; John 3:35 both tell that Jesus said he could do anything.  Yet Mark 6:5 says Jesus was not all powerful.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">47) Jesus says in Luke 2:13-14 that he came to bring peace on earth.  Matthew 10:34 Jesus back peddles and says he did not come to bring peace on earth.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">48) Did Christ receive testimony from man?  <em style="font: inherit;">"Ye sent unto John and he bare witness unto the truth.  But I receive not testimony from man."</em>  John 5:33-34 <em style="font: inherit;">"And ye shall also bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning."</em>  John 15:27</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">49) Christ laid down his life for his friends.  John 15:13 &amp; 10:11 Christ laid down his life for his enemies.  Romans 5:10</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; color: #333333; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">50) Deuteronomy 23:2 says bastards can not attend church unto the tenth generation.  If Jesus was spawned by Mary and Jehovah then he is technically a bastard and can't be leader of the church.</p>
