            <div class='col-md body'>For those whoare confused.  The verses that laoda posted is called the Beatitudes.<br><br>It doesn't mean we have to be poor and miserable to be blessed.  Being poor materially is definitely not a blessing.  Being "poor in spirit" simply means that we realise we cannot achieve salvation by our own effort.  When we realise that we are "poor" then we can start searching for answers to the "poverty".<br><br>Being mourners doesn't mean that we will only be blessed if someone we love dies.  "Mourners" mourn for their sins.  Once we realised what we are sinners, then we know we need comfort, and we shall find it if we seek it.</div>
