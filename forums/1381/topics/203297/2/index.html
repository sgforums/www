            <div class='col-md body'>There r 2 problems with tis notion on adam eating the fruit<br><br>1) God is too unforgiving, harsh and over-react so much so tat he curse all beings (animals included) to death, create "sin" and create all these problems of the world due to his outburst. He could simply just forgive, or given his omnipotent, reverse time and take out the fruit from adam, or just in the first place keep the fruit far away since he already knew from the first place adam is gonna eat anyway, given his omniknowledge. In short god really expect adam to eat the fruit and purposely did nothing to stop it<br><br>2) Inheriting sins from your ancesters is really bullsh!t. Wat he did is beyond your control and there is nothing u can do to reverse the fact adam eat the fruit. It is really the case where when the father was charged with murder all his sons and daughters, who is can even be 1 year old, have to die with him.</div>

If the logic and scripture conflict, why should the scripture prevail? Why don't you think this way: If God doesn't exist, then you would have spent a huge part of your life believing in something that was a whole big lie. You would have spent a great amount of time gathering at a big house with strange people, mumbling to yourself your whole life. For nothing.<br><br>You won't do that, because you are afraid of going to hell. Without religion, we can still lead productive lives and be good people.</div>
