            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Why does having a faith or not have to do with being logical and right in its argument Rolling Eyes Why should I have faith before I can even start to convince others ?</blockquote>Well no problem if you just wish to convince others based on what you believe. But in the first place you dont believe in what you are using to convince ! That is the problem !<br><br><blockquote>As said, u believe in the bible being all powerful and the ultimate truth and as such I present to u the harder to digest part of the bible to show tat it is not true.

He can try to convince A by saying tat "If there is a noch ness monster, why do u think the exploration of the river yield nothing etc etc". B do not have to believe in A in order to refute his argument</blockquote>Again...incredible. firstly, how do you know that it is the harder to digest part of the bible if you dont believe in the bible ? Secondly, the river is something which A and B believe in ya ? A river. But you are telling me now, you dont believe in the bible. So based on your  "river" and loch ness example , is it the same river we are talking about ?<br><br><blockquote>Is it ? Personal attack again I see...</blockquote>Yes. My opinion of your way to refute or argue. Personal ? Why not, it comes from you anyways.<br><br></div>
