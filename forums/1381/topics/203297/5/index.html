I do not believe in christainity, and I am convincing people not to believe in christainity.

So based on your "river" and loch ness example , is it the same river we are talking about ? </blockquote>First question. Tat is obviously easy because some part of the bible make incredible little sense and only madman or illogical people can believe in it. Do u need to believe in order to gauge ? I tell u the tooth fairy can become incredible hulk. Do u have to totally believe in tis theory first to refute it ? U just need common sense. Do u have common sense ? Otherwise why is it incredible to u ?<br><br>A &amp; B believe in the river, however the point of contempt is the monster. Why bring in the idea of the "river" in ? I believe in the world is round, u believe too. I believe in the alphabet B is after the alphabet A and so does u. We believe in almost all the things. SO wat ? Incredible... U probably lost all sense of logic and r just writing for the sake of writing<br><br><blockquote>Yes. My opinion of your way to refute or argue. Personal ?
