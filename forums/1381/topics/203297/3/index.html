I strongly agree. I get uncomfortable when people start spiritualising events, mishaps and disasters. and as Christians, instead of trying to spiritualise their sufferings, it would be much better to just be there for them or to keep them in your prayers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Actually, you are just being honest about it. Honestly, i got bothered by this doctrine too years ago. But i have to bow down to the teachings of Scripture. I always put this in mind: WHENEVER SCRIPTURAL REVELATION CONFLICT WITH MY LOGIC, IT SHOULD BE SCRIPTURE REVEALTION THAT SHOULD PREVAIL IN MY HEART AND MIND. </blockquote>U should be careful. In many cults we can see wat happen when scripture overcome logic and they mass suicide or send their wives to be prostitute to earn money for the cult.<br><br><blockquote>Actually it is through this principle in Scipture about Federal Headships we got saved. This principle of Federal Headships is a blessing and a boon to us when we see another Federal Head--Jesus Christ.<br><br>Adam was no ordinary human being. He was the representative head of us all. When he fell, we fell also. This is clearly revealed to us in Romans 5. Some would contend that we did not fell in Adam we just inherited Adam's fallen nature. But continuing our reading of Romans 5 clearly portrays THE PRINCIPLE OF REPRESENTATIVE HEADSHIPS. </blockquote>The explanation shows tat god is unfair and do not view personal deeds but just look at the "representative head". It is stereotyping  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> It never answer the basic question why does everyone get punished simply because of one man deed and the question tat his decendents, who r not present, can do little to salvage adam actions. People getting punished just because of his ancestors wrongs is a cursed principle. Furthermore the animals etc also get punished for adam fault. Wat is the logic behind tis then ? Does trees sin ? How come trees die as well ?<br><br><blockquote>Adam was our Federal Head right? But there is another Federal Head that came into the scene. The Second Adam or as our Bible's call it: the Last Adam--the Lord Jesus Christ. </blockquote>Then wat happened to the people from adam to jesus ? They all have only 1 representation head which is adam and he eat the fruit, and even if u read romans 5, it claims tat the people before moses to adam all die and sent to hell. No matter wat they did they r condemned to hell.  Even Noah, who is supposed to be better than the others, still go to eternal hell according to romans 5. Cursed principle<br><br><blockquote>When He lived here on earth, He lived righteously, He committed no sin. Then He died on the cross REPRESENTING ALL HUMAN BEINGS!!!! </blockquote>Jesus decend from eve. Eve inherited sin from adam. How come jesus becomes sinless while we r sinful ? Double standard ! Cursed principle !<br><br><blockquote>In the Last Adam, we obeyed all of God's laws. Why? Because the Lord Jesus lived perfectly sinless. In Christ, we died to the penalty of our sins!!! We don't have to pay for it come Judgment Day for our Representative Head has paid that penalty for us [Christians]!!!! </blockquote>Tat is again the strangest principle. Wat he did have nothing to do with me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Also there is a fine print tat need to be noted. He pay the penalty for adam himself, not us. We didn't eat the fruit. And when we "change federal representation", how come men still die ? God still can't change representative head or he can't forgive though he claim to. If the penalty is paid, how come everything seems to be the same as before he die ?<br><br><blockquote>How can one transfer from the Federal Headship of Adam to Christ's Federal Headship?<br><br>By trusting in Christ alone for salvation. </blockquote>There is another way. By rejecting adam as the federal head.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Since we can get to choose if he represent us or not then I chose adam not to represent me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote>They were saved because of faith in the coming Messiah. The word "righteous" in the OT are used to those people in the Old Testament who were saved. </blockquote>Please quote to me the passage of the bible where babies r saved and old people of OT r saved. No one can say from the scripture tat babies r saved neither can they come to a valid conclusion tat some people from OT r saved because there r some verses tat claimed they all r sent to eternal hell. They only assume the more rational outcome simply because they want the religion to sound better<br><br><blockquote>If he or she can perfectly obey his or her conscience from that point to death. He doesn't have a sinful nature. He is not a sinner. He will not even die by the way, because he has no sin [sinful nature] in him. </blockquote>How come trees or animals or a birth defect tat result in the baby being totally idiot still die ? Why does people brain dead and being held in vegetable state die ? They have no conscience. Given your example they should live forever.<br><br><blockquote>Because they chose to be born like that. </blockquote>Prove it from the scripture. Where do u read tis from ? Otherwise tis is your own religion, not christainity.<br><br></div>
