              <p>anyway..my previous post in response to some views somehow did not pull through..but i have to re do it now..</p>
              <p>1st..about the JW..just like any other christians sects i read before, i did some study on them. it appears like protestants that disagree with cath then split off.so too did the JW founders. now jw gt ard 6m believers worldwide. and they do what they preach. contrary to what churches do(collecting $$ opening) they have a small box somewhere and only those who wants to donate will do so  by the box. their teachings have not yet been accepted as mainstream now..just like back then cath vs pro..nw is christainity vs jw kinda thing. lastly, never have i seen a group of christian sect as persecuted as much as they have suffered..mainly because they refuse to take up arms unlike the rest. why, even lee hsiang loong says they are a very good and peaceful group of christians if not for the fact they dont do ns..</p>
              <p>as for trinity and mummy mary. i need all the help i can to guide me..from my understanding....</p>
              <p>God is God, Jesus is God,Holy spirit is God ya? they are 3 in 1 God head.</p>
              <p>so a summary goes like this</p>
              <p>God has no begining.and word was with God and there word was like a god.</p>
              <p>God begin creating.all hell broke loose.so to ransom a perfect man's sin,it takes another perfect man to do so. thus God sent God down to earth through the delivery of mary.so now God has a beginning. God grew up sinless but got baptise(what do baptism means to u?) by a sinful man.and God was acknowledge by God to be his only son.</p>
              <p>so now God preached about God's word and thrashed merchants out of God's temple and God always held himself in subjection to God as seen in many examples in NT. God is finally killed on the cross and 3 days later God rose back to heaven to be God. Now God is waiting further instructions from none other than God for the date/time of armageddon for only God knows when it is but even God does not know when is the exact time. so God ask humans to always be prepared as God will come like a thief at night.</p>
              <p>did i miss out anything main point? besides that:</p>
              <p>God has no beginning nor end was thrown out of the window when mary gave birth to God and God died on the cross. thus making God not almighty since he died.</p>
              <p>God is holy of holiest but being baptise by a mortal man. doesnt baptism means to die from the old self and reborn into a new holy self to serve God? but since God said he never change,then to die from what old self?and be reborn into what new self?</p>
              <p>also, God said no man shall see him and yet live(though no mention of no woman shall see him yet live,we assume man here meant humanity) but how many saw God again while he preached?</p>
              <p>the last part really got me off..God is all knowing,almighty however God also always subject himself to God and says only God will know.doesnt it sounds like some kinda split personality(an imperfection) or double standard?(unfairness)</p>
              <p>i truly want to know how trinity works therefore i asked but not received.</p>
              <p>side note ( doesnt those paganistic drams we watch featuring some deity or buddha have to transmigrate to earth to under go trials so they go back up again?? y so familiar in trinity?)</p>
              <p>please help me out on this. thanks</p>

              <p>GOD, JC, Holy Spirit (HS). One in substance and essence of
                                      divinity. Three ways in which it is expressed. liken it to time.
                                      Past. Present. Future. All 3 represent time in different ways, but
                                      are of the same quality / subject matter, that is time.---24/7</p>
              <p>jw aint new i agree..what i do know about the 1914 thingy is not the end of the world but rather the start of it..if im not wrong..they mentioned that period is the time when satan is being hurled down to earth and pretty pissed cuz not much time to play.(revelation)</p>
              <p>so if i were to use time to rep trinity..the past sent the present to save the future??mayb im really dumb but i still cant comprehend the profoundness of trinity...sad =(</p>

              <p>Yea, i checked out their website, and that's what it says. But if i remembered correctly, other documents that predate 1914 specifically mentioned the world would end. On hindsight, it didn't. So they changed the interpretation.</p>
              <p>I dont blame you for not understanding the trinity from my poor analogy. Like all analogy, they're faulty and open to many interpretations. It's what i can come up with now.

              <p>In fact, Deut 6 describes the use of a "composite unity"
              word for 'one' in the Shema of Deut 6.4-5. i quote:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>There are two
              words for 'one' in Biblical Hebrew: 'ehad ('one', 'alone', 'unity
              from parts') and 'yahid' (always means uniqueness/solitary-only one of
              its kind [cf. used of only son and only daughter, Gen 22.2,12,16; Jer
              6.26; Judges 11.34]...<em>not</em> the same word as
              'yahad' that often means 'in complete unity, together,united' cf. Deut 33.5, Ps 133.1). This verse
              is <em>sometimes</em> used by a few groups within the Jewish tradition
              to assert the numerical unity of God's nature, over against what they
              perceive as a 'Christian' notion of plurality-in-unity. But this
              verse either doesn't support their position (i.e., it doesn’t
              talk about God's nature at all); or actually does the opposite (i.e.,
              by leaving a door open to 'composite unity'). Instead of using
              YAHID, which MIGHT be of some support to their position, it uses
              'EHAD, which <em>lends</em> itself to the plurality position (or
              certainly <em>allows</em> it). Consider some other passages in which
              'EHAD is used:</p>

              <p>if i remembered correctly, JW in a way are kinda funny when they actually tried to predict the kingdom's arrival cuz they fail many times..in this point, they are very wrong to try predict a date for it.like many people who wants to know the date for end of world,they wanted to know to i guess..and were overzealous in that hence over look the fact that all interpretations belongs to God alone.</p>

              <p>my bad on this too..what i meant was not just the essence, but also who have the right of sorvereignty. whn JC subjected himself to God, it already means he is not in full power meaning he cant be God since God is not able to subject to any higher power as it does not exist. that was my point..its also why i cannot believe in trinity.</p>
              <p>Who was GOD talking to in Genesis when He said, "Let <em>us</em> make man in our image".--24/7</p>
              <p>by this time the entire heavenly hosts were also created. not withstanding this, since JC is the only begotten son,its logical hes the 1st creation(not withstanding trinity too), thus think this--&gt;</p>

              <p>Hi domon,</p>
              <p>Many other reasons why they're funny, not merely their rejection of Jesus' divinity.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>by this time the entire heavenly hosts were also created.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>heavenly hosts were created beings. God is not created. You are state that there is a plurality within the nature of God, but to say that God's image is identical to heavenly hosts, is totally off tangent.</p>
              <p>There are other similar verses as well:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
              <li>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Gen 1.26: Then God said, "Let
              	us make man in our image, in our likeness,</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Gen 3.22: And the LORD God said,
              	"The man has now become like one of us,</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Gen 11.7: Come, let us go down and
              	confuse their language</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>Is 6.8: Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom
              	shall I send? And who will go for us?"</p>
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Not one of these, however, suggest that he, the omniscient
              and all-wise God, called on them for advice or even identified them
              with him in some way in his utterance...In a context that speaks both
              of waters and mountains (and so of nature) and of nations (and so, by
              implication, of history), the Lord refutes the notion that he
              consulted others (Is 40:13-14).</p>
              <p>The plural, therefore, inherently suggests
              either the divine majesty or that fullness of his being that was to
              find its ultimate theological expression in the doctrine of the
              Trinity.</p>

              <p>If I understand correctly, we have a spectrum here:</p>
              <p>yahid (uniqueness/only) ----&gt; ehad (one OR composite unity) ----&gt; yahad (united, complete unity)</p>
              <p>So one question asked is, why use ehad when yahid is a better choice?</p>
              <p>But are you sure, that yahid is indeed a better choice?</p>
              <p>Look at how Strong's Hebrew Lexicon defines yahid:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><a href="http://www.eliyah.com/cgi-bin/strongs.cgi?file=hebrewlexicon&amp;isindex=3173">http://www.eliyah.com/cgi-bin/strongs.cgi?file=hebrewlexicon&amp;isindex=3173</a><br><strong>3173</strong> yachiyd yaw-kheed' from <a href="http://www.eliyah.com/cgi-bin/strongs.cgi?file=hebrewlexicon&amp;isindex=3161"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">3161</span></span></a>; properly, united, i.e. sole; by implication, beloved; also lonely; (feminine) the life (as not to be replaced):--darling, desolate, only (child, son), solitary.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>From the Lexicon, we vaguely notice that yahid does not mean "only" per se. Let's confirm using the Concordance:</p>

              <p>Consult or discuss is an overstatement. In all of those verses, God did not ask them for advice, like "oh shit, I dunno what to do next, must ask my angels". Instead God just told them, like a sovereign master, what He's gonna do.</p>
              <p>But of course, we do find at least one instance, where God held a meeting with His heavenly hosts, so the idea is not too far fetched:</p>
              <blockquote>

              <p>Anyway, your analysis is outdated. You'd do well to consult what's the preeminent position of Gen 1:26 by Christian scholars. Do a search on the majestic plural.</p>

              <p>Let's examine the context of Isaiah 6:8 (which happens to be one of my fav biblical verses, the verse used by the Nightstalkers .. hehe)</p>
              <blockquote>

              <p>Please lor, here we have the clearest indiction the Lord was with His heavenly hosts.</p>
              <p>And when the Lord said "who will go for us", you don't suppose He's referring to JC, who's lurking behind a heavenly screen, like åž‚å¸˜å�¬æ”¿, do you?</p>

              <p>Don't get your point.</p>
              <p>Are you trying to say the faith is very real and therefore true?</p>
              <p>I don't think logic works this way, friend. The converse is true though - because it is true, the faith is very real.</p>
              <p>For example, as a Christian, you'd agree that God did indeed spoke to the whole Jewish nation at Sinai. Because such an event happened, a national revelation no less, the Jewish faith is very true.</p>
              <p>However, faith is very real in most religions, probably including Egyptian ones, but doesn't mean they are believing in the correct thing.</p>

              <p>Maybe i have. But certainly, only God the Father was involved in creation as verse 27 indicates. So, verse 26, "let us <em>make</em> man in our image" would sound as if the "us" is involved in the process
              of creation. Definitely, angels are not involved in creation.</p>

              <p>Anyway, your analysis is outdated. You'd do well to consult
                                      what's the preeminent position of Gen 1:26 by Christian scholars.

              <p>Outdated? Based on what? My NIV bible says that too, i dont blame you. But it's only one view out of many. I'm not sure <em>updated</em> certainly means better. Speaking of which, as to why God the Son was not openly declared, Christianity is based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_revelation_(Christian)">progressive revelation</a> (<strong>would that be considered updated?</strong>). Or Gregory Nazianzen puts it this way,</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>“The
              Old Testament proclaimed the Father openly, and the Son more obscurely.
              The New manifested the Son, and suggested the deity of the Spirit. Now
              the Spirit himself dwells among us, and supplies us with a clearer
              demonstration of himself. For it was not safe, when the Godhead of the
              Father was not yet acknowledged, plainly to proclaim the Son; nor when
              that of the Son was not yet received to burden us further … with the
              Holy Spirit … It was necessary that, increasing little by little, and,
              as David says, by ascensions from glory to glory, the full splendor of
              the Trinity should gradually shine forth.” Orations 31.26</p>

              <p>Anyway, searching for majesty plural gave me <a href="http://www.bible.ca/trinity/trinity-oneness-unity-plural-of-majesty-pluralis-majestaticus-royal-we.htm">this</a>: <br></p>
              <p>Have you read my reply properly?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><br>The plural, therefore, inherently suggests <strong>either</strong> the divine majesty <strong>or</strong> that fullness of his being that was to find its ultimate theological expression in the doctrine of the Trinity.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>There are no other examples (in OT Heb) of a monarch using plural verbs or plural pronouns of himself in such a “plural of majesty,” how do you substantiate it?</p>
              <p>Even the closest, Ezra 4:18, which has that construction is in Aramaic. Not only is it poor scholarship to build a case for a grammatical construction in Hebrew on the grounds of this Aramaic text. Even so, the Ezra passage does not necessarily contain a singular royal subject linked to a plural verb-form. If the plural of majesty were a regular Hebrew idiom, why is the singular "me" in the same line?      <br><br>From the Genesis Rabbah about Genesis 1:26:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Rabbi Samuel ben Nahman said in Rabbi Jonathan's name: "When Moses was
              engaged in writing the Torah, he had to write the work of each day.
              When he came to the verse, AND GOD SAID; LET US MAKE MAN, etc., he
              said: 'Sovereign of the Universe! Why dost Thou furnish an excuse to
              heretics?' (for maintaining a plurality of deity). 'Write,' replied He;
              'whoever wishes to err may err.'"</p>
              <p>Even the earliest Jewish sources agreed in the plurality.</p>
