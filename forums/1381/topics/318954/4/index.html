              <p>It uses echad. My previous post said echad (ehad).</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Btw, your Hebrew is weird. Which translation is that? The one I'm familiar is something along the line of "Adonai Eloyahu, Adonai Echad". Of course yours cannot be a Jewish one, 'cos they don't write Yehovah.</p>
              <p>My point is exactly what I wrote - you were endorsing the view that by using Echad in Deut 6:4, Scripture is openly up the possibility of a composite unity. It could have used yahid as this would decrease the possibility of God as a compositie unity. But is yahid a better word? Looking at how yahid is used in Scripture, wouldn't it open up to more heresies? Like God suddenly become the beloved son of a higher god. Machiam like gnosticism liao.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Maybe i have. But certainly, only God the Father was involved in creation as verse 27 indicates. So, verse 26, "let us <em>make</em> man in our image" would sound as if the "us" is involved in the process of creation. Definitely, angels are not involved in creation.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I wouldn't say only God is involved in creation. You can be involved, yet not do the execution. For example, a terrorist cell can plan to blow up the airport, but only one or two will execute the evil act. Can you say the rest not involved?</p>
              <p>But one thing is clear. Creation is attributed to God alone. In Scripture, we find instances of the heavenly hosts around God. And I have shown you that God does indeed "consult" them on certain issues. But execution is only by the sovereign God.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Outdated? Based on what? My NIV bible says that too, i dont blame you. But it's only one view out of many. I'm not sure <em>updated</em> certainly means better. Speaking of which, as to why God the Son was not openly declared, Christianity is based on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_revelation_(Christian)">progressive revelation</a> (<strong>would that be considered updated?</strong>). Or Gregory Nazianzen puts it this way,</p>

              <p>I did not say it means better. Certainly a variety of views exist, and each has its own strength and weaknesses.</p>
              <p>Might progressive revelation be a post-hoc argument trying to salvage the Christian view?</p>

              <p>does this imply a trinitarian Godhead? or a loving father saying to his son(both singular) to make something that looks like them as they play with clay.</p>

              <p>But Maimonides used the word "yahid" in the 13 articles of the Jewish faith.</p>
              <p>Zohar has it as,</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>“Hear, O Israel, Adonai Eloheinu Adonai is one. These three are one. How can the three Names be one? Only through the perception of faith; in the vision of the Holy Spirit, in the beholding of the hidden eye alone. . . . So it is with the mystery of the threefold Divine manifestations designated by Adonai Eloheinu Adonai—three modes which yet form one unity.”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Other early Jewish sources do not disagree with the evidence of plurality within the Shema.</p>

              <p>I would ascribe all the glory of creation to God alone, from the planning to the execution.

You're reading your own modern reasoning into the verse. So if i were to read it in view of the Trinity, it makes sense too.</p>

              <p>Right from the start, i didnt claim that these verses <em><strong>refer to</strong> </em>or<em> <strong>prove</strong></em> the existence of the Trinity. But it allows for the possibility. There is a <em>suggestion</em> (hint, if you will) within those verses.</p>
              <p>Anyway, within that 1 Kings 22: 19 passage, where you showed that God was convening a heavenly court, why doesnt He mention "us" to refer to Himself and the heavenly hosts?</p>
              <blockquote>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Nope. Depends on which perspective you take. It's an understanding of how God works.</p>
              <p>Was it you who told me, in another thread, God gave Adam 6 laws, then He gave Noah 7 laws. Then the whole Law at Sinai, or over the period of many years (depending which Jewish school of thought you're from). Even the birthplace of the Messiah
              in Micah 5.2 was probably not known to Abraham.</p>
              <p>So i surmise, OT does demonstrate progressive revelation, and that's the pattern God chooses to reveal Himself, so it should not be
              a priori rejected when it comes to the OT-NT relationship.</p>
              <p>Even if i cant find 'proof' of the Trinity in the OT, that would in itself, not be a reason to discard the principle of progressive revelation. Especially if the NT was very clear on the issue.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>progressive relvation was obvious in OT and in NT, JC gave the ending away when he said the destroyed temple will be rebuilt in 3 days. things in NT were rather direct.no longer that progressive as there is no time to dilly dally. only left 2000++ years til armageddon. especially in revelation when it serves as a spoiler as to what is going to happen. in the same breathe, perhaps also in NT is the place where trinity will be kind of declared officially. however we do not see that. quotes that were given to show support of trinity is overthrown with other quotes. so how??</p></div>
