              <p> </p>
              <p>Wow...I'm impressed...tell me something definitive abt
                      wat was written by a god and i'll believe you. Bear in mind that
                      you may not understand cos we are all inferior. Unless you suggest
                      that some are more inferrior than others, share with us who they
                      might be. Difinitively of course....nehp</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>nothing was written by God literally..all authors are divinely
                      inspired..heck, God oso only sent angels to tell the writers what
                      He wanted to say..n of cuz we all inferior to God..as for who
                      inferior ar../me points to self then to great crowd..and says you,
                      you and you all lor..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>kk. not as clear cut as maths but that'll do.</p>
              <p>so that means i can party all  my life and when i'm dying
                      i'll just utter a word of prayer and i can go to heaven
                      rite?newcomer</p>
              <p>nope..like i said,heaven is not the final destination..at least
                      not for most of us anyways..even if u sinned all life.but at
                      deathbed u TRULY REPENT your sins..God will take you back to his
                      fold. if not give u the bible for wat??</p>

              <p>you can use the gear picture on the right. click on it, then quote.</p>
              <p>i think i agree.</p>
              <p>and just a bible verse:</p>
              <p><strong>Do not be deceived, God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will reap destruction. The one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.</strong></p>
              <p>Everyone makes mistakes, before knowing Christ we don't know any better. Paul murdered christians, some join gangs, some chopped others, some took drugs, some not so severe. Just maybe telling lies.. or smoked a cigarette or two..</p>
              <p>But God loves us all the same, not because of what we do, but because of who He is. But if you, upon knowing the love of God, takes advantage of that love.. how much do you really love God?</p>
              <p>the right faith produces the right love, which automatically produces good works which proves your salvation. Salvation is still by faith, but good works done with love, is a good indication of where you stand before God. a good tree bears good fruit, a bad tree bears bad fruits.. etc. =)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>just an example, my dad's a gambler, not very heavy, but still a gambler, upon receiving Christ, he immediately stopped. not because he is afraid he will lose his salvation if he gambled, but he just knew that it wasn't what God want for him, so he just stopped, with the help of the Holy Spirit.</p>

              <p>What dumbdumb explained to you is correct but there is another thing you need to be concern about.  That's relating to "all the bad stuffs". You seems to think that since you can be saved at the last moment, why bother now right ? Enjoy all you want and you know that there's a way out. You are not the only one but be warned that it may be too late as per the taxi example.</p>
              <p>Even if bad luck do not fall on one, you need to be warned about such thinking...</p>
              <p>You should read Mathew 25:31-46 in which Jesus tells us something about the last judgement.</p>
              <p>If you do not have the bible (suggest you find one to read), I give you a simple summary.</p>
              <p>Jesus said people will be separate into 2 groups: Sheeps and Goats.</p>
              <p>The requirements are based on what they did and what they did not do - such as clothing, feeding, caring etc... for the needy. In short, did you show any love to your neigbour as you would have loved yourself?</p>
              <p>He said, if you have done to the least of my brothers or sisters, you have done it to me. I.E. if you have shown love to the needy, you ahve shown love to God.</p>
              <p>If you have not done so, you have not shown love to God.</p>
              <p>Jesus also summarised the 10 commandements into 2 important commandments :</p>
              <p>1. You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul and all your mind</p>
              <p>2. You must love your neighbour as yourself</p>
              <p>Is doing all the bad stuff the way to go? When you know God, you will know what is it that He wants from you. Follow His will and you will find that you will led a more meaningful and happier life......</p>
              <p>Less sins for sure, but can be happier (If not as happy) as millions of Christians can testify to.</p>
              <p>What dumbdumb has told you is the version that salvation is by faith alone (anyway, good faith will lead you to good works)....what I am giving you is the version that salvation is by faith and deeds because James said in James 2:14-26, faith without deeds is dead.</p>
              <p>Hope this answered your question : "can i just do all the bad stuffs first before knowing god?"</p>
              <p>Why not take the first step to know God by finding out what the faith
                          is all about? Do not rely on hearsay from your friends and relatives.
                          Go straight to a church and speak to a priest or pastor....ask your
                          christians friends for help.</p>

              <p>hmm.. a personal opinion. the reason why ppl like sin, is because they're trying to fill up something in their lives.</p>
              <p>why do people club (not that clubbing is bad, i club too), drink (not that drinking is bad, i drink too), smoke, flirt around, (haha, i don't smoke), spending countless nights making love, and finding none (haven't tried that. wahahaha!)</p>
              <p>why do christians stop sinning (or stop at some degree), is because they found someone who can fill up that void in their life. It doesn't mean that they stop totally, they will eventually, if they continue to abide in God and let God love them.</p>
              <p>but all in all, God is already waiting for you, to come back to Him. continue searching and asking. =)</p>

              <p>Hi domon,</p>
              <p>the Hypostatic Union of Jesus Christ is to be understood. Jesus was fully man (thus he could say he faced tempations, got tired, prayed) and fully GOD (perfect unblemished sacrifice for our sins, walked on water, healed)</p>
              <p>Quote:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Jesus is God in human flesh. He is not half God and half
                  man. He is fully divine and fully man.  That is, Jesus has two distinct 
                        natures:  divine and human.  Jesus is the Word who was God 
                        and was with God and was made flesh, (<a href="http://www.carm.org/kjv/John/john_1.htm#In">John 1:1</a>,<a href="http://www.carm.org/kjv/John/john_1.htm#An">14</a>). </span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Two natures, not mixed together, nor combined into a new God-man nature. Separate, yet acting as a unit in one person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Commonly, Christian cults try to ignore the the two natures of Christ, which makes one wonder what is the basis of their salvation and redemption? That of their founder's?</p>
              <p>For instance, the <em>Jehovah's Witnesses</em> focus on Jesus' humanity and ignore His divinity. They tend to quote verses dealing with JC as man and pit them against verses that show that JC is divine. They also commonly claim that the Holy Spirit is more of a force, than anything else.</p>
              <p>The rabbit hole really goes much deeper than this.</p>

              <p>what you had wanted to say was that it will be more accurate to use the original text because it will provide better understanding of the meaning and context of scripture - that is not wrong.</p>
              <p>translated and paraphased bible does not give the depth of the original text. also there are many words in hebrew (and aramic and greek) that does not translate well in English.</p>
              <p>however practically, it quite difficult to read original hebrew text because we don't know the language, therefore the quick go-about is to refer to concordances and use study Bibles which offer the reader a deeper understanding of the meanings.</p>
