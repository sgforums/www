In conclusion, it is not wrong to say tat non-believers go to hell. Tat is really the bottom line. About all people being sinners, well when u r borned u have already sinned. The idea of sinning is really too unfair and flawed to be, well, believed logically to have come from a perfect being. God want non-sinners to go to heaven, but he purposely let only christians who perhaps had sinned much to go there.

However, if the listener makes not objection to that "conversation" that it is perfectly legal. You have EVERY right to tell anyone who preaches to you go to away, and you SHOULD use this right.</div>

The concept of Christianity is salvation by faith (which of course you may disagree <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ), but that is THE crux of Christianity, not the good works. I have seen many examples personally that some "good works" done by Christian groups or organisation stems from the purpose of wanting to evangelise, so personally, to me, there is an secondary motive hidden (which I don't agree with).</div>

Good work is not part of the equation. So under this concept, receive something can hardly be considered as "performing certain actions over times". No different from stretching out one's hand when you buy something from a shop and getting a gift in the process, or even going to a place to redeem some free things which may even involving paying a bus fare or taxi charge to go to.

So would you still consider the so-called gift as free?</blockquote>Well, then it boils down to the question on whether does believing in christ considered an action or not.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> If u have to help a person carry a burden, like a bag of luggage, maybe for life, is it a labour ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My reply was <strong>not to show that evengelization only occurs by good deeds or to show that only Christians perfom good deeds out of love.</strong><br><br>Neither do I agree with groups that do 'good' works for the motive of converting people. You live out the faith because that is what you are supposed to do and if by that process you mange to become a witness for Christ than good. Otherwise the group should just have one motive and that is to help people.<br><br>I was trying to state that a lot of people who 'preach' the faith(regardless of religion, though Christians are more agressive) don't actually live it out. They are only interested in how many people they can baptize. Kind of like selling flag day coupons.<br><br>So by all means preach but make sure you'r living out the faith.<br><br>Now about good  deeds just to evengelize, is a bit off. In the first place we love(good is not suffcient) not just because we want to show people how 'good' we've become after 'embracing' the Christian faith but because that is the essence of faith :to love.  Following that instruction we love(or doing 'good') for the sake of loving and not primarily because we want to evengelize people.</div>

I use to use the term mother teresa but it still basically deals with the bible and is not a good example.<br><br>About the appearence of "christian hitler", IMO it can happen. Basically because the same bible, when read by the different people, can come out with different interpretations. Tat is why there are many denomination of christainity.

The value of a programmer is not on its typing skills but understanding of problem, syntex, problem formulation and solution. It is mainly "thoughts" tat rationalise its high pay.
