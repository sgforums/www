            <div class='col-md body'>many ppl out there ask y Christians evangelise. firstly its not something tt Christians can choose to do. it is a responsibility and a mantle handed down to us by Jesus. Let there b no mistake about this for it is written in Bible "make disciples of all the nations." John 15 sums up the entire relationship of Christians and God. God called us to be His disciples, not His converts. To b a disciple in Christ is to live as Jesus did and to bear fruit 4 Him and thru Him and this is done thru evangelising, ministering, nurturing, fellowship in the body of Christ, prayer, the Word of God(The Bible) and with Christ in the centre of our lives.<br>As a Christian, u can hv only one Master - God. u cannot hv one foot in the world n another in God. U either love one n despise the other.</div>

They plainly find some of the evangelists too pressing and insistent and some, even insulting and they don't like it. Jesus also tell people to hit their slaves if they r lazy. How many people keep slaves, or even hit them now ? God also says through Moses tat those women, after having their period, have to let go of 2 pigeons because they r "unclean". Do anyone follow tat now ? It is to show tat u can quote me tat the bible tell u to do so, but I can also tells of many things which u r not doing too. In todays time, tis rule should undergo some form of revision (such as <span style="font-style: italic;">when</span> to evangelise)[My opinion is evangelise only when they r gonna commit suicide r suffering great depression <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ] to be more applicable in todays time. Tis is especially so since there r many religions, most peopel already know wat is christainity and nobody can surely know which is right or wrong.</div>

Fine. I am gonna evangelise the opposite to the people as well.

I had the impression that there were too many complaints and so somebody at the top discreetly put a stop to it.
