I stated we have duty to evengalize but before we(preach) make sure you actually live out that faith, how can you preach something you don't belive in(not living out the faith).

Wah .. even ask you  to share somemore.<br><br>How many conversion testimonies we heard are like that?<br><br>I do not doubt that good behaviour give good impression, which of course makes preaching easier, but I don't understand why will people come to you just 'cos you are good?<br><br>If you can perform miracles I can understand, but good?<br><br></div>
