            <div class='col-md body'>Haha time to chip in.<br><br>Anyway, RCs and Protestants. First and foremost, here is some background information and history in general about Christianity.<br><br>Jesus was a Jew. It is said that along with John and others, he may have been part of the Essenes or an Essenes-influenced Jewish sect. The Essenes were a sect of Jews that preached that the world was coming to an end, something which Jesus shared. Jesus was trying to change the Jewish religion from within - he probably never intended to create a new Church.<br><br>After Jesus's death, the Jewish authorities persecuted his disciples and followers. Amongst them, one of the persecutors was a man name Saul. After the persecution, stoning and killing of Stephen (Acts 7-8.1), he was enroute to persecute others when he had a religious experience and guess what, he converted and became one of Jesus's best followers. He was to become St Paul.<br><br>Well, the world didn't end and St Paul and the rest of Jesus's followers decided that they needed more structure in their organisation. That's when the physical body of the Church organisation began to be formed. One of the issues that the new Church faced was that because they were recruiting Gentiles as well, the Jews in the Church felt, among other thigns, that the Gentiles should be circumcised as well. It is here that the Church was seperated from Jewism. St Paul decided among other things that Christians did not need to be circumcised and stripped the Church of its Jewish flavour.<br><br>Another thing to note is that the Bible was only written down 100plus years after Jesus's death. Also, Bible researches have found out that the first 3 books of the NT, Luke, Matthew and Mark are based from information from a book now known as "Q." Much of the gospel was actually verbally transmitted and only written down much later. In fact, there were many gospels (10 or 11?) with different accounts. The Church decided which 4 fit the best and put it in the Bible. The rest can are kept in the vaults of the Vatican.<br></div>

Yup, people like me were mentinoned to go down to hell. Maybe they use the word non-believer more than use the word women. Yup I am really honoured.<br><br><blockquote>Biblical contradiction?!!! Where is SIS?</blockquote>Lets put it tis way. There r bible verses tat tell people tat the dead will go to heaven only on judgement day. There r some verses who say they go immediately after death. SO in the end when do the dead go to heaven if they go to heaven at all ? Nobody really knows because the verses contradict one another and there is no way to verify it. This is the fault of the bible for being contradictory and unclear. They can only choose which one they like to believe in more and tat is why there r so many varied and different teachings. My suggestions is don't just believe for the sake of believing or because they claimed to be right. Find enough evidences to start believing first. Personally, if the bible says it is perfect and yet it is not, then it is clear the whole bible is wrong and the religion which derives from it wrong as well.</div>

It is through language (koine Greek) that one truly understands the NT. If language is like you wrote "pretty subjective n isn't very substantial", then it follows that your understanding of theology will also be very subjective and any explanation on your part will not be substantial too.<br><br>For example, many instances we find words in the original language (greek or hebrew) that has no equivalent in English or one word in English that was translated from different words in the original, hence it is very easy to miss the subtleties.</div>
