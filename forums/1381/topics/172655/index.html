So since we can't do much, we don't pray for the worse to come right? Love thy neighbour as thyself. Love God with all our hearts, mind soul etc. This sums up the 10 commandments. Faith, hope, love the greatest is love. Love never fails. Love never gives up. Love never boasts itself. Love is humble &amp; kind to all people. Christ is love.<br><br>Can we bear to see the Jews &amp; others suffer? Can we see children die? Suffer the little children to come to Jesus. Forbid them not for they shall enter heaven. We as disciples of Jesus should stop scolding ourselves or others to stop children from entering heaven. Dont stumble others by this.</div>
