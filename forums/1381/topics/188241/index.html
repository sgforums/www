Most of such websites I've seen turned from a neutral website into a hate website, because members lose their main aim. This website could very well be the next one, due to how they word the website. It may not turn into one, if members are focused. But if they do lose focus, it will turn into one. Time will tell.</div>

Why dont u try telling the buddhists over at their forum or the muslims or hindus or taoists etc that their religions should be abolished as well? There must be some truth in these beliefs for them to adhere faithfully to them. To write off all religions is a bold claim. So u have the answers to all our questions? Why not stop labelling ppl as morons &amp; state what are your answers to our existential problems?</div></blockquote>I respect many religious people who have sound understanding of what they believe in and why. Unfortunately I have also met many who are like you; who goes beyond "personal spiritual beliefs" and try to change the world to your liking.<br><br>If you want to change anything, at least based your claims on real credible evidence and not on your stupid beliefs that are based on fantasies and imaginations; I can use other less impolite words but I do need feel the need to.</div>
