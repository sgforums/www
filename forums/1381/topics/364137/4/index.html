                                Yes but there are evil spirits that people may worship. It's written in the bible that in the end times though God pour out trouble after trouble the people would still not repent from worshiping evil spirit.

              Yes you are right back then the emperors were to recite some kind of oath. Anyway the oath sounded like the Chinese knew God. As I read what the Chinese Emperor had to recite at the moment of their inauguration to be emperor it gave me goosebumps....surely there were some very wise people who knew God then. They definitely had the knowledge of God.

              You know when you live in a kingdom you are best to pay respect to the king. To live according to the king's law.
              
              And God is the King of kings. It would even be more crucial to respect God and to live according to His law.

              <p>Well, this is at best grasping at straws and is not conclusive, not forgetting that there is no reference nor proof of this</p>
              <p>I am sure anyone can find in this a blog or website written by someone without verification from a neutral historical authority</p>
              <p>Not forgetting that we are putting two and two to make five, few points to highlight here</p>
              <p>While the people of State of Shang believes in monotheism, there is no conclusive link to christianity...are you proving existence of a god, a single god, a christian god, the same god..etc?</p>
              <p>Technically you dont pray to a Buddha</p>
              <p>Perfect sacrifice...firstly doesnt prove its jesus, if he exists, secondly where is this line found and can it be interpreted differently?</p>
              <p>Where does the line about noah even come from??</p>
              <p>I wish people would take a scholarly or deeper approach to history, spritituality and test out the logic, the coherence of these materials if assuming each of the point is true</p>

              <p>It has been proven that, Shang Di in the early years of china is actually the same god, our lord...</p>

              <p><br>One of the China biggest temple, one of the oldest temple...<br>They remembered on teaching of the lord, as after noah people started to go different places, the chinese remembered this teaching "<strong>You shall not make for yourself any carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above,</strong>" and that temple has totally no image or anything... Just a word "shand di"...</p>
              <p>There are more proves that the only god China pray to is the same god we prayed...<br>But i forgotten them cus the list are like soooo long and some are really in dept and lots of quoting from chinese and my chinese ain't good at all lols</p>
