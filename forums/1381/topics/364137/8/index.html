              as long as there is a single god or many god concept, I would reject it.
              
              if the so called god is so almighty, why would there be so many wars and conflict in this world. why would the god create so many sufferings in this world?
              
              and why banish non believers to hell, since everyone are your creations.
              
              the reason i reject is because, of the absurdity that non believers go to hell.

              <p>if the so called god is so almighty, why would there be so many

                  sufferings in this world?</p>
              <p>and why banish non believers to hell, since everyone are your
                  creations.</p>
              <p>the reason i reject is because, of the absurdity that non
                  believers go to hell.</p>
              <p>i believe religions should be free will and freedom of enquiry,

              I researched on other religions, like hinduism, buddhism, taoism, confucianism, christianity, catholic, Islam, bhagavad gita etc.
              
              I cannot profess to be an expert in all of them, but I know the gist of the religions mentioned. There are about 300 plus religions in India alone, mind you, not to mention its  many languages in India and its famed caste system.
              
              the highest caste are the brahmins (priests) and the lowest caste (lowest of the low), based on birth. If you are born an outcaste, there is no way you are going to grow your way out of poverty or outcaste, and thats blatantly unfair.
              
              no one is born poor or outcaste all his/her life. the poor can be rich, and vice versa. the best system is meritocracy, you are what you are if you are capable, even if you are rich and powerful.
              
              so the hell thingy is ridiculous. since god said we are his creations, then why banish his sons/daughters abeit non believers to hell and reward believers to heavens and eternal bliss? I just can't accept this. aren't parents supposed to be unbiased even if the children misbehaved or doesnt listen to the parents advise.
