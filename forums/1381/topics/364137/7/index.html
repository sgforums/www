              Got insulted you mean not challenged. I'm not anyone's Jesus I can tell you that.
              You assumed too mcuh when you said we took the matter as a matter of pride. Not everyone is like you kid. You must be free of your own current mindset to think CLEAR!.
              Perhaps you are now in a lot of problems or are hurt bad or in bitterness or anger or all but your attitude now isn't helping you, it will just make matters worse. Don't take this as an insult this is not this is an advice. I don't claim I know you but this is how I perceived you. We are not out to get you.

              Fair enough, you know I would have stopped being Christian if I looked at other Christians in my life. Fixate your view on Christ.
                                <br><br>
               You mentioned lack of biblical reference and such and such and yes I know that many Christian can't argue very well and jumped to anger and resentment fast. Or did you mean that our life is lacking reference to the bible? Like I said don't fixate your eyes on Christians but on Christ. I too once expect how my fellow Christian should react or to help me and etc and I've realized that many are simply lacking the faith.....to believe in what the bible has to say to believe in God's words to believe in God's promises. But you can't really blame them or can you? These people most of them do not even know the God whom  they worship, the world is too real to them and they fixate their eyes on this 'real' world and with almost no personal experience of God they lack the faith to truly believe what is written and probably even have doubts on God.
                                <br><br>
              Having said that there are good Christians...though these are usually harder to come by.
                                <br><br>
              What is it that you found that the Christians are lacking reference to the bible or any scholar or authority?
                                <br><br>
              What do you mean by authority most member of the church obey and believe in the doctrine of their own church. State authority has nothing to do with the church authority. At least that's the ideal.
                                <br><br>
              So please tell me you could try PMing me. I would be more than happy to entertain your discussion. Or make another thread.

                                                  <p>so my point is it's not the religion but the person who practice
                                                  that religion that matters.</p>
                                                  <p>all religions teach their followers to do good but it's up to
                                                  the follower to do the good or not. not the religion.</p>

              I was almost hit by car twice in no more than a month in Singapore at one time, I was almost killed in Singapore, starved for 3 days in NUH, purposely defamed schizophrenic abused and tortured psychologically for years, sent a fake letter from my invisible doctor well he must have been invisible that I was fit again to resume study in Singapore and deprived of fair academic appraisal in my own country at least in the least  6 semesters, received 5 death threats PMs from various forums I visit. And all this time I've been refusing medication to prove false the defamation by simply living my life.

              David Widjaja was killed and now those in authority refuse to investigate it and even looked as if they are trying to cover it.
