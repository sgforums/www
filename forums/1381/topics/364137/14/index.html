              <p>I believe there is only 1 God , Jesus.</p>
              <p>All others are lies , old old long lived lies.</p>
              <p>All other forces out there are fallen angels, or angels of
              God.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>            
              He is a loving God, he loves everyone and died for the world for
              our sins.</p>
              <p>As for the trinity, I honestly dont understand it clearly, if he
              is the son of God or God himself, so there is Mystery, but I really
              feel his Holy spirit when I speak to Jesus,</p>
              <p>Theirs Power in the name of Jesus and I believe we must only
              call on the name of Jesus, he is the way , the truth and the life,
              no one can go to the father but by him, he said this, in a verse
              and I can even find this verse if anyone wants me to.I dont
              remember where it is but I can google search it.</p>

              <p>another misguided sheep..truly i say to you..even your pastor cannot answer trinity to you in clear details..</p>
              <p>Jesus never claim to be God..he was always in subjection to the Father..will God subject himself to someone else?? also..God is not a God of confusion..would he give his word to us in such a confusing mystical doctrine??</p>
              <p>surely only the good ol son will know the ways of his father..so it is therefore true to acknowledge that only through Jesus can we approach God. Jesus is our intercessor.</p>

              No you're the misguided sheep. God wants us to put faith in Jesus as our savior.
                 God never wants us to worship anybody else including Moses and all the other prophets but God wants us to put our faith in Jesus and that actually pleases God.
                                                                    <br><br>
                                Though baptized since baby as a Christian(Catholic) I never thought of Jesus as being Godly in the true sense that He was no mere man or prophets. Sure He was the Son of God to me but I still placed Jesus 2nd in my heart as my Lord God took the first place.
                                                                    <br><br>
              That all changed when I was given a sight of Christ after God gave me love for Christ in such intensity that I would do anything for Christ(Yes for me it took God's initiative so that I could love my Savior). His face shines so much light that His whole figure was enveloped by the light. I couldn't see past the light though I really wanted to 'just' to see Christ face. The light was like no other it was much brighter more than anything. Immense is a not a word enough to describe it, the light was getting much more immense/intense in the direction of His face so much so that the closer you looked in the direction of His face the much more intense the light would become. Christ is not only alive but He is glorified in heaven and took a glorified body. God, the Father is actually pleased with anyone who put his faith in His son our savior and judging from what I saw I can say with my mouth that Christ IS GOD.

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm no saint but I cannot deny what I saw. And I still want to see Jesus face! His true face and not some man made picture. I don't care that I died upon looking His face as I believe I would not die had I looked into His face. I would probably die physically but I don't think I would descend to the world of the dead. In other words I would live on. And I would not have to spend 'eternity' losing my memory and losing track of time. That would be a waste of valuable living time. Spare me the rest give me life immediately! Some chosen people get power, unimaginable power that is eternal power as their reward. Those are very lucky people. I can only dream to get that. Completely out of my league.<br><br></div>
