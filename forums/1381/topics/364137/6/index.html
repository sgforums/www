              <p>i am juz answering noah base on his definition...the term backsliding is actually debatable cos diff christians have slightly differing definitions for it...but wadever it is, its referring to a loss in faith n commitment towards church/God...whether the person is stil going heaven or not is another issue which i suggest not going into here...</p>

              Thanks for sharing it. I saw Christ in a vision while being fully awake. It was clear in fact it affected my physical eyes as both were hurt when I forced to see His face which was shining a white light which enveloped His whole figure. I wanted to see Jesus face. I want to know what He really looks like. All we have is pictures man made pictures...I still want to see Jesus face even now 17 years later.

              Which gift of the holy spirit that you receive?

              Sometimes I feel that I haven't given my best to live the life as I should as a Christian.
