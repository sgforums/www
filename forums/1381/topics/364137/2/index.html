              <p>haha yes it's fun to read actually, I like reading about Buddism especially, they have good points on wisdom I think.</p>
              <p> Also world History, learning the religions , helps learn the cultures, wich asia is my favorite to study.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> I like reading the myths also, theres a whole universe out there anything can be possible and exist but they are not God I belief, even Santa is out there somewhere lol and on mars or something he might fly his raindeer, who knows.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Jesus is Lord I believe , also open minded that  anything could exist since I believe God is intellegent and he also  has a sense of humor.</p>

              <p>To make it short</p>
              <p>He's been my friend my whole life, everytime crises happened, I felt his loving presence, my mom took me to church when I was very little 3, while she went thru her divorce.</p>
              <p>   I have learned how loving Jesus is and its not just knowing or reading or hearing, but he even sent his spirit and If recieved, you can feel his spirit, you can feel this love,you can feel the truth, it's a peace that passes all understanding ,</p>
              <p>   I put it to the test at a young age of 11, when I yet not recieved, but still questioned just like anyone else.</p>
              <p> Iv been thru sadness also in life and probably have more to come, he's my strength and hope, when the storm hits,he's my rock I stand on.</p>
              <p>When storms hit in life , we cry for love loss thru death ,divorce,etc</p>

              <p>Hmm wun it be good to have other ppl PoV?</p>
              <p>For example, "Does that mean that the god in other
                                          religion doesn't exist?"</p>
              <p>Oh, one more question .. In your reply "To a Christian point
                  of view there is no God other than God." .. Does it apply to all and which religion r u referrin to, may i ask.</p>

              <p>Thanks<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"><br>yes true,</p>
              <p> we are all at different growth levels,some may appear to be at higher level growth than many but are not.I think its great to stay humble and be real.</p>
              <p>       I also think eventually it is good to when we are ready and know what his calling is to serve him,</p>
              <p>Its great that many work hard to keep the doors of the church open for anyone who would like to come and learn how to recieve him.</p>
              <p>  But some of us cant maybe they are in a country that has no church and they could be killed for it, or maybe they are not yet ready and have'nt found a church yet.</p>
              <p> everyone and anyone who gos , helps keep his chuches open and going and every little voice or clap added to the praise of worshipping him, every single one counts,because if every clap , every voice disappears, there would be no church, every single one of us is important, to his church.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>              It is true that when 2 or 3 are gathered in his name that he is in the midst of them, the spirit can be felt very strong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> But most important, is receiving him in a personal relationship.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> thou, it is good to announce publicly that we have done this someday to share with others that Jesus is my friend, because if we are ashamed to announce him in our lives to others, then he said he would be ashamed to announce us to his father.</p>
              <p>and eventually we must try to reach the lost and go out of our prayer closet to try to reach the lost, we could start with our families is a great challenge and friends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>        The Bible also describes how when we first come to him we are like babies and would need gentle milk and that is when we start with a persoanl relationship with Jesus christ and then as we grow, we need to take on meat, spiritual meat and go after the lost.</p>
              <p>       I believe also, but yeah I think many disagree and can be judging to others, who are at different growth periods of there relationship with him, I admit that Im not really a full grown christian, Iv yet to overcome my own obsticals, yet have to grow also, but he loves us and understands where we are, he even said, he gos after 1 lost sheep .</p>
              <p>  Im at this level now to where I want to serve him and go to church more often, but dont go every Sunday and I even have personal matters to work on , just like anyone else, but I believe we can go to him just as we are and his love will shower us and wash us and just like a plant, the more we stay planted in the relationship with him the more we will grow and bare fruit.</p>
