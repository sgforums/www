They argue for the sake of arguing. They are not reasonable and logical, they feed on their own emotion and try to make others feel as miserable as themselves.

              To entertain one is to make yourself as low as them.

              Just feel sorry for them and pray for them if you like but never entertain them as long as they haven't learned common sense. They are just animals as now.

                                Unker, it is because there are so many nutcase christian fanatics
                                out there who cannot stop posting nonsense that religion is better
                                than science. Look at the topic on homosexuality, the fanatics post
                                their views and run and hide behind religion.</p>

              No it's because the PAP hates religion. They want people to submit only to them. They want to control religion and want them to be considered even above God.
