              <p>Victims of clerical sex abuse are furious with Pope Benedict's claim that paedophilia wasn't considered an “absolute evil”.</p>
              <p>In his Christmas address to cardinals and officials, Pope Benedict XVI also claimed that child pornography was 
                increasingly considered “normal” by society.</p>
              <p>“It was maintained — even within the realm of Catholic theology — that there 
                is no such thing as evil in itself or good in itself. There is only a 
                ‘better than' and a ‘worse than'. Nothing is good or bad in itself.”</p>
              <p>Asking how abuse exploded within the Church, the Pontiff called on senior 
                clerics “to repair as much as possible the injustices that occurred” and to 
                help victims heal through a ''better presentation of the Christian message''.</p>
              <p>###   The latest controversy comes as German magazine Der Spiegel continues to 
                investigate the Pope's role in allowing known paedophile priests to work 
                with children since the early 1980s.</p>

              <p>Pope spreads blame for church's humiliating record on child abuse by priests <br>Barney Zwartz <br>December 22, 2010<br><br>AN UNIMAGINABLE number of child sex-abuse reports this year was a humiliation the church must accept as an exhortation to truth and renewal, Pope Benedict XVI has said.<br><br>The Pope used his annual speech to Rome's cardinals and bishops to urge the church to reflect on how it let the abuse happen.

But nor could he be silent about ''the context of these times''.<br><br><strong>''There is a market in child pornography that seems in some way to be considered more and more normal by society,'' he said on Monday. ''The psychological destruction of children, in which human persons are reduced to articles of merchandise, is a terrifying sign of the times.''</strong><br><br>He also said he heard from bishop after bishop in developing countries how sex tourism threatened an entire generation, while the problem of drugs was extending ''its octopus tentacles around the entire world''.<br><br><strong>He criticised moral relativism from the 1970s that discarded absolutes, leaving only a ''better than'' and ''worse than''. ''Morality is replaced by a calculus of consequences, and in the process it ceases to exist.''<br><br>The Pope was pessimistic about the future, saying: ''For all its new hopes and possibilities, our world is at the same time troubled by the sense that moral consensus is collapsing, consensus without which juridical and political structures cannot function.''</strong><br><br>A Catholic ethicist, Nicholas Tonti-Filippini, said the Pope's use of the 12th-century saint Hildegard's vision of the church as a battered woman, her garments rent and torn by priests' sins, was a powerful metaphor for the church's suffering caused by paedophile priests. <strong>He said the Pope could not blame secular culture, because the culture did not stoop so low as to advocate abusing children, but he was right to criticise situational ethics because child abuse was always an absolute wrong and never justifiable.</strong><br><br>Victims' advocates were sceptical yesterday.

              <p>    The next pope according to some prophecy is supposed to be the last pope and Pope Benedict is very old. Coincidentally I have heard and read that Obama is supposed jto be the last president of the USA. I however do not believe everything I read and hear however.....it is an interesting point. We will soon see whatever the truth may be.2012 isn't that far away and I highly doubt the world will end however I do think something will happen. If nothing happens then the whole world will be feeling like morons</p>

              <p><br>  Oh yes, I know this topic probably far better than you do and I am not disagreeing with you on anything you wrote above.  I had a chance to meet the top jesuit in Asia once but I declined. He is far to smart,far to powerful,has easy access to all info and I am sure that there is so much about them that even i don't know yet. You have to have a PHD to be a jesuit by the way. These guys are very smart . I think that they understand the spiritual realm to the highest degree as well.</p>
