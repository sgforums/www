              <p>Matthew 25 ..................... </p>
              <p>Jesus did not just give money, in fact, He gave people a way to
              get money for themselves. He healed the sick, injured, handicapped,
              unclean, demonized, the best part.. even the dead.. allowing them
              to work for their own keep.  But then, the question stands,
              what is God's will?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The critial point in realtion to what I said in MT 25 is really that fact that Jesus said that if you show love to one of your brothers and sisters, you have shown love to God.</p>
              <p>"Whoever fails to love does not know God, because God is love."
                                      (1Jn 4:8)</p>
              <p>I like to quote Paul when he sum it up as that his teaching is all about faith, hope and love and nothing greater than love.</p>
              <p>All these missions and visit to homes etc....and giving money are good. The point I want to bring to your attention is such acts are adhoc (although giving money can be on a long term basis - I agreed) basis....and secular organisations and other faith are also doing so....</p>
              <p>Where can you visit if no one start, raise funds and run such places in the first place? How about others who are still out there and have no found help? I know many Churches with ministries reaching out within their neighbouhood to seek out those in need and provide them assistance. These are run by church volunteers....i.e. no $$$.</p>
              <p>Is it not Jesus's teaching (backed by all his actions) that he is reaching to the poor and needy and helping them?</p>
              <p>Did he not ask in the last judgement if we have feed Him when he is hungry? Clothed Him when He is naked, visit Him when He is in prison etc?</p>
              <p>Or did he tell us to collecct money and start investing to make more money......make more money for what? To donate a token 10% and mostly more and keep 90% (mostly less) for ourselves?</p>
              <p>So the question what is God's will is best answered by yourself. What do you think He want His followers to do? I think He spelt it out clearly in His 2 commandments for His followers.</p>
              <p>And His true disciples are those who hear His words and act on it and to live their lives as true Christians and be a
                                      light to the world and messengers of Christ. All Christians are told to spread the Gospel and that is to spread God's Love and Charity to His people.</p>

              <p>A "church" setting up a commercial company to make money using funds raised from the church? And there is only 1 shareholder - the "church"?

              <p>You made a strong implcations saying that "If any other pastor preaches the
                                      unadulterated Gospel, I too will support him.." which can be seens as saying churches other than ncc are preaching "adultered Gospel".</p>
              <p>Yet, there is no way you can prove your claim that ncc is preaching "unadulterated Gospel".....</p>
              <p>The word of God never changes and His commandent remains. It is people whose interpretation corrupt the bible. The bible is really about God's love for us and how we should spread the love.....not some complicated doctrines etc...</p>
              <p>Those that preach (imo) "unadulterated Gospel" are those that not just preach about God's love but also take actions to follow His commandments to spread the love and reach out to those in need.</p>
              <p>Such actions are only possible when guided by the Holy Spirits and with Christ living in oneself.</p>
              <p>If going by what you said above to judge a church, ncc is far too small compared with the main streams churches and far leeser success stories to tell. Many other faith have equally outstanding following and success.....</p>

              <p>First of all, I do not represent NCC in any capacity..  I
              am simply a student who attends NCC..  All posts here are from
              my own personal opinion...  I am not a leader(yet), i only
              serve as lightsman for the Youth Ministry. All mistakes are my own.
              NCC does not post on forums, all correspondences should take place
              in the form of a written letter either to the press, or through a
              public announcement on the website or during services..  So
              asking where does NCC stand is not the right question im afraid..
              haha..  It should be, where do I stand..  Oh and even
              though my nick is SPDCP, i also do not represent Singapore Poly
              Dip. Chem Process as a spokesman...  xD</p>
              <p>Now, let me try to answer you from the bottom up.. i think its
              gonna be a really long post...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Matthew 25 verses 1 to 13 is actually prophesying that when
              Jesus returns, half the Jews will be ready, while the other half
              will be ready after the tribulation. Why? Because the 10 virgins
              are not the brides, but the bridesmaids..  The church is
              referred to as the Bride of Christ, who is according to the custom,
              already inside waiting for the groom to arrive.. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Verses 14 to 30 is about managing God's money. Here, it states
              that the servants who invested the masters money were praised,
              while the one who hid it away, was reprimanded for it.. the master
              also said, even if you did not invest, at the very least, put it in
              the bank..   Investing is praised, banking it is bare
              minimum...    The One North building is not just a
              place for us to congregate, but also serves the dual purpose of
              having invested the Lord's money, all of which will go into the
              church, and not the pockets of the pastors. They hold the shares
              only on behalf of the church.  They are not allowed to touch
              any of the money..  All of it is signed in New Creation
              Church's name, not Pastor Prince..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The pastors salaries are decided by the board of renumeration
              and through specific offerings..  everything is taxed and
              documented..</p>
              <p>The remaining verses are for Christians to rejoice by.. 
              when they would receive their rewards for taking on His
              righteousness and not their own...  Those who did not depend
              on their righteousness, were accepted. Those who did, were
              not.. </p>
              <p>Jesus did not just give money, in fact, He gave people a way to
              get money for themselves. He healed the sick, injured, handicapped,
              unclean, demonized, the best part.. even the dead.. allowing them
              to work for their own keep.  But then, the question stands,
              what is God's will?</p>
              <p>"Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away
              the first, that he may establish the second" -Hebrews 10:9</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hebrews 10:9 also answers this question...  There, it says
              that the first must first be taken away, so that the second may be
              established...  I may use this analogy: You cannot recontract
              your mobile line, until the first one is removed.  If you do,
              it is unlawful. God must go by His own rules. If He wants to
              establish a New Covenant, the Old must first be settled with. And
              it can only be settled with a payment, that none of us can
              pay. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, i want to address this question :</p>
              <p>I wonder why you think that we do not, or are currently not
              participating in such things? Just this monday, we sent a a team to
              Thailand on mission. End of October, the Poly Cluster are going to
              a Home for Children with Cerebral Palsy to heal and to bless them
              with company. 10% minimum goes out to support various charities and
              causes. Its not that we are not doing such things, but that we are
              not broadcasting it to the world to hear..  Why? Its none of
              the worlds business , thats first.. second, we are not glorifying
              ourselves... A man who shouts : HEY! I DONATED $100000 compared to
              the one who gives $100000 in silence, you can see if they desire
              approval from man or not..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All the tithes immediately go into the Church's bank account,
              not Ps Princes... Every withdrawal must be documented and taxed
              where applicable... As for the "many people around the world"
              argument... they sound just like Judas Iscariot..  </p>
              <p><sup>"4</sup>But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot,
              who was later to betray him, objected, <sup>5</sup>"Why
              wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was
              worth a year's wages."</p>
              <p>What was Jesus answer? in Verse 7:   <sup>7</sup>"Leave her alone."  Likewise I say to those critics,
              Leave us alone..  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Areas that are zoned for religious purposes are limited to only
              30 year terms.. not 99 or 999...  also, you are right... One
              North is NOT a church..  it merely is a place where the church
              congregates..  and we have already measured the costs.. you
              dont pump $550 million into a project without first considering all
              other options... </p>
              <p>You are right! Rock is a commercial company..  It was
              created to make money...  If Rock does not make money, then it
              is a loser company.. Thank God it is making money...  As for
              shareholders... there is only 1 shareholder... NCC...   So
              Rock is seeking monetary returns so that the church is richer...
              not the pastor..</p>
              <p>Jesus did teach on tithing...  I am sure everyone has read
              Luke 15..  I hope none has thought that it is all about the
              same thing..  There is no insignificant detail in the
              Bible.. </p>
              <p>In the first parable in luke 15, Jesus talks about the lost
              sheep. Instantly you can identify the lost sheep to be the church.
              When Jesus found the church, he left everything else to go save
              that church... </p>
              <p>the second parable, is no longer about the shepherd. it is a
              woman. The church is also depicted as a woman.  A woman who
              has lost 1 silver coin out of 10...  what is 1/10 of the
              church's money?  The tithe!   Jesus says, if the
              church has lost the tithe, she should light a lamp, literally
              meaning obtain wisdom/revelation, and search the house for the
              tithe.. and upon finding it, rejoices..</p>
              <p>The last one we all know the famous prodigal son, The Father,
              finding the lost son...</p>
              <p>So Jesus did in fact teach about tithing..  in fact, he
              taught more on money than on prayer.. <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica;">16 out of Christ's 38 parables deal
              with money...</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please..  this is common sense.. if not, then go to any
              bookstore and ask if the authors decide or the bookstore
              decides..  Also, to say that "NO" bookstore would put it in
              the right place is a fallacy..  how many out of 100 have you
              actually gone to check? i believe all of us have better things to
              do with our time..   I, for one, have always seen it in
              its proper place in Borders, Kinokuniya, MPH, Times, and
              Popular..  at least, the ones that i have been to anyway..</p>
              <p>God says that light was created before the Sun. So that means if
              i nuke the sun into dust, there would still be light..  
              Anyone can prove it? No? Then are you calling God a liar?</p>
              <p>Or</p>
              <p>I can say that i was late because i could not find my keys for
              half an hour... but in actual fact, i was watching TV...  no
              one was at home besides me..  Will you believe me even without
              proof?   simple logic..  mrs xxx can rumor about my
              magnificent key losing abilities..  but no proof to show that
              i was actually watching tv.. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course, the only one who is perfectly right shall be judge
              over who is right..  and apart from the Holy Spirit, who else
              can say that they are never wrong?  Nobody will know the word
              of God? What you call the Bible?  Like i said earlier, the way
              the shepherd leads the flock will be reflected in their growth.. if
              you see many leaders rising up, many sucessful people being grown,
              many lives getting changed for the better, i'd say that the food
              there is good... it is a good testimony... </p>
              <p>I hope i did not sound too harsh or curt or
              condescending..  If i did i apologize... looking forward to
              your comments...</p>

              <p>I have no wish to go intyo a debate with you on bible verses especailly those with regards to tithes. There are already threads started on that and too many things have been said. So no point repeating.</p>
              <p>I know you are young and perhaps, you should keep an open mind and read around....other denominations teaching, those links I gave you earlier as well as other blogs by priests, pastors and Christians like yourself.</p>
              <p>Majority of the mainstream chruches do not teach tithing (and no tithing does not mean no giving) and certainly do not do so like the mega churches do. Jesus has never said we must tithe but give what we can afford like the old lady. And these churches (depite not teaching tithing) has survived much longer and continue to prosper and turning out many successful people.</p>
              <p>Hope you do keep an open mind and search for the truth about Christ's teaching.</p>

              <p><strong>I like to quote Paul when he sum it up as that his teaching is
                                      all about faith, hope and love and nothing greater than love.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>All these missions and visit to homes etc....and giving money
                                      are good. The point I want to bring to your attention is such acts
                                      are adhoc (although giving money can be on a long term basis - I

                                      and provide them assistance. These are run by church

              <p>Now, I agree with you wholly..   Its just that, like i said before, we are doing those things.. We always have been doing those things and we have no plans to stop. I applaud ministers who are able to reach out without the use of money, most of our reaching out also does not involve too much money if possible..    But its times when you want to reach out, but have no money to do it.. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For example,Ms XXX needs an urgent surgery... what good will sending volunteers who can only watch and have no ability to help? </p>

              <p>To provide aid to other countries..  you definitely need money to send the supplies overseas.. you need to take caution of corrupt officials.. you need to bypass certain laws in order to send aid to some minorities.. especially ones that the governement dont like...</p>

              <p>Eh, that was actually a disclaimer i decided to put infront

              for example, Ps Judah Smith from Seattle,WA, Brian Houston from

              <p>You still did not get my point....i.e. don't say it is not true when in fact you don't even know......nothing to do with disclaimer etc...that's one of the 2 reasons I repsond.</p>
              <p>Second reason is about ""unadulterated Gospel" which you retracted but the fact remained that you have no way to know which is ""unadulterated Gospel" and ncc might just be the "adulterated" one - who knows......</p>
              <p>But as you agreed with my views on which is "unadulterated Gospel" and claimed that ncc is doing so, I am happy. I am sure that ncc preached that but do they do it? That's where my doubts lies....</p>

              <p>Now, I agree with you wholly..   Its just that, like i
              said before, we are doing those things.. We always have been doing
              those things and we have no plans to stop. I applaud ministers who
              are able to reach out without the use of money, most of our
              reaching out also does not involve too much money if
              possible..    But its times when you want to reach
              out, but have no money to do it.. </p>
              <p>For example,Ms XXX needs an urgent surgery... what good will
              sending volunteers who can only watch and have no ability to
              help? </p>
              <p>Ms XXX: Help me!</p>
              <p>Volunteer: We love you!</p>
              <p>Ms XXX : help me!!</p>
              <p>Volunteer: God Loves you!</p>
              <p>Ms XXX: just go home...  you cant do anything..</p>
              <p>To provide aid to other countries..  you definitely need
              money to send the supplies overseas.. you need to take caution of
              corrupt officials.. you need to bypass certain laws in order to
              send aid to some minorities.. especially ones that the governement
              dont like...</p>
              <p>Like i mentioned, you need money to buy food and
              clothing..  Look, i understand that you are for reaching out,
              so am I, therefore we are on the same page   =)  
              Different groups have different methods, some controvesial, some
              traditional.. what matters is help is going out to those who need
              it..</p>
              <p>He did teach both... we cannot take one and ignore the
              other..  I have already elaborated on how He taught on the
              subject...</p>

              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Actually, I failed to see what has been done ......cause what is done is bare minimal imo as I mentioned, many others do that.</p>
              <p>I have not heard or know that ncc is providing shelters, homes or anything to help those who need them....</p>
              <p>For Ms XXX in your example, if people from my Church knows about it, she will have a surgery regardless if she has money cause there are hospitals we run that we can help. There are funds we set aside to help such people and we can always raise funds within the Church to help her.....</p>
              <p>The good of sending volunteer is to seek out such people and provide the necessary help that we can NOT WAIT FOR HER TO COME ........if we can't, we can still direct them to place which can help them...if there's a will, there's a way.</p>
              <p>And no, we don't tell Ms XXX that God loves her......we proved it to her by what we do for her.</p>
              <p>If Ms XXX end up with ncc, then die liao........she will be asked, you got money to pay tithe? If got, pay and wait for return.....if not, sorry, we cannot help cause need to use our money to make more money.....so the church grow richer and richer (but not the pastor hor...) and let the money rot like what Jesus said in  MT6:19 "where moth and woodworm destroy them and thieves can break in and steal"</p>
              <p>Is that what you intend to tell me when you say what's the point of sending volunteer?</p>
              <p>Of course money is needed and since when did I said it was not?</p>
              <p>I know you are trying to tell me that ncc do help....I never said that they do not.</p>
              <p>It is what the church does wholeheartedly that matters and not say "see we got do what!!".....</p>
              <p>The point is, the focus of the Church should be soley to preach and do
              what Jesus teaches us as you have agreed - Love and Charity. Not making money.....</p>
              <p>So many churches do not set up company to make money (because that's not the role of a church) and no teaching of tithes....yet they continue to exist, prosper and are able to build schools, shelters, home, hospice and run them for many years....</p>
              <p>That's God's grace and providence cause they do God's will of spreading love and charity.</p>
              <p>Only worry about survival when you don't ahve faith in God's promise like what Jesus said in MT6:19-34.</p>
              <p>And sorry, Jesus do not teach both - certainly never asking His church and followers to colelcct tithes and invest to make more money....and more money for what?</p>
              <p>Like I said earlier, no point in debating what the verses means as all warp version of preaching is "supported by the bible" because of twisted interpretation. This again lead me to ask, if you are sick, will you go to a qualified and trained doctor? For me personally, I will not put my eteranl life issue at stake by following untrained pastors....just my personal opinion.</p>

              <p>Many other churches have a much bigger congregation that ncc and how you think they cope with that?</p>
              <p>I don't think that there is a need for a place to house everyone at 1 go.....service can be held at different time slots.....</p>
              <p>Having multiple building means reaching out to people of different areas, making it easier for people to attend services, having a building in an areas to cater to people living in that vicinity....administering help to the needy and spreading God's love at the same time.....it is not that bad an idea...</p>
              <p>Yes, then the church will be poorer perhaps, but so what?</p>
              <p>Important thing is God's will is not seen to be done but id done because it is in everyone's heart to reach out and help.</p>
              <p>Who cares how long more the world will last? Who even care how long more we are going to live on this earth? But when we are here and since we professed to eb followers of Christ, we shall do His will to our best ability.</p>

              <p>One north is not solely used for worship..  In fact, Rock Productions rents out the Audi to NCC, and on days where NCC is not using it, it is free for everyone else.. </p>
              <p>On a personal opinion, i think the thing we did was to use a loophole
                  in the law to allow us to get a building of our own that meets our
                  need.. </p>
              <p>NCC has to pay Rock for using the Audi. Rock must pay taxes on rent received.  Although Rock is owned by NCC,  Rock cannot just transfer the money back to NCC as and when it feels like, since they are still seperate entities... </p>

              <p>That is a terrible lie, dont ever believe it if someone tells
                  you that...   We have always said, only tithe if you have
                  a revelation..  no revelation, dont tithe..  If this is
                  not your church, dont tithe to us...  if you are not employed,
                  dont tithe...   if you dont want to tithe, dont
                  tithe..</p>
              <p>we do NOT check individual tithing records apart from several
                  occasions,since it is between you and God...  those special
                  occasions are 1) you are being considered for leadership, we have
                  no desire for leaders who are God-robbers.. and 2) if you are to be
                  given voting <em>privileges since if your gonna help in making a
                  major decision, some indication that you are a regular member is
                  required</em>...</p>
              <p>If you dont want to be in the church records, a simple letter
                  will suffice, if not, then drop in the envelope without your i/c
                  number.. </p>
              <p>Again, let us look at the verse in its context... the verses
                  that follow are:  <sup>20</sup> <span>Store your
                  treasures in heaven, where moths and rust cannot destroy, and
                  thieves do not break in and steal.</span> <sup>21</sup> <span>Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart
                  will also be.</span></p>

              <p>It is equally a terrible lie that you try to paint with a volunteer reaching out to the needy because you try to justify why ncc is not doing it.</p>
              <p>Like I said before, tithing is not taught by Jesus and many main stream churches do not teach them. Certainly, only prosperity gospel preaching mega churches do so and rasied many eyebrows cause they way the money is spend. Don't think that mega churches is super rich cause there are churches that are richer despite no tithing being taught ......you find that out yourself....yet they do not create the same hooha because of the way the funds are used.</p>
              <p>My understaning is JP preached only 4 times about tithing in the past years. IMO, that's 4 times too much. I also know that it is at cg level that this is preached (cause I have friend in ncc who are asking me to go) and to come and think of it, tithing (the way being taught at mega churches) is like buying 4D or toto......someone will win big but most remained poor....the one who got rich? God blessings....the one who won nothing, have faith and continue to buy.....your day may just come. At the end, it is the company running it that is assured of winning and thus can pay staff well.......Sure, they also organised trips to visit the less fortunate and give to charity.....</p>
              <p>So why bother in wanting more and more riches when you don't even know why there is a need for it......</p>

              <p>People from many other faith experienced the same thing as you do in ncc so I don't see any difference......</p>
              <p>In actual fact, though you said you will not, you have already been "blinded". It is like you will consult any one who can tell you something they read from medial journal......to your liking even if you know (or not sure) if he is trained doctor.</p>

              <p>Hmmm...now it seems like you take away the consideration 0f 30 years cap........and I take it you don't know it as a fact.</p>
              <p>By the way, I dont think chc is the largest......and if you read the other threads, you will read that Catholics is the largest with more than 300,000 and many more demoninations have more than 20,000 people.</p>
              <p>Yet, they don't need to build something like one north......and the same goes for the other faith....like the Muslims for example.</p>
              <p>So, again another lame excuse....</p>
              <p>And what about considering the advantages of many churches building scattered around the island to help everyone that I mentioned earlier? Not just Christian Churches do that, other faith too.....maybe because making money is not their main agenda? Perhaps...</p>

              <p>You should not put a secular profit making company as comparison with a church. Again, I am not sure if Taka is listed on the stock exchange here (maybe in Japan) and you may like to know listed company do reveal their top men salaries and bonuse.</p>
              <p>Maybe, ncc can learn from the government with regards to that. There are some valid points that noahnoah which is worth considering......does a pastor need a conti car and semi-d? I believed that the apostles do not and in fact preached living simply......</p>
              <p>I have no problems with pastor getting paid...in fact well paid. But how much is well paid? I believe most churches do pay their pastor well.....enough for them to ensure that their family live well.....not luxury..... Maybe using average Singaporean household as a guide is better in this sense...imo.</p>
              <p>Like I said....think.......why they do not reveal to the congregation on how the borad decide to pay?</p>
              <p>It is strange that you have no desire to know how it is done ? Why not you as an ncc member asked and then show the reply to us?</p>

              <p>Is not the Father's business the church?  If not, then why
                  would He send Jesus to us? </p>
              <p>We dont NEED to make more money, rather, we just want to be good
                  stewards of it...  and investing it is the proper duty of a
                  steward, as mentioned in Jesus's Parable of the talents of
                  gold...  It has already exceeded our expectations many times
                  over...   we passed the enough mark long ago... now, we
                  are doing it to see God's promises come true, the ones where He
                  says " Test me now in this, and see if I will not bless you so much
                  as there will not be enough room to hold it!"  ... as a
                  testimony to others</p>
              <p>One north is not solely used for worship..  In fact, Rock
                  Productions rents out the Audi to NCC, and on days where NCC is not
                  using it, it is free for everyone else.. </p>
              <p><strong>On a personal opinion, i think the thing <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">we did was to use a
                  loophole in the law</span></span> to allow us to get a building of our own that
                  meets our need.. </strong></p>
              <p>NCC has to pay Rock for using the Audi. Rock must pay taxes on
                  rent received.  Although Rock is owned by NCC,  Rock
                  cannot just transfer the money back to NCC as and when it feels
                  like, since they are still seperate entities... </p>
              <p>I think somewhere along the line you have thought i'm missing
                  the point again but i'm just expaining the way these things
                  work..  if you know more than me, teach me..  Although
                  business law is really one of the hardest to explain... 
                  trying not to get confused myself..</p>
              <p>We have also repeated time and again that One North is not a
                  place of worship.. it is a civic and cultural zone with retail
                  options..     and we do not raise funds by
                  claiming what it is not..    the people just gave
                  even when we announced the truth publicly... </p>

                  loophole in the law</span></span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">" I leave it up to you to think and decide if that's a right thing to do.</span></span></p>
              <p>(that's the point about one-north and rock.....not if that's a church...it's not and that's a fact we all know).</p>
              <p>Another point, loop hole to do what? I know you argue about the necessity of a place but in earlier parts, I think I have shown you why this may not be necessary the best solution (if we take away making money consideration) and perhaps, other ways are much better in terms of serving the people of God.....IMO, it is soley making money that was the concern.....</p>
              <p>Does that have anything to do when the board sits to decide on pay issues?</p>
              <p>God send Jesus to save us.....not make money! And the business of the Church is to spread the Good News and not make money!</p>
              <p>I have already explained imo the best way to be the light and messenger of Christ (which I think you agreed....if I do not mistaken). And the Church that preach the true gospel should do just that.</p>

              then....especially if you are not sure if JP has proper training......</p>
              <p>Like
              I said in the earlier part, the way to know if true gospels are
              preached is not just what is being preached....but also what is being
              done. And done in accordance to the teaching of our saviour Jesus
              Christ.....</p>
              <p>You said:</p>
              <p><strong>"Now, our heart is for the people, and for the things of God.
                                      Otherwise we would not be preaching Faith, Hope and Love week after
                                      week... In any case, this verse was more a personal
                                      instruction.  If a man is willing to honor God with his tithe,
                                      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">then money does not have a hold on him</span>, and his heart is for God. A
                                      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">man who keeps every cent for himself is evidently storing up
                                      treasure for himself</span>.."</strong></p>
              <p>and that's exactly why Churches went out to help and not keep 90% for themselves and make more money....and more money for what?....and even though it already exceed their target many times......and when is it going to stop? Greed has no ending.....perhaps.</p>
              <p>No thithing does not mean not giving (as I said before) and 10% tithing is not necessary......and it should not be taught as God's way to "return" to you and prosper you cause God enrich everyone and prosper everyone in His own way and standard.</p>
