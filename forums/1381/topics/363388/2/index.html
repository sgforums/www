              <p>^not true. The only thing that NCC preaches about consistently is the amazing grace of God, and because of God's grace, He blesses us with prosperity and successes. When you touch the grace of God, every blessing just flows abuntdantly into your life.</p>
              <p>I love Pastor Prince and his teachings. I have been so blessed by him. He is truly a man of God, a gift from God to us. I never knew how much Jesus loves me until I heard the teachings by Pastor Prince. Its sad that people take his words out of context and twist them according to ther own understanding and not according to God's Word. People are always cynical when it comes to megachurches like NCC, CHC etc. Its true that they are extremely blessed financially, but its also true that they also use these finances to bless others, but people love to see the negative in others, never the good. I am well aware of all the critiques that come against Pastor Prince, but it doesn't change the fact the I, along with many many other christians, regard him as our spiritual father.</p>

              <p>He looks good only cause his wife wants him to look that way..  His hair, dressing, etc etc, is only for his wife to see, not the church... since we not married to him...  =) </p>
              <p>as for that rumor, it is not true and its only polite not to carry on spreading it about...   If an outsider sees a christian spreading lies about another christian, what will they think?  Surely it is not a good way to make friends and get to know people I believe.. </p>

              <p>seek first the kingdom of God, then the forgiveness of one's sin.throw your faith onto God, putting him first and other things will follow in abundance yes..totally agree..thats how some churches uses this to twist its meaning..do most churches seek the kingdom of God first?do they even know what the bible teaches?</p>

I heard his book (Destined to reign), he even suggest that NT starts with Acts and that the 4 Gospels are considered OT....and his books are sold as motivation book and not religious book....why?</p>
              <p>Here's a link that you can read about the review of his book : <a href="http://szezeng.blogspot.com/2008/10/deeper-look-at-joseph-princes-destined.html">http://szezeng.blogspot.com/2008/10/deeper-look-at-joseph-princes-destined.html</a></p>
              <p>You are right that Jesus never turn away from anyone who need His help. In fact, He is always reaching out to the poor, needy, neglected and marginalised. He help regardless and it was His act of love that converts and it is His act of love that he showed Christians how one can live their faith - By loving one's neighbour. This is His commandents to Christians in NT and every of the 10 commandments can be replaced by this commandment - Love.</p>
              <p>I know people from ncc tells me that ncc give 10% of their collection to charities (where did bal 90% goes?) but is money everything? A lot of Churches are providing education, shelter, nursing homes, hospice and even hospital to do exactly what Jesus did - reaching out to the poor, needy, neglected and marginalised. And many of these Churches do not even teach tithing....which is another dubious point of contention. They still raise funds and got volunteers to do the work of God.</p>

              <p>That argument is unique only to ncc I suppose......while imo, it should start with the birth of Christ and begining of the salvation story. More important, it was Jesus's teaching and example that is what NT is about......while act is the starting era where His aposoltes spread the Gospel and teachings according to Christ (as spelt out in the 4 Gospels). NT Christians are followers of Christ isn't it?</p>
              <p>It seems strange why no bookstore would thinks his book shoulld be sold as religious book when it is written by a "famous pastor"........and that speaks volume...and with regards to "Prince does not decide where the bookstores put the

              <p>Churches who do not teach on tithing are robbing the people, and

              <p>the 90% that should remain is used to pay the pastors, the staff

              <p>More like Churches that teach tithing are robbing the people.......never had Jesus said we should tithe 10%....maybe you should read</p>

              <p>and you can google more to learn the truth about tithing. And how tithe is used or misused by some for personal wealth.....while there are many people around the world in need of help......so how does that matches up to the teaching of our Lord?</p>
              <p>Yes, we all need a place to worhsip and building a church is not a problem.....but one north is not a church.....as "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Rock Productions has provided a legal undertaking to JTC</strong></span> that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the venue will be managed strictly on a commercial basis </strong></span>and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>will not be converted into a religious facility</strong></span>"</p>
              <p>If truely a church is needed, they can get a freehold land and building which will cost them much lesser......</p>
              <p>I think above undertaking by Rock is quite clear that the huge investments on a leasehold place is really for commercial purposes seeking for monetary returns so that stake holder will get richer.....</p>

              <p>You are right that Jesus never turn away from anyone who need
                      His help. In fact, He is always reaching out to the poor, needy,
                      neglected and marginalised. He help regardless and it was His act
                      of love that converts and it is His act of love that he showed
                      Christians how one can live their faith - By loving one's
                      neighbour. This is His commandents to Christians in NT and every of
                      the 10 commandments can be replaced by this commandment - Love.</p>
              <p>I know people from ncc tells me that ncc give 10% of their
                      collection to charities (where did bal 90% goes?) but is money
                      everything? A lot of Churches are providing education, shelter,
                      nursing homes, hospice and even hospital to do exactly what Jesus
                      did - reaching out to the poor, needy, neglected and marginalised.
                      And many of these Churches do not even teach tithing....which is
                      another dubious point of contention. They still raise funds and got
                      volunteers to do the work of God.</p>

This is the way to spread God's love and let those in need know that there is <strong>love</strong> (from God) and give these people <strong>hope</strong>....and people who are touched by God will have <strong>faith</strong> and converts....and this is how true Christians who heard the Word of God will take actions to live their lives as Christians and be a light to the world and messengers of Christ.</p>
              <p>After all, Jesus said he is here to serve rather than be served. As His followers, don't you think we should do the same? I.E. to serve like Jesus?</p>

              <p>First of all, I do not represent NCC in any capacity..  I am simply a student who attends NCC..  All posts here are from my own personal opinion...  I am not a leader(yet), i only serve as lightsman for the Youth Ministry. All mistakes are my own. NCC does not post on forums, all correspondences should take place in the form of a written letter either to the press, or through a public announcement on the website or during services..  So asking where does NCC stand is not the right question im afraid.. haha..  It should be, where do I stand..  Oh and even though my nick is SPDCP, i also do not represent Singapore Poly Dip. Chem Process as a spokesman...  xD</p>
              <p>Now, let me try to answer you from the bottom up.. i think its gonna be a really long post...</p>

              <p>Matthew 25 verses 1 to 13 is actually prophesying that when Jesus returns, half the Jews will be ready, while the other half will be ready after the tribulation. Why? Because the  10 virgins are not the brides, but the bridesmaids..  The church is referred to as the Bride of Christ, who is according to the custom, already inside waiting for the groom to arrive.. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Verses 14 to 30 is about managing God's money. Here, it states that the servants who invested the masters money were praised, while the one who hid it away, was reprimanded for it.. the master also said, even if you did not invest, at the very least, put it in the bank..   Investing is praised, banking it is bare minimum...    The One North building is not just a place for us to congregate, but also serves the dual purpose of having invested the Lord's money, all of which will go into the church, and not the pockets of the pastors. They hold the shares only on behalf of the church.  They are not allowed to touch any of the money..  All of it is signed in New Creation Church's name, not Pastor Prince..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The pastors salaries are decided by the board of renumeration and through specific offerings..  everything is taxed and documented..</p>
              <p>The remaining verses are for Christians to rejoice by..  when they would receive their rewards for taking on His righteousness and not their own...  Those who did not depend on their righteousness, were accepted. Those who did, were not.. </p>

              <p>Jesus did not just give money, in fact, He gave people a way to get money for themselves. He healed the sick, injured, handicapped, unclean, demonized, the best part.. even the dead.. allowing them to work for their own keep.  But then, the question stands, what is God's will?</p>
              <p>"Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second" -Hebrews 10:9</p>

              <p><strong>That argument is unique only to ncc I suppose......while imo, it

                                          story. More important, it was Jesus's teaching and example that is

              </blockquote>
              <p>Hebrews 10:9 also answers this question...  There, it says that the first must first be taken away, so that the second may be established...  I may use this analogy: You cannot recontract your mobile line, until the first one is removed.  If you do, it is unlawful. God must go by His own rules. If He wants to establish a New Covenant, the Old must first be settled with. And it can only be settled with a payment, that none of us can pay. </p>

Its not that we are not doing such things, but that we are not broadcasting it to the world to hear..  Why? Its none of the worlds business , thats first.. second, we are not glorifying ourselves...

              <p>In the first parable in luke 15, Jesus talks about the lost sheep. Instantly you can identify the lost sheep to be the church. When Jesus found the church, he left everything else to go save that church... </p>
              <p>the second parable, is no longer about the shepherd. it is a woman. The church is also depicted as a woman.  A woman who has lost 1 silver coin out of 10...  what is 1/10 of the church's money?  The tithe!   Jesus says, if the church has lost the tithe, she should light a lamp, literally meaning obtain wisdom/revelation, and search the house for the tithe.. and upon finding it, rejoices..</p>
              <p>The last one we all know the famous prodigal son, The Father, finding the lost son...</p>
