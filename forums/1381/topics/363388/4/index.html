              <p>I have enjoyed this extensive discussion very much...  the
                      interesting posts here have given me a great opportunity to crack
                      open my bible and read where i normally might have missed.. 
                      thanks alots...  haha..   But i think we got alot of
                      points covered already to make a rather thick
                      FAQ...    I do intend to wrap it up in the next 3 to
                      4 posts if possible..   I've said my hearts content and
                      have been blessed.</p>

              <p>Glad that you enjoyed the exchanges....I am in no position to teach
                      you anything. I only hope at least you will open your mind and continue
                      to do some searching for the truth. I am not saying everything is wrong
                      with ncc....</p>
              <p>At least find out why people are reacting the way to
                      the church, what they are doing, what they are teaching.....as I said
                      all warped version have bible verses to support them. You and I can
                      have our own interpretations.....so who is right?</p>
              <p>Find out what
                      other demoninations are teaching, doing and why they do so? Why is
                      money not so important outside mega churches? And yet they are around
                      longer and still stronger than mega churches?</p>
              <p>Why some are
                      considered cults? They too have bible verses to quote.....and
                      explained. And they too have following in tens of thousands....</p>
              <p>The
                      real way is to seek and you will find......and never shut your mind.
                      The truth may hurt but it is cross that we can carry proudly to follow
                      Christ and be His light and messenger.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S. Never pass off something as untrue or present it as if it's a fact when you actually do not know......</p>

              <p>we do NOT check individual tithing records apart from several
                  occasions,since it is between you and God...  those special
                  occasions are 1) you are being considered for leadership, we have

              <p>So, so much for telling us that "<span style="color: #ff0000;"> if you are not employed,
                  dont tithe...   if you dont want to tithe, dont
                  tithe..</span>" cause when one is <strong>not employed and no money to tithe, ncc consider you a "God-robber"</strong> and <strong>I wonder if ncc will have any desire to  extend help to such "God-robbers"</strong>.............?????</p>
              <p>I know you do not represent ncc's official stand but you do reflect their teachings....in some ways...</p>
              <p>So with above, I tends to feel (imo) that ncc do "force" tithings as who wants to be known as a "God robber" and not a "regular member"? What you says  just does not matches up....</p>

              <p><strong>Just curious.....so if someone leaves the Church, still get to

                                      always saved is about?</strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lets start with an analogy. Suppose a sinner tells the devil: "I dont want you in my life... get out..."    Will the devil leave?  No!     Then how come some churches are teaching that the instant a Born Again Child of God feels jaded and decides to leave church, Jesus, the one who died for him, disappears just like that?</p>
              <p>Is not Jesus greater than the devil? Is He not love personified?   Is it not written, :</p>
              <p>Romans 8:38-39    <sup id="en-NIV-28140" class="versenum">38</sup>For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, <sup id="en-NIV-28141" class="versenum">39</sup>neither
              height nor depth, nor <strong>anything else in all creation</strong>, will be able to
              separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That includes the person himself..  God is not one to do things halfway... once you ask for salvation, He will give you Salvation, capital S..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The reason why we wont force tithing is because we want the congregation to choose to honor God...   You all know by now God never intended for us to be robots..  There is the gift of free will..</p>
              <p>What we are saying in the end, is that when you choose to make God first, He will bless you greatly..  If you dont, He still blesses you, but the one who honors Him truly makes Him happy.. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It appears I have made a mistake..  Non Tithers are still considered full members, however, they are non voting members..  Its not such a big deal, since its really rare that we need to vote on something..  But we are firm on not having a non tither as a leader... If you cant be faithful with the least, who will trust you with the true riches?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why do we say "if no revelation, dont tithe" is because we dont want you to go back to the tree of knowledge of good and evil..  God doesnt want men to tithe mechanically..  Melchizedek did not bring bread, wine and a AK-47 to Abraham saying : TITHE!! or else..  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why do we say "if no income, dont tithe?"  because tithing is giving
              the firstfruits of the harvest.  when there is no harvest, the season
              is for sowing, not tithing. Its the season for receiving, for being fed..   thats why we will help..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So all in all, we do not condemn our members for the inability nor the lack of desire for God's ways because it is a reflection of their current level..  some plants are not ready to blossom yet, but need cultivation... </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, i began posting in this thread in order to clear some doubts, but it seems like i created more instead..    I think therefore it would be wise to keep silence for as long as the Spirit leads, for it was fun, but now, if i'm not helping the situation, then let me step back, and let the results speak for themselves in the end...  </p>
              <p>May peace and joy pursue you always. Amen =D</p>

              <p>Lets start with an analogy. Suppose a sinner tells the devil: "I
                  dont want you in my life... get out..."    Will the
                  devil leave?  No!     Then how come some churches
                  are teaching that the instant a Born Again Child of God feels jaded
                  and decides to leave church, Jesus, the one who died for him,
                  disappears just like that?</p>
              <p>Is not Jesus greater than the devil? Is He not love
                  personified?   Is it not written, :</p>
              <p>Romans 8:38-39   <sup>38</sup>For I am convinced
                  that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the
                  present nor the future, nor any powers, <sup>39</sup>neither height nor depth, nor <strong>anything else in
                  all creation</strong>, will be able to separate us from the love of
                  God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
              <p>That includes the person himself..  God is not one to do
                  things halfway... once you ask for salvation, He will give you
                  Salvation, capital S..</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>I have heard JP preached on this salvation thingy.....but you should think clearly and deeper on this......</p>
              <p>We don't even need to ask for our salvation because by the grace of God, we "already have it" by the finished works of Christ on the Cross. It is available to ALL mankind....</p>
              <p>And I think many mistaken with the "once saved always saved" thing imo. Salvation is the best hope that God has promised to us as Paul said in Roman 8:24</p>
              <p>"In hope, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>we
                                          already have salvation; in hope, not visibly
                                          present</strong></span>, or we should not be hoping -- nobody goes
                                          on hoping for something which is already visible. 25 But
                                          <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>having this hope
                                          for what we cannot yet see, we are able to wait for it with
                                          persevering confidence.</strong></span>"</p>
              <p>So as Christians, we know that God will save us as He promised. But can one loose his salvation? IMO, yes and does that means God has break His promise? No.</p>
              <p>Salvation comes with conditions.....our <strong>Faith</strong>. It is not just what we says (I believe in God etc..) but what we do (not about going to Church and irritating others with some rotten evangelisation).....It is about listening to His commandment and following them....</p>
              <p>As Christ said, to love our God and our neighbour as how He has loved us. How do we love our God? He said in MT 25 which we discussed.....and if there is love, there is hope. Thus, our life as Christians should be the light and messengers of Christ....our Christian life should be one that is truely converted in our hearts to reach out and love our brothers and sisters.....It is those that are poor, marginalised, neglected and needy that need us,....not making more money....And we can help only when we have love in our hearts....our works will show our love.</p>
              <p>As Paul said in Ep 2:10 "We are God's work of art, created in Christ Jesus for the good works which God has already <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>designated to make up our way of life</strong></span>."</p>
              <p>You can read James chapter 2 on what happens when one claimed to have faith and yet not living out one's faith.</p>
              <p>Sorry but not here to argue about salvation but just to clarify with you.</p>

              <p>As I said before, what you says do reflect ncc's teaching and you did confirmed some of the doubts that others have of ncc.</p>
              <p>Like I said before, teaching of tithing the way it is done is not supported by bible and already given you some links to explained that. For one, just think about it, tithe you quote is never about money although it is already in existance...why?</p>
              <p>And try finding a verse when Jesus said that tithe is to be used to enrich His followers...</p>
              <p>The biggest problem is that you are not willing to look at why others do not teach and enforce tithing like the way it is done....and yet the church can prosper and the people continue to enjoy success....What about non-Christian? And mind you, money is not the only yardstick to measure success....If so, think about the triad, money-laundering, druglord, loan sharks......they are all blessed by God because they have lots of money?</p>
              <p>And yes, tithing is "forced" on ncc members although they keep saying no. The fact that you (an ncc member) has been told that not tithing is a "God Robber" speaks volume of it....and I doubt anyone who goes to a Church wants to be known as a "God Robber".....although IMO, that's just a twisted teaching. But it's the kind of "phycological threats" being subtly planted in the member's mind.....</p>
              <p>and what about the greed sowed by saying that it will bring "returns of many folds" ?</p>
              <p>I have spoken enough about what I believed many also have doubts about ncc....their main agenda is like any profit oriented companies - i.e. make lots of money. Perhaps also like such companies, return for shareholders and more importantly, the renumeration of CEOs etc are top priority......But ncc call themselves a Church and that will make all the difference....and look at the collapsed banks etc....</p>
              <p>Well, I may be wrong but judging from what I heard, read and from you, it seems to further confirmed my thoughts....</p>
              <p>And I agree with you that being a Christian and living a Christian way of life is indeed fun and rewarding. I respect that your decision to take a step back. But I sincerely hope that a young man like you should really open up your mind and seek the truth. IMO, ncc is not preaching the truth and it is shown by it's works or lack of it.... You may like the atmosphere, environment and the style of preaching but contents is what matters.....remember, the scams always sounds the way you like and presented in a more classy and flashy way.......</p>
              <p>No harm looking around and if you are finally convinced that ncc preached the truth, good for you. God bless.</p>

              <p>Now, i began posting in this thread in order to clear some
                  doubts, but it seems like i created more

                  keep silence for as long as the Spirit leads, for it was fun, but
                  now, if i'm not helping the situation, then let me step back, and<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> let the results speak for themselves in the end...</strong></span>  </p>

              <p>I forgot to address this earlier....it is actually the results that we are talking about now....what the church is doing or not doing.....</p>
              <p>Doing according to what is preached as in the bible i.e. to love.....not by words but by deeds like what Jesus did.</p>
              <p>You are trying your best to defend ncc....but sadly, even going by your own yardstick, it dosen't look good. Not on the things they teach, not the things they do and certainly not the things they don't do!</p>
              <p>The results are already here to show and it is the results (or the lack of it) that people are questioning.</p>
              <p>Really, I think it should ring some alarm bells in you if you put emotions aside and think....and remember that it is Christ that we should follow and not the pastor.</p>

              <p>Ha..ha..ha..You are right that you are "like killing their own
              brother/sisters rather then loving each another." - i.e. killing SPDCP....</p>
              <p>Killing his desire and opportunity to search and find the truth by asking him to shut his mind! If what he know is the truth, he will not have problems looking and searching around. Only those whose doctrines are "weak and questionable" are afraid to look around.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SPDCP, decide for yourself who is for you:</p>
              <p>1. someone who asked you to shut your mind and stop learning...</p>
              <p>2. someone who asked you to open your mind and search around ........and learn what others are doing and teachings and decide which is right to you.</p>
              <p>Remember that God gives you a sound mind to discern the truth and only you can do it. To discern, you must open up your mind as the truth is not afraid to be tested. Only falsehood can't and thus need to forget about explaining......</p>

              <p>Thanks Shao Wei , appreciate it very much xD </p>
              <p>Nah.. i never stopped searching..  in fact Ps Prince just preached on Wisdom being the principle thing, and meditating daily on God's Word is how a man makes his ways wise...  </p>
              <p>"Oh how I love thy Law! It is my meditation all the day. Thy
                  commandments make me wiser than mine enemies; for they are ever with
                  me. I have more understanding than all my teachers; for thy testimonies
                  are my meditation." - Psalms 119:97</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not posting only because there was no desire to do so and as and when i feel like it i'll post what else i might have learnt.. </p>
              <p>I think though, instead of broadening our range of input, perhaps we should narrow it down...    narrow it down to those who constantly preach Jesus and What He Has Done...    Cos there are alot of messages on everything i.e Prosperity, leadership, discipleship, church growth, etc, etc, but Jesus must be centre of everything.. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One of the main things holding me back from broadening my eyegate and eargate is ...  How broad is appropriate? If I share it to others, am i preaching to giraffes or to sheep? Some super cheem words with latin in them may be dropped around like loose change but then, if whose who need it cannot understand me, whats the point?</p>
              <p>I still dont know the meaning of exegesis... if thats any indication..</p>
              <p>Also, there are those who say, for example, that God no longer treats homosexuality as an abomination and that its perfectly fine to advocate or practise it....  Now when we counsel them, they ask us to broaden our minds..  </p>
              <p>I dont have that problem when i use Jesus as my yardstick,... He is perfectly understandable, and even helps us to understand certain parables and metaphors such as the one used on the woman with the demonized daughter in Tyre..</p>
              <p>"dont take the childrens bread and cast it to the dogs" &lt;--- the word Dogs here is actually puppies(kunarion,<span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS,Arial,Geneva; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS,Arial,Geneva; font-size: x-small;">κυνá½±ριον</span></span>, as opposed to kuon(<span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS,Arial,Geneva; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS,Arial,Geneva; font-size: x-small;">κá½»ων)</span></span>, which is simply just Dog), who are cute and loved by the kids..    Thats what gave her the hint to reply : Yes Lord, but even the puppies eat the crumbs..  </p>
              <p>Jesus is also knowing of the future, thinking of our generation when He spoke some parables, making them relevant even till today..   With Jesus we cant go wrong.. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in fact,we are constantly reminded to guard our eye gate and ear gate,
              even thought it was not directly mentioned in the scripture... Would that not constitute narrowing our minds somewhat?</p>

              <p>It's perfectly fine cause the choice is yours.....</p>
              <p>You are right that everything should be centered around Jesus as all true christian should look to Him, hear His Words and act on it.</p>
              <p>Our discussion also focus on that (at least I am trying to point that to you) and it seems like what you said is falling short....regardless if we use Christ or your theory as yardstick.</p>
              <p>I know every church preaches what they claimed to be Word of God but as you said, if one don't understand, then what's the point? Worst, those who do understand and twisted it to make it into a business.....for monetary gain....</p>
              <p>The point is, Jesus is the perfect example and He never sit around but went out of His way to reach His people with love, compassion and charity.....not by saying "I love the world" but actually loving by what He does....</p>
              <p>By asking you to open your mind is exactly to guard your eyes and ears.... by knowing what others are preaching and doing (and why), you will know which version is the actual Word of God cause you can discern and match it up with the 4 Gospels.</p>
              <p>After all, if you think what you are hearing now is the absolute truth, it will be proven and shown to you when you search.......(and perhaps you care to answer or explain those questions raised which you left unanswered?)</p>
              <p>I am suggesting to you because you claimed that JP preaches "unadulterated Gospel" <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>yet you have no way to know</strong></span>.....and you also said you will support any pastor who preach "unadulterated Gospel"....how can you do so when you don't even know what they are preaching?? Do you think you are fair to yourself??</p>
              <p>You sounded to me like one that is close to be totally brainwashed......or overcome by the "need" for propsperity....</p>
              <p>A church should be about love and what it does should be like what Christ do.....by reaching out as a community to love especially those who are left behind, those who are rejected and neglected by their deeds.....not making money (which is the job of a secular company).</p>
              <p>Remember that Jesus said that not all who called Him "Lord...Lord..." will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

              <p>Lol man, are we still on monetary gain? None of the churches pastors recieve anything from the sales of materials/property owned by the church, i believe its been repeated over and over the previous posts.. </p>
              <p>everything they recieve is from regular remuneration, and from personal offerings like for example if Mr X sends Ps Mark a cheque to bless him..      I do want to add that Ps Mark( all of the other pastors included) doesnt immediately get the cheque, but it is sent to the accounting department for taxes before he recieves it... </p>

              <p>Yes, and like it has also been repeatedly mentioned, we are preaching sunday after sunday of God's love for you and through activities organized by the departments we are reaching out..  Our focus is however, on Jesus.</p>
              <p>probably, immediately someone will say : You say you focus on Jesus, but dont do His commands?   </p>
              <p>To that i reply: I plan to put the Commander first, then the command second..  I dont want to be too caught up in following the command, and then forget who is commanding...  Sounds confusing?   I'll explain.. </p>
              <p>Jesus asked the Samaritan woman for a drink. He later went on to say: If you knew <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>who it is</strong></span> who is asking you for a drink,<span style="color: #ff0000;"> you will ask him, and he will give you ever lasting water...  </span></p>
              <p>Did Jesus say " if you know who I am, you will give me a drink?"   No, instead He says <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>I</strong> </span>will give <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>YOU</strong></span> a drink..  and after the woman left to preach to the 10 cities(decapolis), the disciples found Jesus refreshed as if He was the one who had drunk..   and He said I have food you know not of...</p>
              <p>Compare with Martha, who was so busy serving that she forgot who Jesus was, and ended up blaming both Mary and the Lord...  :" Lord, <span style="color: #ff6600;">dont you care</span> that <span style="color: #ff6600;">my sister has left me alone </span>to serve.." </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What im trying to say in the end is that NCC stand is : while reaching out is wonderful, its a great work, and missions are excellent and praise-worthy, and giving to the poor is commendable and such.. dont put too much importance on doing things, but prioritize sitting under His feet, and lean on His breast, and focus on His love for you!</p>
              <p>All these things are good..  But focus on Jesus and the rest will follow..    We dont preach on missions, but we preach Jesus and the desire to do missions come naturally..   We dont preach giving to the poor, but preach Jesus and the people are generous...  We dont preach church growth, but preach Jesus and we grew from 150 to 20000 in 10 years...  Who/what am we boasting in?  our "ability"?  "charisma"? No!  We preach Jesus, our boast is in Jesus!       </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>your last verse i will contest by saying that that phrase "not all who call me Lord Lord will enter into the kingdom of Heaven" is out of context..   What use is calling Jesus "Lord Lord" if you have not accepted Him as Saviour? He is Yeshua, which means "saviour" and not "Lord"...    Its is like Gandhi saying " i like your Christ, but i dont like your people... always stabbing each other in the back and fighting among yourselves..." ... Gandhi acknowledges Jesus is great, but he does not believe in Jesus as Saviour..</p>
              <p>But for Christians, they have been saved..  Jesus is not someone who gives half-half work...</p>
