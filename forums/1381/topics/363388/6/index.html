              <p>Very interesting....they raised $2millions for this center. Well Done! But after that? Can shed more lights on who is running the center and who pays for the day to day operational cost since 2001? Interesting to know...</p>

              <p>I have been questioning the teachings of New Creation church and for the sake of understanding what has been taught, I have and now still attends the late sunday afternoon services. I have also emailed the church on how I disagree on the wealth and prosperity teachings that the church focused so much on. The answers I get of cos are the ones that you all know "they believe that a pastor can be paid well." And they also do not just focus on wealth as in MONEY, but they believe GOd will bless us with wealth, health etc...in all areas of life if you beileve.</p>
              <p>And after questioning them and listening to them, I have only one conclusion. If you are a fellow christian, keep an open mind. Why do I say that? At one of the sermons, Prince preached about faith and he says something that made sense to me. How do I know you have faith? How do you know i have faith? How do you know whether my faith is real? and vice versa? No one knows except God.</p>
              <p>And to me, that summarises the attitude that Christians should have towards this church. I can be skeptical about their practices but I am not gonna call their faith a fake one or wrong one or judge their faith. If what he is doing is wrong, as all believers should do, is to believe that he will be judged heavily by God. But what if he was right afterall and anointed by God? What would happen to christians who choose to criticise and judge this man? Therefore, I am convicted in my heart to say that while I may not exactly agree with this man in some ways, I am not gonna judge but instead ask God to give him the wisdom to teach the things of God and for us, to rightly listen to the things of God and be wise not to judge but to discerm.</p>
              <p>And as for non believers, your only participation would be like mine towards Reverend Min Yi in the Ren Ci case. I dun believe, I never give so to me its just gossip fodder. Hope you get what I mean. It really doesnt matter to you all whether Prince is good or bad.</p>

              <p>All I am asking is what happen after building the center...who runs it and who fund the operation? NCC? And what is NCC's involvement after the building.....it's interesting to know. It's not about contribution as we all know how to do that as far as NKF is concerned.</p>
              <p>Or is this a one time donation thingy ??</p>
              <p>I am asking because it seems like many other institutions with the name of the religious organisations on them are started, build, run and funded (as at leats raise funds by) the particular religious organisations. Meaning, they build and use it for them to reach out and serve those in need.... and of course, they also make one time donations thingy towards other causes....</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I have been questioning the teachings of New Creation church and
              for the sake of understanding what has been taught, I have and now
              still attends the late sunday afternoon services. I have also
              emailed the church on how I disagree on the wealth and prosperity
              teachings that the church focused so much on. The answers I get of
              cos are the ones that you all know "they believe that a pastor can
              be paid well." And they also do not just focus on wealth as in
              MONEY, but they believe GOd will bless us with wealth, health
              etc...in all areas of life if you beileve.</p>
              <p>And after questioning them and listening to them, I have only
              one conclusion. If you are a fellow christian, keep an open mind.
              Why do I say that? At one of the sermons, Prince preached about
              faith and he says something that made sense to me. How do I know
              you have faith? How do you know i have faith? How do you know
              whether my faith is real? and vice versa? No one knows except
              God.</p>
              <p>And to me, that summarises the attitude that Christians should
              have towards this church. I can be skeptical about their practices
              but I am not gonna call their faith a fake one or wrong one or
              judge their faith. If what he is doing is wrong, as all believers
              should do, is to believe that he will be judged heavily by God. But
              what if he was right afterall and anointed by God? What would
              happen to christians who choose to criticise and judge this man?
              Therefore, I am convicted in my heart to say that while I may not
              exactly agree with this man in some ways, I am not gonna judge but
              instead ask God to give him the wisdom to teach the things of God
              and for us, to rightly listen to the things of God and be wise not
              to judge but to discerm.</p>
              <p>And as for non believers, your only participation would be like
              mine towards Reverend Min Yi in the Ren Ci case. I dun believe, I
              never give so to me its just gossip fodder. Hope you get what I
              mean. It really doesnt matter to you all whether Prince is good or
              bad.</p>

              <p>I agree with your attitude towards NCC or JP. Since we (and even many of those NCC members) do not know JP personally and interact with him on a personal basis, it is never possible for us to decide what kind of a person he is. It is like an artiste on stage, we know only what they do on stage and not what they do off stage.</p>
              <p>However, can we have an idea if one has faith? IMO is possible as conversion is really in the heart and if one is truely converted in their hearts, they will live their life close to the teachings of Christ which is of course of love, compassion and charity.</p>
              <p>Preaching about that is one thing and putting what is preached into our life is another thing.... as James said in Jn chapter 2. If you have faith, what you do will reflect it as your faith will lead you to do what Christ teaches - to love God and to love your neighbour.</p>
              <p>For NCC, the impression they give is all about making money and making more money....and if you read the discussions earlier, someone from NCC even suggest that NCC is exploiting "loopholes" of the law!</p>
              <p>There is nothing wrong being rich or wanting to be rich. What is important is how we attain the riches and how we use those riches that God gives us....and never let greed overcomes contentment.</p>
              <p>JP is a great preacher and his sermons are "attractive" and I am glad that you are not swayed by it. I believed that also reflects on the state of your faith.</p>

              <p>"No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one 
                                and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise 
                                the other. You cannot serve both God and Money." -  Matthew 6:24</p>
