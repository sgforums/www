              <p>Ha..ha..ha..You are right that you are "like killing their own
              brother/sisters rather then loving each another." - i.e. killing
              SPDCP....</p>
              <p>Killing his desire and opportunity to search and find the truth
              by asking him to shut his mind! If what he know is the truth, he
              will not have problems looking and searching around. Only those
              whose doctrines are "weak and questionable" are afraid to look
              around.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SPDCP, decide for yourself who is for you:</p>
              <p>1. someone who asked you to shut your mind and stop
              learning...</p>
              <p>2. someone who asked you to open your mind and search around
              ........and learn what others are doing and teachings and decide
              which is right to you.</p>
              <p>Remember that God gives you a sound mind to discern the truth
              and only you can do it. To discern, you must open up your mind as
              the truth is not afraid to be tested. Only falsehood can't and thus
              need to forget about explaining......</p>

              <p> He changed it for the same reason God changed Jacob's name to Israel..  There is nothing wrong with changing your name, do it if you want...   Lots of people have done it for reasons i cant care to mention...   why should it be surprising or rather, why is it even other peoples business what his name is?</p>

              <p>Lol man, are we still on monetary gain? None of the churches
                  pastors recieve anything from the sales of materials/property owned
                  by the church, i believe its been repeated over and over the
                  previous posts.. </p>
              <p>everything they recieve is from regular remuneration, and from
                  personal offerings like for example if Mr X sends Ps Mark a cheque
                  to bless him..      I do want to add that
                  Ps Mark( all of the other pastors included) doesnt immediately get
                  the cheque, but it is sent to the accounting department for taxes
                  before he recieves it... </p>

              <p>When did I touch on that in the last post? Feeling guilty? In fact, in the past post, I said I had no problems with pastors getting piad...infact to be paid well....But what is the yardstick to measure? You don't even know and ask me to ask your church instead.........?? So much for trying to explain misunderstanding about your church.</p>

              <p>Yes, and like it has also been repeatedly mentioned, we are
                          preaching sunday after sunday of God's love for you and through
                          activities organized by the departments we are reaching out.. 
                          Our focus is however, on Jesus.</p>
              <p>probably, immediately someone will say : You say you focus on
                          Jesus, but dont do His commands?   </p>
              <p>To that i reply: I plan to put the Commander first, then the
                          command second..  I dont want to be too caught up in following
                          the command, and then forget who is commanding...  Sounds
                          confusing?   I'll explain.. </p>
              <p>Jesus asked the Samaritan woman for a drink. He later went on to
                          say: If you knew <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>who it
                          is</strong></span> who is asking you for a drink, <span style="color: #ff0000;">you will ask him, and he will give you ever
                          lasting water... </span></p>
              <p>Did Jesus say " if you know who I am, you will give me a
                          drink?"   No, instead He says <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>I</strong></span> will give <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>YOU</strong></span> a drink..  and
                          after the woman left to preach to the 10 cities(decapolis), the
                          disciples found Jesus refreshed as if He was the one who had
                          drunk..   and He said I have food you know not of...</p>
              <p>Compare with Martha, who was so busy serving that she forgot who
                          Jesus was, and ended up blaming both Mary and the Lord...  :"
                          Lord, <span style="color: #ff6600;">dont you care</span> that
                          <span style="color: #ff6600;">my sister has left me alone</span> to
                          serve.." </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>You are confusing yourself and I said many times that I know your church preaches Jesus.....that's not the problem. Every church does that.....</p>
              <p>The church preach the Word Of God and lead us to follow His commandment. Is it that simple. So results of love will show.....like the shelter, the homes, hospice etc.....How would people who dedicated time, money and personal scarifices be confused with God because they are "so busy serving"? Tell me which church you know of that falls into that category?</p>
              <p>How can one who follow Christ commandent be "too caught up in following
                          the command, and then forget who is commanding" ? Unless you are telling me following Christ might lead you astray.....</p>
              <p> On the other hand I am not so sure of one that is operating like a profit orientated organisation.......following Christ??</p>

              <p>What im trying to say in the end is that NCC stand is : while
                      reaching out is wonderful, its a great work, and missions are
                      excellent and praise-worthy, and giving to the poor is commendable
                      and such.. dont put too much importance on doing things, but
                      prioritize sitting under His feet, and lean on His breast, and
                      focus on His love for you!</p>
              <p>All these things are good..  But focus on Jesus and the

                      but we preach Jesus and the desire to do missions come
                      naturally..   We dont preach giving to the poor, but
                      preach Jesus and the people are generous...  We dont preach
                      church growth, but preach Jesus and we grew from 150 to 20000 in 10
                      years...  Who/what am we boasting in?  our
                      "ability"?  "charisma"? No!  We preach Jesus, our boast

              <p>You are somewhat right that you cannot be Christ-like if Christ is not in you. The church and her members who have Christ in them will follow His words of love and reach out to love their neighbours...............not making money which is not the function of a church. Love of money is GREED.</p>
              <p>You still harping on the "growth" and "size" of the church.....which I thought by now you should know is not the second largest.............but the most important reason is what and why these people are attracted to the church..... Are they attracted by the calling of God to be a Christian so that they can serve the mission that God gave them? I.E. to love their neighbours? If so, the results after 10 years will show.......</p>
              <p>and what others think and voicing displeasure of speaks volume of the results or the lack of it.....</p>
              <p>Even cults and terrorist have strong following and they also grow depsite being "persecuted"..........</p>

              <p>your last verse i will contest by saying that that phrase "not
                  all who call me Lord Lord will enter into the kingdom of Heaven" is
                  out of context..   What use is calling Jesus "Lord Lord"
                  if you have not accepted Him as Saviour? He is Yeshua, which means
                  "saviour" and not "Lord"...    Its is like Gandhi
                  saying " i like your Christ, but i dont like your people... always
                  stabbing each other in the back and fighting among yourselves..."
                  ... Gandhi acknowledges Jesus is great, but he does not believe in
                  Jesus as Saviour..</p>
              <p>But for Christians, they have been saved..  Jesus is not
                  someone who gives half-half work...</p>

              <p>Out of context? He also said that only those who heard His words and act on it will enter into the Kingdom of God.....</p>
              <p>Who else will call Jesus Lord unless they are His believers and followers?</p>
              <p>As I said, it is because of His death that brought us the rewards of eternal life....but He came to save the world. So this is available to ALL mankind provided they listen to His words and act on it. I.E. only true Christians who are converted in their hearts to one that is of love, charity and compassion as He said in the last judgement (MT25).</p>
              <p>So not all who claimed to be Christians are saved.....otherwise why would He said what He did (as above)? And why would Paul said what he did (in my previous post)? So you decide who lied to you.</p>
              <p>Regardless if you take the Catholic version that one is saved by faith and deeds or the Protestants version that one is saved to do good deeds, it will matches up in the end. If you said you are Christian and yet have no deeds to show, than what James said in chapter 2 is clear about such "faith".</p>
              <p>Why would one have faith in Christ and yet do not follow His commandments?</p>
              <p>And don't go on arguing what is good deeds and how many is needed etc.....because when one is truely converted in their hearts, good deeds comes naturally as part and parcel of their life...never a chore and never need to count. You don't count how many times you breathes although that is what keeps you alive.</p>
              <p>More importanly, as Christian good deeds is our pirority as God commanded us. Not making money which I said again, is not the function of any church.</p>
              <p>How would Jesus's work be "half-half" if He saves only people who listen to His words and act on it (especially when He said them clearly in the Gospel) ??</p>

              <p>You are right when you ask why it is other people's business what he changes his name to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, some things are not as clear cut especially when religion (in this case Christianity) is concerned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You have seen in recent cases how the basic fundamental teachings of religion have been warped into self serving interests, so one has to be skeptical whenever something does not seem to conform to what that religion preaches or believes in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I just feel that the name "Prince" is not suitable especially in the context of the christian faith since there is a connotation of royalty. Why not "James" or "John" or "Andrew"? Are these names too common so a religious leader needs to come up with a "special" name? Again, you need to see it in the context of the religion involved.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If anybody else who is not a religious leader calls himself "Prince", then I have no cause for concern. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
