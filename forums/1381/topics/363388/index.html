              <p>^not true. The only thing that NCC preaches about consistently is the amazing grace of God, and because of God's grace, He blesses us with prosperity and successes. When you touch the grace of God, every blessing just flows abuntdantly into your life.</p>
              <p>I love Pastor Prince and his teachings. I have been so blessed by him. He is truly a man of God, a gift from God to us. I never knew how much Jesus loves me until I heard the teachings by Pastor Prince. Its sad that people take his words out of context and twist them according to ther own understanding and not according to God's Word. People are always cynical when it comes to megachurches like NCC, CHC etc. Its true that they are extremely blessed financially, but its also true that they also use these finances to bless others, but people love to see the negative in others, never the good. I am well aware of all the critiques that come against Pastor Prince, but it doesn't change the fact the I, along with many many other christians, regard him as our spiritual father.</p>

              <p>^not true. The only thing that NCC preaches about consistently
              is the amazing grace of God, and because of God's grace, He blesses
              us with prosperity and successes. When you touch the grace of God,
              every blessing just flows abuntdantly into your life.</p>
              <p>I love Pastor Prince and his teachings. I have been so blessed
              by him. He is truly a man of God, a gift from God to us. I never
              knew how much Jesus loves me until I heard the teachings by Pastor
              Prince. Its sad that people take his words out of context and twist
              them according to ther own understanding and not according to God's
              Word. People are always cynical when it comes to megachurches like
              NCC, CHC etc. Its true that they are extremely blessed financially,
              but its also true that they also use these finances to bless
              others, but people love to see the negative in others, never the
              good. I am well aware of all the critiques that come against Pastor
              Prince, but it doesn't change the fact the I, along with many many
              other christians, regard him as our spiritual father.</p>
              <p>God bless you!</p>
