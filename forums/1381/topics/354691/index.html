              <p>I have been pondering on this topic for quite some time but have no answers to the validity of it. Thus, I am posting a few questions relating to this here and see whether fellow brothers and sisters in Christ can often some of your perspectives.</p>
              <p>The biblical teaching taught about many things relating to curses. In churches, we often heard about curse of poverty, curse of death, curse of insanity,etc. Furthermore, this has relations to generational curses that could have been started 1 to 2 generations ago and would probably affect all the way down to the 3rd and 4th generations.</p>
              <p>So if you may, share with me your thoughts on the following question:</p>
              <p>1) Do you believe in curse of poverty?</p>
              <p>2) Have you witnessed this in your personal life, your family (including extended family), your friends,etc?</p>
              <p>3) How do you recognized this as a curse of poverty?</p>
              <p>4) Pastors talk about breaking curses. Do you think curses such as poverty can really be broken by prayer, confession, or intercession (of course, prior to that one must accept Jesus Christ as his saviour)?</p>
              <p>5) Have anyone seen transformation of someone whose life was in total poverty but after acceptance of Jesus Christ as his saviour, was free from the curse and lead a life that is free from poverty?</p>
              <p>Thank you and God's blessings, grace and mercy be with you,</p>

              <p>Poverty in today's context where the family is constantly not making enough to make ends meet. It could also be for some unforseen circumstanaces, incidents such as getting involved in situations where hardearned money has to be spent and be depleted from time to time - such as getting into accidents, close family members needing money for medical treatment or surgery.</p>
              <p>In short, let's not look at wasting money intentionally or deliberately as a topic of discussion. There are people whom I know who are constantly in debts or not making enough - not that they are not educated or that they are not intelligent. It's just that for some reasons uncontrollable, they will always be not making enough...</p>
              <p>One more thing, sometime such cases are recurring from generations to generations...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Since sleeping on the streets and begging for food is mentioned here, that itself is poverty. Whoever is in that predicament would definitely want to get out of it. Question here is why is he/she in this situation? Is there such a thing as curse of poverty that has fallen upon him/her that he or she has to beg and sleep on the street?</p>
              <p>Contentment is definitely an important self-conscious platform that we have to be mindful of (at all times). However, being content or how to be content is not the focus of this discussion. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Curse of poverty?</p>
              <p>All I know is a vow for poverty in Christianity.</p>
              <p>God gives extraordinary wealth(through honest means) to one follower and give the grace of overwhelming peace and joy to other to lead a simple life.</p>
              <p>There are people who are blessed financially by the Lord and others who receive blessing in other forms. Jesus just said for us not to worry about our life.</p>
              <p>All curses are broken when one accepts Jesus Christ as His savior with his mouth and his heart.</p>
              <p>When one accepts Christ as his Lord and savior he is no longer living under curses and God's judgment. Christ is his Lord and he becomes His own. When one believes in Christ he can rebuke evil that particularly comes his way to attack him personally in the name of the Lord and it shall flee without delay and without resistance. The Lord is his fortress. No evil* could do harm to him.</p>
              <p> evil*: spirits</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In fact when you accept Christ, men are more dangerous than spirits.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I have been pondering on this topic for quite some time but have no answers to the validity of it. Thus, I am posting a few questions relating to this here and see whether fellow brothers and sisters in Christ can often some of your perspectives.</p>
              <p>The biblical teaching taught about many things relating to curses. In churches, we often heard about curse of poverty, curse of death, curse of insanity,etc. Furthermore, this has relations to generational curses that could have been started 1 to 2 generations ago and would probably affect all the way down to the 3rd and 4th generations.</p>
              <p>So if you may, share with me your thoughts on the following question:</p>
              <p>1) Do you believe in curse of poverty?</p>
              <p>2) Have you witnessed this in your personal life, your family (including extended family), your friends,etc?</p>
              <p>3) How do you recognized this as a curse of poverty?</p>
              <p>4) Pastors talk about breaking curses. Do you think curses such as poverty can really be broken by prayer, confession, or intercession (of course, prior to that one must accept Jesus Christ as his saviour)?</p>
              <p>5) Have anyone seen transformation of someone whose life was in total poverty but after acceptance of Jesus Christ as his saviour, was free from the curse and lead a life that is free from poverty?</p>
              <p>Thank you and God's blessings, grace and mercy be with you,</p>
              <p>JY</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I'm not sure if curses exist in Christianity, I always thought that only God has the power to do so if he wishes (and it is hard to believe that he would do so to his children that he created out of love).</p>
              <p>Actually I don't think that poverty is to be feared. Our Lord himself and most of the holy men and women described in the Bible could hardly be considered to be wealthy in a material sense, yet they were the richest people who ever lived.</p>
              <p>So take heart that God endows you with your talents and resources, so that you will have the ability and opportunity to do his work. Peace with you!  </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think, from this passages, and in the light of the entire bible, God does make his people rich, only if He allows it. We know that being rich isn't wrong, if God so rightly bless, enjoy it, but also use the riches that God blessed you with, to bless others, and be rich in good deeds. Don't be arrogant and think that you are untouchable or above others who not not as well off as you, thus placing our confidence in your riches.</p>
              <p>But if you are not rich, don't clamour after it, and don't think about trying to earn points with God (thinking that godliness is a means to attaining wealth)</p>
              <p>God's blessing has nothing to do with whether you are godly or not, He does what He sees is right. But as we know, our works have no standing before God, so pls don't think thoughts like "if i go to church more often, God will more likely bless my business and career than if i don't go church", or that "if i tithe more, God will bless me more". This is a wrong thinking, because the reason why God blesses you when you tithe is because God says He would, but not because you tithe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ultimately, it's all about being content with the lot which God has given you.</p>
              <p>so is proverty a curse? It depends what do you mean by poverty then.</p>
              <p>God promises to take care of your every need. Are your needs met, then be content, and don't think that you are poor. =)</p>
              <p>When I was a young believer, I did pray for my dad to get a better job, because he was really unhappy with his old job, because his hard work isn't being appreciated and recognised. He searched for a new job for a really long time, and yeah, God answered it. It paid alot better, and he's happier. Now, he's also a christian, and whatever riches we have, we bless others. we hold alpha, christmas parties etc, invited friends and colleagues, and share the good news etc.</p>
              <p>when we define curses, i see it as, an absense of God's blessings and support.</p>
              <p>when we define poverty, i see it as, a constant lack of basic provision. (staying in a hdb flat isn't considered proverty, just because you know people who live in bungalows)</p>
              <p>if you're a child of God, and you are really struggling with providing for the family, etc, then yes, please go up for prayers. God says He will provide for your needs, you shall not want. Somewhere, that blessing is being blocked, either by our lack of faith, or sins or some disobedience somewhere.</p>
              <p>do i know anyone who became rich after he became a christian. yes. my cell leader.</p>
              <p>he came from a christian family, then he backslided as a youth, and was a sailor for awhile. he was addicted to gambling, and often gambled away every cent he has, even taking funds from his company. At his most desperate moment, he was invited to church, and he rededicated his life back. God helped him overcome his addiction, and he started from scratch.</p>
              <p>he learnt about tithing, and he told God he didn't have money, so instead of 10%, can he give 5%. and he started from there, then God blessed him, and he had endless business. he has this huge whiteboard where he will stick business, timing whatever la.</p>
              <p>from empty board, to no space to stick anymore information on the board.</p>
              <p>even now, he sometimes have to give some business to other people to do, because he has too much to handle.</p>
              <p>so, ya, does God bless? Definitely</p>

              <p>just to add smth.</p>
              <p>my dad just came back from a mission trip in hong kong, and he was so filled with joy and excitment. i didn't get to hear it first hand, so hear from my mum.</p>
              <p>apparently the team that went this round, was really fruitful, my dad prayed for healing for someone, and that person's arm really healed, and he gave testimony the very next day.</p>
              <p>so ya, God definitely makes our lives rich, may not be about money and finances.</p>
              <p>but just to add another point from the other point of view.</p>
              <p>in my extended family, the ones having problems, divorces etc etc, are always from the not so well-off family.</p>
              <p>so is there a link? i don't know, you tell me?</p>

              <p>I just want to add this words</p>
              <p>The richest person is not one who has everything but one whose desires are all met.</p>
              <p>Frankly only God can meet ALL of our desires........miraculously by sending His spirit in our heart. His spirit of gentleness and overwhelming peace and joy. I had it through grace lost it due to attachment to sin and now begging for God to give it to me again.</p>
              <p>So what do you desire? If you desire nothing more in your life than what you already have now you are the richest person on the planet.</p>
              <p>If you already own a lot of things but feel that you desire much more you are still a poor man and thinks and acts like a poor man.</p>
              <p>@dumbdumb thank you for sharing the healing testimony. God bless you and your family. Be at peace and be richly blessed in God.</p>
