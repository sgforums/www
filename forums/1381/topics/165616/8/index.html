            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ironside:</div><div class="quote_body">i don't understand.......Manasseh and Ephraim were biological sons of Joseph</div></blockquote>In ancient Middle East, inheritance rights are usually passed from father to son but they can also be passed from father to grandson, or from father to son-in-law. As a side issue, one example of the latter was when Jacob and Rachal fled from Laban, Rachal stole the household gods, which caused Laban to chase after them all through the night. Archaeological evidence suggests that these household gods (tÂ’rafim) are used as the token of inheritance which can be passed from father to son usually but also to the son-in-law in the event that there are no surviving sons.<br><br>The blessing on the death bed is like making a will in modern times and it is binding. So Isaac mistakenly left his inheritance to Jacob instead of Esau when he blessed Jacob thinking he was the hairy Esau. Jacob on his deathbed decided to bless Ephraim and Manasseh, giving them an equal share in his estate as their uncles. So Joseph is over-represented, having two tribes to his name. The tribes of Joseph therefore refer to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh.<br><br>So, in one sense, if you count Ephraim and Manasseh as separate tribes, you get 13 in all, not twelve. However, if you consider the tribes that inherit land, there are only 12, because the tribe of Levi do not own any land. Their inheritance is the Temple of God.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As for the lost tribes, there are constantly groups of people who claim to be descendants of the 10 lost tribes. It is difficult to verify if the claims are true. The Assyrians did not keep the 10 northern tribes together but scattered them all over the empire, with the intention of destroying their cultural heritage. In contrast, The babylonians (present day Iraqis) treated the captives from the kingdom of Judah much better...some of them like Daniel got a first-rate education and were allowed to practise their religion to some extent. When the persian king Cyrus allowed them to return, they re-constituted the nation of Israel.<br><br>Did any members of the 10 tribes taken away to Assyria manage to return? I dunno...there were suggestions that some of them did. For example, the Samaritans claim to have descended from Ephraim and Manasseh and they stayed around Samaria, which used to be the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel. They have some practice in common with the Jews but differ in other respects. As you know from the gospels, the Jews hated them although they claim to worship the same God and read from the same Torah.<br><br>I had a discussion with a Jewish friend who is reading history in Oxford University. He is vehement in his belief that the 10 tribes are truly lost and that present day Jews have all descended from the kingdom of Judah. In fact, there are some who are insistent that the term Jews refer only to Judahites, although it has a wider connotation in lay usage.</div>
