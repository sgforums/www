            <div class='col-md body'>I Kings 4:26 (KJV) says " And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. " That is a lot of stalls. But II Chronicles disagrees with this count. It tells us, "Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horses." (II Chronicles 9:25 ) So was it 4000 stalls, or 40,000? Surely one of these verses is wrong.<br><br>Here is one last example. The book of Mark tells a story of a miracle. "Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came there. Seeing Jesus, he fell at his feet and pleaded earnestly with him, 'My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live.'" ( Mark 5:22-23) Mark then tells how Jesus went to the ruler's home and, on the way, a woman is healed by touching his garment. Mark picks up the story again in verse 35. "While Jesus was still speaking, some men came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. 'Your daughter is dead,' they said. 'Why bother the teacher any more?' " So here we find that Jairus first comes and tells Jesus that his daughter is dying, and only later does Jairus find out that she is dead. Now let's look at the book of Matthew which says, "While he was saying this, a ruler came and knelt before him and said, 'My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live.'" ( Matt. 9:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Here the same ruler knows that the daughter is dead when he first comes to Jesus. And this happens before the garment touching incident. Can both Matthew and Mark be right?</div>

Since then the scholarship of Greek and Hebrew, as well as the discovery of older and better manuscripts have improved bible scholars' understanding of the original languages.<br><br>Those translations which give the number 40,000 are based on the Masoretic Text, the Old Testament used by Jews in the Middle Ages. But if one checks the Septuagint (LXX), one discovers manuscripts giving the number 4,000--the same as in 2 Chronicles 9:25. (The LXX was so called because 70 Jewish scholars were commissioned to translate the OT texts from Hebrew to Greek in 300-200BC)<br><br>Here is something I read off the web on this matter:<br><br>"What we have here is a classic example of a copyist error. Before the printing press, each copy of the Bible had to be produced by hand from a previous copy. Though the scribes doing the copying were amazingly meticulous in their efforts, occasionally a scribe would get sleepy or lose his concentration or mishear a word in the text as it was being read aloud, and he would make a mistake. These tiny mistakes are called copyist errors, and they were dangerous because, if not caught, they would be passed on to future copies made from this scribe's work.<br><br>The Hebrew word for forty is only two strokes of a pen different from the word for four. What probably happened in the case of 1 Kings 4:26 is that some early scribe became sleepy and accidentally added those two strokes to the word he was writing. No one caught the error. His manuscript became the basis for the Masoretic Text. The true form of the text was preserved in the LXX manuscript tradition (the LXX being an early Greek translation of the Old Testament), which is used for this verse by almost all modern Bibles.<br><br>The fact we have a copyist error in this case has been known for a long time. For example, Keil &amp; Delitzsch's Commentary on the Old Testament, first published in the mid-1800s, states: "Arba'iym (40) is an old copyist's error for arba'ah (4), which we find in the parallel passage, 2 Chronicles 9:25, and as we may also infer from chapter 10:26 and 2 Chronicles 1:14, since according to these passages Solomon had 1,400 rekeb or war chariots. For 4,000 horses are a very suitable number for 1,400 chariots, though not 40,000, since two draught horses were required for every war chariot, and one horse may have been kept as a reserve" (Commentary on the Old Testament 3:53).<br><br>Generally, numerical discrepancies are trivial in their solution and are obvious to scholars. John Haley's classic work, Alleged Discrepancies of the Bible, states, "We have previously, more than once, called attention to the marked resemblance of Hebrew letters to one another; also to the fact . . . that these letters were in ancient time employed to represent numbers. These two facts indicate at once the cause and the solution of the numerical discrepancies" (Alleged Discrepancies, 380)."<br><br></div>
