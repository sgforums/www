            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by neutral_onliner:</div><div class="quote_body">I Kings 4:26 (KJV) says " And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. " That is a lot of stalls. But II Chronicles disagrees with this count. It tells us, "Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horses." (II Chronicles 9:25 ) So was it 4000 stalls, or 40,000? Surely one of these verses is wrong.<br><br>Here is one last example. The book of Mark tells a story of a miracle. "Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came there. Seeing Jesus, he fell at his feet and pleaded earnestly with him, 'My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live.'" ( Mark 5:22-23) Mark then tells how Jesus went to the ruler's home and, on the way, a woman is healed by touching his garment. Mark picks up the story again in verse 35. "While Jesus was still speaking, some men came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. 'Your daughter is dead,' they said. 'Why bother the teacher any more?' " So here we find that Jairus first comes and tells Jesus that his daughter is dying, and only later does Jairus find out that she is dead. Now let's look at the book of Matthew which says, "While he was saying this, a ruler came and knelt before him and said, 'My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live.'" ( Matt. 9:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Here the same ruler knows that the daughter is dead when he first comes to Jesus. And this happens before the garment touching incident. Can both Matthew and Mark be right? </div></blockquote>to neutral onliner, I think that your post of this is not warranted in this thread.
