            <div class='col-md body'><a href="http://graceatwork.org/view.php3?Id=350" rel="nofollow">http://graceatwork.org/view.php3?Id=350</a><br><br>When I was interviewed for the position of pastor of First<br>Baptist Church, I had to answer one key question: "Do you<br>speak in tongues?"<br>The church had been split by the charismatic<br>controversy. They had to know.<br>My answer then and my answer now is this:"What you need to<br>know is my theology on the matter. That is more critical<br>then whether I have this gift."<br><br>I have not revisited this topic for some time. In the twenty<br>odd years since that interview many of the churches I know<br>have moved beyond that controversy and that divide. There<br>has been a lot of maturing all round. Although different<br>churches still have different views on the subject there is<br>a much higher level of mutual respect and a lot of healthy<br>learning between different traditions. (I am grateful for<br>the many friends I have from Pentecostal and charismatic<br>traditions. I am grateful for their friendship and the<br>opportunities we have for working together.)<br><br>But once in a while you get "deja vu all over again" and you<br>get a speaker or a group that pushes the classical<br>Pentecostal position on tongues, tongues here understood as<br>an unknown language, sounds uttered in prayer unintelligible<br>to the one praying and to others (1 Corinthians 14:2).<br><br>Usually the agenda is the desire to see the release of God's<br>supernatural power. This is something seen as happening in a<br>believer's life separate from conversion, an event often<br>referred to as the baptism of the Spirit. As evidence that<br>this release had taken place, one was given the gift of<br>tongues. Tongues became something very critical because it<br>was identified with spiritual empowerment which is the real<br>goal.<br><br>So what is my take on this?<br><br>First off I am very grateful to my Pentecostal and<br>charismatic friends for reminding us of the need for the<br>Holy Spirit's power. Luke summarizes Jesus's ministry in<br>this way: "...with respect to Jesus from Nazareth, that God<br>anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went<br>around doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the<br>devil, because God was with him." (Acts 10:38 NET)<br>The link between supernatural power, the Holy Spirit and<br>the ability to do God's work is clear. And Jesus is the<br>model for His church.<br><br>Too often the modern church has put her trust in techniques,<br>technology and good marketing to get God's job done,<br>basically paying lip service to the need for the Spirit's<br>anointing. We welcome every reminder that while we should<br>appreciate all tools the Lord gives us, our ultimate trust<br>is in Him and in His empowerment.<br><br>But what is the linkage between spiritual anointing and the<br>gift of tongues? Is tongues something that everyone should<br>be seeking as the sign of God's empowerment?<br><br>My starting point is 1 Corinthians 12: 29-30<br><br>"Not all are apostles, are they? Not all are prophets, are<br>they? Not all are teachers, are they? Not all perform<br>miracles, do they? Not all have gifts of healing, do they?<br>Not all speak in tongues, do they? Not all interpret, do<br>they?" (NET)<br><br>There is no ambiguity in the Greek. Paul is asking a<br>rhetorical question that demands the answer "no". No,<br>tongues is not for everyone.<br><br>Remember that Paul is writing to a church that included a<br>faction that was pushing for more dramatic manifestations of<br>the Spirit including the gift of tongues. This was a group<br>who probably saw themselves as spiritual elites who wanted<br>others to join them and apparently one of the marks that you<br>had reached their level of anointing was the exercise of the<br>gift of tongues.<br>Paul is clear. No, not everyone has this gift. Indeed it is<br>the Lord who decides who gets what gift. (1 Corinthians<br>12:11).<br><br>But Paul is not against the gift of tongues. He admits to<br>exercising the gift frequently in his private prayers. But<br>he is also clear that his preference is that intelligible<br>language be used when the church gathers so that believers<br>can be edified.<br><br>"I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you,<br>but in the church I want to speak five words with my mind to<br>instruct others, rather than ten thousand words in a<br>tongue." (1 Corinthians 14:18-19 NET).<br><br>There are those who argue that there is a "sign of tongues"<br>which is to be differentiated from the "gift of tongues." At<br>Pentecost one of the signs that the Spirit had come was<br>tongues. And everyone ought to seek this "sign of tongues"<br>as evidence for the Spirit's anointing though not all will<br>be given the "gift of tongues."<br><br>I do not see this differentiation in Scripture.<br>The word "tongues" is the same both in Acts 2 and in 1<br>Corinthians. And if one were to push for the signs at<br>Pentecost should we not also push for the sound of a violent<br>wind and the tongues of fire?<br><br>Therefore I am not convinced that the gift of tongues is the<br>indispensable sign of God's empowerment or that all<br>Christians should strive to get it. And I am against any<br>sort of elitism in the church. There are no second class<br>Christians at the Lord's table.<br><br>But I am convinced that we desperately need the empowerment<br>of the Spirit for the life and mission of the church. How<br>then do we appropriate God's power for His purposes? For my<br>answer I go to Acts 4: 23-31.<br><br>Here we find a church totally sold out to God and His<br>purposes. Initial success in mission work had provoked<br>persecution. God's power was critically needed for a breakthrough. And so the group joined in corporate prayer beseeching the Lord to intervene and work His power with the following results:<br><br>"When they had prayed, the place where they were assembled<br>together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy<br>Spirit and began to speak the word of God courageously."<br>(4:31 NET)<br><br>Yes there was accompanying physical phenomenon - the place<br>was shaken - and the Lord does that sometimes, but the key<br>words are "prayed," "filled with the Holy Spirit," and<br>"began to speak the word of God courageously."<br><br>When we focus on the phenomena of tongues we often get tied<br>up into all sorts of controversy that take us away from the<br>heart of the issue.<br>Instead of pushing tongues we should be searching our hearts<br>and asking, are we are indeed sold out to God and His<br>purposes? Are we really aware of our total helplessness to<br>do His work apart from His anointing?<br><br>Whatever our stand on the gift of the tongues, and every<br>church needs to define their position, we must major on<br>the majors.<br>Come O Lord and fill us again.<br><br>Your brother,<br>Soo-Inn Tan<br></div>
