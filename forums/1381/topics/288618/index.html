I have proposed to Chin Eng and ben1xy on closing this forum.  We have agreed that we will no longer keep this forum active.<br><br>I am no longer able to actively read posts in this forum and be an effective moderator because of family and work priorities.  As I consider about lessening my activities here, it will not be fair to let the other moderators bear too much of the load.  Hence, we will close this forum.<br><br>The secondary reason in closing this forum is because of the recent activities in EH has made it unpleasant to me to visit this forum. I love God and would love to share my joy with whoever is interested to know more. But I feel it is no longer sensible to share when our views are repeated put down just because someone is not agreeable to our faith.<br><br>Instead of appearing to be a thorn in the flesh, it is best that we remove our presence here.<br><br>Eternal Hope was started as a gathering place for fellow Christians in sgForums. I have made many good friends through this forum and my stay here was mostly enjoyable.<br><br>To the "old gang", Choco B, the Bear, skinnybeanie, Inzaghi, M, s|nned, tare, NT2 etc., my beginnings in here was made wonderful by all of you.<br><br>To Chin Eng, ben1xy, Icemoon, laurence82, vince69, laoda99, thank you. Thank you for the knowedge I have learnt from you. Thank you for the friendship I have with you. (though I did not have the opportunity to meet some of you)<br><br>From this day, Eternal Hope will no longer moderated.  All old and new posts will be deleted.<br><br>I will still be in sgForums.</div></blockquote>1) No time to be effective moderator doesn't mean need to close forum. There are a few things you can do<br>a) Appoint new moderators to help you<br>b) Request Jason to make this into a public forum and let him appoint new moderators<br><br>2) Activities make it unpleasant for you to visit the forum and thus the closure? Is that any different from the "closure" of Pumping Iron? Is it worth it to close a forum just like that? Is it that hard on you when people do not accept your faith? If you a true believer, how would that affect you?<br><br>3) You have started this forum as a gathering place for christians of SgF. By closing the forum, you are depriving them of this wonderful gathering place you have once created. The problem here is, do you think it is right for you to destroy something because you created it? Other than the feelings of the moderators, how about the feelings of Christians? By closing a place where you share your thoughts and views about Christianity and God, isn't it considered sinning?<br><br>A Church is for Christians to gather, to praise God, listen and accept the teachings of God. Similarly, this forum is for SgF Christians to gather, to talk about Christianity, and to spread the teachings. Closure of this forum would be almost the same as the closing of a church. God teaches you to extend your acceptance, patience, and  love to others. Surely you can brush away unpleasant events in this forum and not let it affect the existence of this forum.<br><br>Those are my initial thoughts when I saw this news. Thanks.</div>

Hey, if we cannot accept people do not believe in Christ, we would have killed at least half of the people around us. I am the only christian in my family. My company only has 5 christians out of 40. But well, we get along fine, we sometimes talk about religion and our beliefs, we had disagreements but we get along fine. But as humans, you may choose to say I am judgemental, i dun care what others say anyway haha... but we are humans, with that little bit of intelligence to discern who genuinely wants a discussion encompassed by mutual respect and those who are simply out to challenge and discredit everything christians say.<br><br>You can see lah, there are a couple of people here who openly says that christianity is not something they want to believe in or something along that line but did you see us chasing them away or curse that their arse-hole will be filled with cement?
