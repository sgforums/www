If we want to keep a forum running, we have to be responsible and make sure that other Christians do not stumble, or that degradatory statements are not made, or that proper respect is given to all religions. However, if the moderators can no longer upkeep this, it might be better to close the forum. It's not about misunderstanding the premise of our faith.
