[/b]</blockquote>Then explain this, Jesus said that He came not to abolish the law, but to fulfil it. He lived the law perfectly so that we could have a perfect sacrifice. He also said that until heaven and earth pass away not an iota will be changed. What do you suppose that means. You think just because Jesus came, the OT is no longer relevant? Then how do you describe God? Where do you find out about Him? Even Jesus said, you shall worship the Lord your God and Him only shall you serve. What do you suppose that means? How do you serve God if you do not know what He is all about? How do we find out about what pleases God, what makes Him happy etc? If the OT was not relevant, then why would God include it in the bible? For bedtime stories? The whole of the bible is there to teach us about God and His character, God Himself says that He does not change. So if He does not change, why would God vary His requirements in the OT?<br><br>Jesus was first and foremost God's son, He was also a JEW. God's chosen people were JEWS, what do you think then? That if the initial disciples were not exempt from the ways of the JEWs, how much more do we who are adopted sons and daughters have to fit into what God is about. When people get adopted into a family, they get adopted under house rules... not their own, so likewise, we are adopted on God's terms, not ours, true, we have the choice to refuse this adoption, but once adopted, we have to do it God's way not ours...<br><br>You have the context of grace totally wrong. The context for grace is grace for the gentiles for our salvation. Not grace to do away with all of the other requirements for living a Christian life. We have grace so that we do not have to work for our SALVATION, but Jesus Himself said, He came so that the law may be fulfilled. That is the reason why so many people out there have the concept of cheap grace.<br><br>The grace exists so that in our walk with the Lord AFTER our salvation, we still have the ability to come to Him in repentance because He does not judge our sins as they deserve under the law.<br><br>Eph 1:7 (amplified bible)<br>7In Him we have redemption (deliverance and salvation) through His blood, the remission (forgiveness) of our offenses (shortcomings and trespasses), in accordance with the riches and the generosity of His gracious favor,<br><br>Eph2:5 (amplified bible)<br>5Even when we were dead (slain) by [our own] shortcomings and trespasses, He made us alive together in fellowship and in union with Christ; [He gave us the very life of Christ Himself, the same new life with which He quickened Him, for] it is by grace (His favor and mercy which you did not deserve) that you are saved ([a]delivered from judgment and made partakers of Christ's salvation).<br><br>It has always been said in the bible that by grace you have been saved, but please direct me to where in the bible it says by grace you can disregard all of God's commandments and ways?</div>

What sort of lawlessness do you think this refers to?<br><br>Having our redemption in Christ does not mean that the Laws of God do not still operate, it just means that we are exempt from the judgement should be fall in these areas.<br><br>God has placed many laws in place which still operate... take for example the law of gravity... you try by your grace to step out of a 10 storey window and lets see you by your grace float...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>See the Bible gateaway ..it says in the NIV New International version<br><br>23"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give <strong>a tenth of your spicesÂ—mint, dill and cummin</strong>. But you have neglected the more important matters of the lawÂ—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.<br><br>I suppose you have the means to see that it is a kind of <strong>Jewish practice </strong>to tithe or contribute a tenth of spices - mint, dill and cummin...I used all of them before for cooking they give a tenth.<br><br>Would it be any difference you say? Why have not the disciples follow it thru when they specifically meet to initiate some rules for the Baby Jerusalem church? In Acts I means?<br><br>Yes,Jesus did said to not neglect the former! giving the tenth ie. Why didn't he said that it is as weightier but just without neglecting the former&lt; giving the tenth? or really He refers to the weightier matters of the heart matters= the Laws at its core? righteousness(justice)  Mercy(God's forgiveness and acceptance) faithfulness( or is it faith, a creed? or the faithfulness of God in keeping his promises to his people)<br>My own understanding of the context that the core of the Law  plus the the ceremonial laws of washings, sacrifices, offerings etc are for teaching them to relate to the Holiness of a fearful but merciful and All-Powerful God &gt; They were chosen to represent Him as a people but they failed even to accept the actual Reality of God in Person when Christ|Messiah came..John wrote they received him NOT.. or received him not but to them who received they became the children of God punishments. Tithing was to be given under the Law's obligations and never under Grace. Why did Jesus tell them Pharisee and scribes to give their obligations? the tenth of spices even? why? Simply to the Pharisee and the scribes.. U see? Not us &lt;<strong>believers</strong>&gt;<br><br>Thanks ...for attention?<br><br></div>

EH folks "brunch up" against you.....<br>2. There is no place for "newbie" to chat up....<br><br>In point 2, the implication is that EH is no place for a newbie like yourself to chat up.<br>You are obviously not a newbie, and under no circumstance did you state that you had another nick. Therefore you lied (perhaps unwittingly) about your status because you made no attempt to correct the misconception, leading the readers into thinking that you are truly a newbie.....<br><br>The synergy of a forum like this depends a lot on whom we are addressing to. Clones are typically condemned, not just here in EH but in each topic.<br><br>There are many good reasons why some forumites hold double identity:<br>1. Loss of password - Happy Harvest?<br>2. Change of mindset and refusal to be identified under the previus nick - Repented John<br>3. Left and return (and maybe forget password) - NT2<br><br>You don't have to like what I said, but it's the truth!</div>
