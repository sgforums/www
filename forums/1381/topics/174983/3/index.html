It occurs only once (Mark_7:11). It means a gift or offering consecrated to God. Anything over which this word was once pronounced was irrevocably dedicated to the temple. Land, however, so dedicated might be redeemed before the year of jubilee (Lev_27:16-24). Our Lord condemns the Pharisees for their false doctrine, inasmuch as by their traditions they had destroyed the commandment which requires children to honour their father and mother, teaching them to find excuse from helping their parents by the device of pronouncing "Corban" over their goods, thus reserving them to their own selfish use.<br><br>Tithe - a tenth of the produce of the earth consecrated and set apart for special purposes. The dedication of a tenth to God was recognized as a duty before the time of Moses. Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek (Gen_14:20; Heb_7:6); and Jacob vowed unto the Lord and said, "Of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee."<br></blockquote>The different between Corban and Tithe, is that the former is something that is being set aside (still in the person's own procession) while the latter is given away (no longer in the person's procession).<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Can they not also have investments and etc... to generate other outside income? Don't be too quick to judge.

Their members give in <strong>secret </strong> and designated money for needs and such without having once to pass the plate around? I have never seen their offering bags or plates! They had none!I am not criticising other churches and I know their Pastors needed to be paid, and i do support them too morally speaking&lt; they did a job, and they get their pay accordingly&gt;but it is important to know that your tithes and offerings to the Lord seemed to be out of a grudging one <strong>if God is imagined to require our goods</strong>&lt; Yes He is Lord of all things&gt;Must he insists that we are to tithe our money? It was true with ancient Israel, are we Jews or Christians? Anyone can gave a percentage of their  income faithfully - let it be according to THE HEART and not the LAW!<br>This is not a new issue, even in the New Testament epistles of Paul ours today seems to be like Charity shows!<br>Imagine how grudgingly we give, has it ever occur to anyone that God don't need money to survive? I can go to worship God without theat bother because worship includes giving, but it's always from the heart that counts!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In spite of the length of rebuttals and counter-rebuttals, I have to agree with MC and brey.... norey seems out of point. After reading through more than a couple of times, I still don't get what his point is..... seems that everyone's agreeing on the same thing yet want to rephrase each other's words for the heck of it.....<br><br>Just one question: if norey hadn't worked for 40 yrs? Can we safely assume that he is more than 60 yrs old considering that a normal adult will need to start work right after national service? If that being so, is it possible for a person to remain jobless for so long yet continue to enjoy having a lifelihood offered to him? As brey may have already mentioned, a person not working for 40 yrs is possibly an invalid.... but seeing that norey can cycle to AMK to deliver CNY stuff we can safely discount the disability angle.<br><br>Hmmmm.... must be one of the greater mysteries of life.....</div>
