            <div class='col-md body'>By the time the Lord made woman, he was into his  sixth day of working overtime.   An angel appeared and said, "Why  are you spending so much time on this one?"<br><br>And the Lord answered, "Have you seen my spec sheet  on her? She has to be completely washable, but not plastic,  have over 200 movable parts, all replaceable and able to run on diet coke and  leftovers, have a lap that can hold four children at one time, have a kiss that can  cure anything from a scraped knee to a broken heart-and she will do everything with only two hands."<br><br>The angel was astounded at the requirements. "Only two  hands!? No way! And that's just on the standard model? That's too much work for one day. Wait until tomorrow to finish."<br><br>But I won't," the Lord protested. "I am so close  to finishing this creation that is so close to my own heart. She already heals herself when she is sick AND can work 18 hour days."<br><br>The angel moved closer and touched the woman. "But you have made her so soft, Lord."<br><br>"She is soft," the Lord agreed, "but I have also made her tough. You have no idea what she can endure or accomplish.<br><br>" Will she be able to think?", asked the angel.<br><br>The Lord replied, "Not only will she be able to think, she will be able to reason and negotiate."<br><br>The angel then noticed something, and reaching out, touched the woman's cheek. "OOPS, it looks like you have a leak in this model. I told you  that you were trying to put too much into this one."<br><br>"That's not a leak," the Lord corrected,   "that's a tear !"<br><br>"What's the tear for?" the angel asked.<br><br>The Lord said, "The tear is her way of expressing her joy, her sorrow, her pain, her disappointment, her love, her loneliness, her  grief and her pride.! "<br><br>The angel was impressed. "You are a genius, Lord. You thought of everything! Woman is truly amazing."<br><br>And she is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Women have strengths that amaze men. They bear hardships and they carry burdens, but they hold happiness, love and joy.They smile when they want to scream. They sing when they want to cry. They cry when they are happy and laugh when they are nervous. They fight for what they believe in. They stand up to injustice. They  don't take "no" for an answer when they believe there is a better solution. They go without so their family can have.  They go to the doctor with a frightened friend. They love  unconditionally.They cry when their children excel and cheer when their friends get awards. They are happy when they hear about a birth or a wedding. Their hearts break when a friend dies. They grieve at the loss of a family member, yet they are strong when they think there is no strength left. They know that a hug and a kiss can heal a broken heart.<br><br>Women come in all shapes, sizes and colours. They'll drive, fly, walk, run or  e-mail you to show how much they care about you. The heart of a woman is   what makes the world keep turning. They bring joy, hope and love. They have compassion and ideals. They give moral support to their family and friends. Women  have vital things to say and everything to give.<br><br>HOWEVER, IF THERE IS ONE FLAW IN WOMEN, IT IS THAT THEY FORGET THEIR  WORTH.<br><br>PLEASE pass this along to all your women friends and relatives to remind them just how amazing they are ... also to some men to remind them to appreciate the women they have !!<br></div>
