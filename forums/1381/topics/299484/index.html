There is a bunch of people who believe that the moon landings were faked. They have all kinds of evidence for it. When people try to explain to them why their evidence is wrong, they accuse those people of being part of the conspiracy to fake the moon landings. The number of people who believe this is actually very small so not much effort is put into debunking their claims. A couple of astronomers have made the effort to carefully debunk all the claims, but overall, not much attention is paid to them because they don't do much harm.<br><br>However, let's say if millions of people believed this, considerably more effort would be put into explaining why the moon landings really did occur.</div>

The EO and Caths got a different OT Canon. I believe the EO has yet to make a definitive ruling on the OT Canon though most of them have 76 books.

While there were bishops or elders, the apostle Paul did not see these people as how we will see bishops today. Probably because parousia is near, there is no need for a clear hierarchy.<br><br>The Bishop of Rome, while not exercising any primacy, was certainly a respected figure, c.f. the Tome of Leo.</div>
