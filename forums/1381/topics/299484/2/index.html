            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Icemoon:</div><div class="quote_body">They early church resembled Protestant in the sense they had no definite hierarchy structure. While there were bishops or elders, the apostle Paul did not see these people as how we will see bishops today. Probably because parousia is near, there is no need for a clear hierarchy.<br><br>The Bishop of Rome, while not exercising any primacy, was certainly a respected figure, c.f. the Tome of Leo.</div></blockquote>If you mean the NT Church then it depends since everyone can intepretate it differently. Sure there is little difference between elders and bishops and most certainly zero mention of cardinals. But then again we have the so-called Petrine Verses such as Mat 16:18 which doesn't fit Protestantism theologies.<br><br>If you mean the early Christian Church during the chaotic 2nd century, then I beg to differ haha! By that era St Ignatius had clearly outlined the the three-fold office and Apostolic Succession were beginning to be preached.<br><br>The Bishop of Rome only truly began to exercise her primacy around the 3rd century onwards. We do have instances of Popes such as Pope Victor attempting to settle the Easter Controversy in 190AD but the Eastern Churches never did accepted his right to intervene. Pope Leo the Great was a clear example of not just Papal Primacy but rather Papal Supremacy. At times he seems more forceful than Vatican 1 haha!<br><br></div>
