              <p>There are increasingly more people on Earth today who are beginning to understand the future of Earth, which is why it's referred to as the "New Earth". However, different people have different understandings, so often describe it in different perspectives. But it can be summed up as the evolution of Earth, or Ascension.</p>
              <p>Though ideally, Ascension and the New Earth is meant for all on Earth, realistically, the consciousness level of majority of Mankind is not high enough. Unless they have a very determined intention to raise their consciousness level, and be prepared to understand the Truth of Earth, only a proportion of Earth's population will get to experience the New Earth. Others will probably do so in future lifetimes.</p>

              <p>Somewhere along those lines, but the book takes a 'consciousness' approach to religion. The author tells of the utmost importance of who you really are in the now, the present moment. Like how our 'self'-identities are in fact all but an illusion created by the ego. Basically, the real answer to 'who I am' is not your socially created definition of who you really are. Its not the voice in your head, but the life that is behind it and can only be felt in the present moment, not the past and not the future.</p>
              <p>The author often quotes from the Bible, and I do believe that his way of looking at certain Bible verses make for some very interesting perspectives on the good old verses.</p>

              <p>Life on Earth currently is effectively an illusion, as the entire way of life was intentionally manipulated eons ago to function in a certain way. It's difficult to explain this in detail here, but by this time next year, it'll be much easier for all to understand. No point debating over this now.</p>
              <p>Though we all like to think of ourselves as independent thinking persons, fact and truth is: most people are living according to "society's" prescribed way, not their chosen or best way. Hence, few people can truly live their life to their best potential, but simply to fit in with everyone else or "society". One aspect of regaining consciousness is to be able to understand one's true purpose of life, not the purpose "society" assigned to one, like the way a washing machine has been programmed to wash and spin only, nothing more, nothing less.</p>
