              <p style="text-align: justify;">Fire has always played an important and
              symbolic role in our history because of its divine origins and the
              sacred element associated with it. For these reasons, the Greeks
              maintained consistent fires in front of their principle temples in
              ancient Greece. This was also the case in the sanctuary of Olympia,
              where the Ancient Olympic Games took place. The flame was lit using an
              ancient method where the rays of the sun are reflected in a skaphia,
              the ancestor of the parabolic mirror used today for lighting the
              Olympic flame.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.singapore2010.sg/public/sg2010/en/en_youth_olympic_flame/en_history/MainPar/0/text_files/file1/jyof_3_flame_lighting_ceremony_in_greece.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="480" height="312"></p>
              <p>The
              modern Olympic flame is ignited in Olympia at the site where the temple
              of Hera used to stand, by an actress playing the part of the High
              Priestess using the same ancient method. It serves as a reminder of how
              fires were lit on the altars of Greek gods and goddesses to honour them.</p>
              <p>Above is taken from YOG official website :</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.singapore2010.sg/public/sg2010/en/en_youth_olympic_flame/en_history.html">http://www.singapore2010.sg/public/sg2010/en/en_youth_olympic_flame/en_history.html</a></p>
              <p>So the YOG is to honour Greek gods...... So should Christians (and Muslims) participate in the YOG?</p>
              <p>What do you think?</p>

              <p>Sorry to say but you have violated the censorship laws in singapore because you posted something that can cause conflict within Singapore's multi-racial community. You should really ask a priest/pastor/ustaz/imam about this. We as normal human beings might not know whether it's permitted in religion or not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From my view as a muslim, i don't think it's restricted as long as we know that we are not worshipping a different god from the one and true god that we truly worship. But i do have to argue with my own statement because some people might find it illogical as let's say if i'm muslim and i offer prayers to an idol (worshiping idol), it's a major sin and it's truly offensive to religion. If for YOG's case, if i carry the torch around the island, would you say i worship greek gods? It all comes down to intention and this applies to the policy of GOD KNOWS BEST!</p>

              <p>For TTFU's case, in Islam, music is a hot debate that still rages today. You can search on the permissibility of music in Islam but best you apporach a religious expert in this issue because there is no clear rulling on music. Some say is forbidden, some say is discouraged but all we know is, it's a hot topic.</p>

              <p>Thanks for this, what you say is true, sometimes it may not be your intention but the thing is how other people view it as such.</p>
              <p>Just to share a story, once there were two monks travelling together, a senior monk and a younger monk. They came to a river that was waist deep and with rushing waters.</p>
              <p>Beside the river was a woman. She was weak in body and had to travel across the river. As she could not do it on her own, she asked the senior monk to help carry her across. The senior monk agreed and helped her across by carrying her. Seeing this the younger monk was deeply angry with the senior monk.</p>
              <p>After crossing the river the woman said goodbye to the two monks and went on their way.</p>
              <p>The two monks continued to travel on their own way, and all the while the younger monk had a scowl and infuriated look on his face. The older monk sensing the younger monks displeasure asked after a long while why the younger monk was so unhappy.</p>
              <p>"You as a monk should not lay your hands on a woman," shouted the younger monk. "Yet you not only touched the woman and carried her as well. Do you not feel ashamed?"</p>
              <p>The older monk replied,"I stopped carrying the woman after the river already, why are you still carrying her inside your heart?"</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Fire is important to chinese people. We burn stuff as offering

              <p>So yeah, all christian should avoid YOG. and fire. and
              non-christians. seriously, just stay at home, away from everyone
              else. If you live in HDB, jump out of the windows, there are too
              many hindus, muslim and buddhist around.</p>

              <p>Firstly, I think you know that is a sweeping statement by

              <p>And what is this thing about fire being important to chinese
              people hence Christians should aboid fire? Being a Christian or
              non-Christian is not about race. In fact, so is the case for many
              other beliefs and religions.</p>
              <p>I really hope that you will meet more Christians who do not
              conform to your stereotypes. Just as importantly I hope you are
