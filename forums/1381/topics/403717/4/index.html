              <p>That's your best logical debate? You are as good at it as your
              mother is beautiful, and your mother is damn ugly.</p>
              <p>And your insistence that someone that don't agree with you
              supports PAP? You are as mature as your dick is long, and your dick
              is so short that kids laugh at it.</p>
              <p>Am I trying to debate with you rationally? No, because that's
              not your intention, you just want alot of people to insult you and
              call you names, and you will get it.</p>
              <p>And oh, religion-bias or not, I am certainly bias against
              retards... like you.</p>

She could indeed be worse than that.</p>
              <p>Well, that someone is me! You are not capable of rational debate. You PAP lackey! Your biggest mistake is to resort to calling names. The few 'real' people who support you are cretins. just like you. Cretins interbreed with cretins.  Welcome to the cretins'club!</p>
              <p>When you start the name calling first, you lost control. Now I'm in control. Believe me. It's true. It doesn't end with your mother! I want to fuck your grandmother too!</p>

              Cause I admit I did mention about people being anti Christian. Given the recent hoo haa in here.
              
              So I asked lo. 
              
              If I was wrong in my understanding, please, feel free to correct me.
