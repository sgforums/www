            <div class='col-md body'>After reading much of stupidissmart's <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=74489&amp;page=5" rel="nofollow">thread</a> on whether religion is still relevent after science, here are some of my thoughts.<br><br>Religion is 1st invented by people who used God to explain things that they dun understand.(eg. thunder n lightling) when science became more advanced, and started to explain these phenomenons, ppl start to believe in God less. But certain groups refuses to give up the immense power n wealth they have amassed thru the ignorance of ppl and keep pointing to other things that 'have not' been explained by science(note, i use 'have not' not 'cannot') and try to keep ppl believing in God, as well as stressing that 'their' religion is the one 'TRUE' religion. I'm not against any specific religion when I say this(though it might be seen as pointing to the churches <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ), jus wat I see from a sociological point of view.<br><br>Personally, I have nothing against religion. I think religion should simply be something to base ur faith in, something to give u strength when u believe u are receiving help from a 'higher' source. I am not a believer/practitioner of any faith, rather, I respect all faithes. I dun eat pork when I'm with my muslim frens, no beef wif my buddist frens and try to speak politically correctly when I'm wif my christian frens <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Obession wif religion has certainly IMO become a serious issue. It is certainly unhealthy, as we can see from the terrorist attacks against 'non-muslims' countries or even the local case of the embezzlement case of the pastor which happen cos ppl believe too much in the 'strenth(?)' of their religion group, or the many stories of abuse(sexual or otherwise) by high ranked members of religious group.<br><br>to sum it up, wat i think is tat religion MAY really become obsolete in time to come, although many powerful groups will be unwilling to accept it and give up their power. Believe in wat u may, but do not force ur views on others, and there is no one REAL/CORRECT religion no matter how much u want to believe it to be.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh.. this is a never ending battle with the same topics coming up over and over again. But nvm.. God will prevail. Being a science student myself.. I understand how fallable science is.. in fact ask any lecturer for yourself. Dun get me mistaken.. science is not BadÂ… look at all the medical advances and the lives that are saved. But why do ppl rather believe that the world was created by chance (evolutionists) rather than by God (creationist)<br><br>In 1925 .. with the publishment of space trial.. most scintist agreed that the universe was unlimited. However.. thanks to Einstein.. we now know that tthere was a beginning!<br><br>First evolutionÂ… through advances in biochemistry.. we know and have mapped out 3.2 billion base pairs of precisely oriented, precisely placed human DNA. Through the use of telescopic machinery.. we can gauge that the universe existed for about 15 billiob years.<br><br>Now comes the problems.. how did the first single cell organism with (rough estimate) 50,000 base pairs.. become 3.2 billion? .. where did the extra 3 billion base pair come from?<br><br>Lets first rule out DarwinÂ’s natural selection.. natural selection can only cause a change in the existing DNAÂ’s information. So where did the mechanism for the additional 3 billion + base pair come from?<br><br>This is not all.. the first cells were asexualÂ… meaning that through binary fusion.. they split in 2 to reproduce. But the cells existing in humans are eukaryotic. Mening that through mitosis, individual male and female cells exchange gamates to reproduce (put it crudely sperm and egg). According to modern theories.. eukaryotic cells allows for change.. not asexual cells. BÂ’coz,  asexual cells are an exact replica of each other. While eukaryotic cells allows the xÂ’change of DNA info. So then how did evolution come around??<br>How did the single asexual cell redevelop?<br><br>In addition to that.. if according to macro-evolution.. the first living organism were evolved from chemicals. How did that happen? These are processes that science cannot answer. They can just guess.<br><br>The problem with evolution is that ppl tend to look at the later processes of apes to humans.. not from cells. Micro evolution is possible.. but macro.. its almost impossible. The possibility of all these becoming one is 1 out of 10 (add another 40 thousand zeroÂ’s behind 10) . Yet ppl choose to believe this possibility. NOW thatÂ’s what I call faith.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>this is my first post! kind of excited kakaa. This is really an interesting topic and evolution has always intruiged me. I am a neutral but one thing occurs to me.<br><br>Malboro, songs has stated in his first post how impossible macro evolution is. He wrote some information about how single cells reproduced themselves. Why did you choose to ignore the whole thread but focus on his second thread which is clearly an analogy?<br>Furthermore, what you mentioned is clearly contradictory. A human being is far more complex than a watch. Thus, wouldn't forming a watch be easier than the formation of the human race? You seem more bias than him, attacking a few points and ignoring all the scientific facts. You haven't answered his questions on evolution yet.<br>You also forget that he is a Christian. So your arguement on science explaining the creation on God and all that sexual things are out. He believes that God created everything. That is the basic Christian belief right? In any case, I am in a debating team actually, and your tone of arguement is offensive. Will you be pleased if i use words like orphan on you? There should be ethics to follow.<br><br>Songs, why are you running away by choosing not to post anymore. It seems like you are admitting defeat? Besides that, your analogy, although a bit bias, was quite funny. Are you into Psychology? Because the method you used, in debating terms is called the intuitive analogy. Please continue posting. I think i can learn a lot here.<br><br>Kudos,<br>Warrior!<br><br></div>

He wrote some information about how single cells reproduced themselves. Why did you choose to ignore the whole thread but focus on his second thread which is clearly an analogy?<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">honestly, i'm not much of a science student, i'm a sociology student <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>therefore, in terms of the evolution n stuff, i admit i dun know much, i did not refute his views.<br></span><br>Furthermore, what you mentioned is clearly contradictory. A human being is far more complex than a watch. Thus, wouldn't forming a watch be easier than the formation of the human race?<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">i dun see how i'm being contradictory. A living thing can change/evolve, but a non-living thing simply cant. Animals living in cold env grow more fur, change their fur color seasonally, this is a fact.</span><br><br>You seem more bias than him, attacking a few points and ignoring all the scientific facts. You haven't answered his questions on evolution yet.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">as i said, my point of view is purely sociological</span><br><br>You also forget that he is a Christian. So your arguement on science explaining the creation on God and all that sexual things are out. He believes that God created everything. That is the basic Christian belief right?<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">so a christian n their beliefs cannot be wrong? I believe that all things in life shd be free, do i just go into any shop n take wat i wan, n if arrested, i simply tell them god meant for things to be free for all, so payment does not apply to me?</span><br><br>In any case, I am in a debating team actually, and your tone of arguement is offensive. Will you be pleased if i use words like orphan on you? There should be ethics to follow.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">maybe my tone is offensive? perhaps i guess. I'm jus pissed at the way he ended his post, simply saying he's right n tats it. i welcome a good discussion or argument anytime, not a shout n run attitude. btw, when i used the term orphan, i am not refering to him. I'm jus saying if someone(in this case god) has no parents, is he an orphan? cos we know god is jesus father, i'm jus asking if god has its father. I dun see which code of ethics i broke.<br></span><br><br>Songs, why are you running away by choosing not to post anymore. It seems like you are admitting defeat? Besides that, your analogy, although a bit bias, was quite funny. Are you into Psychology? Because the method you used, in debating terms is called the intuitive analogy. Please continue posting. I think i can learn a lot here.<br><br>Kudos,<br>Warrior!<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

I'm not saying thats the definite truth or that there is no afterlife, i, like everyone else do not know(even if they shd claim otherwise). I agree that science n religion can co-exist, and i'm not trying to make anyone turn against their religion n beliefs, i jus feel that one needs to look at things from more than a single-minded perspective.<br><br>my qns is simply one that has religion become an obsession?<br><br>In sociology, we always say that there is no one true or real theory. many diff theories are put forward for ppl to debate and the merits n flaws of each theories are dissected and the 'best' theory is accepted until the next 'better' one comes along. but when it comes to religion, ppl simply become very single-minded in defending their beliefs without considering any other possibilities. I'm jus trying to make ppl see there COULD be something else other than what they believe in if they could only care to open their minds to it.<br></div>

Correct me if I am wrong, Christians are taught to center their lives around Christ. Thus, Christians live for Christ and to spread his word. To categorise it as an obsession would be quite offending. It's a matter of perspective. One thing though, that has me convinced about the spiritual realm, is the miracles that happen. Furthermore it is impossible that all these cases of healings are fraud. Maybe one or two, but to throw away all claims as fraud is a show of ammeturism.

In fact there is a famous one in America that cheats money and leaving their clients believing they r cured and refuse medications. If there is really such miracles happening, then there wouldn't be dead christians isn't it ? Why some christians get miracle heal while the other have to die ? Lastly, there r also miracle "revivals" from non christians too. They r proclaim dead which minutes after they woke up. Why ?<br><br>If u ask me... they really means nothing... miracles, or a very low probability of it occuring still happened in real world if u do not know...<br><br><blockquote>Correct me if I am wrong, the Christian belief is that God is omnipotent. That means he doesn't need a creator. A question i ask myself, at the end of my life, what happens? Does everything end? </blockquote>Well, people r arguing tat all things need to be created. However God cannot be created since it is "omnipotent". So in short u guys admitted tat not <strong>all</strong> things in life has to be created by someone. Why not just admit that the universe is uncaused and cut out the middleman ?<br><br>BTW.. I have to say it again... u say God is omni potent because christian <strong>believe</strong> in it. How well do u know God ? How do u know he is omni potent ? Where do u get tis information ? Probably from the bible. The bible says the heart is the center of thinking, not the brain. Is tat true ?

If I believe wat I like, then I will believe I am Bill Gates, damn rich and damn successful. HOwever fact is I am not. Same as religion and afterlife. U like to believe in afterlife, however the truth exists no matter wat u believe.

Deep down in everyone heart they knew the end is the end. Or they don't believe in it as deeply as they should<br><br>Science, if true can prove religion to be wrong. Like the heart thingy explains above. If evolution is true and we r from monkeys, it proves tat God never meant to create Man in the first place. If science proves the Big Bang theory (actually it is proved), tat just means God never created the universe in the first place.

This is your only chance, you only live once. </blockquote>here is one answer<br><br>http://freethought.freeservers.com/reason/againstrel.html<br><br>Many freethinkers believe that some religions are inherently harmful to humanity, and that just as believers have a right to express their views on religion, freethinkers have a right, and sometimes even a moral responsibility, to let their views be heard. Here are some examples of how religion is harmful: Religion often encourages bigotry, hatred and intolerance; it often prevents rational discussion of important issues such as abortion and euthanasia; it has inspired many wars and continues to make peace very difficult to achieve in such places as Northern Ireland and the Middle East; it often inspires religious zealots to commit acts of terrorism; it often tends to destroy its believers' sense of personal responsibility; and it is often mentally and emotionally unhealthy. Of course, religion is not all bad, but we still have an obligation to speak out against the aspects of religion that are harmful.<br><br>personally, I just can't stand the way christians r throwing their time, moeny and effort in something tat is certain to be wrong. I feel sad tat they r wasting these resources and got cheated for their whole lives in believing a heaven where it never exists. I also feel anger tat christians r trying to convert people over to their religion, and sometimes using methods most undesirable. I also can't stand the attitude of some christian in which they view unbelievers who r "stubborn and not open minded". I also cannot stand people who impose their "law" by refering to their bibles and reading using their own interpretations. Some of the laws like "cannot dye hair as u r betraying God gift to u", "killing people is okie as God will forgive me of my sins" or "wrote in technical reports all the things God has given us for the first para" or "cannot masterbate and wear condoms or go for abortions". Frankly these piss me off<br><br><blockquote>Like what Singaporetyrranosaurus has said, he has seen enough to believe in Christ.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>i have something to add. Do you think that subconciously, in everyone of us, we believe in a God. Why do i say this? Because, lets say if we are at a dead end, or down with bad illnesses that medicine can't cure, it is natural that we will pray and ask for a miracle. This is my view. What about the rest</blockquote>Tat is because they r desperate. People trapped in collapsed buildings have to eat their shit and drink their urine. It is because subconciously they believe shit and urine is good for their body ?<br><br>Subconsciencely all people know tat death is the end of everything. Tat is why people, even if they r religious, fears death. Tat is why they go to see doctor instead of letting nature takes its course. If God want u to die because of this sickness, why do u want to cause a delay ?</div>
