            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>if all life evolved from a single cell, how did emotions come about? how did morals come about</blockquote>Emotions is always there. I had explain why wrath need to exists before. When there is pain, all living things will feel sad too. Why is there pain ? it is like sensors around the body which tell u where is wrong. It also encourage animals not to do anything tat causes them pain, so make them better survivors. Happiness occurs is when they found food. As such, animals will keep finding food to survive. When u slowly kill a pig (in some countryside they just take a knife and keep cutting them to kill them) they will fear u and try to run around the fence crying and oinking. Again this is there to make them better survivors. If they have no fear, they do not run after they r hurt. Tat make them worse survivors.<br><br>Morals r there because we lived in a group.<br><br>Wolves have their own code of group ethics. When they hunt and found food, they will bring the food over to the den when everyone shares it. They could have ate the food themselves, but they share it because they knwo the importance of living in a group. When a deer in a group spots a predator, they will sound an alarm to warn others to flee too. Why warn others ? If that deer didn't the others will stay there and get eaten by the predator which ensures his safe escape. More complex beings will have more complex moral code. This is there because we r living in a group and have to live in a manner which is not going to go badly in the group.<br><br>Come to this point, why is there emotions according to bible ? Why are there morals ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yah, from the way you answer questions, i can tell you are neither a science student nor an open minded individual. You close yourself to all alternatives except your own ideals. Your battering is senseless because you keep piling information from your sources and insist that other sources are wrong. Your defense at many points seems so laughable and your logic incoherent. Take some time and read your old posts. At times, its not consistent and quite funny. Even science is not sure of macroevolution, but yet you, who isn't even a scientist, fight for that belief without evaluating other alternatives.<br><br>Furthermore, I have only been to chruches a few times and i don't see anybody there that is sulking or that doesn't want to be there. They are happy, don't you see it. I guess you are too bias and insistent on imposing you views on others. If you can spend your time at a karaoke singing songs, why can't you spend your time in church to be with all your family and friends? You just don't see it do you?<br><br>Btw, is Icemoon a Muslim?</div>

The information I am piling up is evidence about the one tat were given to me by other people had flaws. If u r open minded, u will take the time to read though them and see why tis is so. If my logic is laughable and incoherent, maybe u can take the time and tell me about it ? Science is not sure of macro evolution ? I got an article tat says it is already sure. It even explains some of the information about wat others said has flaws. Does it need a scientist to know how to read ?

They will be free.<br><br>Just think about it, for non christian they can study fully for exam during exam period.

Wat disrespectful thing had I said, other than he swindler thingy ? I be frank to u I really can't find another word tat matches tis desciption but phrase it in a nice way.<br></strong></blockquote>You are obviously entitled to your opinion of whether Jesus is a swindler or not. What would you say if we make the same pronouncement on someone your love? Perhaps, your parents....<br>Please, don't get me wrong here. Just trying to illustrate a point. By your definition, calling someone a swindler is NOT name calling? Do bear in mind that the name Jesus is very dear to the people in Eternal Hope. If you do not agree to the faith that the Christians, here in Eternal Hope and elsewhere is professing, than stay out.<br><blockquote><strong><br>U r obviously mistaken about the real world. People have been asking them to go to church, asking people to watch Passion of Christ, knocking door to door asking people to go to church, camps and fairs and school pursuading people to go to church and peopel r encouraged to bring their friends over etc. Can u say none of these happened ?<br></strong></blockquote>Herein you are again mistaken. Asking people to go to church, watching the Passion, knocking on doors IS NOT CONVERSION. It is merely allowing the non-believers to have an opportunity to experience Christian fellowship and teaching. The commandment given to Christians by Jesus is to "go forth and tell the world" NOT CONVERT the world. We are to spread the good news. Whether, you as an individual, believe in this good news is another matter.<br><blockquote><strong><br>It may be pointless to u but it may means something for those on the line. There were people tat used to read sources from christian sides about christ historical links or evolution. It is refreshing to hear wat the freethinker views on such information isn't it ? It is good for everybody to hear both sides of the stories.<br></strong></blockquote>It becomes pointlless when a discussion turns into an argument. Here is not to say that I do not value comments to, say, forumites like Marlboro and Ventin. I believe all will agree that the postings of these individuals are more enquiring than argumentative in nature. Even within the Christian community, there are differing opinions on evolution, creation etc. But the moment any posting becomes relentless argumentative than it becomes pointless.<br><blockquote><strong><br>Well, say tat to the people tat want to convert freethinkers into christians. I do not know how disrespectful I had got, or how much u desire. If I had to say out my views I had to say it out straight. I don't like to beat around the bush and confuse the readers in the end</strong></blockquote>There are many ways to make a statement. You can ask politely or you can demand. But what you give is what you get. Please, may I advice that if you wish to pursue this topic further, do not ever, ever make derogatory remarks about Jesus.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
