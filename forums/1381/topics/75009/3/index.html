Back to the point of "conversion": say you want to invite a girl to your home with the intention of introducing her to your parents hopefully leading to marriage. Going to your home does not make her your wife. She will NOT become a member of your family unless she AGREES to marry you.

Herein, it is not to state that the first man looked like Mr Universe. He might very well looked like all the archaelogical findings on human specie.

There are much more contradictions on tis webite<br><br>http://ffrf.org/lfif/?t=contra.txt<br><br>Good point ! Either believe in it totally or don't believe it at all.<br><br>If u believe in bible totally, then u have to believe tat our heart acts as the brain and bats is a bird, not a mammal and women who aren't virgins on their marriage have to be stoned to death. Is all written in the bible isn't it ? </div></blockquote>For starters, as you have given a site with the contradictions, allow me to point to you a site that attempts to address such contradictions: http://www.carm.org/index.html. While I harbour little hope of you going into this site to learn, I still need to point out to you that there is such a site. For most parts you have taken the verses quoted beyond the cultural and literal context it was intended to be read. While there are many parts of the scripture were written to teach, other parts of scripture (many you have quoted) were written as part of history and was meant not be misconstrued as a lesson of life. To go on any further for me here, is beyond what I capable, scholastically speaking, of going into.<br>When reading scripture, one must also take into consideration the limitation of the languages. An example of which is the word love: which in the English language has only one word, wherein, in Greek there is agape, eros, phileo, and a couple of others that I do not remember. Let me just say that neither you and I has the scholastic ability to fully comprehend the language of scripture. All you have done is taken into consideration information gleaned from some, obviously, anti-Christian website and present them as your personal knowledge. To be able to make a really unbias decision, at least tell me you will visit the site that I'd given you at the beginning of this note and read the write-ups.<br><br>Having said all that, here is where I mean that it has become pointless. You obviously have your preconceived idea of how to deal with religion. While I respect your right to have such view, I am seeing that your entire string of posting does not contain any inclination towards enquiring but is just a string of rebuttals and objections.<br><br>I admit that I am not equipped with sufficient wisdom and knowledge to deal with your objections, however it is my sincere hope that at least we can walk out of this in an amicable manner, you with your personal view of the religious realm, and me with the faith of a God whom I believe is real, regardless of what others may think.<br><br>Good day, stupidissmart.<br></div>
