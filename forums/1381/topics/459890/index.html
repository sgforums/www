              Many orthodox religion followers are afraid to go against or let go of their religion doctrinaires because they are afraid of going to Hell and you cannot blame them. One question, " Would you go against your own religion precepts to know the truth?"

              There are many Singaporeans who actually discuss about Afterlife without referring their belief inaccordance to their religion upbringing. Most of them are intellectual individuals and usually they are quite conservative on matters like this so to speak.

            <div class='col-md body'>My opinion is simple and it is a fact. Once our body are buried or cremeted, the physical body will become organic matter....Dust to Dust, Ashes to Ashes...However, the life force or soul that we call it, it doesn't dies because it is an energy and you can't destroyed an energy. It has to return to somewhere. That energy is your memory of your life...it will always be yours throughout eternity.</div>

              It's minority of scientists that deluded to believe in heaven and hell...  Some saw Jesus, some saw Buddha, some saw Allah and so on...  they all said their dreams are damn real... so who is right..
              
              Look at all other brain surgeons that make research on brain, and what are their conclusions.
              
              Dreams can be so real, so true, so vivid, so undeniable, so mysteriously prophetical.. but able to see them rationally as just dreams and hallucinations is another thing..  Well he maybe never experience such a dream before .. against another person who can dream vividly a lot... so can a bit pardon him of being hysterical of his own dream.
              
              Again, if you embrace emptiness as matter of wisdom of life, of course to you the dreams are indeed dreams and even if you awake from your dream and walk around on this earth, you will also agree this human life is also a dream.... But this is not wisdom or either wise... it is ignorance instead, which you like to glory it as wisdom.
              
              What we dream in the night when we are asleep are confined to the laws of our brain and defintely no proof whatsoever that it is linked to some other dimensional worlds...
              When we awake and walk around, we are confined to the scientific laws of this world.  Beyond this, I do not want to explain... becos it does not matter..
              
              If you think Christianity or Islam ought to be your way of life, good.. then do show the good works demanded ... seriously let me be super exaggerating that 99.9999999% 
              is not even knowing and doing a pinch of the good demanded by their religion.  Let's don't waste time on difference on belief teachings blah blah...

              <p>My opinion is simple and it is a fact. Once our body are buried or cremeted, the physical body will become organic matter….Dust to Dust, Ashes to Ashes…However, the life force or soul that we call it, it doesn’t dies because it is an energy and you can’t destroyed an energy. It has to return to somewhere. That energy is your memory of your life…it will always be yours throughout eternity.</p>

              This kind of phenomenon incidences usually cannot be regard as evidence or proof or scientific proof because there isn't any facts to be seen. So unfortunately many would see it as just a story without any facts eventhough it come from a near death experiencer who is a doctor or a scientist.

              They say when you use 100% of your mind power, its like listening something within you. Its amazing famous people like Helen Killer the famous author of many books in the past was blind but she could magnificently wrote many great stories. Beethoven, who was deaf, could compose the famous Fifth Symphany music.
                          
              The conscious mind is only awake when we are awake while the subconscious mind is always awake though we are asleep e.g. controls your breathing while you are sleeping. So maybe those really intelligent or genius people are still using their mind while asleep.
