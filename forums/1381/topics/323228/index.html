              <p>It's the same thing with asking why do you pay your taxes to the government. Well the govt needs the money to run the country on the people's behalf. The Vatican needs the money to manage the Catholic churches all over the world. The priests in Catholic church don't have family to give their inheritance to and they don't accumulate personal wealth that is.</p>
              <p>So you are saying that in every Protestant church the use of money is transparent? But is it the case? Do the protestant priests always give to the poor? I've seen quite a few Protestant priests who live a life of luxury. Benny Hin for example. Not that I'm against it but it seems rather odd to spend the congregation's money on luxurious lifestyle while they could be used for other nobler things. It's theoretically God's money right? But God never actually took the money because God never needed them.</p>

              <p>It's the same thing with asking why do you pay your taxes to the
              government. Well the govt needs the money to run the country on the
              people's behalf. The Vatican needs the money to manage the Catholic
              churches all over the world. The priests in Catholic church don't
              have family to give their inheritance to and they don't accumulate
              personal wealth that is.</p>
              <p>So you are saying that in every Protestant church the use of
              money is transparent? But is it the case? Do the protestant priests
              always give to the poor? I've seen quite a few Protestant priests
              who live a life of luxury. Benny Hin for example. Not that I'm
              against it but it seems rather odd to spend the congregation's
              money on luxurious lifestyle while they could be used for other
              nobler things. It's theoretically God's money right? But God never
              actually took the money because God never needed them.</p>

              <p>really??cath priests no accumulate wealth??remember joachim kang??hes cmg out u knw..</p>
              <p>i dun say protestants are good too..by nw i tot u would have understand me to b neutral among christiandom since my stand is that mordern christiandom is flawed terribly..</p>
              <p>i dun knw wtf is benny hin..if not wrong hes the faith healer??aint faith healer supposed to heal faith??wats he curing cancers for?</p>
              <p>back then economy was very diff..a man of God with 2 sheeps can have much more very quickly.now a man of God with 2 dollars most probably will lose the 2 dollars to GST immediately.</p>
              <p>churches are still collectin money from members to run the church building,pay for their own living expenses.pretty much like monks collectin alms.tats all they need...</p>
              <p>church leaders collect much much more and living lives of luxuries frm members money should be shot.</p>

              <p>Jesus said this:</p>
              <h5>The Widow's Offering</h5>
              <p>Jesus
              sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched
              the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich
              people threw in large amounts. But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins,<sup> </sup>worth only a fraction of a penny.</p>
              <p>Calling
              his disciples to him, Jesus said, "<strong>I tell you the truth, this poor
              widow has put more into the treasury than all the others</strong>. They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything—all she had to live on."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jesus knows that the temple jews were money grubbing evil men. Jesus knew that the money would most probabily end up in their pockets and misused.</p>
              <p>But Jesus also knew the heart of the giver. He knew the widow's intention is to give to God. I bet the widow also knew that the money would most probably be swallowed up by the greedy pharasees. But her intention is to love God and do the right thing.</p>
              <p>And Jesus honoured that.</p>

              <p> n i told the city harvest guy that their church is as grand as the temples in JC's days.except i didnt go on to say JC also thrashed them out of the holy temple.</p>
              <p>my point is people of God must understand that the material wealth they gave to their organization means that they appreciated the grace of God in that humans have whatever they own becuz of God and his creations..to give back to God means we appreciate that undeserved loving kindness..</p>
              <p>however,many people give blindly.or were deceived with the wrong dotrine and twisted words to give freely..</p>
              <p>i dont really mean only rich people will receive all the blessing or i would not have put ".."...</p>
