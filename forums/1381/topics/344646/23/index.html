              <p>the trinity is not being taught in the bible..but from mouths of men that deviated from the early christians..never did Jesus claim Godhood..and evidence point clearly to who is God and who is god..so im agreeing with the bible that the father,son and holy spirit does not form the trinity.God is never a trinue being..Jesus is never the creator..the almighty abba father..he can never be..though i believe he died willingly for all humans..The Father God...Yahweh/Jehovah is the true living almighty God..and only to him should humans worship..these are not what i say..but what the bible says..</p>

              <p>Hey guys, lets have a real metaphysical discusion here.</p>
              <p>I'm not going to focus on the metaphysical term of God and such, because thats not in the realm of the physical. I'm focusing on the physical aspect of christianity, the bible. Here's my top 5 reasons on why the bible is completely utterly rubbish.</p>
              <p>5.        If Heaven is eternal, why create the Earth? If you're going to put us here for a little 90 years and then send us to heaven and hell for eternity, why not just put us in heaven in the first place? If you say that Earth is just a test for us for god to judge, Why create the rest of the universe? You could test us without the billions of galaxies out there.</p>
              <p>4.        You say God is really good. Wrong. Hell is a place where you suffer forever. And ever.

              <p>Hey guys, lets have a real metaphysical discusion here.</p>
              <p>I'm not going to focus on the metaphysical term of God and such,
              because thats not in the realm of the physical. I'm focusing on the
              physical aspect of christianity, the bible. Here's my top 5 reasons
              on why the bible is completely utterly rubbish.</p>
              <p>5.        If Heaven is
              eternal, why create the Earth? If you're going to put us here for a
              little 90 years and then send us to heaven and hell for eternity,
              why not just put us in heaven in the first place? If you say that
              Earth is just a test for us for god to judge, Why create the rest
              of the universe? You could test us without the billions of galaxies
              out there.</p>
              <p>4.        You say God is
              really good. Wrong. Hell is a place where you suffer forever. And
              ever. Even if you stole a packet of noodles or killed 10 people,
              you would still go to hell. Thats like the death sentence because
              you forgot to hand up homework. And the point of punishment is for

              <p>If god judges, then he is certainly a very inept judge.  Just open your eyes and look around you - poverty, disasters, wars all causing miseries and loss of human lives everywhere. I am very sure among the sufferers they must be some pious christians.  Why an omni-everything judge causes destructions so indiscriminately.  Or is he just want to fast-track those unfortunate, but pious christian to the kingdom of heaven? Even if this is the case, why  must he cause so much miseries to all the others when not everybody who suffered at his hands is as godless as I am.  Even if the god of Christianity is real, such an evil, tyrannical should not deserve the respect of a rational being.</p>

              <p>God is more than love and mercy, the bible also says he is holy. Leviticus 19:2.</p>
              <p>He is just, his love was expressed in the gift of his son Jesus as the means of redemption. anyone that rejects this gift rejects being redeem, he will fall under God's judgement. the "widely read" John 3:16</p>
              <p>we can't escape the laws that govern our universe. we need such things as gravity, weather and fire to survive. but they can lead to tragedy. read matt 5:45</p>
              <p>we are a social race. our lives are intertwined, so we sometimes suffer when the sin or foolishness of others spread trouble. read 1 corinthians 12:26</p>
              <p>sin brought brought a curse on the earth and it's people. this curse includes disease ans death. genesis 3:15-24</p>
              <p>suffering awakens compassion. jesus told us to care for those who suffer in poverty, we are his partners in helping others. luke 10:33-35</p>

              ever. Even if you stole a packet of noodles or killed 10 people,
              you would still go to hell. Thats like the death sentence because
              you forgot to hand up homework. And the point of punishment is for
              people to repent, to not make the same mistake again. Instead, you
              make them suffer for eternity, with no chance of repenting. Thats
              not punishment, thats cruel torture. By god, who is supposed to be
              "love"</p>
              <p>3.        Noah's Ark. By all
              accounts, it has been calculated that it would take 3 times the
              volume of all the water on Earth in order to flood the Earth the
              way the bible describes it. Since water didn't come from space or
              the ground, it couldn't have happened. Also, for anyone who has
              taken sec 2 bio, 2 animals could NEVER repopulate the entire Earth.
              If you learned ecosystems, you would know that it would take 1 ton
              of grass to support 10 zebras which could only support 2 lions. Now
              you have 2 zebras and 2 lions on the ship. Who's gonna survive?
              Neither.</p>
              <p>2.         Evolution.
              Lets face it. You're not going to pass O level Bio by
              writing "God did it".</p>
              <p>1.         God himself.
              The bible describes him as "knows everything and sees everything".
              Well, then why does he get angry when Eve eats the forbidden fruit?
              He would have known she would have eaten the fruit. But then why
              didn't he kill the snake or put the fruit somewhere else? Because
              he didn't know? Because he couldn't do it? Both are the only
              answers, and yet, both answers prove that he cannot exist.</p>
              <p>Oh and don't tell me "god works in mysterious ways..." Cos the
              right answer is not that, the right answer is "I don't know, lets
              find out" That phrase has propelled science all this way and lets
              you read this post on the computer that science created, not
              god.</p>

              <p>So you are a science buff eh?</p>
              <p>So, you must also acknowledge that science has not prove a thing yet that God doesn't exist. The missing link in human evolution is still missing.</p>
              <p>Heard of the 'Ardi' find? It's going to rewrite the evolution theory again.</p>
              <p>The Christians belief in God is based on faith and trust. What trust?</p>
              <p>"God will bless those who bless the Jews and curse those who curse the Jews."</p>
              <p>You can destroy the Christians' trust by seeking to destroy the Jews. If anyone succeed in doing that, I think that will be the evidence that the Christians need to convince themselves that God does not exist.</p>
              <p>Or you can make use of your science knowledge to continue searching for proof that God does not exist. Do let us know when it's a success.</p>

              <p>So you are a science buff eh?</p>
              <p>So, you must also acknowledge that science has not prove a thing
              yet that God doesn't exist. The missing link in human evolution is
              still missing.</p>
              <p>Heard of the 'Ardi' find? It's going to rewrite the evolution
              theory again.</p>
              <p>The Christians belief in God is based on faith and trust. What
              trust?</p>
              <p>"God will bless those who bless the Jews and curse those who
              curse the Jews."</p>
              <p>You can destroy the Christians' trust by seeking to destroy the
              Jews. If anyone succeed in doing that, I think that will be the
              evidence that the Christians need to convince themselves that God
              does not exist.</p>
              <p>Or you can make use of your science knowledge to continue
              searching for proof that God does not exist. Do let us know when
              it's a success.</p>

              <p>'Ardi' will require a relook into the origin of evolution of homosapien but it does not disprove the concept of evolution.  It is still consistent with the idea that human beings were evolved from some earlier primitive animals.  This is certainly more credible that the the creation myth with explicitly states that evolution of species stoped after the 6-day creation and the earth is only 6000+ years old.</p>
              <p>Nobody will attempt to destroy you cherished religion but it cannot stop people deserting your religion.  In America(a Xtian nation, you may want to think), more and more young people are turnung away from Christianity. In Europe most people openly profess they do not believe in a personalised god, And you may not aware the former Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church,1992-2000, Richard Holloway openly described himself as 'After-Religionist'.</p>
              <p>By the way if you looking for evidence that god doesnot exist, I am afraid you are going to be disappointed simply because you cannot prove something which does not exist. Just try to prove to me that our national icon the Merlion does not exist.</p>

              <p>Read Genesis before your claim that earth is only 6000+ years old. In the begining is not 6000 + years ago.</p>
              <p>If it cannot be proven that God does not exist, why are you so sure that God does not exist? That's so convinient. So, by simply saying that God doesn't exist exonerates science buffs from searching for evidence?. </p>
              <p>Ardi was discovered in the 90s but the discovery could not be hidden
              any longer. It will rewrite the evolution theory, that's for sure.
              Continue to find the missing links. Don't give up. The evolution theory still cannot explain the origin of life.</p>
              <p>As more prehistoric animals taught to be extinct are discovered today, the evolution theory will also evolve with the new find.</p>
              <p>I believe that there's a creator and there's no need for me to look for evidence that God doesn't exist. You should.</p>
              <p>Here's the proof. As long as the promise to the Jews is kept, that's the reason to believe that the promise to Christians will also be honoured.</p>
