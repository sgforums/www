              <p>Why Virgin Mary is called Virgin Mary? She gave birth right?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">She was virgin when Jesus was born.... it is more like a venerable title than anything else.</span> </p>
              <p>Why are there so many different version of testaments? New and old. What to believe?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Not many versions, just one version divided into two parts. There are those who believe in only one part.</span></p>
              <p>Is it true catholics in the past used violent ways to condemn those who did not believe in god; by punishing them?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes. History is constantly filled with people who wants to push their personal agenda. This kind of strategy will not end. </span></p>
              <p>Ever occured to u that the holy bible could be an all-time bestseller like what the modern day J.K.Rowling did with her Harry Potter series? Written just as a fiction?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Bible was already an all-time bestseller, once. If you look at how the Bible was put together, you can still claim that it is untrue, but you cannot deny the fact that the Bible was put together by scholars (at that time).  </span> </p>
              <p>Whose god is the real deal, if there's any?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">It's up to you.... Every religion and faith will claim that their's is the real deal. You will only find out when you die.</span> </p>
              <p>I understand Jesus sacrifice himself to save mankind from their sins, he was resurrected and supposedly came back to life. If he did, he will die again, but where is his remains kept since he is so holy?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">According the Bible, he ascended into heavens. But since your worldview excludes the authenticity of the Bible, it does not really matter.</span> </p>
              <p>Why is a Pope needed? Does a Pope has any nationality? Or is he recognised as a worldwide citizen?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Pope is the head of the Catholic church. He is a citizen of Vatican city. But he can be of any nationality. (Catholic brethens may correct me on this one)</span> </p>
              <p>If god created god, then who created god? (The chicken and egg qns)</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">No one created God. But since you don't believe in God, it is also not important. </span> </p>
              <p>Is Adam and Eve the first creation of god? If so, they are only 2 humans to begin with. But how come now I see so many skin colors?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The traditional believe is that when Noah's sons left, they were the one that gave the world the different races. </span> </p>
              <p>If christianity is the true religion, what of other religion? If u dont disapprove of other religion, it means u accept other gods existence too. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Christianity is the true religion to Christians. I don't disapprove other religions but it does not mean that I accept that there are other gods. I believe each person has the freedom to worship as he pleases.</span> </p>
              <p>All of the above is the questions that is looming over my head after I read a few pages of the bible, the bestsellers of the Da Vinci series, the things i heard from people with religion and the general questions I always had when people cant seem to answer me.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Don't be bogged by Dan Brown and his Da Vinci series. At best, they are half-truths - even non-Christian historians think that.</span></p>

              <p>hmm, i can actually answer the skin colour question scientifically. lol, but i forgot already, i have to ask my leader.</p>
              <p>but the quick summarized answer is.. actually we all have the same skin colour. but the reason why some of us appear darker or lighter, is actually not because of the difference in skin colour, but rather the body's ability to produce this pigment called melanin.</p>
              <p>if you have more melanin, you appear darker, if you have lesser malanin, you appear lighter.</p>
              <p>melanin is supposed to protect your skin from getting harmed by the sun. like sunburn and stuff.</p>

              <p>i think most folks with basic science understand the melanin thing. the issue of race goes beyond skin color. it goes into facial features, physical attributes etc.</p>
              <p>if it is that simple, than folks will have similar features (eg caucasian) but with different levels of melanin.</p>
              <p>however, there is a distinct difference between caucasians, mongoloids and negroids.</p>

              <p><br>you think?</p>
              <p>jgho's not the first bloke to think he's got all the questions....</p>
              <p>basically such folks fall into three categories:</p>
              <p>1. seekers, <br>2. neutrals,<br>3. critics.</p>
              <p>if it's a real seeker - the correct place to look for answers will be any church, or any Christian website.</p>
              <p>if it's a neutral - there are plenty of info pros and cons in the internet.</p>
              <p>if it's a critic - no real point in responding because certain points will NEVER EVER be accepted.</p>
              <p>it is my opinion that SGforums is NOT the place for seekers.... for neutrals, it is quite alright... for critics... well, depends on my mood.</p>
              <p>whether one is a neutral or a critic, the way questions are asked.... will be known.</p>

              <p>well.. like i said in another thread - people only believe when they want to believe. it's kinda a waste of time to talk about facts, evidences, explainations.</p>
              <p>if they don't want to believe, nothing is going to convince them otherwise. lol</p>

              <p>can't blame us though, after years of enthu sharing, we just realise it's all a waste of breath.</p>

              <p><br>actually most non-believers are seeking answers ----- to affirm their beliefs.... if they are already LOOKING for God, the answers will lead them to God, if they are looking for a fight, the answers will lead them to a fight.</p>
