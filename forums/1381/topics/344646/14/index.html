              <p>OT liao lah.....there are so many "Catholic websites" around that are anti-Catholics as if you don't know.......</p>
              <p>hmm, maybe you also need to check what is really a Catholic Church.......</p>
              <p>first not universal in doctrines, then got more charismatic and less charismatic and now this......you really proved to me that you are the pro-Catholic guy around....and one that knows us pretty well too.</p>
              <p>Typing
                      fast and not checking is a bad habit and not stress....happen in my
                      work too....this is a forum and not an english school leh.....</p>
              <p>Mutiple factual errors is the scary issues.....</p>
              <p>Anyway, I know you are just trying to divert attention from the fact that the argument is due to your factual error......</p>
