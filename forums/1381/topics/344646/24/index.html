              <p>Read Genesis before your claim that earth is only 6000+ years old. In the begining is not 6000 + years ago.</p>
              <p>If it cannot be proven that God does not exist, why are you so sure that God does not exist? That's so convinient. So, by simply saying that God doesn't exist exonerates science buffs from searching for evidence?. </p>
              <p>Ardi was discovered in the 90s but the discovery could not be hidden any longer. It will rewrite the evolution theory, that's for sure. Continue to find the missing links. Don't give up. The evolution theory still cannot explain the origin of life.</p>
              <p>As more prehistoric animals taught to be extinct are discovered today, the evolution theory will also evolve with the new find.</p>
              <p>I believe that there's a creator and there's no need for me to look for evidence that God doesn't exist. You should.</p>
              <p>Here's the proof. As long as the promise to the Jews is kept, that's the reason to believe that the promise to Christians will also be honoured.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you actually think you would score well on a O level bio paper by writing "god did it"?</p>

              <p>Religion is about faith and trust. I've already explained why Christians believe that God's pormises will be honoured because God kept his promise to Abraham.</p>
              <p>Don't waste time with your scientific mind lah. A theory is a theory. You cannot call it a fact.</p>
              <p> Why don't you introduce Lucy to Ardi, the new earliest huminid? The evolution theory has been evolving with time. It helps promote creationism!</p>
              <p>Soon the evolution theory that you've studied will be 'quite' different from the theory that senior science buffs have learnt not too long ago. Go and fight the science but to fair, must also promote creationism.</p>
              <p>Remember, the theory also evolves with time. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>Do you know what is the biggest problem of creationism?</p>
              <p>Biology.</p>
              <p>According to the "theory", 2 humans appeared 6000 years ago and populated the entire planet.</p>
              <p>Just seriously think. Could 2 animals seriously populate the entire planet? 6 billion people in 6000 years. Lets say Adam and Eve could have comfortably had 10 children in their lifetimes, 5 boys and 5 girls. Of those, half died due to diseases, famine, predators as it was the stoneage, the life expectancy of people then was about 25. Of those say, 3 boys and 2 girls, the cycle could continue.</p>
              <p>BUT. What if all the girls had died, or all the boys had died, or the second generation was only girls or only boys? The chances of having the right number of offspring each generation is about 1/128, with the chances decreasing exponentially every generation.</p>
              <p>But then, supossing they were incredibly lucky, they would have died out in 5 generations anyway due to genetic instability inherited by mating with family members. ( you don't marry your sister)</p>
              <p>Also, this "theory" doesn't account for the spread of humans across the world, or the genetic variability of asians, africans, and caucasians. Also, according to the bible, it was only until the tower of babel that humans had different languages, about 2000BC, but stone carvings of different languages have been found even before 5000 BC!</p>
              <p>Evolutionary theory may be evolving, but the central CORE premise is the same. The details of the thoery may shift, but the solid center will never move. If anything, you don't need evolution to go anywhere near creationism because SHEER COMMON SENSE defeats creationism completely.</p>
              <p>Another note about the bible, is that its a textbook case of circular logic.</p>
              <p>Q: Why is the bible true?</p>
              <p>A: The bible is the word of god.</p>
              <p>Q: Why is the bible the word of god?</p>
              <p>A: Because the bible says so.</p>
              <p>Q: Why is the bible true then?</p>
              <p>A: Because the bible is the word of god.</p>
              <p>You see. Even a curious 5 year old could unravel the logic of all this. The bible is the only substantation of the christian god. I don't know, there may be a god out there, but it is definitly not the christian god.</p>

              <p>Just seriously think. Could 2 animals seriously populate the
                  entire planet? 6 billion people in 6000 years. Lets say Adam
                  and Eve could have comfortably had <span style="color: #ff0000;">10 children in their lifetimes,
                  5 boys and 5 girls.</span> Of those, <span style="color: #ff0000;">half died</span> due to diseases, famine,
                  predators as it was the stoneage, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">life expectancy of people
                  then was about 25</span>. Of those say, <span style="color: #ff0000;">3 boys and 2 girls</span>, the cycle
                  could continue.</p>
              <p>BUT. What if all the girls had died, or all the boys had died,
                  or the second generation was only girls or only boys? The chances
                  of having the right number of offspring each generation is about
                  <span style="color: #ff0000;">1/128</span>, with the chances decreasing exponentially every

              I do not wish to spend time commenting on the Christians' delusion that god loves and teaches us to love one another. There are ample evidence in the holy book that shows the Jewish god YHWH is not too concerned with love.  Even Jesus has said something contrary to the concept of love.
              
              
              Ah, sorry I got mixed up.  You said god love, but you did not tell me which of the gods of various religions in this world.

              I think Kepler was a clergy and for his generation, to declare disbelieve in God is to pronounce ones own dead sentence (See how evil the church was). I am sure everybody is ware that Galileo was forced to recant his theory on motion.  And to claim Newton is a Christian is just as informative as saying he is English.

              concept of love. Ah, sorry I got mixed up. You said god love, but
              you did not tell me which of the gods of various religions in this
              world.</p>

              <p>Can you prove merlion does not exit. It is so basic in logic
              that it is impossible to prove non-existence. The burden of proof
              is with the party which claims it existence. It is actually very
              simple - just produce it it it is actually there.</p>

              <p>Just like if a person is not guilty of a crime.....meaning the crime he is accussed does not exist, does that mean that he cannot prove it if he is charged wrongly?</p>
              <p>It is ok if you choose to think God does not exist and do not believe....I respect that. It is another thing to come to a Christian forum and says we are wrong and telling us to prove we are right....especially you have zero proof to back up your own disbeliefs.</p>
