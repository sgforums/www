              deism and jewism are different in the sense that a deist god does not mess with his creations. he just created existence, set off the big bang and left it as it is.

              <p>Well, pardon me, for i was about to leave home for dinner. I did
              further research and i admit that i made a mistake about
              jean-jacques, yet i still hold true to my views that there is a
              contradiction between science and christ.</p>
              <p>I did not take my secondary school education seriously, and yes
              i'm not very familiar with them. so what? I can still provide u the
              reasons.</p>
              <p>Conflicts between science and christianity:</p>
              <p>1) Leviticus 11:13-19 states: These are the birds you are to
              detest and not eat because they are detestable: the eagle, ... any
              kind of heron, the hoopoe and the bat.</p>
              <p>when did bats become birds?</p>
              <p>2)Leviticus 11:20-22 states: All flying insects that walk on all
              fours are to be detestable to you. There are, however, some winged
              creatures that walk on all fours that you may eat: ... Of these you
              may eat any kind of locust, katydid, cricket, or grasshopper.</p>
              <p>locusts, katydids, crickets and grasshoppers DO have SIX
              legs.</p>
              <p>3) ... The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved.
              (Psalms 93:1) ... The world is firmly established; it cannot be
              moved. (1 Chronicles 16:30) He set the earth on its foundations; it
              can never be moved. (Psalms 104:5) Joshua said to the LORD in the
              presence of Israel: "O sun, stand still over Gibeon, O moon, over
              the Valley of Aijalon. (Joshua 10:12)</p>
              <p>As we all know, all these statements are false.</p>
              <p>I can go on and on, i shall stop here unless asked for more.</p>
              <p>Now the point is, people in the past believed these to be true,
              yet has been proven to be false in this current age.</p>
              <p>The christian community has been constantly changing it's views
              ever since the religion was born, due to facts contradicting the
              scriptures.</p>
              <p>So what makes you think you are among a pioneer batch that truly
              understands the bible?</p>
              <p>What I am more concerned with, is that people are actually
              believing the bible word for word, believing the facts to be wrong
              and are of the devil. eg:
              http://www.alaska.net/~clund/e_djublonskopf/Flatearthsociety.htm</p>
              <p>I must stress once again that religion, even in moderation,
              creates a breeding ground for fanatical idealogy.</p>
              <p>and so what if i do not know when's the first nobel prize
              awarded? of course i don't know what i have not researched and i
              won't be a smart-ass and google the answer just to act like a
              know-it-all. i humbly admit my ignorance.</p>

              <p>Do crickets(locusts etc) use long hind legs to walk?</p>
              <p>When did bats become birds? You should ask when did humans re-classify bats(animal that can fly) as mammals?</p>
              <p>There's the ancient classification system and there's the modern classification system.</p>
              <p>Critics have imposed the modern system of categorizing animals upon the ancient text and then said that the bible is wrong.</p>
              <p>Let's look at the books of 1 chronicles and Psalms in context.</p>
              <p>Are they books on astronomy?</p>
              <p>1 Chronicles decribes King David's reign and his fear of the Lord.</p>
              <p>The Book of Psalms is a book of religious songs to praise the Lord. Do you take lyrics of modern music seriously?</p>
              <p>You didn't take your studies seriously and you asked"so what?" ?</p>
              <p>Not very smart since the bible is not a scientific textbook. The Bible is a guide for spiritual matters and not one for physical matters. It describe items of a physical nature down to simplest terms. Do you have a problem with that?</p>
              <p>If you want to go more in depth into physics, you study the discovery of  Laws that Govern the Universe made by Christian scientists, not read the bible.</p>

              <p>*sighs* See, ATR you get the point. If you use your brain (that means EVERYBODY) you will simply realize that the continuations of religion mainly rely on human error.</p>
              <p>If you are still wondering whether God exists or not, maybe that's the wrong question for you to ask. Maybe you should just ask yourself if you believe your actions are right or wrong? Or if you feel you are straying from an imaginable path? Who knows. Only you do.</p>
              <p>I've somehow managed to read all of this, and to be honest with you, I've laughed so much, I've cried. The human race itself is so corrupt that it doubles back on itself. Maybe there's a greater question out there for people other than the existence of God. That's human nature for you. lol</p>
              <p>If you want, you can try meditating. That might help. Also, if this helps try seeing the world around you as something distant from yourself. Maybe thinking a little more about yourself will guide you better than if you listen to someone else. :)</p>
              <p>I kinda know what you're going through, since I've been there myself. I kind of shut myself away from the world, and only thought of myself for a while. Then I realized that the world was a cruel and hateful place and that I should just try to change my outlook on it, and yes, I felt a little better. I still think that people are wrong, I still know what they're capable of doing, and I do know how horrible everything around me is, but maybe just taking a different perspective on life can simplify things a little. Maybe you can realize your higher calling. Who knows? (Nobody, really, it's just something for you to find out for yourself.)</p>
              <p>btw, I used to be catholic, since it's been in my family. But now I don't know, I guess that I can somehow believe in a higher deity than anyone or anything and I just use it to make myself feel happy (I just think that not everyone/thing is an idiot. lol)</p>
              <p>In short, just find your happy place, dude. That will facilitate things and stop this religion feud. (Hopefully. My head hurts.)</p>

              <p>*sighs* See, ATR you get the point. If you use your brain (that means EVERYBODY) you will simply realize that the continuations of religion mainly rely on human error.</p>
              <p>If you are still wondering whether God exists or not, maybe that's the wrong question for you to ask. Maybe you should just ask yourself if you believe your actions are right or wrong? Or if you feel you are straying from an imaginable path? Who knows. Only you do.</p>
              <p>I've somehow managed to read all of this, and to be honest with you, I've laughed so much, I've cried. The human race itself is so corrupt that it doubles back on itself. Maybe there's a greater question out there for people other than the existence of God. That's human nature for you. lol</p>
              <p>If you want, you can try meditating. That might help. Also, if this helps try seeing the world around you as something distant from yourself. Maybe thinking a little more about yourself will guide you better than if you listen to someone else. :)</p>
              <p>I kinda know what you're going through, since I've been there myself. I kind of shut myself away from the world, and only thought of myself for a while. Then I realized that the world was a cruel and hateful place and that I should just try to change my outlook on it, and yes, I felt a little better. I still think that people are wrong, I still know what they're capable of doing, and I do know how horrible everything around me is, but maybe just taking a different perspective on life can simplify things a little. Maybe you can realize your higher calling. Who knows? (Nobody, really, it's just something for you to find out for yourself.)</p>
              <p>btw, I used to be catholic, since it's been in my family. But now I don't know, I guess that I can somehow believe in a higher deity than anyone or anything and I just use it to make myself feel happy (I just think that not everyone/thing is an idiot. lol)</p>
              <p>In short, just find your happy place, dude. That will facilitate things and stop this religion feud. (Hopefully. My head hurts.)</p>

              <p>This is exactly what every humans should be doing. Think for themselves, and not believing without question. Frankly, God, do not want you to believe wholesale without question, of His existence or non-existence. Whether you believe or not, He would appreciate effort like yours, because it is your own.</p>

              because it says not to test god. I did it to emphasize. whether the "you" tested him at Massah or not, makes no difference.

              if u dun verify the christian god's existence, verify the rules he set for us, and believe in him, abiding his laws, that is blind faith.

              <p>Religion is faith but why do you insist Christians based on blind faith? </p>
              <p>The universe had a beginning. The brilliant minds of astronomers had agreed, based on circumstantial evidence. Should Christians give these brilliant minds or your statement the beneift of the doubt ?</p>
              <p>All you are asking is proof of His existence but you cannot produce proof or even evidence of His non-existence. I've said before, the answer lies in education. Do yourself a favour. Increase your intelligence. That will change your outlook. You can even conduct a test yuorself to verify His non-existence instead of asking a believer for proof of His existence.</p>
              <p>Back to that that quote Deu.6.16. Don't get too personal. That's God speaking to the Hebrews, not you, not the Christians.  It shows that you did not read the book in it's context.</p>
              <p>About Luke 4.12, It's the devil challenging Jesus to test God. Jesus was all alone with Satan. Even if God did a miracle hadJesus jumped, nobody else would have witnessed the miracle. Jesus's faith came from God's covenent with Abraham and the promises He kept to the Jews.</p>
              <p>Christians are to learn from the lesson. If you are not a Christian, then God is not talking to you.You did not seek, so you do not find. I even doubt that you've read the bible. You are merely taking snippets of quotes from critics.</p>
