              <p>What about carbon dating? Is it accurate? I don't know. No one
              is able to verify something that's assumed to be 50,000 years old.
              I trust the BC/AD dating system, which was based on the birth of
              Jesus.</p>
              <p>Why is the fish living fossil unconvincing? It proves that
              evolution of that fish did not occur. Evolutionists are very afraid
              of living fossils.</p>
              <p>Another evolution theory that the evolutionists themselves
              debunked  is the use of vestigiality organs. Go do your
              research, OK?</p>
              <p>Why pull in religion? Do you believe in creationism or
              evolution? You tell me.</p>
              <p>I've said before. Research by creationist scientists are not
              confined to creationism only. They are also biologists, chemists or
              physicists. They become more convinced of the existence of an
              intelligent designer with each new discovery .</p>

              <p>Earlier, you asked me how has science invalidate bible and I asked you about carbon dating for this purpose. If you claim you don't know how accurate cardon dating is, I have nothing to say, I cannot influence your belief. If you think carbon dating is accurate, then science can debunk bible, which says earth is about 6000 year old only.</p>
              <p>Your account of fish fossil and vestigial organ and their confusion created in the evolutionist community are baseless. These topics are well discussed and supported by evidence. You could be reading these off from a creationist website and may have led to another direction.</p>
              <p>Of course I believe in evolution and natural selection.</p>

              <p>According to the text I read, vestigial organs are the evidents of evolution. We share the same vestigial organ with our ancestry up link and slowly these organ are evolved to function-less organ in us.</p>
              <p>I share some facts on vestigial organs (from updated and verified text):</p>
              <p>1) Tail bone at end of our spline. It was evolved from a tail since 4~5 million years ago.</p>
              <p>2) Pelvic Bone in a whale. Whale does not need pelvic bone because it does not have lower limbs. Whale is evolved from the ancestry of tetrapods.</p>
              <p>3) Appendix in human. No function in a human body. The same organ serves as homologous organ in other animals. Evolution explains why all animal evolved from the same ancestry.</p>
              <p>Do you think I am more outdated than Scadding (, who cannot identify the useless organ and said it is no of use to evolution) ?</p>

              <p>This christian reliance on the bible is complete nonsense.</p>
              <p>You would rather believe a group of primitives who thought lightning was a sign to kill 30 goats, who wrote a book that has not been updated for 2000 years about perfectly explainable natural events (biodiversity through evolution) and completely impossible events (noah's ark)</p>
              <p>Rather than believe the combined knowledge and experimentation of 500 years of the world's greatest minds validated by evidence, observations and has produced life changing products like hygiene, medicine, industry and electronics?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Given these two choices, its pretty obvious which one you'd pick.</p>
              <p>Actually, for those who think christianity is unfairly treated, they actually had a chance of ruling the world for about 100 years.</p>
              <p>They were called the Dark Ages.</p>
              <p>All books were burned and the central education and policy makers was the church.</p>
              <p>Starvation was widespread, with whole families dying of lack of food, chlorea, smallpox and the common cold wiped out entire villages.</p>
              <p>The Church's answer to the problem?</p>
              <p>You're not praying hard enough, so god is punishing you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously guys, if you got the chance to become prime minister for a day, we'd be in very very bad shape. Thats why even the USA, where the dollar bill says "In god we trust" has enforced the rule "separation of church and the state" for 300 years and is considering taking down the "in god we trust" if the christian nuts weren't allowed to vote.</p>
              <p>TLDR: Christianity is the obvious loser of the two choices, with absolutely no evidence to back it up.</p>

              <p>(1) 6000 years was stated inside. It is not my interest to

              scripture. </p>

              a benefit of re-stating your meaning of this statement. I do not
              want to jump at your confusion point.</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(2) Please set aside your arrogance and have a good debate with
              me here. Your citing of<span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif; color: #333333; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;"><strong> Scadding</strong> gives no backing up. You and your community may be literally taking
              every words of Scadding as total truth and bend it to your
              advantage. Scadding work was incomplete and do you seriously think
              we should close the chapter and claim Scadding is the truth. We
              have all the time to work on this until the sun burns
              out.</span></span></p>
              <p>Scadding's thought exercise: "<span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif; color: #333333;"><em>Since
              it is not possible to unambiguously identify useless structures,
              and since the structure of the argument used is not scientifically
              valid, I conclude that ‘vestigial organs’ provide no special
              evidence for the theory of evolution</em><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">."</strong> <span style="font-style: normal;">is more than a literal work than scientific
              work. Do you want to base your defense on this word-playing
              statement ? If Scadding did not know then, he should admit
              it.</span></span></p>
              <p>According to the text I read, vestigial organs are the evidents
              of evolution. We share the same vestigial organ with our ancestry
              up link and slowly these organ are evolved to function-less organ
              in us.</p>
              <p>I share some facts on vestigial organs (from updated and
              verified text):</p>
              <p>1) Tail bone at end of our spline. It was evolved from a tail
              since 4~5 million years ago.</p>
              <p>2) Pelvic Bone in a whale. Whale does not need pelvic bone
              because it does not have lower limbs. Whale is evolved from the
              ancestry of tetrapods.</p>
              <p>3) Appendix in human. No function in a human body. The same
              organ serves as homologous organ in other animals. Evolution
              explains why all animal evolved from the same ancestry.</p>
              <p>Do you think I am more outdated than Scadding (, who cannot
              identify the useless organ and said it is no of use to evolution)
              ?</p>

              appendix, long-regarded as a useless evolutionary artifact, won

              Medical Center proposed that it actually serves a critical function.

              <p>and : "Why is the Bible outdated? Because it was 2000 years old?"</p>

              <p>Sorry to said, but as science become more advanced, there is even a greater price to pay. When guns were bought to life by science, what were they for ? Kill your own kind. When science created bombs and nuclear silos, is it to kill everyone else ? When science created cars, what were they for ? To destroy the earth's natural ozone layer ? Science has killed millions of people in WW1 and WW2. I fear that WW3 is on it's way as Science become more advanced and create more crazy weapons.</p>

              <p><br>Well, I can say with complete honesty and pride that science does not know all the answers to origins of life. There are theories with increasing evidence supporting it like abiogensis, the rise of organic molecules through geological processes and of course, the much assaulted and much proven evolution.</p>
              <p>But the eventual answer is "We don't know. Yet."</p>
              <p>And that is the best answer you can have, as it encourages discovery, invention and improvement.</p>
              <p>What do christianity have to offer as an explanation?</p>
              <p>"God did it"</p>
              <p>Wow. Stunning. This leads to total stagnation and halt of scientific progress. All you'd had to do was sit in a cave, talk to your imaginary friend and hope to go to heaven when you die.</p>
              <p>But lets say it is a theory.</p>
              <p>Whats the evidence to back it up? The bible.</p>
              <p>How do you know the events in the bible are true? Because the bible is god's word.</p>
              <p>How do you know its god's word? Because the bible says so.</p>
              <p>This, for those not trained in mathematical logic, is called circular logic, and is the absolute worst argument in existance.</p>
              <p>QED, the bible is one of the absolute worst arguments in existance.</p>

              <p>absolutely. its explanation is dogmatic and irrational. I even have one christian friend, who is unable to answer my question when I asked him, told me god will tell me when I die. if god is so almighty why cant it offer me an explanation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2000 years ago, whatever the church or pastor said, you accept it, sort of like blind faith, no questions asked. if you asked or challenged it, the pastor or church will say you lack faith in god. when you ask them why there are earthquakes, they will tell you its act of god and if you query them further, they will tell you its fate, god plan or punishment to bad people who have sinned. this type of reply will gobsmacked you to your face. the list goes on and on.</p>
