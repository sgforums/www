              <p>Whether god exists or not i fail to see how it makes a difference in your life</p>
              <p>It was not in contemplation of god that fire was first discovered, or the first airplanes built, or the first skyscrapers envisioned</p>
              <p>I believe that people believe in god because its the only thing they've got after they have abandoned their reason. Its from which they get their direction from after they have abandoned their mind</p>
              <p>In the past when knowledge of the world was little i guess there was some sort of excuse/reason people look to a book to guide their life. Now for the life of me i just cant figure out why belief in god is becoming so prevalent when in the modern age i should expect the contrary</p>

              <p>You already answered yourself that you should believe in God.</p>
              <p>Yes, your parents had sex and out came you.....but not every couple having sex had babies. And like someone else pointed out, where did the first generation come about? I.E. the origin of life....and why God has no part?</p>
              <p>The fact that you are confused and doubting and going nowhere is part of growing up. It was about mixing with the wrong crowd - Nihilist.</p>
              <p>Since you said you are serving as an alter boy, why do you do so? Not everyone end up serving at the alter - why you? Speak to your spiritual director or catechist.</p>

              <p>Oh no you're losing your faith?</p>
              <p>I can tell you that when a person loses his faith he loses with him the ability to endure much of this life hardships. In other words he will become vulnerable to attack.</p>
              <p>I have been a believer and my faith has helped me a lot in dealing with life blows even to extreme conditions.</p>
              <p>In my life as a believer in Christ I have</p>
              <p>1. Been given a vision of glorified Christ in which His face shone like no other. It was a long time ago. when I was in my 7th grade. No I'm almost 30 year old. So I know for sure that Christ was no liar and He lives and glorified and that Christ broke the imprisonment of death.</p>
              <p>2. I got rid of an evil spirit sent to my dorm room just by crying out to the Lord out of helplessness. No it wasn't because the shaman was being nice. lol</p>
              <p>3. I've been persecuted and mentally abused and tortured to the point that I almost lost my mind. I have been deliberately defamed that I suffer from schizophernia but I fought on by refusing any sort of medication and went on entering local university and finished my degree from scratch. I was saved from literally losing my mind because I felt the presence of the Virgin Mary at one time. And it's not my bullshit. She was the most charismatic living entities I've ever felt.</p>
              <p>4. Over the years God has allowed me to feel what other people are feeling. Of course not all the time just sometimes. I know for sure now that every living person is basically the same. Each one of us has the same capacity to feel what other people are capable of feeling.</p>
              <p>The most beautiful heart I've ever been allowed to feel is an intimate prayer of a nun in the church. She was rather chubby and ugly but her heart in prayer then was the most beautiful thing I've ever felt to this day. The second most beautiful thing is to have someone loving you. I mean passionate love real love.</p>
              <p>I read that schizophernic sufferers claim to be able to read other people mind but I'm no liar and definitely not delusional. And I've never been allowed to read people's mind.</p>
              <p>5. God has allowed me to know some future events too though not that often not just my own future but family members and even distant nation.</p>
              <p>6. i've asked and given my own earthquake in the place where I stood once. It brough a wide smile onto my face. Who is as the Lord our God lol. So now the possibility that I was a psychic has been ruled out. No psychic could ever move the ground such that nobody was able to walk and even had trouble standing up. So you are left with the possibility that I'm actually nuts lol.</p>
              <p>7. I've been given a secret of what death actually means. Now I accept that not all people will be raised to life immediately after they are dead. Dead people in unknown numbers actually still descend to the world of the dead which is neither hell or purgatory.</p>
              <p>The point is I would have lost everything but I didn't because I have my faith and instead of breaking apart I'm getting stronger in my faith.</p>
              <p>I let anyone mock me now but their mockings only confirm that what I've experienced was not my own doing and that thye were impossible to be experienced by most people.</p>
              <p>And I shall wait for the next big thing God has in store for me because God will not let me be diminished by my enemies. Praise be His name!</p>

              God might exist, he might not exist, nobody knows. nobody can prove.
              
              but, the gods of the religions of our current time certainly do not exist.

              <p>I guess God is personal. And I don't mean to brag because I have nothing to brag about. Those things I wrote are not causes to brag. Simply because I didn't do any of those. I just experienced them but I didn't do a thing. Not even a twitch nothing none.</p>
              <p>And the last thing I wanted to cause is to strike fear so whenever I literally felt another person heart or feeling I would 99% not say a word to let the other person knew that I knew.</p>
              <p>The other 1% was an exception though....I was half awake and I sort of slipped my tounge. It was more like a reflex...anyway that 1% needed some form of response though. I'm just glad that I did react to that one.</p>
              <p>But I remember one time that still kind of bothers me to this day. I was in a bad mood. And I felt angry. To cut the story short...I made this person to be disappointed and sad though he was innocent. I felt what he felt but because I was angry I blamed it on him(I know that was selfish of me shame on me). Later I regret this but never found this man again. I regret it because I knew how I made him to feel. If I hadn't felt what he felt I don't think I finally would have regretted acting the way I acted. It would have been easier had he gone angry towards me too instead of allowing me to cause him pain.</p>

              <p><br>You can't touch or see love, thoughts physically.</p>

              <p>GOD EXIST. And you can keep denying GOD's EXISTENCE for all you want. I'm not interested to convince you cos you have failed to consider so many miracles around you.</p>
              <p>Why do you think Earth is the only planet that is most livable for us humans?</p>
              <p>Why do you think Earth is position along the solar system that we get sufficient light and dark?</p>
              <p>Why do you think Earth and the other planets can orbit around the Sun without crashing into each other?</p>
              <p>Why do you think the world around you is so colourful? (It could be dull and colourless)</p>
              <p>So many wonderful things can be found of Earth, yet you have failed to realise it.</p>

              <p>Don't forget one important thing, everything has it's own maker and creator.</p>
              <p>So who do you think created the solar system and Earth? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
