              <p>On the other hand, God is not false and baseless because there are facts, history as well as His works.....remember the answer to your questions of what God has done for mankind?</p>

              <p>Thank-you. What I see here are many youngsters who tried to be "complicated" and "educated" so much so that they become so proud that they deny there is God. And they conclude with wrong ideas / misconceptions about the faith and produced those rubbish here thinking they are real smart.....and knowledgeable of the Christian faith...One claimed to almost becoming a pastor, some claimed to have studied the bible, being a ex-Christian, having photo as proof but never produce any etc.....</p>
              <p>And their idea of science with evidences and proof have no answer to the origin of life.....and yet they claimed that the Bible version is fake....Yet, they have no concrete evidence and proof in any scientitic way to prove that God does not exist....</p>
              <p>They will choose not to respond and go on to another thread and post the same old rubbish over and over again....</p>
              <p>Then, they come charging that Christains should proved that God do exist....and yet they will choose to ignore facts and evidence....Yes, they choose to ignore God.</p>
              <p>To conclude, most are here not because they think God does not exist....in fact, most if not all are simply unsure if God do exist. Thus, their need to distort the existance of God so that they can "feel safer".</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents worth.</p>

              <p>the thread title reads "Does God exist?" Plain and simple. but we get a whole lot of stuff like, the bible is full of mistakes...God is an evil God...if He was this, why did He do that? one thing i notice abt such stuff is tat they nvr answered the thread title. such statements/qns are merely asking/stating abt the reasons y God did/didnt do certain things. or like, wads the pt of believing in Him if He was evil? however, they still dun answer the thread title. For God to be evil, He has to 1st exist rite? why God didnt/did do certan things? again, He has to exist 1st in order to do/didnt do certain things rite?</p>
              <p>moreover, even if the bible is full of mistakes. it still doesnt prove that there is no God. Mistakes can happen in 2 ways. 1) imperfect human beings misinterpreted them. 2) the writers of the bible who themselves were humans made mistakes. ok, maybe the bible was wrong abt the existence of the christian God, then wad abt Allah? wad abt the jewish God? in fact, they made a very gd pt by saying tat the bible is written by man and hence is full of mistakes. tat onli shows the imperfection of human beings, INCLUDING themselves. so while the bible is full of mistakes cos it was written by imperfect humans, wad abt the bible was tot to have mistakes cos it was misinterpreted  by imperfect humans who tot they knew betta???</p>

              <p>Mankind has come a long way since 2009 years ago. science and
                  technology also has come a long way since the backward and ancient
                  civilisations of 2009 years ago. science, medicine, technology has
                  enabled mankind to understand the things they didnt 2009 years ago.
                  by using god, satan, heaven and hell to explain everything in this
                  world and the universe is way too incomprehensible ie illogic
                  to say the least and simple. if not we would mistake natural
                  diasters as acts of god, but they are not. they are just natural
                  occurences or phenomenon, or simply put nature, not god punishing
                  mankind. we now understand how the techtonic plates collide to form
                  mountains and valleys.</p>

              <p>Yes, I agree with you that science and technology has come a long way but nothing has make God's existance, His teachings and the Bible redundant.</p>
              <p>Science do help to enable mankind to understand things better but science has never been able to explain origins of life or to prove that God does not exist! The simple reason being that God created everything!</p>
              <p>I do not know where did you get the idea that natural diasters is a form of "god punishing mankind"............</p>
              <p>Wonder why people are now talking about going green and using less of the air-con and emitting less pollution etc? It simply means going back to nature....</p>
              <p>And ever wonder why people are saying yo avoid fast food etc....and going back to organic food? It simply means going back to nature....</p>
              <p>Why? Because God created nature and all the food we need.......human "kekiang" and mess up everything....so more dieases and health problems and enviromental issues and it becomes too much to handle.....so now they says, go green, go organic etc...and save our earth!</p>
              <p>And it will be really illogical to turn to science when they have no answers to origin of life. As far as science is concerned, it only helps to prove God's existance.</p>
