              <p>there you go again....since when did I said we don't need to advance science?</p>
              <p>The fact is science cannot explain the origin of life which is God's creation....and that's a fact. A fact that you cannot accept and yet have no other explanations....</p>
              <p>So where did the phrase "acts of god" came from? You tell me.....</p>

              <p>And your superman example is out of place here as history, facts and science all tells us that it is a cartoon and comics created by man.

              <p>Life is created by God.....and you will not be here if God does not exist.....I know you will says that you come from your mother.....period. Look beyond that boy and see further.....</p>

              <p>And your superman example is out of place here as history, facts and science all tells us that it is a cartoon and comics created by man. Just like your big bang theory....and since you know that superman is created by man, you should look at your big bang theory in the same light....</p>

              <p>If sources in writting is what you after, then go read and learn more about the Bible which is written by man who are inspired by God and lead by the Holy Spirit. Not men's effort alone.....and perhaps you will then stop making statements as a result from being completely clueless about God.</p>

              <p>I wonder will anyone take you seriously with your self pawned comments and claims on proof of existence of god and you came up with <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">science has proof the existence of god</span></strong>. asked what facts and evidence you quoted from to substantiate your claim and this is all you can come out with? its not the quantity but the quality of what is being argued for and against. if this is the quality you can muster, I am afraid its all being BS.</p>
