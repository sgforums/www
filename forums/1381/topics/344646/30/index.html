              And Rooney just stick with Buddhism and stay away from this forum otherwise you're giving Buddhism a bad name. I know a lot of nice Buddhist. One even converted to Christianity now. But those who stay Buddhist are nice lot of people.

              <p>I am answering your questions on what has God done ..... and these humans are all religious and guided by the teachings of their faith to serve the community. Try harder and you see Christians have the most involvement. Because they respond to God's teaching of love, compassion and charity. For the beneficiaries (regardless of faith), God loves them all and thru His followers, He showed His love and care for them. So much for God does not exist.....</p>
              <p>So what if everything is "invented by man" when the faith actually leads one to live a better life and serve the community? And this is based on facts as the good works done by them has proven.</p>
              <p>What have you atheist done? Care to share with us?</p>

              <p>2000 years ago, whatever the church or pastor said, you accept

              challenged it, the pastor or church will say you lack faith in god.
              when you ask them why there are earthquakes, they will tell you its
              act of god and if you query them further, they will tell you its
              fate, god plan or punishment to bad people who have sinned. this

              <p>First, pls explain why you did not respond to questions on what you mean by "Love and compassion and morality
                                              is ingrained into the human psyche" is it a scientific fact or did
                                              you just make it up?</p>
              <p>Secondly, when did anyone here said that we don't need science? The fact is science till date has no answer to the origin of life......and since when did I said that we should stop looking for answers?</p>
              <p>As much as you speculate that science may one day find the answer, the truth is you don't know if it will happen or will ever happen. I said we already know the answer but not everyone wants to accept the answer  and that's your choice.</p>
              <p>So, until science can proved the origins of life as otherwise, we stick to what we already know.</p>
              <p>Yes, maybe you can claimed that there is no God and we are just putting our faith blindly......and yet you have no proof that there is no God...</p>
              <p>On the other hand, you feel very intelligent putting your faith in science as if it is an alternative religion and yet, there is no assurance that science ever find the answer....A case of being disillusioned with the science? (sounds familiar?)</p>
              <p>Yes, there is no need for a lot of things to survive......you need air and water and all other lives (our food chain) also need that. Where did air and water come from? Ahh, that means we do need God?</p>
              <p>Your reply is not sarcastic at all.....it's childish.</p>
