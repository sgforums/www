              <p>oh please, i just googled "nobel prize winners who believe in
              god".</p>
              <p>the first name amongst those winners was albert einstein =,=
              Well, he may believe in a god, but he certainly is against the god
              which goes by the name of Yahweh or Allah.</p>
              <p>Jean-Jacques Rousseau, founder of modern deism was listed as
              well? wow, i wonder what that list is trying to do huh, misguide
              more people into religion i say. Someone born protestant, converted
              to Catholicism in his teens, but eventually turned deist.. why's he
              listed!!?</p>
              <p>I have no problems with people who believe in god/gods which go
              with science, side by side, trying to answer what science cannot,
              and most probably never will be able to.</p>
              <p>furthermore, those scientists may be nobel winners. but so what?
              does that make them more knowledgeable about whether a god exists
              or not?</p>
              <p>eg: a person devotes his life to chemistry, makes astonishing
              discoveries about new elements or creates some wonderful synthetic
              material. This will guarantee him a nobel prize.</p>
              <p>BUT lets say he's a theistic satanist. A theistic satanist
              believes satan as the true creator of man, advocates indulgence
              instead of abstinence, etc etc. Yet none of these beliefs and
              morals will ever contradict with his chemistry knowledge.</p>
              <p>Studying evolution, natural selection and the universe's origin
              is the way to go if one wants to defraud the bible or koran.</p>

              didn't renounce their religion after receiving a nobel prize. The
              number of Christian scientists, especially physics, who received
              Nobel prizes are remarkably high.</p>
              <p>Why do you mention Jean-Jacques Rousseau? Was he a nobel
              laureate? Was he a Physicist?</p>
              <p>Einstein was a Jew. Would you consider Einstein an atheist? Was
              he even an atheist? He believe in Spinoza's God.</p>
              <p>Unlessl you can invent a scientific theory - have it named after

              <p>There is no clear-cut distinct teaching in the bible. Words can be twisted.</p>
               
              <p>Whatever you hear in church, in sermons, is merely the priests interpretation of the bible.</p>

              <p>My personal opinion: Religion is a sensitive issue as it has a long history and there are many believers in different religions.</p>
              <p>Personally I do not fully believe in God. Also there are many Gods for different religions, that's why I feel each religion's God is an extension of a culture/race. That's why Christian Gods are "ang moh", Buddhist "gods" are chinese, etc. (correct me if there are exceptions?) Why isnt there a religion with Gods that embody all the races on Earth?</p>
              <p>However, I do see that religion does do good for certain people. Eg, Christianity is now a popular religion. There are non-believers who convert during times of calling or crisis periods where Christian frenz provide a good social support network. I've also thought about joining Christianity at one point in time as I've a few frenz who are devout christians, who also convert during school days. I think the social network and support that christian groups display show a very strong and warm community. I've even visited a church session before. However, something told me that I can't join and pretend to believe in God if I seriously do not believe it from the bottom of my heart. No doubt I may enjoy the social network, but I can't envisage myself talking about a religion or God or the Bible which I do not connect with and do not believe with. There are too many questions than answers for me.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, it's a personal choice for religion. You must know what you want and be true to yourself. You may deceive others into thinking you do truly believe in God, but you yourself will know deep down in your heart if you really do believe.</p>

                          <p>Oh, you did not study physics in school. You are not familiar
                          with Newton, Boyle, faraday or Kepler. What a jerk!</p>
                          <p>You better explain the conflicts between science and
                          Christianity or you will not be taken seriously.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
                          <p>BTW, what happened to my question on Jean-Jacques Rousseau?
                          Realised the blunder you've made?<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
                          <p>You don't even know when the first Nobel prize was awarded.

                          <p>Well, pardon me, for i was about to leave home for dinner. I did further research and i admit that i made a mistake about jean-jacques, yet i still hold true to my views that there is a contradiction between science and christ.</p>
              
              <p>I did not take my secondary school education seriously, and yes i'm not very familiar with them. so what? I can still provide u the reasons.</p>
                          
                          <p>Conflicts between science and christianity:</p>
                          <p>1) Leviticus 11:13-19 states: These are the birds you are to detest and not eat because they are detestable: the eagle, ... any kind of heron, the hoopoe and the bat.</p>
                          
                          <p>when did bats become birds?</p>
                          
                          <p>2)Leviticus 11:20-22 states: All flying insects that walk on all fours are to be detestable to you. There are, however, some winged creatures that walk on all fours that you may eat: ... Of these you may eat any kind of locust, katydid, cricket, or grasshopper.</p>
                          
                          <p>locusts, katydids, crickets and grasshoppers DO have SIX legs.</p>
                          
                          <p>3)     ... The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved. (Psalms 93:1)
                          
                              ... The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved. (1 Chronicles 16:30)
                          
                              He set the earth on its foundations; it can never be moved. (Psalms 104:5)
                          
                              Joshua said to the LORD in the presence of Israel: "O sun, stand still over Gibeon, O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon. (Joshua 10:12)</p>
                          
                          <p>As we all know, all these statements are false.</p>
                          
                          <p>I can go on and on, i shall stop here unless asked for more.</p>
                          
                          <p>Now the point is, people in the past believed these to be true, yet has been proven to be false in this current age.</p>
                          
                          <p>The christian community has been constantly changing it's views ever since the religion was born, due to facts contradicting the scriptures.</p>
                          
                          <p>So what makes you think you are among a pioneer batch that truly understands the bible?</p>
                          
                          <p>What I am more concerned with, is that people are actually believing the bible word for word, believing the facts to be wrong and are of the devil. eg: http://www.alaska.net/~clund/e_djublonskopf/Flatearthsociety.htm </p>
                          
                          <p> I must stress once again that religion, even in moderation, creates a breeding ground for fanatical idealogy.</p>
                      
                      <p> and so what if i do not know when's the first nobel prize awarded? of course i don't know what i have not researched and i won't be a smart-ass and google the answer just to act like a know-it-all. i humbly admit my ignorance.</p>
