              <p><br>Living testimonies.....every Christians should ideally be a living testimony of God and the power of God. There has been perhaps not too few witnesses and wonders but ignorance too powerful.</p>
              <p>Too many lies and liars, too big ignorance and foolishness that the truth is all concealed behind them.</p>
              <p>When people become a witness of certain wonder they cry psychic even though they do not know anything about psychic. when they witness greater wonder they are silent. Silent at first then began to think all the coincidences that could explain it. Making up explanations which is only remotely logical just to denounce the simple truth that it was a wonder. When people heard wonders they simply dismiss them . I've learned that human is a very subjective and emotional being. The use of logic is only to verify their subjective views. Most people are brainswashed to their beliefs and cannot think clearly and independently. Most people are not even rational. I mean do we buy what we need or do we buy what we want? We need only a little while we want a lot.</p>
              <p>Have you guys ever read about the story of brother Yun from China?Read his book, The heavenly man.</p>
              <p> There's a clip of him telling his testimony on youtube too. But again a great wonder 1,000 miles away weigh much less than a small wonder 10 meters away. People.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look inside as God is inside you. Search your feelings. Tap into [the power of] God as God is tapped into you and each one of you. Let God play an active role in your life. Be empowered. God is not far away. He is always there. Always be with each one of us. Whether you let him be honored in you or to ignore Him completely is up to you. And I'm not babbling new age movement. I hate new age movement. lol.</p>
              <p>Have you ever wanted to utter a wish in your heart and see it granted in an instant? Have you made the demon that came to you fled? All with a faith in God. Have you ever wondered what's inside another person heart. All things are possible with God.</p>
              <p>Well the best training to make a soldier is a battlefield. The best training to make disciples of the Lord is persecution. Either you break or you make. But does it have to come to that to wake up from the deep slumber?</p>

              <p>Since there are people whose behavior is worse than animal. It's an insult to the animal kingdom to regard those people as animal.

              <p>marriage is term for human, and invented by human ,carry out by human, so human and gorrila are differernt,because human are thousand of hundred year ahead of gorrila, through evolution,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>there are some people born with heavy hair all over the body, and with different facial structure, similar to gorrila, somehow, medically it's called a "return back"</p>
              <p>The cause of the so called disease, is there is a gene being suppressed through the development of human kind, and something trigger it to wake up, maybe it's a living proof of theory than human evolve from ape.</p>

              <p><br>you made yourself clear ,about marriage and sex between the human and gorrila, is impossible, but i bet you know someone who have pet, their feeling about their pet sometimes is complicated, for those who have betrayed by their human partners, maybe they will vent their emotion on pet,</p>
              <p>Like dog, loyalty is their instinct.</p>
              <p>Some already treat their pet as family member, for those who is single, maybe their feeling about pet is mixed, sometimes like lovers, sometimes like child.</p>
              <p>You are a christian, so you pretty strengthen on importance of spirituality, but i think the spirituality kingdom of animal is as important as human,</p>
              <p>By buddist point of view, any sentient being have buddha seeds in themselves, i guess this answer the question whether animal have soul or not, because if human have soul, animal will have soul as well from buddhism point of view,</p>

              <p>Wrong, we are equating that humans are part and parcel of the animal world except we are more evolved in the thinking process. Please note that it's not the other way round. Animals having kindess empathy are intrinsic in their instincts as most animals have a social order. Human Beings have instincts by nature as a baby instinctively goes for the mother's teat.</p>

              <p>Albert Einstein do not believe in a Monotheistic Creator God, even though he was born as a Jews. A few Einstein's personal letters on auction have provided solid evidences to prove beyond any doubts that he do not believe in God. Please read the following article for greater details.</p>
              <p><strong>Albert Einstein's God -- The "Product of Human Weaknesses"</strong></p>
              <p>A letter from Albert Einstein to philosopher Eric Gutkind is to be auctioned today at Bloomsbury Auctions in London. The letter -- hidden within a private collection for a half-century -- is making news as evidence of Einstein's dismissal of belief in God.</p>
              <p>For decades, Einstein has been claimed by both atheists and theists. The scientist was given to rather anecdotal statements about religion and belief in God, and these statements are easily taken out of context. Given Einstein's cultural and intellectual stature, both sides in this great debate have assumed that Einstein's agreement would lend intellectual credibility to their argument.</p>
              <p>Some theists (including an unfortunate number of Evangelicals) have seized upon some of Einstein's statements to claim that he was a theist. When Einstein remarked that God "does not throw dice," some claimed that this was evidence of theism and belief in God. When Einstein quipped that "Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind," others claimed that this was evidence of Einstein's insistence that some form of religious belief is necessary to science.</p>
              <p>Atheists, on the other hand, had plenty of evidence upon which to draw. The data of Einstein's life and the contours of his thought certainly indicate that Einstein held no belief in a personal God who acted as a moral agent.</p>
              <p>The letter to Eric Gutkind includes more explicit statements by Einstein, written in the year before his death.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/may/13/peopleinscience.religion"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Guardian</span></span></em></a> [London] published selections from the letter, including this paragraph:</p>
              <p><em>... The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honourable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this. These subtilised interpretations are highly manifold according to their nature and have almost nothing to do with the original text. For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people. As far as my experience goes, they are also no better than other human groups, although they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power. Otherwise I cannot see anything 'chosen' about them</em>.</p>
              <p>Einstein's language is very clear. God is dismissed as "nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses" -- a statement hauntingly like the verdict of Friedrich Nietzsche. This letter helps to substantiate what other statements also indicate. Einstein was not an atheist in the sense that he wanted to deny any force beyond what science could explain. On the other hand, he was an atheist in the sense that he clearly rejected theism and belief in any personal God.</p>
              <p>Born to a Jewish family, Einstein once wrote of his loss of faith:  "Through the reading of popular scientific books, I soon reached the conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not be true. The consequence was a positively fanatic orgy of freethinking coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being deceived by the state through lies, it was a crushing impression."</p>
              <p>In his letter to Gutkind, Einstein expressed his belief that the Bible is a "collection of honourable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish."</p>
              <p>An individual's thought can easily (even almost necessarily) change over a lifetime.  The emergence of the Gutkind letter, written just a year before Einstein's death, seems to provide ample evidence that the scientist's verdict about the Bible did not change.</p>
              <p>Before fleeing Germany as World War II approached, Einstein explained his concept of religion:</p>
              <p>"<em>Try and penetrate with our limited means the secrets of nature and you will find that, behind all the discernible laws and connections, there remains something subtle, intangible, and inexplicable.  Veneration for this force beyond anything that we can comprehend is my religion.  To that extent I am, in fact, religious</em>."</p>
              <p>By that definition, most atheists are "in fact, religious."  There is no room in this definition for the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob -- nor for Jesus Christ.  Like many other unbelievers, Einstein respected the morals of Jesus, but rejected any thought of deity.  He came to be proud of his Jewish ethnic identity, but rejected any claim that the Jews are a chosen people.</p>
              <p>The emergence of the letter from Albert Einstein to Eric Gutkind goes a long way toward setting the record straight.  Evangelical Christians are prone to over-excitement when any famous person, living or dead, is claimed as a believer in God.  This is not an attractive habit, and it often leads to intellectual embarrassment.  The truth of the Gospel and the reality of the self-revealing God are not enhanced by vague expressions of a non-theistic spirituality or a sense of nothing more than an inexplicable sense of meaning in the cosmos.</p>
              <p>Beyond this, the witness of an honest Christian is far more powerful than a listing of the rich, intelligent, and powerful who may or may not have believed in some kind of God.  Attempts to claim Einstein for theism reveal a deep intellectual insecurity.</p>
              <p>The Einstein/Gutkind letter is expected to bring a sale price well into the thousands of dollars.  It is then likely to disappear into yet another private collection.  Its unexpected emergence in these days does present an opportunity to clarify Einstein's real beliefs. </p>
              <p>In the end, it is better to see Einstein, not as a believer of sorts, but as an atheist of sorts.  Belief in God was simply childish, he asserted.   Einstein believed in awe and wonder, but not in God.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Pagan root's of Monotheism</span></strong>.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>The Development of the God-idea </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">To trace the origin and development of the God-idea, one must go back to the time when civilization was still in its infancy and modern science was still unknown. Primitive people, out of fear of and admiration towards natural phenomena, had believed in different spirits and gods. They used their belief in spirit and gods to form religions of their own. According to their respective circumstances and understanding capacity different people worshipped different gods and founded different faiths. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">At the beginning of the God-idea, people worshipped many gods--gods of trees, streams, lightning, storm, winds, the sun and all other terrestrial phenomena. These gods were related to each and every act of nature. Then gradually man began to attribute to these gods, sex and form as well as the physical and mental characteristics of human beings. Human attributes were given to the gods: love, hate, jealousy, fear, pride, envy and other emotions found among human beings. From all these gods, there slowly grew a realization that the phenomena of the universe were not many but were One. This understanding gave rise to the monotheistic god of recent ages. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In the process of development, the God-idea went through a variety of changing social and intellectual climates. It was regarded by different men in different ways. Some idealized god as the King of Heaven and Earth; they had a conception of god as a person. Others thought of god as an abstract principle. Some raised the ideal of Supreme deity to the highest heaven, while others brought it down to the lowest depths of the earth. Some pictured god in a paradise, while others made an idol and worshipped it. Some want so far as to say that there is no salvation without god?no matter how much good you do, you will not receive the fruits of your actions unless you act out of a faith in god. The Atheists said, 'No' and went on to affirm that god did not really exist at all. The Skeptics or Agnostics said, 'We do not or we cannot know.' The Positivists say that the God-idea was a meaningless problem since the idea of the term god 'was not clear'. Thus there grew a variety of ideas and beliefs and names for the God-idea: pantheism, idolatry, belief in a formless god, and belief in many gods and goddesses. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Even the monotheistic god of recent times has gone through a variety of changes as it passed through different nations and people. The Hindu god is quite different from gods of other faiths. Thus numerous religions came into existence: each one differed greatly from the other in the end, and each one says that 'God is One'. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>The God-idea and Creation </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As each religion came into existence and developed around the God-idea, religion developed its own particular explanation of creation. Thus the God-idea became associated with various myths. People used the God-idea as a vehicle for their explanation of the existence of man and the nature of the universe. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Today, intelligent men, who have carefully reviewed all the available facts, have come to the conclusion that, like the God-idea, the creation of myths must be regarded as an evolution of the human imagination which began with the misunderstanding of the phenomena of nature. These misunderstandings were rooted in the fear and ignorance of primitive man. Even today, man still retains his primitive interpretations of creation. In the light of recent, scientific thinking, the theological definition of god is vague and hence has no place in the contemporary creation theories or myths. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If man is created by an external source, then he must belong to that source and not to himself. According to Buddhism, man is responsible for everything he does. Thus Buddhists have no reason to believe that man came into existence in the human form through any external sources. They believe that man is here today because of his own action. He is neither punished nor rewarded by anyone but himself according to his own good and bad action. In the process of evolution, the human being came into existence. However, there are no Buddha-words to support the belief that the world was created by anybody. The scientific discovery of gradual development of the world-system conforms with the Buddha's Teachings. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Human Weakness and the Concept of God </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Both the concept of God and its associated creation myths have been protected and defended by believers who need these ideas to justify their existence and usefulness to human society. All the believers claim to have received their respective scriptures as Revelation; in other words, they all profess to come directly from the one God. Each God-religion claims that it stands for Universal Peace and Universal Brotherhood and other such high ideals. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">However great the ideals of the religious might be, the history of the world shows that the religions up to the present day have also helped in spreading superstitions. Some have stood against science and the advancement of knowledge, leading to ill-feelings, murders and wars. In this respect, the God-religions have failed in their attempt to enlighten mankind. For example, in certain countries when people pray for mercy, their hands are stained with the blood of the morbid sacrifices of innocent animals and sometimes, even fellow human beings. These poor and helpless creatures were slaughtered at the desecrated altars of imaginary and imperceptible gods. It has taken a long time for people to understand the futility of such cruel practices in the name of religion. The time has come for them to realize that the path of real purification is through love and understanding. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Dr. G. Dharmasiri in his book 'Buddhist critique of the Christian Concept of God' has mentioned, 'I see that though the notion of God contains sublime moral strands, it also has certain implications that are extremely dangerous to the humans as well as to the other beings on this planet. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">'One major threat to humanity is the blindfold called 'authority' imposed on the humans by the concept of God. All theistic religions consider authority as ultimate and sacred. It was this danger that the Buddha was pointing at in the <em>Kalama Sutta</em>. At the moment, human individuality and freedom are seriously threatened by various forms of authorities. Various 'authorities' have been trying to make 'you' a follower. On top of all our 'traditional' authorities, a new form of authority has emerged in the name of 'science'. And lately, the mushrooming new religions and the menace of the Gurus(as typified by Jim Jones), have become live threats to the individual's human freedom and dignity. The Buddha's eternal plea is for you to become a Buddha, and He showed, in a clearly rational way, that each and every one of us has the perfect potentiality and capacity to attain that ideal.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">God-religions offer no salvation without God. Thus a man might conceivably have climbed to the highest pinnacle of virtue, and he might have led a righteous way of life, and he might even have climbed to the highest level of holiness, yet he is to be condemned to eternal hell just because he did not believe in the existence of God. On the other hand, a man might have sinned deeply and yet, having made a late repentance, he can be forgiven and therefore 'saved'. From the Buddhist point of view, there is no justification in this kind of doctrine. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Despite the apparent contradictions of the God-religions, it is not deemed advisable to preach a Godless doctrine since the belief in god has also done a tremendous service to mankind, especially in places where the god concept is desirable. This belief in god has helped mankind to control his animal nature. And much help has been granted to others in the name of god. At the same time, man feels insecure without the belief in god. He finds protection and inspiration when that belief is in his mind. The reality or validity of such a belief is based on man's understanding capacity and spiritual maturity. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">However, religion should also concern our practical life. It is to be used as a guide to regulate our conduct in the world. Religion tells us what to do and what not to do. If we do not follow a religion sincerely, mere religious labels or belief in god do not serve us in our daily life. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">On the other hand, if the followers of various religions are going to quarrel and to condemn other beliefs and practices -- especially to prove or disprove the existence of God -- and if they are going to harbor anger towards other religions because of their different religious views, then they are creating enormous disharmony amongst the various religious communities. Whatever religious difference we have, it is our duty to practise tolerance, patience and understanding. It is our duty to respect the other man's religious belief even if we cannot accommodate it; tolerance is necessary for the sake of harmonious and peaceful living. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">However, it does not serve any purpose to introduce this concept of god to those who are not ready to appreciate it. To some people this belief is not important to lead a righteous life. There are many who lead a noble life without such belief while amongst believers there are many who violate the peace and happiness of innocent people. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Buddhists can also co-operate with those who hold this concept of god, if they use this concept for the peace, happiness and welfare of mankind but not with those who abuse this concept by threatening people in order to introduce this belief just for their own benefit and with ulterior motives. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">For more than 2,500 years, all over the world, Buddhists have practised and introduced Buddhism very peacefully without the necessity of sustaining the concept of a creator of God. And they will continue to sustain this religion in the same manner without disturbing the followers of other religions. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Therefore, with due respect to other religionists, it must be mentioned that any attempt to introduce this concept into Buddhism is unnecessary. Let Buddhists maintain their belief since it is harmless to others and, let the basic Teachings of the Buddha remain. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">From time immemorial, Buddhists have led a peaceful religious life without incorporating the particular concept of God. They should be capable of sustaining their particular religion without the necessity, at this juncture, of someone trying to force something down their throats against their will. Having full confidence in their Buddha Dhamma, Buddhists should be permitted to work and seek their own salvation without any undue interference from other sources. Others can uphold their beliefs and concepts, Buddhist will uphold theirs, without any rancor. We do not challenge others in regard to their religious persuasions, we expect reciprocal treatment in regard to our own beliefs and practices.</span></p>

              <p><br>Living testimonies.....every Christians should ideally be a living testimony of God and the power of God. There has been perhaps not too few witnesses and wonders but ignorance too powerful.</p>
              <p>Too many lies and liars, too big ignorance and foolishness that the truth is all concealed behind them.</p>
              <p>When people become a witness of certain wonder they cry psychic even though they do not know anything about psychic. when they witness greater wonder they are silent. Silent at first then began to think all the coincidences that could explain it. Making up explanations which is only remotely logical just to denounce the simple truth that it was a wonder. When people heard wonders they simply dismiss them . I've learned that human is a very subjective and emotional being. The use of logic is only to verify their subjective views. Most people are brainswashed to their beliefs and cannot think clearly and independently. Most people are not even rational. I mean do we buy what we need or do we buy what we want? We need only a little while we want a lot.</p>
              <p>Have you guys ever read about the story of brother Yun from China?Read his book, The heavenly man.</p>
              <p> There's a clip of him telling his testimony on youtube too. But again a great wonder 1,000 miles away weigh much less than a small wonder 10 meters away. People.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look inside as God is inside you. Search your feelings. Tap into [the power of] God as God is tapped into you and each one of you. Let God play an active role in your life. Be empowered. God is not far away. He is always there. Always be with each one of us. Whether you let him be honored in you or to ignore Him completely is up to you. And I'm not babbling new age movement. I hate new age movement. lol.</p>
              <p>Have you ever wanted to utter a wish in your heart and see it granted in an instant? Have you made the demon that came to you fled? All with a faith in God. Have you ever wondered what's inside another person heart. All things are possible with God.</p>
              <p>Well the best training to make a soldier is a battlefield. The best training to make disciples of the Lord is persecution. Either you break or you make. But does it have to come to that to wake up from the deep slumber?</p>
