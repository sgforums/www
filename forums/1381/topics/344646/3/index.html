              <p>my goodness sake.. some of you all can really talk reasons
              illogically.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no god. It is that simple. I know that there are many
              people who believe in god. However, no matter how many people in
              the world believe in god, it would not make god existence become
              real.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>God existence is a human illusion. Apparently, as you can see
              from this post, many people are either believers or 'not interested
              in the answer' people. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Atheism is the correct idea. Its states that there is no god,
              which hits the truth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you do not believe in atheism, that means you have missed a
              truth in life. If you understand and conclude for yourself atheism
              is correct, then you have hit the truth, and that will bring you
              good things in life. Because truth is a virtue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who dun care about this question, its your own loss
              because ignorance is not an virtue and there are negative
              effect.</p>

              <p>to me, i think that atheism and religion, which one is true is a primary one question.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>there are more important and difficult questions and decision to make in later life. Those are the question of university level and the professor level decisions and beliefs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If a person got this primary one question wrong. The foundation will be faulty already. If you get it correct, its good but nothing to cheer also, cos its primary one level only.</p>

The one that kicked satan's ass all the way to hell.The alpha and the omega. Oh,  and i know u are not god by way logical fact that u dun believe in god. So how can one of such great power deny his very own existence ?</p>
              <p>Well, i not shaming u or directly pouring cold water on you, i am just saying, if u guys believe in logic and science , so be it. But i am just showing u the holes the logic athiests use for thier argument thats all. I cant help it... lol.</p>

              <p>hello, a catholic here, i believe the answer that your looking for is in this post that you've typed.</p>
              <p>sorry i know i'm not making much sense but what made you believe that theres a God in the 1st place? i'll like to ask you to revisit those experiences/times and i believe you've gone through the cathecism program? Go to the church where you serve and ask a catechist to help you, i'm sure they'll be more than happy to. If not then just join an RCIA or RCIY program for a refresher course. We lose our faith sometimes, the fact that you're asking around for confirmation that God is real goes to show that to a certain degree you already believe in him.</p>
              <p>I myself came to really believe in God when i was in sec 3, during one of the camp retreat. Before that i always though where the hell is this "God" that i'm being forced to get up early on sundays for? Where was he when i failed my PSLE??</p>
              <p>Coming to a forum no doubt is a better way to get a "balanced" view it is also a dangerous place where useless info are freely shared.</p>
              <p>And with regards to God is in us. I believe its the holy spirit thats in every1 of us?</p>

              <p><br>it is unfortunate that are only have two groups of friends who hold opposing views. the more you mix around you will find that there are many who hold views quite different from these two.</p>
              <p>atheists cannot prove that god do not exists anymore than religious people being able to prove that god (any god) exists.</p>
              <p>posting such questions here will only lead you to more confusion +++ starting flaming posts from both camps... and you will not be any wiser.</p>
              <p>atheists have become christians and christians have become atheists.... on the grand scale of things, what your believe personally does not affect the other folks here.</p>
              <p>you will need to work this out yourself... if don't think god exists, so be it.... if you think god exists but not sure what's he doing, go talk to a pastor or a priest....</p>
              <p>allow me to offer you a starting point: ask yourself.... do you believe in the supernatural (ie, something that exists beyond the natural realm).... if you don't believe in the supernatural.... that the likelihood of the existence of God is very very remote.... if you do believe in the existence of the supernatural.... then perhaps there is a God.</p>
