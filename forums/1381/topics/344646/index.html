              <p><em>This is my entry for Ray Comfort’s “Why I Don’t Believe in God” contest. It’s impossible to fit all the reasons not to believe in God in 200 words, so this is my very selective attempt. It’s a shame I couldn’t fit examples to back up my points — it will make it easy for Ray to “refute” it. But that’s the point of limiting it to 200 words, I guess.</em></p>
              <p>My journey to atheism began as I studied science. I gradually traveled from young earth creationism to old earth creationism to theistic evolution to atheistic evolution. Evolution elegantly refuted my belief that design required a designer. I also realized the probability of an “infinitely complex” God was inherently more improbable than any other cosmological solution, because something infinitely complex is infinitely improbable.</p>
              <p>I studied the history of the Bible. Eventually I acknowledged its messy history, contradictions, horrors and absurdities. It had no more evidence of being from God than any other holy book. Without blind belief in the Bible, there was no evidence for the supernatural claims of Christianity.  Furthermore, I realized that miraculous claims were always based on anecdote. There was never any evidence, only tall tales.</p>
              <p>Long ago, man, in his ignorance, created gods to make sense of the world. Then, when that failed, man created science. Science has been the most successful way of discovering truth ever invented. For example, we no longer have to pray for the sick or exorcise demons - we heal with medicine. Science has, in every way, proven far more effective than religion.</p>
              <p>God is no longer necessary, and I say good riddance.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I do not believe god exists because there are too many claims (usually very specific claims) and no evidence at all. There is no way to prove or disprove god's existance, just like the existance of extra terrestrials. But most religeos retards go around saying that they are a witness. Well, we are not interested in a witness' claims right? We need solid evidence, but they cannot provide any.</p></div>

              <p>That would be too simple an answer to us human beings would it not?</p>
              <p>I'm not here to proof god existence nor am I an advocate for science, but I would rather believe that god is alive within ourself and science is a proof of it.</p>
              <p>Of gods and men, there is only one difference, the decision we make in our everyday life. It is these decisions that decides if there is a god within us.</p>
              <p>An example would be saving another's life at the cost of our own safety, that would be something that God would have done if he is there. And in this case should we choose to do that, we would have manifested his existence by our actions to the person in need. If I were to do something like that, I would not proclaim myself to be a god. Instead I would tell the person whom I have helped that he/she could be the same person who save someone else another day.</p>
              <p>One of the few interesting books that I have read which actually gives an unbiased view on the implications of science towards god or religion on a whole is Gods of the new millennium by Alan F. Alford. If you are interested on pure facts and documented proof of the existence of God in the scientific sense, you can refer to this book though it is quite old. The last print should be in 1999. But please read it with an open mind, and you will find yourself enlightened on other issues and not just theology. After I have finish reading the book, I look at the world in a different perspective. Everything scientific becomes more than what it seems and everything theological becomes something to be appreciated more.</p>
              <p>Find God within yourself, for that is the only place where you know it will be.</p>
