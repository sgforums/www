              <p>There is no living man who is without a soul. If you meant conscience well conscience is not soul.</p>
              <p>And yes souls are not simply masses of energy floating around but I think some souls could for whatever reason change its appearance into masses of glowing energy ball. I don't know whether they were human souls though. Some souls could fly or move in the airspace. Some others move very quickly as if they were lightning. Others walk and teleported. Some souls when they move in our world reverbates a distintive energy waves that actually could be felt very clearly at least to the person it intended to feel. I have no idea why they reverbates energy waves while moving. But those which do reverbate in varying strength. And they are imo are not ordinary souls. I think the stronger the spirit, the stronger the reverbation they cause to the 'environment'. Perhaps the reverbation is the tearing of the fabric of time and space. But this is just my stupid theory.</p>
              <p>As for where do souls come from and how one acquired one is still much a mystery. I don't think living person souls come from heaven well except for Christ.</p>
              <p>But I do know where [some] human souls are going and where Jesus went for three days after His death on the cross. And why Jesus told His disciples that Lazarus was sleeping when He actually meant that he was dead. Read the two links below to know where [some] human souls are going. It's a place neither heaven nor hell. It's the place Jesus referred as the kingdom of death. It's a situation brought upon by the deceit of the snake upon the first human.</p>

              <p><br>so what's soul like, it's a kind of inner form of yourself.</p>
              <p>And if when we say there is a soul exist, seems there is a life after death, actually even there is a god,or a soul, i don't believe it's like what been described in mythology, god cannot be conceive by human with the limited knowledge, but i tend to believe human are not alone in universe, so maybe there is higher civilisation or higher creature, someone name it god.</p>
              <p>A human cannot even know all the knowledge in the human world, how can a human conceive god, which is supernatural?</p>

              <p>haha your "stupid theory" is the closest one i've seen so far that relates to the actual theory. (Memory serves one purpose...) The way energy <strong>can </strong>cause a tear in time and space (aka, a rift) in order to pass through. It's kind of like... when you throw something. There's a lot of laws of physics that have to be applied to throw an object, and also to have accuracy. I'm not saying that the movement of souls is as easy as that, though. Maybe......</p>
              <p>oh, and I have a digital camera that can take a picture where you see everything clearly and then you end up with all these white cirlces in the picture. That might be the visible example behind your explanation.</p>

              <p>So isn't it blind faith to believe in something which you cant verify?</p>
              
              <p>Anyway, regarding the souls, you tend to say animals do have souls, but many christians believe that humans have the right to tread on the rights of animals because god gave humans the permission and this is because god did not create animals in his image, thus they do not possess an immortal soul which would one day inhibit heaven.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              Another proof which show many christians do not believe animals have souls:
              
              "Well, in a public audience on January 19th 1990 Pope John Paul 11 said "also the animals possess a soul and men must love and feel solidarity with smaller brethren" He pointed out that in Genesis "the way in which man was created suggests a relationship with the spirit or the breath of God. And one reads that after having created man from the dust of the earth, the Lord God 'breathed life into his nostrils and man became a living soul.'" He went on to say that animals have the breath of life and were given it by God. So, in this respect, man, created by the hand of God, is identical with all other living creatures. Although the pope's statement was reported in the Italian press it was not reported in the UK and was ignored by British Catholic publications."

              <p>Your question is easy to be answer :)</p>
              <p>Well dont belive = u have ur reason</p>
              <p>Belive = u have ur reason</p>
              <p>And I'm sure everyone knows what are those reason to belive and not to.</p>
              <p>But the people are still asking weather they "should" or "should not" belive in God.</p>
              <p>Is really no use asking another person for this question actually. (Since u aready know the "reason")</p>
              <p>So, just ask yourself. Do u "want" to belive in God, rather than "should" you belive in God.</p>
              <p>And your problem will be solve :)</p>
              <p>Luck and peace :)</p>

              <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Well a relationship with God is primarily based on faith. You can't change that. God in all His wisdom thinks that our faith is something precious to be valued by Him.</p>
              <p>It doesn't mean that the faith is blind because believers will have moments in their life where they actually see God's work that is indisputable to the believer. Be it a miraculous healing, miraculous repentance, being freed from the threat of evil, being consoled when praying, overwhelming peace, dramatic change of heart, vision, prophecy, apparition, personal revelation and other kind of wonders.</p>
              <p>Some even have a more intimate relationship with God than many other people. These people are known to be mystics or saints( I know that to some Christians every Christian is a saint but not every self professed Christian is a Christian). </p>
              <p>In other words God is something personal that you need to experience. And you will find that faith in Christ and God is not in vain. It works.</p>
              <p>The problem now is I see so many Christians today who are clueless about God and having no personal relationship with God. Many Christians also prefer safety than to stand on their faith. Many lost their faith, dying slowly in their faith over the years so that they become neither Christians or atheist in a full sense or they become a fanatics/extremist out of desperation. From what I've seen from these people they have no personal experience with God and are usually very weak in their faith or having a false sense of spirituality which is fabricated instead of genuine.</p>
              <p>I don't mean to judge them but when one decides to become a Christian either go all the way or don't bother to become one lest one wants to become the stone that hinders others from finding about Christ.</p>

              <p>Why must we always challenge and ask for proof and evidence of any beliefs?</p>
              <p>When you are with your mother, do you ask for proof that she is your biological mother?  Oh yes, you may say that you have birth cert to prove it.  Then why can't Christians have bible as the proven word of God?  Or do we go into searching for scientific evidence by doing a DNA test on our parents?  Yes, we can do it, but why isn't anybody doing it and choose to believe with no question asked?</p>
              <p>You see... how Christian believe the existence in God is just like how we believe in our own parents (forget about those problem kids who have issues with parents). </p>
              <p>In my example above,</p>
              <p>Child = Christian</p>
              <p>Parent = God</p>
              <p>Birth Cert = Bible</p>
              <p>DNA test = scientific evidence of God's existence</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My mom told me that she gave birth to me by natural delivery.  She also shared with me her ordeal while giving birth to me and I almost died in her womb.  I believe in what she told me and of course I believe that she is my biological mother.  So, is that blind believing?  Or should I ask for proof and scientific evidence of the believability?</p>
