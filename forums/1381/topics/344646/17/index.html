              <p>In the case of having to prove god exists can be seen in this example. Whether or not your mother is your biological one does not really matter right? As long as she plays the part. However does god always play the part? Providing for a foster mother is much easier then praying to a figment of imagination. When something goes right you thank god. Something goes wrong u blame yourself, where got logic?</p>
              <p>When you pray for something it doesn't happen then you say its not god's will. If it happens then you heap praises. So basically either way god is always there/correct? I myself can also create a religion, i just need a "holy" text that has the words "shall not test god", bam! You can't prove my religion is a fake. If my book got any errors can just say its misinterpretation. I can also make my own "doomsday" book. If what i write happens means i see the future, if it doesn't happen i just need to say its not in your lifetime.</p>
              <p>Im sure many people do literature and ppl always say that a piece of writing has thousands of interpretations. The fact is, the writer only meant for there to be one interpretation. What many people are doing now is probably called over-reading into the passage.</p>

              <p>so what's holding you? Make your own religion. I would certainly be interested in observing how this religion of yours would develop through time.</p>
              <p>Prove me that you can make people believe in lies by devising your own theology.</p>
              <p>Come on do it you can share with us here your own theology. I'd be interested. remember just write anyhow. Don't copy. Make your own theology. Say 66 gods enough? or 6? or even one? And the 77 messiah or even one? Tell us what happens when people die according to your made up religion. Basic tehology first should suffice at first. But you need to have your own holy book. Your own place of worship and your own priest or priesteess. Come on do your talk! Or are you just a fool who writes without even thinking. we all would count how many years this religion of yours can stand? 1,000? 2,000? or more?</p>

              <p>I'm sorry but the truth is that He does.</p>
              <p>I'm saying this not merely out of conviction but out of my own testimony. God is alive. His whole body was covered by an immense white light that shone from His face. Such was the intensity of the light which was coming out from [the direction of] His face that even His figure was not able to be seen. I wasn't able to penetrate the light to see His face, I tried for several time stubbornly but in the end God made both my eyeballs hurt because of the sheer intensity of the light which was coming out from His face.</p>
              <p>His name was Jesus. I know because I asked for Jesus(to be allowed to see His face, because I thought that all the pictures of Jesus were merely man made and not the true Jesus) and was then shown the vision after God gave me love for Jesus which was rapidly increasing in intensity in mere seconds and I felt I deserved to ask someting of God and I asked to be allowed to see Jesus face. What I saw was clear, very clear in fact and I saw it while being fully awake. I wasn't imagining things. In the end the vision faded...I didn't dare to try to see [in the direction of] His face again after both my eyes were hurt by the sheer intensity of the light which was coming out from His face so I just kind of stare at the ground.... The vision was given while I was in my 7th grade(sec 1). I'm now 29 years old.</p>
              <p>I know for a fact that God is alive.</p>

              <p>can humans who onli use 15% of our brain at the most ever fully understand a God who supposedly created everything in tis universe? if one seeks to fully understand Him b4 believing in Him, then one is bound to fail. again, I will not worship and put my trust in a God whom i can fully understand cos then i am trusting in a God who is equal to 15% of my brain...</p>
