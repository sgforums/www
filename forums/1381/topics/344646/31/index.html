              <p>You guessed wrongly.............</p>
              <p>First, pls explain why you did not respond to questions on what you mean by "Love and compassion and morality is ingrained into the human psyche" is it a scientific fact or did you just make it up?</p>
              <p>Secondly, when did anyone here said that we don't need science? The fact is science till date has no answer to the origin of life......and since when did I said that we should stop looking for answers?</p>
              <p>As much as you speculate that science may one day find the answer, the truth is you don't know if it will happen or will ever happen. I said we already know the answer but not everyone wants to accept the answer  and that's your choice.</p>
              <p>So, until science can proved the origins of life as otherwise, we stick to what we already know.</p>
              <p>Yes, maybe you can claimed that there is no God and we are just putting our faith blindly......and yet you have no proof that there is no God...</p>
              <p>On the other hand, you feel very intelligent putting your faith in science as if it is an alternative religion and yet, there is no assurance that science ever find the answer....A case of being disillusioned with the science? (sounds familiar?)</p>
              <p>Yes, there is no need for a lot of things to survive......you need air and water and all other lives (our food chain) also need that. Where did air and water come from? Ahh, that means we do need God?</p>
              <p>Your reply is not sarcastic at all.....it's childish.</p>

              <p>First, yes, all emotions can be traced by having an MRI scan done to your brain. Thats why scientists can say which parts of the brain does what. It cannot actually manufacture the emotion, but you know the brain uses chemical electrical pathways in the specific area of the cortex.</p>
              <p>Secondly, I'm not familiar with your line of reasoning.</p>
              <p>"So, until science can proved the origins of life as otherwise, we stick to what we already know."</p>
              <p>What do you already know? A few lines from a dusty old book written 2000 years ago by cavemen and has not been updated since? Seriously. All that love and compassion stuff in the bible may be alright, but when it starts commenting about the physical realm, it gets ugly.</p>
              <p>Because the physical realm belongs to science. Earth made 6000 years ago? Testable. God created man and animals? Testable. Earth the center of the universe? Testable. And guess what? Science tested them, and the bible was ABSOLUTELY wrong.</p>
              <p>"where did air and water come from?" The big bang and the supernovas of stars apparently. Certainly not god.</p>
              <p>"and yet you have no proof that there is no God..."  If you have ever studied logic or philosophy, the "burden of proof" is your side. So don't tell me that there's a god and i can't disprove it. YOU prove it, its YOUR claim that god exists.</p>
              <p>Although science may not have all the answers, at least we're going the right way. At least we're moving in the right direction. If you're going to say "god did it" at every step of the way, we're never going to move forward, and maybe even backwards.</p>
              <p>Imagine if Thomas Edison said God did it. We won't have lightbulbs.</p>
              <p>Imagine if Newton said God did it. We won't have the theory of Gravity.</p>
              <p>Imagine if Einstein said God did it. We wouldn't have nuclear power or a understanding of the universe.</p>
              <p>Try to look at the universe without god. I've look at it with god before, and it all seems so childishly easy, just applying god to everything, and saying god works in mysterious ways when you don't understand something.</p>
              <p>Try instead to THINK, to find out what happened, instead of blaming it on some invisible, untouchable, apparation that can do anything.</p>

              <p>Free will? When god killed the egyptians forcing them to free
              the jews, when he brought down the tower of babel, what happened to
              their free will?</p>
              <p>The part about the coming of jesus, like what u said a few posts
              above, is but speculation</p>
              <p>You choose to believe in the bible, which means that you agree
              that you're gonna be doomed, coz according to the bible, you are
              not one of the people of his chosen, master race, the jews.</p>

              <p>Hi, the bible did mention why God killed the egyptians. Please research more about it before you talk.</p>

              <p>Yes, such a concept that the  "concept of god was invented by man" is invented by faithless man which is baseless.....and nothing to argue about because it is baseless and false. So don't say it again since you already said many times...</p>
