              <p>miracles and prophecies, i think you have yet to realize morals are mere creations of men.</p>
              <p>men who are higher or lower than animals? who are you to judge? are you sure everybody else agrees with your judgment? only people who uphold the same moral system as you do, will agree. but there is no such thing as a universal moral system.</p>
              <p>people in saudi arabia believe its morally right to kill women who shame their husbands and family.</p>

              <p><br>No moral judgment is not something that is created by men. Each men have the capacity to judge what is good and what is evil. Any man who has lost its moral guidance and conscience is a derailed person.</p>
              <p> However men capability to judge what is good and what is evil may be distorted since childhood by culture or any other human made beliefs even by religion or distorted religion or  by faulty upbringing.</p>
              <p>But every man knows what is good and what is evil inherently.</p>
              <p>And because every man knows what is good and what is evil we are ought to be judged in the end. If you look at the bible I don't think animal would be judged according to what they did.</p>
              <p>A person once told me that the meaning of the antichirst number is involution which means the opposite of evolution. Men are ought to be judged because of the universally existing conscience in men. The existence of which cannot be expected in mere animals.</p>
              <p>Christ didn't come to save the animals but to save men who was created in the image of God. Beacuse men could sin and rebel against God fully knowing of it consciously or subconsciously. Animal cannot be said to have rebelled against God. Do you know any sinful dog or snake? Or have you ever thought of a morally numb animal? or an evil animal?</p>
              <p>Men are moral creatures because we have the ability to judge what is wrong and what is not. There is no doubt about it. Would you as a parent ever want to hope that your children grow to be morally corrupt people? People without conscience? People without a heart? Even if they grow to be successful and hold high prestige? Would you?</p>
              <p>The most obvious proof that we are moral creatures is the universal existence of values in every culture which has existed. Kindness, lovingness, humility, etc. What grown man doesn't grasp the concept of goodness or any of those values above? In every culture and folklore we admit and understand the concept of good and evil. Or who here who would not feel violated when he or she is in the receiving end of an evil act from another person. One would not feel violated by acts of evil if one didn't grasp the concept of evil and good. Or just look at every civilization there is. which one doesn't have a judiciary system of some sort? Thus we acknowledge that evil needs to be punished. And that none of us would like to be in the receiving end of evil deeds.</p>
              <p>Or is there a movie in which the protagonist is an evil character and the antagonist a good character? And which in the end the evil protagonist had a 'happy' ending?There is a perfectly good reason why there isn't such a movie made.</p>
              <p>Men are moral creatures while we cannot say the same for animals. It's the same reason why we can be regarded as being lower than animals when we choose not to follow our conscience.</p>
              <p> When morality fails universally, civilization will follow.</p>

              <p>Einstein wasn't a deist either.</p>
              <p>Einstein's religious views are often debated as he did not give a specific answer during his lifetime.</p>
              <p>Einstein was often asked, "Do you believe in God?", to which he <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sometimes</span> replied "I believe in Spinoza's God, who reveals himself in the harmony of all being". "By God", Spinoza wrote at the very beginning of his Ethica, "I mean a being absolutely infinite-that is, a substance consisting in infinite attributes, of which each expresses eternal and infinite essentiality". Proposition XV of the Ethica stated: "Whatever is, is in God, and without God nothing can be, or be conceived."</p>
              <p>Einstein certainly held, as his constant appeal to God showed, that without God nothing can be known, but what did he really mean by his appeal to Spinoza? Once in answer to the question "Do you believe in the God of Spinoza?" Einstein replied as follows:</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I can't answer with a simple yes or no.</span> I'm not an atheist and I don't think I can call myself a pantheist. We are in the position of a little child entering a huge library filled with books in many different languages. The child knows someone must have written those books. It does not know how. The child dimly suspects a mysterious order in the arrangement of the books but doesn't know what it is. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of even the most intelligent human being toward God. We see a universe marvellously arranged and obeying certain laws, but only dimly understand these laws. Our limited minds cannot grasp the mysterious force that moves the constellations. I am fascinated by Spinoza's pantheism, but admire even more his contributions to modern thought because he is the first philosopher to deal with the soul and the body as one, not two separate things.</p>
              <p>He dared not claim what he could not understand but he was awed by the laws that held the universe together.</p>
              <p>Never did he once state he <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">firmly</span> </span>believed in a supreme being who created existence.<br><br>An <span style="text-decoration: underline;">agnostic pantheist</span> is what describes Einstein best, in my opinion. This is because he does not firmly believe in a spinozian god. Furthermore, spinoza's god is a pantheistic one.<br><br>Pantheism differs from deism because pantheists view the universe as one entity, everything is united together in some way, and this entity is god.<br><br>Deists believe one supreme god which created the universe, and left nature to develop it.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Flaws of Monotheist's counter-responses to the question of "Who created God".</span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The question “Who made God” is commonly used to argue against the existence of the sort of god traditionally believed in by Christians, Jews, Muslims, and many other monotheists. Strictly speaking, this isn’t an independent argument because it is not offered on its own. Instead, it is used as a rebuttal to the claim that our universe is too complex and intricate not to have been designed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to this common theological argument, nothing so complex as the universe with all of its accompanying natural laws could possibly have occurred simply due to random chance; ergo, it must have all been designed and created by some being which believers label “god.” This can only establish the existence of a creator god, but that is usually enough of a basis for many to then proceed with further arguments to show that a creator god must be the same god of their religion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The response “Who made God?” can be used to point out an important flaw in the above argument: if the universe is too complex not to have been designed, then God is also too complex not to have been designed. A creator-god is never portrayed as something simple or, more importantly, something simpler than the universe. If this god is at least as complex as the universe, then it needs a designer and creator at least as much as the universe.</p>
              <p>Believers will usually respond with one of a couple of common objections. The first is to claim that this creator-god has always existed while the universe has not; because the universe began to exist at some point, it requires a creator in a way that the god does not. Unfortunately, the assertion that this god always existed is unsupported and apparently unsupportable — it’s just an assertion we have no particular reason to believe. The assertion that the universe “began” to exist is also problematic because time itself is a feature of the universe, and therefore the universe does not exist “in” time such that we can talk about a time “before the universe” or a time “after the universe.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another objection raised by believers is the idea that their god is a “necessary being” and doesn’t need a “creator.” Unfortunately, this is also unsupported and unsupportable. There is no basis for such an arbitrary assertion, except to try to excuse their god from the same standards they wish to apply to the universe.</p>

              <p>...continue from preceding post.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Moreover, both of the above excuses made for this god can be equally work for the universe. Why can’t the universe be “necessary” or not need a “creator?” Why can’t we say that the universe has “always” existed because there is no identifiable point in time when the universe did not exist? No one can say — after all, we really don’t know enough about our universe or universes in general to make such judgments. Of course, we also don’t have enough verifiable data of gods to make such judgments about <strong>them</strong>, either.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another possible objection, also ad hoc in nature because it is only brought up in order to explain away this argument, is the idea that the “complexity” being discussed only applies to material things. God, being immaterial, is not subject to the same standards. This objection falters, however, because the same people offering it also typically believe in immaterial souls, thus leading to the unorthodox belief of our souls existing in parallel with this god rather than being creations of this god. Although someone could hold such a belief, it isn’t one you will likely encounter; as a result, it is unlikely that this objection can be used consistently or successfully with the person’s beliefs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The question “Who made God?” does not quite suffice to prove that the traditional God believed in by Jews, Christians, Muslims, and others does not exist. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>It does, however, manage to show that one of the most common and popular reasons used to support belief in such a god is highly problematic and probably cannot serve as rational grounds for belief. </strong></span></span></p>

              <p>Err.. because there are so many Gods out there, one must use his/her intelligence to find the correct God that made us, or probably such a God does not exist at all?</p>

              <p><br>You should first find out for yourself how the Earth's planet eco-system would be affected if the Sun were too close or too far away from Earth.</p>
              <p>Especially when you only chose to consider the brightness/darkness of the Sun, you should never be naive to ignore the UV effects of the Sunlight.</p>
              <p>Like I said, things don't happened by themselves or by an accident. Everything that is around you, has it's own maker and creator.</p>
              <p>So please don't be naive and believed that the solar system and the planets and the Sun and all the blessings around you were there by luck or an accident.</p>

              <p>Hi A.T.R. It is normal for anyone to doubt the existence of God. Especially when God does not appear to answer our prayers and when we have friends who ridicule our belief in God. I would suggest that you speak to your favourite priest about your doubts and your fears. Pray to God as well, not to ask him for this favour and that (can do that later) but just cry out to him as a friend about your doubts and fears.</p>
              <p>You might also want to read the following inspiring stories of folks who have found God in the Catholic Church:</p>
              <p><br><a href="http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2008/0802dr.asp">http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2008/0802dr.asp</a></p>

              <p><br>Lastly, we will never be able to prove or disprove the existence of God using 'scientifc means', so it will be pointless for you to pursue that route. God bless !</p>
