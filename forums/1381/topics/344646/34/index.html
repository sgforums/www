              <p>I am here to enlighten people the origination of religions, how they came about, but I suppose people like you are being inculcated with the preachings that you are hopelessly out of tune and out of touch with reality. I have heard enough of christians preaching that not only provoked, but also insulted other religions with your god is satanic and only believers are going to heaven. The stand I make is not against your religion, but on any religion with a god or many concept. thank goodness the whole world is not praying or worshipping to god blindly, if not society will never progress the way it is now.</p>

              with the preachings that you are hopelessly out of tune and out of
              touch with reality. I have heard enough of christians preaching
              that not only provoked, but also insulted other religions with your
              god is satanic and only believers are going to heaven. The stand I
              make is not against your religion, but on any religion with a god
              or many concept. thank goodness the whole world is not praying or
              worshipping to god blindly, if not society will never progress the

              <p>Ha...ha... ha..., you don't need proof to conclude that God is unreal and does not exist but need proof that He does? Talking about illogical....this is classic. Yes, I bet such simple logic is beyond you.....</p>
              <p>Actually, I already gave you proof but you choose to ignore it and now claimed that it is "hollow" but never said why and explain how or show your cause.....I have been asking many times and you evaded all the time....</p>
              <p>And your lack of proof in itself is the best proof that you are wrong......</p>
              <p>Maybe, you can't face the truth and it is as simple as abc.....and hope Santa can bring you some logic and common sense this Christmas.</p>

              <p><br>as I said previously, if you have proof, christians or judaist would have proven it long ago. if you have proof, you would have provided it  immediately and there will be no debate whatsoever. we are still awaiting for you and your brethens to provide it.</p>

              <p>See, there is proof but you choose to ignore and reject it but NO valid reasons is stated.</p>
              <p>And it has nothing to do with superman because Jesus did exist and history, facts and science all point to that truth.</p>
              <p>What about you? Have you even provided ONE proof?</p>

              <p>See you completely try to evade the issue at hand....you came here to said all those things you did but can not back it up......nothing at all.</p>
              <p>As you rightly said, if you have proof of what you said, you would have produced them and thus will truely enlighten us to what you said.....</p>

              <p>Continue to evade by waiting for me and my brethens to prove it? Prove what? Until you have proven what you said, then there is really nothing for us to prove......there is no need to counter your baseless claims and lies.......is there?</p>
              <p>We just leave you as you are.....a complete liar fully exposed. Prove to me that you did not lie......by producing facts to back up your claims.....and once again, if you can't,
