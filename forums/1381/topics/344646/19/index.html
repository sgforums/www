              <p>hmm. ok, to put it simply, i find it hard to say "i can't provide you the answer", because i see it as losing the conversation. because every religious discussion or debate usually ends up with christians having to prove something.</p>
              <p>"if you say God exist, prove it.", "if you say that homosexuality is bad for the society, prove it", "if you say we're going to hell, prove it".</p>
              <p>the burden of proof usually falls on the chrsitian's shoulder, to say that he doesn't know the answer, or if he is unable to produce sufficient evidence, is as good as saying that the non believer is right, because of inductive reasoning.</p>
              <p> if i am looking for a fight, i don't have the burden to prove anything. i'll feel good just knowing that you can't give me an answer, and use that as an angle to prove my point.</p>
