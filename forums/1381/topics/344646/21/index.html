              <p>i can only speak for the latter.</p>
              <p>as for the costs. they probably only expect christians to attend (we don't mind), it looks like an event only christians would attend anyway.</p>
              <p>if the cost bothers you, maybe you can talk to a christian about it (since i think many were interested in sharing their faith with you), and work something out.</p>

              <p>oh, i have been here questioning, not their faith, but their lack of integrity when responding to certain issues....thats like since 2004</p>
              <p>its easier for them to blame u for playing around, insinuate that u are too unintelligent (compared to them) etc etc..than to say they dont have a clue or anything</p>
              <p>my personal belief as to why this forum fell apart that, is that not only there are non believers who genuinely played around, but that's almost insignificant compared to the constant squabbles among denominations here and the lack of integrity when responding to issues..</p>
              <p>believe me, i know hoards of forumers who are christians whom i often go outing with  and they think the people here are idiots</p>

              <p>First of all, let's examine your definition - a group of people with <strong>faith</strong>.... what is "faith" to you? Faith, at best, in an intangible thing. When Christians say that we have faith in God, we are challenged to prove the existence of God. When Christians say that we believe in the Bible, we are challenged to prove the validity of the Bible.</p>
              <p>So at the end of the day, if you say that we are a group of people of faith, and we say we believe in God and the Bible, are you going to ask us to prove it? If I cannot prove the existence of God and the validity of the Bible, are you going to call use delusional? or stupid? (mind you, that has been done before).</p>

              <p>I have always thought that a forum such as this is not the right platform for answers.</p>
              <p>1. Members are lay people, many of whom are no different from you. We have our personal understanding and comes in varying levels of spiritual maturity. Some are young and hot-blooded and others are old and jaded. But for some strange reason we are all gauged on the different yardstick from non-believers.... we are not suppose to retaliate when pushed.</p>
              <p>2. If you think the answers are the same, does it not also mean that the Christians you are asking are believing the same thing?</p>
              <p>Which is why, I'd previously said that you should go to a church to look for better Christian answers, but of course, you had chosen NOT TO.</p>

              <p>  Hello people.</p>
              <p>  I think this question really seeks each individual's experiences in life, and I ask forgiveness from members involved in this thread on my opinions before proceeding, so whatsoever that is spoken of in the aftermath of this apology is well taken care of.</p>
              <p> Our lives are bounded unto this earthly world where it seemed a place stranded between the illusionary of the duality of things; the first wonder and glimpse of a formidable creation set forth by the unknown, who, was shrouded behind the holy veil.</p>
              <p> The entirety of universe, a unification of all probabilities, a totality of all hierarchical forms of life and object, undoubtedly through aeon, did not less affirm us the presence of a creator; it reassured to us again and again via humanity in the expounding of complex technologies and mysteries of nature that there is an inevitable evidence of a divine being, an intervention of divinity that had touched the hearts of us subconsciously at a point in time of our lives. And such is the presence of divinity in all things that it seemed almost unfeasible in all ways to the relinquishing of it nor of contempting it, and that alone which arouses the spiritual sensitivity in humans stood eminently as the touch of the creator; one that its sanctity could not be forgotten.</p>
              <p>  Humanity was not superior because of the outspring of constant inventions and technological creations that would theorize the tough willpower of survival in history, nor of the capability in victory over nature; but truely, it is the beauty of virtues and morals bornt in blood of Humanity, and where in its heart lies a special capacity that is dedicated for the union with the divine being. And wherein the lives of all, there is a unity in the seeking of the purpose of Life; the divinity signal and the calling of the divine being, a true calling that has to be answered to even till time of death. It is definitely that through the testimonial of Humanity's existence, illustrates how the divine being surely favoured Humanity with the bestowing of richness in Grace unconditionally.</p>
              <p>  Science is on the rocky path to the unveiling of holy veil while Religion, a path of illumination, a journey through the holy veils to the divine being under the constant dedication of oneself to the divine calling and the selfless outpouring of Faith.</p>
              <p> In Deus nos fides.</p>
