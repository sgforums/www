              <p>I agree with you that folks like Benny Hinn are detrimental to the Christian faith and to society. But as pointed out by Smarty Boy, Christianity is not Benny Hinn and we should not use him as the benchmark or icon for the Christian faith.</p>
              <p>I would also like to point out that City Harvest is not the largest church in Singapore. Their overall membership of 25,000 (according to their website) is only about 15% - 25% of the number of Catholic Christians in Singapore.</p>

              <p>technically that's comparing apples to oranges....</p>
              <p>City Harvest is ONE PHYSICAL CHURCH..... The Catholic organisation is divided into many physical churches.... To put it into perspective, the Methodist church membership is larger than City Harvest, but we do not have ONE single church that is larger than them.</p>
              <p>If the issue is: the number of Catholics in Singapore vs the number of non-Catholic Christians then it is a better comparison.</p>

              <p>I don't think so. In defining a 'church', it makes more sense to look at <em>unity of leadership and beliefs</em> than mere physical locations.</p>
              <p>The Catholic Church 'operates' out of more than thirty locations (parishes) throughout Singapore but they all 'report' to Archbishop Nicholas Chia. And regardless of which parish you go to, the services and the doctrinal beliefs are the same. For all intents and purposes, they form <em>one Church</em>. This is different from non-Catholic churches where each has its own 'chief' pastor and each differing in its doctrinal beliefs, some more than others.</p>
              <p>As an analogy, if we want to compare the size of fast food companies in Singapore, say McDonalds vs Burger King, we would look at all Mac outlets as a single entity vs all BK outlets taken together. We don't compare just one Mac outlet vs one BK outlet. We also do not group BK, Carl's Junior, Long John's Silver and MosBurger together as one entity and compare it with McDonalds.</p>
              <p>As such, the comparison between City Harvest Church membership (from all its locations in Singapore) vs the number of Catholic Christians in Singapore (from all parishes in Singapore) is valid.</p>
              <p>Given the above, I may also not agree with your statement that "CHC is the largest independent church in Singapore"; it would depend on what we understand by 'independent church'. I would agree however to "CHC having the largest gathering of members in a single location for worship every Sunday on a regular basis." (assuming of course that this is true).</p>

              <p>"Mega churches" like CHC is claiming that they are so big because of God and how their pastors touched so many people.....that they are growing so rapidly etc... but in actual fact, there are so many churches that are much bigger than them.</p>

              <p>I have no idea what it means which is why I did not use the term in my alternate definition of CHC, and which is why I can't agree with your statement until you provide more clarity of what you mean or understand by that term.</p>
