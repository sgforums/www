              <p>Do you believe god as someone or something external of yourself? I believe that god is within us.</p>
              <p>Or rather, I would say that god is a descriptive term used as an example of goodness. Let me quote and example from another religion, one which is older than Christianity. There is a phrase said by Shakyamuni, the original buddha,</p>
              <p>"I am a man, just like you."</p>
              <p>This phrase was never really propagated in Buddhism or rather mahayana buddhism. It makes the buddha seems like a mundane person. The way Shakyamuni propagated buddism is through stories and examples of incidences that had happened in his own life. It is through this process that buddhism is slowly propagated throughout india and then to China. People of that era and time has very strong mythical roots in religion. After his death, his disciples found the need to supernaturalise his life so that the common people can easily accept his teachings. His most intelligent disciple Anan, was actually the one who documented his teachings after his death and not Shakyamuni himself. If you have had actually read up on his teachings previously, you would have noticed that his original teachings were very much just focus on one thing. How to be a true human being.</p>
              <p>History aside, my point is simple, the originators of each Religion has only one thought in mind most of the time. How to make allow each and every human being to be the greater self than they should be now. I have no doubt that their stories are truly inspirational, but aside from feeling touch, we should look into our won lives and see how we can be more like them. Or rather, like a God, literally.</p>

God is already there in the first place and he created those things that we are seeing now, currently.<br><br>We are now in this stage called post-modernism.

              <p>"I studied the history of the Bible. Eventually I acknowledged its messy history, contradictions, horrors and absurdities. It had no more evidence of being from God than any other holy book. Without blind belief in the Bible, there was no evidence for the supernatural claims of Christianity.  Furthermore, I realized that miraculous claims were always based on anecdote. There was never any evidence, only tall tales.</p>
              <p>Long ago, man, in his ignorance, created gods to make sense of the world. Then, when that failed, man created science. Science has been the most successful way of discovering truth ever invented. For example, we no longer have to pray for the sick or exorcise demons - we heal with medicine. Science has, in every way, proven far more effective than religion."</p>
              <p>----</p>
              <p>Of course GOD is exist..</p>
              <p>yes i do agree that the history may be might be a messy and not true since nobody can really proof it.. i also think that any religion cant really claims that they are the absolute. but just look at them as a a way to pray. we all believe that there is something/someone much greater than us who create us.no matter we want to call him God,or Allah or muhammad or whatever..(who can proof his name is what?the names are might be just given by humans )and religions are giving us options whether we want to praise him by singing, sitting position or bend on your knee, every friday(moslem) or every sunday etc etc.</p>
              <p>and science.. u think who creates you?creates your brain? creates the system in your body? who's the scientist who is so damn good that can creates the cells inside your body? creates system that giving you feelings and thoughts..and  who creates the world? the earth? particles?gasses? meteor?fire?who creates them? there shud b somebody who creates it on the first place!</p>
              <p>and miraculous things.. yes it does happen sometimes.even to me. and  he actually answer prayers too.</p>

              <p>hi ATR, wassup man.</p>
              <p>And may peace be upon everyone here and those reading as well.</p>
              <p>Got some weird guys here lah, just want to increase their post oni.. sigh.</p>
              <p>Ya lor, say i one of them lor...</p>
              <p>well anyw, so many talk so little answer for ATR, <br>his question: doubts/waste time/continue to believe or not.</p>
              <p>well, in my view, do what you feel and/or think. Just do it, then see how it goes.. no lost mah, i mean nothing to lose...</p>
              <p>Since you say that ur doubting God nowadays, i think that God havent show u signs, like miracle, I don't know abt you but alot of us experience miracles as in we will say "what the toot..., that has to be God's work" like things happen so perfectly. can't explain and that we believe that it must have been God. Faith also plays a part loh. But these miracles will strengthen one's faith.</p>
              <p>Ya, then you say u waste time praying, so u feel like u waste time praying, then don't pray, then see what feeling this will bring, if u feel guilty, then it means that u have more faith than you know, then pray a bit loh, just as long as u feel better. if you don't feel anything and your time is spent doing more productive things or suddenly u become richer then by all means stop praying.</p>
              <p>I feel God still haven't show u the light (wah so chim ah? (show you His signs yet) )so just chill, play your part in life by living care for the environment, don't pollute, make friends, be good, if u dun want to be religious at least be a good person thru characteristics. can? ok!</p>
              <p><a href="../../../users/246492">candiz</a>: he confused mah, anyway he can ask any question he like, thats what forums are for mah.. hmm.. i don't think your answer is wrong, its correct he needs to conc. on other more impt thing. but then it his freedom to voice something that he wants or need. for millions of ppl who think this guy need to conc. on more impt things will just exit this thread but thank you for replying and telling him. Appreciated.</p>
              <p>Peace Out!</p>
              <p>Take care ok</p>

              Don't think of God as a huge person with a beard, looking down from the sky, seeing everything.
              
              Look around you, everything that happens is God's will.
              
              That just means everything that happens, happens accordingly and perfectly and precisely correct. Whether we like it or not. Most of the things that happens are what we label as bad, because we do not like the results. But think, it happens accordingly. Even the things that we label as good.
              
              Lets say a killer litter, that falls off a high ledge. When that item goes off the ledge, it fall down, fly off, float off, according to its weight. Whether it hits the ground or lands on someone's head, again depends on the position of the two at that particular time. If both item and person are at the same place at the same time, a collision happens. When that happens again it depends on the item and the person, what the results will be. Everything will be precisely accordingly. Whether we like the results or not does not affect the precision of the results. Maybe someone is killed, severly injured, or just shocked, maybe the item just hit the ground without anyone knowing about it. There cannot be a wrong result. Like a pot falling on a person's head and that person turn into ice. This can never happen because that would be a wrong result. So everything happens accordingly, whether we like it or not. 
              
              Investigations into an accident always reveal why it happens, and when all the correct facts are collected, there are always no mystery.
              
              The next part to know about God is that we are told that God can do anything. This is not true. God cannot tell a lie. God also cannot cause a wrong result. But we want God to produce certain result thats we like.  Like, someone we love has cancer and is going to die. We pray to God to adjust the result to our liking. But no, things will happen accordingly correct. That person will die accordingly, or be cured accordingly. The latter usually happens by the actions of the doctor, by our actions, by determination of the patient.
              
              So if things are going to happen the way it happens anyway, what is the purpose of God? 
              
              Note that what happens to us, depends largely to our actions. Our actions produce results. But we want the good and likeable results all the time. That unreasonableness on our part, never mind, thats our perogative. So how do we take the correct actions that would produce the correct results? Correct results meaning being successful, having a pleasant life, wealth, health, strength, and all things good. The answer is simple, you think. You search for information, direction, clues, help, suggestions, from any source that is available to you, in order to do the correct actions for the correct result. And the simplest available source is to think of God. All of us has an inherent God within us. We can think, we know what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is bad. It is just a matter of strengthing the God within us,  or letting it wither. 
              
              So God is for guidance as how to act for a particular result, but then we need the wisdom to know that things don't always go the way we want it to go. There are too many influences that are outside our control, that affect our plans.
              
              Think of God, and you will know how to work, to live, to react, how to overcome troubles. The results will be precisely by how you act.

              <p>my goodness sake.. some of you all can really talk reasons illogically.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no god. It is that simple. I know that there are many people who believe in god. However, no matter how many people in the world believe in god, it would not make god existence become real.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>God existence is a human illusion. Apparently, as you can see from this post, many people are either believers or 'not interested in the answer' people. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Atheism is the correct idea. Its states that there is no god, which hits the truth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you do not believe in atheism, that means you have missed a truth in life. If you understand and conclude for yourself atheism is correct, then you have hit the truth, and that will bring you good things in life. Because truth is a virtue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who dun care about this question, its your own loss because ignorance is not an virtue and there are negative effect.</p>
