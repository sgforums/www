              <p>one reply . Yes, see all the wonderful things on earth, ask
              yourself one question, where it comes from, you will trace them in
              this route most probably</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Item on earth</li>
              <li>clay</li>

              <li>big bang</li>
              </ul>
              <p>or</p>
              <ul>
              <li>animal on earth</li>
              <li>mother</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You cannot trace any more from here, so who created them, such
              as mother and big bang, it is GOD.</p>
              <p>According to Gensis Chapter 1 verse 1-7, god created them.</p>
              <p>And please do not say is other gods on earth</p>
              <p>According to the bible and is quite true also in normal
              thinking</p>
              <p>Buddist gods have eyes but cannot talk, ears which cannot hear
              and this go on and on</p>
              <p>Islamic reglion is just a copy cat of christianity such as all
              the names in the bible had been changed to some muslim names only,
              the places between the bible and the quaram is similar, if not
              indentical, and is islam started frist or the belief of
              christianity, whcih is always exsistance, first.</p>
              <p>So, pals, let's us seriously think of whether god exsisted is a
              valid question, he created all of us, as well as this forum, the
              LCD/CRT screen that u are seeing this post.</p>
              <p>If you do not still belief, ask yourself another question, how
              does the big bang occur and how big is the universe, it is what
              cretainly scientist cannot answer them, but bible, words of god can
              answer them, sich as big bang is similar to Genises Chap 1 verse
              1-8 let there be light and so on explains big bang wisely, as well
              as how big is the universe, gods say that it was as big as the
              scope of him.</p>
              <p>And i know that many would be puzzling is god really exsisting
              and who created him.</p>
              <p>I had an explaination, god is not a person for us to gage, his
              wisdom is bigger than what all of us can put in, and he is the
              everlasting, we need to connect to him and gain enlightenment in
              how is really GOD through prayers and so on</p>
              <p>So, GOD is exsisting. PM me if you got any more doubts of his
              exsistance.</p>

              <p>If human had perfect knowledge we would understand all.</p>
              <p>And the concept of God and the whole universe of science will
              not contradict each other.</p>
              <p>Right now the level of our technology and science imo is still
              pretty primitive. The whole world propulsion is dependant way too
              much on the extract of dead animal which in all convenience is
              volative.Thank God for that.</p>
              <p>Yes man has gone to the moon but their spacecraft was and still
              is drawfed by the size of their fuel tank. That shows how efficient
              our state of propulsion really is.</p>
              <p>To make matters worse. Human technologies have been developed in
              pursue of either military purposes or financial gain i.e the desire
              to dominate with little consideration given to the care of the
              environment i.e nature. This has resulted in the massive
              environmental damages thoughout our planet and we seem to be
              heading for a new extinction.</p>
              <p>Someting important that many people seem to forget is that
              science never created anything. To be precise science is the art of
              manipulating the rule of the universe through obtained knowledge
              learned by the use of observation and research( which is
              experimenting and observation).</p>
              <p>Airplanes fly not because it can fly but because of the
              manipulation of air pressure by the unique shape of the wing.
              Airplane engine is just used to push the plane forward. So you can
              say the airplanes rather than flying actually sails in the air.
              LOL.</p>
              <p>It's the same with helicopter and all other stuffs that we
              created.</p>
              <p>To realize just how smart we are....the whole world of science
              is still baffled on how to fight HIV which is a virus that is the
              lowest level of life there is.</p>
              <p>We are still living in the dark age. Just because now we have
              candles widely available everywhere doesn't mean we can do without
              the sun.</p>
              <p>Wake up! We have progressed but no where close to understanding
              even a fraction of the whole knowledge there is.</p>
              <p>I'm just saying that there IS NO sufficient data, scientifically
              speaking, to conclude that there is no God.</p>
              <p>Have you ever seen a 50 foot shark? No?</p>
              <p>Just because you haven't seen one it doesn't mean it don't
              exist.</p>

              <p>Oh yea, fyi i am an atheist. What i wrote is purely based on
              perception and not bringing religion into play. God may not exist in my
              mind, but i can't say for others. Well can you define religion ? I am
              sure both of us can. Even though i ain't had one.</p>
              <p>What i
              believed religion is meant to be a communal faith, mentally and
              socially. True , if you're a Christian , naturally you would think God
              exists , even without scientific proof.</p>
              <p>I would proceed to having queries for you to answer.  Then how does <strong>Christianity </strong>came
              about ? I am also from a Catholic school from my sec sch days.
              Everyday, for some religious reason , they would make the students sing
              hymns in the name of the Lord. I used to ask my form teacher about it,
              "Does God Exist ?"  As she was a Catholic too , i expected her to say,"
              Yes , God exists." </p>
              <p>However, what reply i've gotten made me
              rather surprised. "Believe what you want to believe in.There is no
              right or wrong to think God exist and vice-versa." As i never had a
              religion , nor planning to adopt one , i am convinced from that day on.</p>
              <p>I make my stand clear. In regards to googoomuck's opinions , he
              said : "Surveys showed that 40% of scientists believe in God but among
              top scientists, the number who recognize the hand of God in the
              universe are remarkably high." isn't convincing enough to make other
              atheists to believe God does exist. Let me give an example.</p>
              <p>Where
              do we come from ? I used to hear people commenting on how God created
              the 1st man - Adam and 1st woman - Eve. Yet, it's been <span style="color: #888888;">scientifically proven </span>that
              our evolution is actually derived from Apes in fact. Oh ,
              you might argue that maybe scientists , under the faith of God ,
              managed to prove our evolution from <strong>nothingness </strong>due to God's help. Yet , why this author(i presume him as a christian) have quite a lot of theories which aren't really feasible ? That' my point of view.</p>
              <p>http://ldolphin.org/wmwilliams.html</p>
              <p>I bet you got your theories from here. Cause what you wrote resembles what has been stated in the website itself.</p>
