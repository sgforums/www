              <p>it depends what it means to be independent? own teachings which disagrees with basic biblical teachings? or is that church unaccountable to anyone else.</p>
              <p>if i understand, CHC broke off from the anglicans, NCC also. since both pastors used to be anglicans?</p>
              <p>so i guess i can consider them independant?</p>
              <p>the catholic church accounts to the pope, so within themselves, they're also independant.</p>

              <p>it depends what it means to be independent? own teachings which disagrees with basic biblical teachings? or is that church unaccountable to anyone else.</p>

              <p>so i guess i can consider them independant?</p>
              <p>the catholic church accounts to the pope, so within themselves, they're also independant.</p>

              <p>interesting.</p>
              <p>i think the key phrase is that the church has no denomination, and has forsaken the tradition of the following denomination. most churches of CHC nature, NCC etc, they consider themselves the charismatic movements. my first church, hope of god, is like that. when i asked what denomination we are under, my mentor told me that we do not have any, we just call ourselves charismatic.</p>
              <p>is it possible to call a church independant because there's not accountability to anyone beyond a highest point?</p>
              <p>that way, i think the catholic church can be considered as an independant body, since they can make their own rules and have their own authority to back those rules.</p>
              <p>CHC, NCC also can be considered la, if pastor kong makes up his own rules, and no one can really point out that he's wrong etc.</p>

              <p>A logical conclusion which I wholeheartedly agree with. Well done !</p>
              <p>I would also add that even if we take the narrower definition of an 'independent' church as a 'non-traditional' church or one that operates independently of the 'traditional' catholic, lutheran, anglican, methodist etc churches, I would still assert for the benefit of readers that:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">City Harvest may be the largest independent (ie: 'non-traditional') church in Singapore but its overall membership of 25,000 (according to their website) is still only about 15% - 25% of the number of Catholic Christians in Singapore.  <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">And I should also clarify that in all my posts about the Catholic Church, its dogma and doctrines etc, I <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">always</span></em> refer (as would most people) to the Church headed by the bishop of Rome (ie: the pope), the successor to St.Peter, unless otherwise stated. So when I say Catholic Church (unless otherwise stated), I do not refer to any church, group or society that has broken away from the pope, regardless of whether they call themselves 'Catholic'.</span> </span></p>
