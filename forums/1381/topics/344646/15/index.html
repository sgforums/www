              <p>hmmm.... on one hand the catholic church does not normally describe itself as being an independent church, yet it is independent from the Methodists, the Anglicans etc etc.... i wonder what is what now...??? and smarty boy is again very good at mimicry.</p>
              <p>well, again, it goes back to how you want to define things.... if you say that the 30+ Catholic parishes would make an "independent" church, so be it.... but that will go against any previous assumptions or any declarations by the Catholic parishes.... and, as I had said before, unless there is a documented record that the Catholic church is an independent church, i'd safely say that you guys are just trying to define things to make the issue convenient for your own argument.</p>
              <p>one point that I will agree with you is: CHC is NOT the face of Christianity in Singapore.... and neither are the catholics.</p>

              <p>My <em>only</em> purpose of describing the Catholic Church as 'independent' is to try to make a valid comparison between the sizes of the Catholic Church and City Harvest Church in Singapore. Since that is getting no where, let's get back to the earlier question at hand, which is whether City Harvest is the largest church (independent or otherwise) in Singapore. </p>
              <p>On the one hand, you have City Harvest spread over two locations, both teaching the same doctrine and ultimately reporting to one chief pastor. On the other hand, you have the Catholic Church spread over 30+ parishes in Singapore, all teaching the same doctrine and ultimately reporting to Archbishop Chia. Tell me what you think is the best way of comparing the sizes of both churches ?</p>
              <p>Take the larger City harvest location and compare it with the largest catholic parish ? Take both City Harvest locations and compare it with the largest catholic parish ? Take both City Harvest locations and compare it with all the catholic parishes ?  What is <em>your</em> preferred method of comparison and why do you think that is valid ?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Seems that within the Catholic churches, there are also denominations some of which may not even fall under the control or the goverment of the Church at Rome.</span></p>

              <p>Seems that the practices are not as common as previously thought...</p>
              <p>So, if such catholic churches are considered to be independent catholic churches, who are they independent of?</p>
              <p>And are those churches who fall under the jurisdiction of Rome also called independent churches?</p>

              <p>Any local church in any location that is not in communion with the bishop of Rome (ie: the pope), who has its own Code of Canon Law and 'theological stand', is not part of the Catholic Church, regardless of what they call themselves. They have broken away from the one universal Church to form their own group, no different from all the protestant churches who have broken away from the Catholic Church and from each other.</p>
              <p>Dogma and doctrine is universal in the Catholic Church, whether you are in Singapore, Rome or Timbuktu, although worship practices may differ depending on culture and tradition.</p>

              <p>What do you mean by deride since my england also not so powderful....care to explain?</p>
              <p>Hmm, you quote from anti-Catholics website so that you do not deride Catholics? You lying again or what?</p>
              <p>Maybe you quote from the website and use it to argue against Omnia? I am not sure.... but I did not even quote anything! Something wrong with you? So pathetic!!</p>
              <p>Actually, the declaration is not from me or Omnia but facts which I think you also know...</p>
              <p>If the church you mentioned is the same as our Catholic Church, then chc is the same as methodist church too....and we can say anything we want.</p>

              <p>people judge by the practices that they see is going on.</p>
              <p>you can say "no, this isn't what's going on.. actually, what we meant is.. " etc etc, but truthfully, it's all just hollow words. in the end, you act on what you believe. and what's what everyone sees. actions of the catholics or christians.</p>
              <p>that's where everyone will draw their conclusions.</p>

              <p>hmm, you quote an anti-Catholic link to show that the Catholic Church teaching is wrong....and that's not to deride Catholics doctrine? How oxymoronic! Maybe that's because you are pro-catholic......??</p>
              <p>Both chc and methodist started by ex-anglican what...so same lor...going by your logic mah.</p>
              <p>Just because they have the words "catholic" means they are the same as the Catholic Church? Just like website that have the word "catholic" in it means catholics websites to you even though they are completely anti-catholics? What's wrong with your brain?</p>
              <p>And you think just because you twisted something, we must ask the Pope "to condemn them, whatever," ?? Stop being arrogant with your high and migthy attidute lah... Who do you think you are?</p>
              <p>You can continue to choose to think this is the same Catholic Church - it's your choice but the fact will not change that it is not. You are just pathetic beyond descriptions.</p>
              <p>Who says that the Catholic Church is being magligned here? You think you have done a good job at that? Try harder.....</p>
              <p>You are the only one who is kpkb-ing here since you have been proven wrong with your apple and orange comparison thing.... moving further and further away from the thread.....so stop your kpkb-ing....</p>
