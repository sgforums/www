              <p>I guess God is personal. And I don't mean to brag because I have nothing to brag about. Those things I wrote are not causes to brag. Simply because I didn't do any of those. I just experienced them but I didn't do a thing. Not even a twitch nothing none.</p>
              <p>And the last thing I wanted to cause is to strike fear so whenever I literally felt another person heart or feeling I would 99% not say a word to let the other person knew that I knew.</p>
              <p>The other 1% was an exception though....I was half awake and I sort of slipped my tounge. It was more like a reflex...anyway that 1% needed some form of response though. I'm just glad that I did react to that one.</p>
              <p>But I remember one time that still kind of bothers me to this day. I was in a bad mood. And I felt angry. To cut the story short...I made this person to be disappointed and sad though he was innocent. I felt what he felt but because I was angry I blamed it on him(I know that was selfish of me shame on me). Later I regret this but never found this man again. I regret it because I knew how I made him to feel. If I hadn't felt what he felt I don't think I finally would have regretted acting the way I acted. It would have been easier had he gone angry towards me too instead of allowing me to cause him pain.</p>

              <p>You compared god to love. So god is an emotion caused by
              hormones, which are chemicals?</p>
              <p>There might be another plant that humans could live in, but just
              not in our solar system I guess.</p>
              <p>We get sufficient light and dark? If our sun was brighter or
              dimmer, we would have adapted and that would then be the
              'sufficient' amount of light.</p>
              <p>I am not really sure on how to explain why the planets do not
              crash into each other, but I know that they revolve around the sun
              because they are 'stuck'. As they are revolving, the centrifugal
              force prevents them from crashing into the sun and the
              gravitational force of the sun prevents the planets from going out
              of orbit.<img style="vertical-align: bottom;" src="http://cectic.com/comics/069.png" alt="" width="700" height="300"></p>

              <p>i think herzog_zwei’s theory that “If both Kepler and Newton are alive today, they would have renounce Christianity as incomparable with science.” sounds more likely to happen.</p>
              <p>These two are clever people. When clever people study current scientific findings which disprove of god, they would understand it.</p>

              I am less concerned with buddhists and hindus, as they can reside peacefully among us. What they believe in, is of no importance to me, as long as we get along well. They do not or should i say, almost never impose their beliefs on others in an annoying manner.

                      <p>oh please, i just googled "nobel prize winners who believe in god".</p>
                      
                      <p>the first name amongst those winners was albert einstein =,=  Well, he may believe in a god, but he certainly is against the god which goes by the name of Yahweh or Allah.</p>
              
              <p>Jean-Jacques Rousseau, founder of modern deism was listed as well? wow, i wonder what that list is trying to do huh, misguide more people into religion i say. Someone born protestant, converted to Catholicism in his teens, but eventually turned deist.. why's he listed!!?</p>
                      
                      <p>I have no problems with people who believe in god/gods which go with science, side by side, trying to answer what science cannot, and most probably never will be able to.</p>
                  
                  <p>furthermore, those scientists may be nobel winners. but so what? does that make them more knowledgeable about whether a god exists or not?</p>
                  
                  <p>eg: a person devotes his life to chemistry, makes astonishing discoveries about new elements or creates some wonderful synthetic material. This will guarantee him a nobel prize.</p> 
                  
                  <p>BUT lets say he's a theistic satanist. A theistic satanist believes satan as the true creator of man, advocates indulgence instead of abstinence, etc etc. Yet none of these beliefs and morals will ever contradict with his chemistry knowledge.</p>
                  
                  <p>Studying evolution, natural selection and the universe's origin is the way to go if one wants to defraud the bible or koran.</p>
