              <p>So, finally, you admitted that you have no proof to back up your
                      claims that God is unreal or does not exist.</p>
              <p>And yes, you are lacking sense from the outset and your
                      illogical conclusion that  "lack of proof" means that God does
                      not exist simply cannot stand. I thought you rely on scientific
                      facts and evidences to make conclusion....why exception when it
                      comes to God?</p>
              <p>From all the rubbish that you posted, it simply means that you
                      are completely clueless about God and thus, it is not a fair
                      statment from you that God is unreal or does not exist. You have no
                      proof to back up your claims.</p>
              <p>Since you already admitted that you have no proof to back up
                      anything you said, then it is confirmed that they are baseless
                      claims and lies.....</p>

              <p>Why would I refer to science journal to prove God existance?
              Surely only an idiot would want to do that..... I already answered
              that and it obviously did not get into your thick sulk. And which
              science journal that you read have proven that God does not exist?
              And how about those TV shows you watch?</p>
              <p>Before your blur the issue, you came here to said God is unreal,
              does not exist, Bible is out-dated etc without a single proof....
              and I have been trying to understand why you said so by asking for
              proof to back up what you said ......and finally <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>you admitted that you have
              nothing to prove or back up what you said </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>So it is
              already proven that <span style="color: #ff0000;">you have NO
              CASE</span> and that you are just making baseless claims and
              telling lies....... What more is there for me to prove that you are
              wrong?</strong></span> What onus? If there is any need, the onus is
              on you to prove what you said.</p>
              <p>With your lack of logic and narrow mindset, I would not be
              suprised that you want to continue to make baseless claims and
              telling lies even when you have been exposed.</p>
              <p>Try to give a more convincing post to show your case and back up
              your claims with facts and proofs. Otherwise, you are just evading
              and trying to wriggle out of the fact that you made baseless claims
              and lied.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the genesis of religions, how it came about</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Gripped by fear men go to sacred mountains, sacred groves, sacred trees and shrines.  Primitive man found himself in a dangerous and hostile world, the fear of wild animals, of not being able to find enough food, of injury or disease, and of natural phenomena like thunder, lightning and volcanoes was constantly with him. Finding no security, he created the idea of gods in order to give him comfort in good times, courage in times of danger and consolation when things went wrong. To this day, you will notice that people become more religious at times of crises, you will hear them say that the belief in a god or gods gives them the strength they need to deal with life. You will hear them explain that they believe in a particular god because they prayed in time of need and their prayer was answered.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000066;">QUESTION: But if there are no gods how did the universe get here?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #990000;">ANSWER:</span> All religions have myths and stories which attempt to answer this question. In ancient times, when man simply did not know, such myths were adequate, but in the 20th century, in the age of physics, astronomy and geology, such myths have been superseded by scientific fact. Science has explained the origin of the universe without recourse to the god-idea.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000066;">QUESTION: But so many people believe in some form of god, it must be true.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #cc0000;">ANSWER:</span> Not so. There was a time when everyone believed that the world was flat, but they were all wrong. The number of people who believe in an idea is no measure of the truth or falsehood of that idea. The only way we can tell whether an idea is true or not is by looking at the facts and examining the evidence.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the genesis of

              <p> </p>
              <p>Gripped by fear men go to sacred mountains, sacred groves,
              sacred trees and shrines.  Primitive man found himself in a
              dangerous and hostile world, the fear of wild animals, of not being
              able to find enough food, of injury or disease, and of natural
              phenomena like thunder, lightning and volcanoes was constantly with
              him. Finding no security, he created the idea of gods in order to
              give him comfort in good times, courage in times of danger and
              consolation when things went wrong. To this day, you will notice
              that people become more religious at times of crises, you will hear
              them say that the belief in a god or gods gives them the strength
