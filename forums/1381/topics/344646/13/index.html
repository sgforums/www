              <p>CHC can claim whatever it wants. Since you appear to endorse their claim about being the largest independent church in Singapore (by repeating the statement in your post), why don't you tell us what 'independent church' means ?</p>
              <p>I have no idea what it means which is why I did not use the term in my alternate definition of CHC, and which is why I can't agree with your statement until you provide more clarity of what you mean or understand by that term.</p>

              <p>independent church - non-denomination church, or a church that does not affiliate itself with other established denomination..... good enough for you? I am sure you could have found that out if you had wanted to.</p>

              <p>Someone might <em>hate</em> the PAP party but still <em>agree or endorse</em> the notion that it is the largest political party in Singapore.

              <p>In discussing the size of churches in Singapore, you had suggested, "<em>would it offend you (or Omnia) if the claim is: CHC is the largest independent church in Singapore?</em>".</p>

              <p>In actual fact, when I quote from the methodist website, I actually endorsed what they said (I am not sure about others but I do).......i.e not doing good works is to deny Christ and one who deny Christ cannot claim to have faith in Him (seems some methodist agreed too) and thus cannot claimed to be saved - simple logic.</p>

              <p>It all hinges on what we think the world "independent" mean. I am sure we are all entitled to our personal definition. If such definitions are different then there is no way to come to a conclusion as to whether the statement that CHC is the largest independent church in Singapore is true or not.</p>
              <p>If your definition is that the Catholic church is also an INDEPENDENT church then it's up to you, I have no issue with that claim, we can all make any claims we want. However, there had never been any claims by the Catholic church as being an INDEPENDENT church, unless you are able to substantiate your claim by providing a statement for the Catholic church as being so. It remains your personal claim that the Catholic church is "independent".</p>
              <p>Perhaps if you talk to your church fathers and see if they see the Catholic church as being a "Independent" church and share with us as to what they say.</p>

              <p>If I said that Herzog said that he does not believe in the existence of God....</p>
              <p>Does it mean that I endorse or agree that there is no existence of God, or</p>
              <p>Does it mean that I claim that Herzog made a remark....</p>
              <p>By saying that Herzog made a remark about the existence of God, does that automatically state that I agree with his statement or endorse what he said????</p>
              <p>Personally, I don't really care if CHC is the largest independent church or not, neither do i care if the Methodist congregation is larger than them or not, nor the combined Catholic church is larger than them or not....</p>
              <p>The statements made were merely to point out the actual wording of CHC's claim, which is, they say they are the largest independent church in Singapore and NOT the largest church in Singapore.</p>
              <p><em>Catholic church being "independent"?</em></p>
              <p>It all hinges on what we think the world "independent" mean. I am sure we are all entitled to our personal definition. If such definitions are different then there is no way to come to a conclusion as to whether the statement that CHC is the largest independent church in Singapore is true or not.</p>
              <p>If your definition is that the Catholic church is also an INDEPENDENT church then it's up to you, I have no issue with that claim, we can all make any claims we want. However, there had never been any claims by the Catholic church as being an INDEPENDENT church, unless you are able to substantiate your claim by providing a statement for the Catholic church as being so. It remains your personal claim that the Catholic church is "independent".</p>
              <p>Perhaps if you talk to your church fathers and see if they see the Catholic church as being a "Independent" church and share with us as to what they say.</p>

              <p>You are right. The Catholic Church does not normally describe itself as being an 'independent' church.</p>
              <p>However, since we are trying to ascertain whether City Harvest is really the <em>largest independent church</em> in Singapore, we should try to understand what City Harvest means by 'independent' and apply it to other churches to make a valid comparison.</p>
              <p>And going by what you have explained so far, it would be valid to say that all 30+ Catholic parishes in Singapore would make up an 'independent' church; which would mean that City Harvest would neither be the largest church nor largest independent church in Singapore. And more importantly, going back to the original point raised, City Harvest should therefore not be seen to be the face of Christianity in Singapore.</p>
