              <p>Can you prove merlion does not exit. It is so basic in logic
              that it is impossible to prove non-existence. The burden of proof
              is with the party which claims it existence. It is actually very
              simple - just produce it it it is actually there.</p>
              <p>Jews occupy the Palestine happens on after the WWII.</p>
              <p>You said 'As long as the promise to the Jews is kept, that's the
              reason to believe that the promise to Christians will also be
              honoured'</p>
              <p>This is certainly a very 'modern' justification for believing in
              Christianity. Pardon me if you don't mind. If that is really the
              way to justify Christianity, how did Christians prior to WWII be
              sured that the promise of eternal life will be ultimately honoured
              then?&lt;.p&gt;</p>

              <p>I am not sure anybody cares to renounce Christianity becuase it
              is a no issue. Just quit going to church to listen to fairy tales
              will do.</p>
              <p>But I know at least of one who actively campaign against
              Christianity. He is Steven Weinberg who shared the prize in physics

              believe)</p>
              <p>In one of his public speeches he was quoted saying</p>
              <p>With or without it(religion), you'd have good people doing good
              things and evil people doing bad things, but for good people to do
              bad things, it takes religion.</p>

              <p>I'm sure this Weinberg knows that a simple loaf of bread has a maker. It's call a baker. To deny that the first human being, which is much more complex than bread, has no maker is beyond any man who has the ability to think.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">"In his 1997 essay, “Before the Big
              Bang,” Weinberg
              describes a meeting he and other physicists had with Al Gore, in which
              the
              scientists tried to sell the Vice President on the value of funding the
              Super
              Collider.<span>  </span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Just as Gore left the meeting,
              he turned back in the room to ask if the scientists “could tell him
              what
              happened before the Big Bang.”<span>  </span>They had
              no satisfactory answer.</strong></span><span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong> </strong></span> </span>(Al Gore,
              incidentally,
              is not the first politician to take an interest in scientific questions
              about
              origins.<span>  </span>The defense in the Scopes case
              introduced a letter written by President Woodrow Wilson to one of its
              scientific experts, W. C. Curtis.<span>  </span>In his
              letter to Curtis, Wilson<span> wrote, "</span>It
              surprises me that at this late date such questions should be raised. Of
              course, like every other man of intelligence and
              education, I do
              believe in organic evolution.")"</span></p>
              <p>He didn't know what happened before the big bang.</p>
              <p>I'm glad that Weinberg is also known to support Israel. He knows where his ancestors came from.</p>

              <p>Your theory may be wrong too. Nothing can be absolute in

              <p>First a correction.  I have not said "My Theory".  I do not have any theory to my credit!!</p>
              <p>Nobody, no scientist, will claim that science is inmutable. Scientific enquiry is an incremental process, with new theory building and improving on the existing ones and so on. But science will never know that what they have got is the ultimate theory of the physical world because of the limitations of our technology in making perfectly precise measurements.  Still science has come a long way since the day of Gelileo, and it can only gett more and more precise in its description of the physical world.</p>

              <p>Did some "digging" in the past into this often quoted Galileo stuff.....and my uderstanding is that "his ideas were not
                  entirely correct. Galileo believed that the sun was not just the
                  fixed center of the solar system but the fixed center of the universe.
                  We now know that the sun is not the center of the universe and that it
                  <em>does</em> move—it simply orbits the center of the galaxy rather than
                  the earth.</p>
              <p>As more recent science has shown, both Galileo
                  and his opponents were partly right and partly wrong. Galileo was
                  right in asserting the mobility of the earth and wrong in asserting the
                  immobility of the sun. His opponents were right in asserting the mobility
                  of the sun and wrong in asserting the immobility of the earth."</p>
              <p>I am quoting from a source from a Catholic website and thus it will provide the other side of the coin....and those interested can check it out at : <a href="http://www.catholic.com/library/Galileo_Controversy.asp">http://www.catholic.com/library/Galileo_Controversy.asp</a></p>
              <p>This is not to start another war on who's right or wrong.....just the other side of the story and you make your own judgement.</p>

              <p>As at today, science cannot give an explanation as to who and how the universe is created. And until a concerete conclusion by science is found, it remains a mystery to scientisits.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, the Bible had given an account of the creation and Christians choose to accept this. Non-Christians do not. But that really is a personal choice isn't it? Non-believers are asking for proof that the account is true and yet they have no proof to proved that it is untrue.</p>
              <p>Let's says Christians accept that it is "untrue" and that what the Bible said is "falsehood"...then should they turn to believed in science that has yet to provide any answer? And what if nothing is found or discovered within our lifetime?</p>
              <p>And what benefits is there to disbelieve the Bible then?</p>
              <p>IMO, the Bible is about teaching people to love one another and lead a life of love, compassion and charity.</p>
              <p>Even if everything in the Bible is "untrue" and yet lead people to lead a life of love, compassion and charity, what's the harm?</p>
              <p>I know many others have read the same Bible but come to a different conclusion...... and these are the people who "put and forced words down the throat of the Bible".</p>
              <p>Please do not start quoting me bible verses and asking for explanations....it's pointless as Christians explanations will not be accepted....and unless non-believers have the same open mindedness (that they are asking from Christains) and learn it from a reliable source in detail...there is no point saying that Bible is not real....</p>

              If you're convinced you're not going to hell then I'm happy for you. Most of the time I doubt my own salvation because I'm not worthy. I had my moments of assurances but life is fluid and dynamic so I can never be really sure until the day I leave this earth. Whether I descend to the world of the dead or raised from the beginning is all at the mercy of God that I tried to follow and respect.

              about fish fossils? That's because early fish thought to be extinct

              <p>What about carbon dating? Is it accurate? I don't know. No one is able to verify something that's assumed to be 50,000 years old. I trust the BC/AD dating system, which was based on the birth of Jesus.</p>
              <p>Why is the fish living fossil unconvincing? It proves that evolution of that fish did not occur. Evolutionists are very afraid of living fossils.</p>
              <p>Another evolution theory that the evolutionists themselves debunked  is the use of vestigiality organs. Go do your research, OK?</p>
              <p>Why pull in religion? Do you believe in creationism or evolution? You tell me.</p>
              <p>I've said before. Research by creationist scientists are not confined to creationism only. They are also biologists, chemists or physicists. They become more convinced of the existence of an intelligent designer with each new discovery .</p>
