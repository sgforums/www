But then the issue is this: by whose standards?  In the Catholic world, there exists an objective standard.  We call it the Magisterium of the Church.  Dissenters can continue in their misguided beliefs.  The rest of us who struggle honestly through our human imperfections to follow the commands of Christ (rather than rationalising them away as non-essentials) will continue to pray for them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>regards,<br>obiterdicta</div>
