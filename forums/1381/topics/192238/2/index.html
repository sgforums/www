And there was found no place for them.<br><br>12 And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books.<br><br>13 The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works.<br><br>15 And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire.<br><br>2) An unbeliever is someone who does not trust in Christ alone for salvation.<br><br>You could 'pray' to Him, read about Him, go to one of the Christian churches every sunday, you could pray a thousand sinner's prayer but as long as you have not trusted in Christ alone for salvation you are an unbeliever.<br><br></div></blockquote>This judgment takes place at  the  close of the Mellinial reign of  Christ.<br><br>the judgment of the nations in Matthew 25 does not refer here. There the judgment in Matthew 25 takes place after the Tribulation period. It is a judgment of the living.<br><br>Here the judgment is the judgment of those who have died unsaved.  a 1000 year period is in between the Matthew 25 and Rev. 20<br><br>2Ti 4:1  I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom:<br><br>He will judge the Living Gentiles at His appearing [refering to the Second Coming. Matthew 25] He will judge the dead at the close of His 1000 year Kingdom.<br><br>The word "at" their literally means 'according to'. So we can translate it as:<br><br>who will judge the living and the dead <strong>according to</strong> His appearing and His kingdom.<br><br>According to His appearing and accoring to His Kingdom.<br><br></div>

If that was so, it would not self-contradict at all. The self-contradiction only arrives if one assumes the dogma was dead text, but if it was dead it would not save and there was nothing to consider in the beginning.<br><br>So one has to start with the notion that the dogma is real in the sense of the creed for the sake of the argument. So then, if the Christian dogmas indeed were alive how would it work with a 2 year old?<br><br>I for one, dissent from the opinion that a 2-year old goes to hell in death. If anything it has been humanity that has been showing callous disregard for children, not God. For our rights of the older too many have been killed, when the older should have been protecting these children. It seems to me this creed in part cannot just come from my sheer instinct (or I could just choose to ignore it when it suits me), but from some higher source of direction beyond me.<br><br>When I consider that possibility, the dogma is hardly dogma. It's that way because the reality of stuff is indeed that... it's is so strange. Strange but not self-contradictory... it is us it seems that are the self-contradictory ones.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ito_^:</div><div class="quote_body">what about the people who believe and/or accept the teaching of other religions?</div></blockquote>If there was an ultimate truth then one might have to accept there was a way of dealing with it. It seems to me that all religions are the result of this fact, even Christianity. It also seems to me from first principles that not all religions are equal in appealing to this ultimate truth. In short, one may say that all roads may <span style="font-style: italic;">lead</span> to Rome, but not all <span style="font-style: italic;">actually</span> reach there. This is the problem with absolutes but we can't abandon them without abandoning much rational thought... in which case there would be no need to ask any question at all for all questions and answers are equally worthless.<br><br>Of course the claim from it's proponents is that Christianity is the <span style="font-style: italic;">best</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> method of appealing to this ultimate truth. This may seem arrogrant but it only takes a moment's thought to see the rationale behind this. This is but another absolute truth claim, and the real issue is to see this absolute truth claim is <span style="font-style: italic;">true</span>, and if it is, why so.<br><br>It also begs the question that if this is true, then it would not be arrogrant at all to say that it is the only way as to hold back and not do so for the sake of P.C.-ness would be a very great evil. You are in your own beliefs, knowingly tossing many people to their doom for the sake of not offending them or appearing arrogrant.<br><br>I will grant that the danger of believing that you are the only way is that some might become arrogrant, but that is the very nature of the knowledge of the truth (unlawfully used it tends to puff the ego), and I believe is utterly against the very spirit of Christianity itself.<br><br>But if I was drowining I might want to find something that works, not everything that might not find me rescue for the sake of not being arrogrant or to be fair to the rest. High stakes there are here, and who is to blame for pushing the issue so starkly? It would be an evil not to do so. If there was a bomb to explode I might think less of startling and distrupting people's lives in the area and more of getting them out.<br><br>The argument on the arrogrance of Christianity cannot be valid unless it's very creeds state that it should not be the only way... but it says the very exact opposite thing. So we are quite helpless.</div>
