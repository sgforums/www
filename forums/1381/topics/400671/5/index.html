              <div class="quote_body" style="display: none;">
              <p>I also break precepts sometimes.</p>
              <p>The point about Buddhism is not to be a 
                              perfect human. Nobody is
                                                      that perfect, unless you're Buddha.</p>
              <p>It is just being good enough (so that you 
                              arent living in guilt
                                                      and the consequence of your bad karma that 
                              obscures your practice
                                                      to attain enlightenment) so that you can 
                              practice and attain
                                                      enlightenment. The goal is to attain 
                              enlightenment. The goal is
                                                      liberation from suffering, not perfect morality.</p>
              <p>And the thing is - it works, many people did 
                              attain
                                                      enlightenment even today.</p>
              <p>Anyway meditation is really not that hard - 
                              it is actually very
                                                      enjoyable, if you practice after some time 
                              you'll find it so.</p>

                                                      achievement and I will keep on thinking abt the

                                                      have done.</p>
              <p>Therefore I am not interested in buddhism 
                              anymore.</p>

              <p>Because if you are at primary school level, then you look at University textbook, of course it is hard.</p>
              <p>If you slowly practice from primary school level, then gradually sec sch, jc/poly, then uni, then things becomes much easier.</p>
              <p>Nobody in Buddhism should expect you to become non attached immediately. If you can be completely not attached, you are already near Buddha.</p>

              <p>Oh yes, I am aware that the bible also said that God is
              '<span style="font-family: Tahoma;">loving, righteous and just'.
              However it does not contradict that God is also angry, jealous,
              takes vengeance (for the purpose of seeking justice or whatever
              reasons), etc.<br></span></p>
              <p>It just means that God as depicted in OT is a personal God that
              has the full range (or much) of emotions that we do. We love
              others, but we sometimes also feel angry about others (for whatever
              reasons, maybe someone was really evil, etc), we also feel jealous
              sometimes, etc. Nobody including God (as depicted in OT) is angry
              or jealous all the time, those emotions arise out of a certain
              context.</p>
              <p>I see, in that case I agree.</p>
              <p>You see, if someone is already open to an alternative then he
              would be actively searching for the answers himself. It does not
              need someone to come to a forum to criticize their own faith. He
              will want to find out the truth of the matter regardless of whether
              anyone is criticizing him.</p>
              <p>For example I mentioned about my Buddhist master turning into
              Christian based on his reading up of Buddhism. He used to criticize
              Buddhism a lot due to his utter lack of understanding of what
              Buddhism is about (he used to think of Buddhism as simply
              superstitions and a demonic religion). However he was informed that
              his approach is of little use and has in fact 'pissed off' people
              more than they actually change people or convert people. He was
              also challenged by his Uni professor to start writing a critique on
              Buddhism through his own studies and the professor will give him
              full support to do so, as that will be a more approachable way than
              insulting and denigrating the other religion without
              understanding.</p>
              <p>But after finding out what Buddhism is about, he converted, but
              he did not do so because Buddhists are criticizing his Christian
              faith. He did so because he was open, he was willing to find out
              what the others are teaching, he was willing to question and
              examine.</p>
              <p>If someone is already stuck to his own belief and unwilling to
              find out about other religion, then no amount of criticism will
              actually move a person.</p>
              <p>That is why I say, helping 'potential people' is better than
              criticizing people who have already chosen their paths.</p>
              <p>As I said, I am not saying that Christians are illogical or shun
              the use of logic.</p>
              <p>I am saying that logic cannot possibly explain the entire
              workings of God, just like logic cannot explain the entire workings
              of the universe (what we understand is like only an infinitesimal
              speck of the vastness of the universe).</p>
              <p>You haven't answer me, can you perfectly logically understand
              how God works? Yet you do have faith in Him right?</p>
              <p>Let me quote something from my other moderator Thusness from a
              few years ago:</p>
              <p><em>Faith is necessary because there is no certainty in
              knowledge. Even in exact science, no certainty is to be found. Of
              course certainty versus probable knowledge is a topic relating to
              Epistemology (the theory on Knowledge) but still, it is pivotal
              towards understanding why the need for faith at all. How science
              has led to the common misunderstanding that faith is not necessary
              is amazing but it is mostly due to the predictive nature of these
              scientific theories derived from thorough experimentation. This is,
              however, mainly due to the fact that the pool of data made
              available for the derivation of these theories does not go beyond
              our man-size world. As we know, Newtonian physics or classical
              science works well for a man-size world but not quite well in the
              macro and micro universe. Our ordinary experiences do not permit us
              to experience something having the mass of a star or traveling at
              half-speed of light, we presume that the entire universe must obey
              the laws of the man-size world. But when we are exposed to things
              not so ordinary, like traveling at a speed much faster then our
              ordinary experience of Â‘speedÂ’, we are lost because phenomena just
              donÂ’t behave the way we expected it to be. The idea that time
              travel slower when they are approaching the speed of light and halt
              at speed of light is mind boggling. Similarly when scientists begin
              to deal with the universe of the outer space Â– the macro universe,
              they are dealing with much more massive objects than the man-size
              world, a billion times more. The idea that space curves and time
              halt at the speed of light came as a shocked to the classical
              scientists. This applies true when we deal with the micro universe
              of the quantum world. The world of the electrons does not comply
              with Newtonian nor Einstein theory. This includes the spooky
              non-local behavior of particles that AEN brought up in another
              thread. <strong>When Heisenberg introduced the Â‘uncertaintyÂ’
              principle, it is so weird that even Einstein rejected it and thus,
              Einstein famous remark -- Â“God does not play diceÂ”. But Â“God does
              not play diceÂ” is a belief system!</strong> I canÂ’t remember where
              I read it but I could clearly recalled that even Stephen Hawking
              used phrases like Â“official dogmaÂ”, Â“deep emotional attachment to
              determinismÂ” to describe scientists like Einstein. Stephen Hawking
              even went further to say that Einstein was doubly wrong when he
              said Â“God does not play diceÂ”.<br> <br> I will not dwell too deeply into it but the purpose is simply to
              illustrate that our knowledge is nothing certain nor absolute.
              Science is itself a belief system for us to better understand the
              phenomenon existence. It is its certainty in predictability within
              a prescribed environment that convinces us that faith is not
              necessary. It creates the impression of certainty and made a
              probable knowledge appears absolute but in actual case, science
              itself is a belief system and a great deal of faith (maybe good and
              rational faith in this case) is vested in science
              unknowingly.</em></p>
              <p>...........</p>
              <p><em>...faith plays a vital role in our life and we are always
              investing faith in people, theories, concepts and belief systems
              unknowingly. Human is not just a rational being; to understand
              ourselves, we must also examine our emotional, mythical and
              psychological makeup.<br> <br> To touch on what is Â‘trueÂ’ and Â‘rightÂ’ free of our belief systems
              is a philosophical question that I do not wish to get into. Coming
              into contact with Buddhism is more of coincidental. My deepening of
              faith in BuddhaÂ’s words came only as a result of practice. It is
              experiential and subjective. It is sort of Â‘I know because I
              experience it.Â’</em> <em><img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></em></p>
              <p>..............</p>
              <p><em>'Right' implies complying with a pre-determined set of
              criteria. I think we must be aware of the distinction between
              "right faith" and "right attitude towards faith". If a certain
              belief system has a criterion "that one should have full trust in
              God", then 'testing God' is not 'right faith'. A half-hearted
              devotion will deny the relationship as well as the experience with
              God. To a rationalist this approach may not be appealing, but to
              some sages, their wisdom have penetrated deep enough to understand
              the entirety of our psychological and spiritual makeup. I do not
              see it as wrong. It is a practice that will similarly yield
              religious experiences. One should not be afraid to be blind in
              total devotion. Nevertheless if such practices are understood
              wrongly or fall under the hands of unscrupulous religious leaders,
              it can be devastating.<br> <br> On the other hand, I think "right attitude towards faith" do
              require us to question and check the basis of our belief systems.
              For the latter, it is the process of authentication that deepens
              the faith; however this can be quite challenging psychologically
              and dangerous too. It can lead one to a state of total
              confusion.</em> <em><br> <br> Both approaches are different in nature. In Buddhism there are
              different paths to suit different people, it is not a one and for
              all cases. It Â‘stagedÂ’ one according to their suitability and
              developed the necessary conditions for us to progress further.
              Spirituality is not an easy journey, we will learn along the
              road.</em> <em><img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></em></p>
              <p>Hmm... don't think you get what I mean yet. What I am talking is
              the Truth that precedes belief system, and the Faith the precedes
              separate belief systems. Belief systems are many and they all
              contradict each other, even within a single religion the different
              denominations contradict each other as well. But what I am talking
              about goes deeper than that.</p>
              <p>I think this video is good and explains what I mean especially
              the first 7:37 minutes: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04gdsFt_zDY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04gdsFt_zDY</a></p>
              <p>When you said that Christ is the only way to God, I will not
              refute that, but then the question is what exactly is the nature
              and substance of Christ. Most people are believing in their own
              image of what Christ is without any further experiential
              understanding. When you use your own conceptual understanding of
              what you perceive Christ to be to attempt to comprehend what Christ
              is, it will fail. No conceptual thought can capture Christ
              absolutely, it is only a limited pointer to the thing-in-itself. To
              know Christ, the egoic mind or the separate-self sense has to
              dissolve, and surrender to the direct experience of the Higher
              Power which you call Christ. It is not using thought to understand
              him, as my friend Thusness have said many years ago,</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>This reminds me of a medieval Christian book 'The Cloud of
              Unknowing',</p>
              <p><em>The book counsels a young student not to seek <a title="God" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God">God</a> through knowledge but through what the author
              speaks of as a "naked intent" and a "blind <a title="Love" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love">love</a>." This is brought about by putting all thoughts
              except the love of <a title="God" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God">God</a>, under a "cloud of forgetting"
              and thereby piercing <a title="God" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God">God</a>'s cloud of unknowing, with a
              "dart of longing love" from the heart.</em></p>
              <p>Furthermore it is said in the bible:</p>
              <p><em><sup>20</sup>I have been crucified with Christ and
              I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the
              body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave
              himself for me. (Galatians 2:20)</em></p>
              <p>Anyway I understand that no amount of talking about this will
              convince you since you are deeply rooted into the belief system.
              But if you do have such a mystical experience or union, your
              perspective will change, as you begin to see that this truth and
              experiential insight is universal, since it is prior to all belief
              systems, all concepts, can be touched only directly through a
              direct means such as total submission to a higher power and
              dissolving the false ego or the separate self sense.. it is the
              direct experience of that One God (THAT from which everyone and
              everything arise and subsides from), not divided by our
              conceptual/egoic mind into 'my God' vs 'your God'.</p>
              <p>As Father Thomas Keating said, <strong>Faith precedes belief
              systems, which means that Faith means the consent or surrender to
              the divine reality or to the Ultimate Reality or whatever name is
              in the different religion, before it is broken down into different
              belief systems which are bound to be influenced by the cultural
              conditioning of the person or the reformers who worked on that
              religion. So when Faith becomes contemplative, it begins to precede
              the Oneness behind all religions, before the experience of God is
              broken down into various belief sytems. You have to have some
              belief systems because we are human, as a starting point as I was
              trying to say, the faculties have to be organized around the faith,
              (inaudible), as a stepping stone or a conveyer belt to take us to a
              further level of relating to this mystery which is more direct,
              which doesn't reject our former religious practices, but has a
              certain freedom towards them so that they are not abolutized, so
              the only Absolute becomes The Absolute.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>And on the other end of the spectrum which is an equally
              important is the separate sense, which is the 'I am' which Ken
              Wilber was speaking about, which begins to emerge in very early
              childhood, then becomes fully reflective and self-conscious in
              adolescence and so on. And this is the basic source of every human
              problem. It is the source of certainly every sin in the sense of
              'missing the mark', because it is the separate self sense that
              opposes reality, and the Truth, and which creates our own 'self'
              and ultimately our own 'hell', if the 'self' we are developing goes
              to the extremes of selfishness as our experience and those of many
              others realize it's quite possible. So on one hand you have the
              basic oneness of everything that is in its Source, and the basic
              issue of separating ourselves from that Oneness which then means
              that we're separating ourselves from our True Self and everybody
              else and from the cosmos in varying degrees in which we sin,
              meaning to miss the mark, which is to fail to recognize the truth
              of the situation. So the separate self-sense is what all the
              religions is trying to cure as far as I can see, and all the
              consequences of that development which psychologically speaking
              have been researched in our times, and such things as the private
              or psychological unconscious, the personal unconscious, the
              collective unconscious... this whole world of motivation that we're
              not aware of is the fruit of the development of the separate self
              sense into energiy centers like the first three chakras of the
              Hindu scheme of things, which are trying to find happiness in the
              wrong place. We have designed happiness so that you cannot choose
              anything else. Even to choose evil is in the hope of finding
              happiness somehow there, or even to kill yourself is in hope of
              getting away from pain that is intolerable. So happiness is
              confused with the gratification of the instincts of child -
              security, power control, self-esteem and approval, and these grow
              into the false self and the ego, and so when you come to adult with
              this baggage of possessive attitudes towards yourself and the world
              and other people that can't possibly work in the adult life, but
              unfortunately you have to live with six billion other people who
              have the same problems. So it is no wonder there are social
              problems, because unless this radical problem is addressed,
              societies which are made up of a bunch of false selves is not going
              to do too well.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>And hence to take the determination not to contribute to
              the messiness of the world by adding our own false selves projects
              to it is one of the greatest gifts you could give to humanity. And
              if enough people do this, then society will be transformed, and
              without it I don't think it can be. That's why religion, whatever
              it's forms are (and they are innumerous) is crucial because it is
              the only path, at least foreseeable path that leads most people to
              the experience of God. Now, other things can, like nature, or
              wonderful service of others, (inaudible), arts to some degree, but
              the holistic and concentrated ways that religion addresses the
              human problem are unmatched. But they also have to be gradually
              transceded, not by rejection, but by taking the steps in which we
              relate to God more and more maturely as we grow as human beings
              into adulthood. And love is certainly very crucial and motivating
              as to do so. And I suppose that's why the first commandment in the
              Judeo-Christian scheme of things is to Love the Lord your God with
              your WHOLE Mind, with your WHOLE Heart, with your WHOLE Soul, and
              with all your strength... it's impossible to do without
              contemplative prayer and the insights that that
              brings.</strong></p>
              <p>It is actually not the case. Mystics actually attempt to
              describe their experience in a very matter-of-fact way and many of
              them have profound understanding of the bible or their
              scriptures.</p>
              <p>Secondly, faith that has support of logic is better than blind
              faith, but such faith is still based on a belief system, a belief,
              and beliefs still have room for doubts, because it is still on the
              realm of thought and there is no inner conviction.</p>
              <p>True conviction arise when we submit totally to the higher power
              such that we feel we are being 'lived'. There will be no more
              doubts and conviction when it is born of direct experience. There
              is a direct certainty of that Being, or God, that is undeniable and
              undoubtable - even without thoughts. 'You' have dissolved into
              That.</p>
              <p>There is completely no room for blind faith anymore at that time
              - because you so completely see the Truth of it.</p>
              <p>Yes, I do not deny that. In fact that is what I am saying - that
              Buddhism differs from all other religions due to its lack of
              talking about an 'ultimate substance'. Almost all religions -
              Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, etc... all talk about an
              'ultimate substance'.</p>
              <p>But it is not that we do not experience the Ground, the
              Substance, it is that we also understand its empty (not
              nothingness, but interdependent origination - will not go too
              deeply into that) nature. I do not think I will go into this deeply
              here.</p>
              <p>Yes I noticed this too. lol</p>

              original language. Therefore, the next time they come across these words in
              scriptures again, they should have no problem squaring it with the revelation
              of God in the person of Jesus Christ (and not, as quipped, “split

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">Logic by
              itself cannot explain the entire workings of God, in the area of physical
              creation, that’s where science comes in as seen in the works of believers like
              Tycho Brahe, Nicolas Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, Gottfried Leibnitz, Isaac
              Newton, Leonardo da Vinci, Johannes Kepler, John Dalton, Christian Huygens,
              Robert Hooke, Michael Faraday, Joseph Henry, James Joule, Louis Pasteur, etc.
              There is no conflict between proper empirical science and Christianity. In the
              area of salvation, one then requires special revelation and thus, the person of
              Jesus Christ and scriptures. In all of these, faith and logic go hand in hand.
              My faith is in God and His words. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">I think I
              see what you mean. There might be some equivocation in our understanding of the
              word “faith”. I don’t perfectly understand God’s works because it is clear in
              His word that His ways are higher than ours (Isaiah 55), God’s rebuke of Job,
              and Deuteronomy 29:29, “the secret things belong to the LORD our God”. To be
              able to do so perfectly would be blasphemous, because it means I’m God but I’m
              not. To that extent, the faith that exists is a persuasion that God will keep
              His promises to return in judgment, His character, etc. Which is why when one
              hears believers claim “don’t question, just believe”, question all the way(!!)
              because the Christian needs to understand in whom and in what he has the faith.
              See the “understanding” here presupposes the use of reason and logic. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">Thus, for
              the Christian, faith and reason go hand in hand. Faith cannot be divorced of
              reason, especially faith understood in the sense of “leaping into the unknown”
              - the Christian faith is NOT like that.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">Hope that
              answers your question.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">The
              article (from your friend) is pretty consistent with my view on how the practice of empirical
              science requires faith. The thing is, the non theist doesn’t seem to know what
              it is he has faith in. St Augustine once said that he believed in order that he
              may understand.</span></p>

              faith that seems particularly very popular especially in a postmodern culture,
              but it’s not one that I favour. The root of the problem is epistemological, but
              that’s fodder for another topic.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: ArialMT; color: #262626;"><em>When you use your own conceptual understanding of what you
              perceive Christ to be to attempt to comprehend what Christ is, it will fail.</em></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">Christians
              don’t rely on our own understanding. We rely primarily on the revelation of God in
              Scriptures. Proofs are person-relative, but truth is absolute, what the
              experiential Christians (new age and mystics) have is “proof” that they have
              “experienced” Christ. They think they have but it’s not concrete and
              operational. Its like arguing from personal experience for the existence of
              God, “I can sense God’s presence therefore He exists.” Arguably, it might be
              valid but it’s certainly not cogent. Because God is truth, proof of His
              existence does not have to be steeped in (what I think are) filmsy arguments.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;"><em>To know
              Christ, the egoic mind or the separate-self sense has to dissolve, and
              surrender to the direct experience of the Higher Power which you call Christ.</em></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">This is
              absolutely different from Christianity. By that I mean those mystic / new agey
              / ultra charismatic Christians. God is transcendent (apart from and independent
              of the material universe) (Gen 1:1), we are uniquely created to exert dominion
              over the earth and to have our identities. We are not meant to “share” in God’s
              substance and personhood. A strong Creator-creation distinction can be found in
              Christianity.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;"><em>'Knowing'

              "knowing" through oneness, it is "knowing" through

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;"><em>It is

              </blockquote>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">So how
              does the Mystic “know” this? Through personal experience? But my personal
              experience tells me otherwise, so who’s right? If it boils down to epistemology,
              who’s the final arbiter of truth? Myself? Him? Why is his current mode of
              understanding and thinking God not wrong, but others are? So he is affirming
              the existence of right and wrong, but those are objective values, totally in
              contrast to his subjectivity. [ps: don’t mind the barrage of questions, it’s
              just the way I write. No offense intended].</span></p>

              this truth and experiential insight is universal, since it is prior to all
              belief systems, all concepts, can be touched only directly through a direct
              means such as total submission to a higher power and dissolving the false ego
              or the separate self sense.. it is the direct experience of that One God (THAT

              conceptual/egoic mind into 'my God' vs 'your God'.</em></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">Acknowledged.
              I do believe that knowing God involves having a relationship with Him but not
              an experiential understanding that blurs the Creator-creature distinction.

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;"><em>Yes, I
              do not deny that. In fact that is what I am saying - that Buddhism differs from
              all other religions due to its lack of talking about an 'ultimate substance'.
              Almost all religions - Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, etc... all talk

              not go too deeply into that) nature. I do not think I will go into this deeply

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">I'm not sure about this. So what is the Substance then? Is it truth? Christianity
              talks about truth. Buddhism seldom talks about truth and perceives truth as
              empty in its nature? Is there another ultimate substance besides truth? maybe a link would be helpful. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">A parting
              thought. Truth exists. We cannot deny the existence of truth without first
              affirming it. Because God is truth, when we know something that is true, we are
              knowing something about God. As you illustrated with the pointer analogy, e.g.
              the finger that is pointing to the moon is not the moon,<span>  </span>we need to be mindful that we should
              not<span>  </span>confuse our experience with
              being an “experience” of God himself.<span>  </span></span></p>

                                                      displays those traits are vastly different from contemporary
                                                      understanding, it serves non believers well to understand these
                                                      words in their original language. Therefore, the next time they
                                                      come across these words in scriptures again, they should have no
                                                      problem squaring it with the revelation of God in the person of
                                                      Jesus Christ (and not, as quipped, “split
                                                      personality”). </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Tahoma;">Logic by itself cannot
                                                      explain the entire workings of God, in the area of physical
                                                      creation, that’s where science comes in as seen in the works of
                                                      believers like Tycho Brahe, Nicolas Copernicus, Galileo Galilei,
                                                      Gottfried Leibnitz, Isaac Newton, Leonardo da Vinci, Johannes
                                                      Kepler, John Dalton, Christian Huygens, Robert Hooke, Michael
                                                      Faraday, Joseph Henry, James Joule, Louis Pasteur, etc. There is no
                                                      conflict between proper empirical science and Christianity. In the
                                                      area of salvation, one then requires special revelation and thus,
                                                      the person of Jesus Christ and scriptures. In all of these, faith
                                                      and logic go hand in hand. My faith is in God and His
                                                      words. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">I
                                                      think I see what you mean. There might be some equivocation in our
                                                      understanding of the word “faith”. I don’t perfectly understand
                                                      God’s works because it is clear in His word that His ways are
                                                      higher than ours (Isaiah 55), God’s rebuke of Job, and Deuteronomy
                                                      29:29, “the secret things belong to the LORD our God”. To be able
                                                      to do so perfectly would be blasphemous, because it means I’m God
                                                      but I’m not. To that extent, the faith that exists is a persuasion
                                                      that God will keep His promises to return in judgment, His
                                                      character, etc. Which is why when one hears believers claim “don’t
                                                      question, just believe”, question all the way(!!) because the
                                                      Christian needs to understand in whom and in what he has the faith.
                                                      See the “understanding” here presupposes the use of reason and
                                                      logic.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Tahoma;">Thus, for the Christian,
                                                      faith and reason go hand in hand. Faith cannot be divorced of
                                                      reason, especially faith understood in the sense of “leaping into
                                                      the unknown” - the Christian faith is NOT like that.</span></p>

              <p>By all means use logic, but in the act of surrendering to God, you aren't analysing God, because if you are then the submission cannot be total because in total submission you are also submitting your own opinions, and not only that but your entire being, to Him. Not saying that there is no time and place for logic. There is a time and place for everything, including using logic, reading bible, reasoning, debating, etc. But logic can never totally grasp God, as you have said you don't and can't perfectly understand God's work. One can never hope to understand God through our limited human minds no matter how many times you read bible or how skilled you are in seeing logic - just like it is impossible to encapsulate the vastness of the universe into a single sentence - not saying that there is no merits in reading bible as it can serve as a 'pointer' to God.</p>

                                                      identities. We are not meant to “share” in God’s substance and
                                                      personhood. A strong Creator-creation distinction can be found in

              <p>Of course, you as a person are not God. Your clinging to 
                                                      this separate self identity is the so called barrier with God. As you 
                                                      rightly said, <em>We are not meant to “share” in God’s substance and personhood.</em> The 'person' can never 'share' or 'know' God's substance. To 'experience' God, there is no room for your 'personhood'. That
                                                       is why you have to 'surrender' your personhood to Christ until you feel 
                                                      that you no longer live, but Christ lives.</p>
              <p>"I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me" 
                                                      (Gal 2:20)</p>
              <p>This has nothing to do with New Age. Anyway, Christian Mysticism existed since the early days and is nothing close to being a modern invention. In fact the tradition of Christian Mysticism is as old as Christianity itself: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_mysticism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_mysticism </a></p>

                                                      others are? So he is affirming the existence of right and wrong,
                                                      but those are objective values, totally in contrast to his

              <p>God lives and knows and takes over your life.</p>
              <p>All other mode of understanding is the understanding through your own egoic self, the personal, mental, conceptual perspective of God. It is not true understanding. Personal understandings are many and often contradictory (but none can ever grasp God), but God is One.</p>
              <p>None of those concepts can grasp God. In the realm of concepts there is always room for doubts, misunderstandings, self-contradictions, contradictions with others, etc etc. It is not true knowing, but more like personal 'belief'.</p>

                                                      So what is the Substance then? Is it truth? Christianity talks
                                                      about truth. Buddhism seldom talks about truth and perceives truth
                                                      as empty in its nature? Is there another ultimate substance besides
                                                      truth? maybe a link would be helpful. </span></p>

              <p>In Buddhism, which differs from all other religions in the aspect that we do not posit an ontological substance. There is an Ultimate Truth, but this Truth does not refer to an inherently existing/independent essence but to  a non-substantial unity of
                                                                              interconnectivity. In other words that Truth is present and cannot be denied, but it is not reified through understanding the interconnectivity and non-substantiality of everything.</p>
              <p>On first sight this seems to contradict the other religions including the mystics and contemplatives from other religions that I mentioned above. But it is simply a refining of views, it is still refering to the same experience. The luminous presence (which is given many names like God, etc) that is the source of all existence is not denied, it is rather a  deepening of insight to include the non-dual,  
                                                      groundlessness and  interconnectedness of the luminous essence. To understand more about what I'm saying you have to read about what <a href="http://www.heartofnow.com/files/emptiness.html">'Emptiness'</a> means in Buddhist context. I hope I am not adding more confusion and complication, as this is not easy to understand and is one of the deeper and most profound teachings of Buddhism. However this is the difference between Buddhism and other religions or contemplative traditions.</p>
