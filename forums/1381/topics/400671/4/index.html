              <p>Must I slam your head against the wall to make you realise that the Christians don't have answers to every question?</p>
              <p>Your question is not even yours. It's been asked many times by skeptics. You can google and tell me it's not true. If you wish, you can also google for answers that some believers have provided. They answered the question to the best of their ablity.They don't lose faith because they cannot find an answer. They don't lose hope. At least not so easily like the cretins.</p>

              <p>Humans took after God's FULL look and nature before Adam sinned. Because of the sin that is first committed, humans began to have sinful nature. We can't blame the devil for everything because that is self-denial. </p>
              <p>I respect what you believe in, but we both have different views. </p>
              <p>I don't feel my perspective of Christianity is a routine of prayer and going to Church. It is developing our relationship with Jehovah God. </p>

              <p>You cannot argue against religion with logic. Religion is always
                                      about faith.</p>
              <h4>Hebrews 11:1</h4>
              <p> "Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain
                                      of what we do not see."</p>
              <p>If logic can determine what is true or false in the bible, the
                                      religion would haved died a very long time ago.</p>

              <p>Oh yes, I am aware that the bible also said that God is '<span style="font-family: Tahoma;">loving, righteous and just'. However it does not contradict that God is also angry, jealous, takes vengeance (for the purpose of seeking justice or whatever reasons), etc.<br></span></p>
              <p>It just means that God as depicted in OT is a personal God that has the full range (or much) of emotions that we do. We love others, but we sometimes also feel angry about others (for whatever reasons, maybe someone was really evil, etc), we also feel jealous sometimes, etc. Nobody including God (as depicted in OT) is angry or jealous all the time, those emotions arise out of a certain context.</p>

              <p>You see, if someone is already open to an alternative then he would be actively searching for the answers himself. It does not need someone to come to a forum to criticize their own faith. He will want to find out the truth of the matter regardless of whether anyone is criticizing him.</p>
              <p>For example I mentioned about my Buddhist master turning into Christian based on his reading up of Buddhism. He used to criticize Buddhism a lot due to his utter lack of understanding of what Buddhism is about (he used to think of Buddhism as simply superstitions and a demonic religion). However he was informed that his approach is of little use and has in fact 'pissed off' people more than they actually change people or convert people. He was also challenged by his Uni professor to start writing a critique on Buddhism through his own studies and the professor will give him full support to do so, as that will be a more approachable way than insulting and denigrating the other religion without understanding.</p>
              <p>But after finding out what Buddhism is about, he converted, but he did not do so because Buddhists are criticizing his Christian faith. He did so because he was open, he was willing to find out what the others are teaching, he was willing to question and examine.</p>
              <p>If someone is already stuck to his own belief and unwilling to find out about other religion, then no amount of criticism will actually move a person.</p>
              <p>That is why I say, helping 'potential people' is better than criticizing people who have already chosen their paths.</p>

              <p>As I said, I am not saying that Christians are illogical or shun the use of logic.</p>
              <p>I am saying that logic cannot possibly explain the entire workings of God, just like logic cannot explain the entire workings of the universe (what we understand is like only an infinitesimal speck of the vastness of the universe).</p>
              <p>You haven't answer me, can you perfectly logically understand how God works? Yet you do have faith in Him right?</p>

              <p>Hmm... don't think you get what I mean yet. What I am talking is the Truth that precedes belief system, and the Faith the precedes separate belief systems. Belief systems are many and they all contradict each other, even within a single religion the different denominations contradict each other as well. But what I am talking about goes deeper than that.</p>
              <p>I think this video is good and explains what I mean especially the first 7:37 minutes: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04gdsFt_zDY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04gdsFt_zDY</a></p>
              <p>When you said that Christ is the only way to God, I will not refute that, but then the question is what exactly is the nature and substance of Christ. Most people are believing in their own image of what Christ is without any further experiential understanding. When you use your own conceptual understanding of what you perceive Christ to be to attempt to comprehend what Christ is, it will fail. No conceptual thought can capture Christ absolutely, it is only a limited pointer to the thing-in-itself. To know Christ, the egoic mind or the separate-self sense has to dissolve, and surrender to the direct experience of the Higher Power which you call Christ. It is not using thought to understand him, as my friend Thusness have said many years ago,<em></em></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>This reminds me of a medieval Christian book 'The Cloud of Unknowing',</p>
              <h2><em></em></h2>
              <p><em>The book counsels a young student not to seek <a title="God" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God">God</a> through 
                                                          knowledge but through what the author speaks of as a "naked intent" and a
                                                           "blind <a title="Love" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love">love</a>."
                                                           This is brought about by putting all thoughts except the love of <a title="God" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God">God</a>, under a 
                                                          "cloud of forgetting" and thereby piercing <a title="God" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God">God</a>'s cloud of 
                                                          unknowing, with a "dart of longing love" from the heart.</em></p>
              <p>Furthermore it is said in the bible:</p>
              <p><em><sup id="en-NIV-29086" class="versenum">20</sup>I have been 
                                                                      crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The 
                                                                      life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me
                                                                       and gave himself for me. (Galatians 2:20)</em></p>
              <p>Anyway I understand that no amount of talking about this will convince you since you are deeply rooted into the belief system. But if you do have such a mystical experience or union, your perspective will change, as you begin to see that this truth and experiential insight is universal, since it is prior to all belief systems, all concepts, can be touched only directly through a direct means such as total submission to a higher power and dissolving the false ego or the separate self sense.. it is the direct experience of that One God (THAT from which everyone and everything arise and subsides from), not divided by our conceptual/egoic mind into 'my God' vs 'your God'.</p>
              <p>As Father Thomas Keating said, <strong>Faith precedes belief systems, which means that Faith means the consent or surrender to the divine reality or to the Ultimate Reality or whatever name is in the different religion, before it is broken down into different belief systems which are bound to be influenced by the cultural conditioning of the person or the reformers who worked on that religion. So when Faith becomes contemplative, it begins to precede the Oneness behind all religions, before the experience of God is broken down into various belief sytems. You have to have some belief systems because we are human, as a starting point as I was trying to say, the faculties have to be organized around the faith, (inaudible), as a stepping stone or a conveyer belt to take us to a further level of relating to this mystery which is more direct, which doesn't reject our former religious practices, but has a certain freedom towards them so that they are not abolutized, so the only Absolute becomes The Absolute. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>And on the other end of the spectrum which is an equally important is the separate sense, which is the 'I am' which Ken Wilber was speaking about, which begins to emerge in very early childhood, then becomes fully reflective and self-conscious in adolescence and so on. And this is the basic source of every human problem. It is the source of certainly every sin in the sense of 'missing the mark', because it is the separate self sense that opposes reality, and the Truth, and which creates our own 'self' and ultimately our own 'hell', if the 'self' we are developing goes to the extremes of selfishness as our experience and those of many others realize it's quite possible. So on one hand you have the basic oneness of everything that is in its Source, and the basic issue of separating ourselves from that Oneness which then means that we're separating ourselves from our True Self and everybody else and from the cosmos in varying degrees in which we sin, meaning to miss the mark, which is to fail to recognize the truth of the situation. So the separate self-sense is what all the religions is trying to cure as far as I can see, and all the consequences of that development which psychologically speaking have been researched in our times, and such things as the private or psychological unconscious, the personal unconscious, the collective unconscious... this whole world of motivation that we're not aware of is the fruit of the development of the separate self sense into energiy centers like the first three chakras of the Hindu scheme of things, which are trying to find happiness in the wrong place. We have designed happiness so that you cannot choose anything else. Even to choose evil is in the hope of finding happiness somehow there, or even to kill yourself is in hope of getting away from pain that is intolerable. So happiness is confused with the gratification of the instincts of child - security, power control, self-esteem and approval, and these grow into the false self and the ego, and so when you come to adult with this baggage of possessive attitudes towards yourself and the world and other people that can't possibly work in the adult life, but unfortunately you have to live with six billion other people who have the same problems. So it is no wonder there are social problems, because unless this radical problem is addressed, societies which are made up of a bunch of false selves is not going to do too well.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>And hence to take the determination not to contribute to the messiness of the world by adding our own false selves projects to it is one of the greatest gifts you could give to humanity. And if enough people do this, then society will be transformed, and without it I don't think it can be. That's why religion, whatever it's forms are (and they are innumerous) is crucial because it is the only path, at least foreseeable path that leads most people to the experience of God. Now, other things can, like nature, or wonderful service of others, (inaudible), arts to some degree, but the holistic and concentrated ways that religion addresses the human problem are unmatched. But they also have to be gradually transceded, not by rejection, but by taking the steps in which we relate to God more and more maturely as we grow as human beings into adulthood. And love is certainly very crucial and motivating as to do so. And I suppose that's why the first commandment in the Judeo-Christian scheme of things is to Love the Lord your God with your WHOLE Mind, with your WHOLE Heart, with your WHOLE Soul, and with all your strength... it's impossible to do without contemplative prayer and the insights that that brings.</strong></p>

              <p>It is actually not the case. Mystics actually attempt to describe their experience in a very matter-of-fact way and many of them have profound understanding of the bible or their scriptures.</p>
              <p>Secondly, faith that has support of logic is better than blind faith, but such faith is still based on a belief system, a belief, and beliefs still have room for doubts, because it is still on the realm of thought and there is no inner conviction.</p>
              <p>True conviction arise when we submit totally to the higher power such that we feel we are being 'lived'. There will be no more doubts and conviction when it is born of direct experience. There is a direct certainty of that Being, or God, that is undeniable and undoubtable - even without thoughts. 'You' have dissolved into That.</p>
              <p>There is completely no room for blind faith anymore at that time - because you so completely see the Truth of it.</p>

              <p>Yes, I do not deny that. In fact that is what I am saying - that Buddhism differs from all other religions due to its lack of talking about an 'ultimate substance'. Almost all religions - Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, etc... all talk about an 'ultimate substance'.</p>
              <p>But it is not that we do not experience the Ground, the Substance, it is that we also understand its empty (not nothingness, but interdependent origination - will not go too deeply into that) nature. I do not think I will go into this deeply here.</p>

              <p>Oh yes, I am aware that the bible also said that God is
              '<span style="font-family: Tahoma;">loving, righteous and just'.
              However it does not contradict that God is also angry, jealous,
              takes vengeance (for the purpose of seeking justice or whatever
              reasons), etc.<br></span></p>
              <p>It just means that God as depicted in OT is a personal God that
              has the full range (or much) of emotions that we do. We love
              others, but we sometimes also feel angry about others (for whatever
              reasons, maybe someone was really evil, etc), we also feel jealous
              sometimes, etc. Nobody including God (as depicted in OT) is angry
              or jealous all the time, those emotions arise out of a certain
              context.</p>
              <p>I see, in that case I agree.</p>
              <p>You see, if someone is already open to an alternative then he
              would be actively searching for the answers himself. It does not
              need someone to come to a forum to criticize their own faith. He
              will want to find out the truth of the matter regardless of whether
              anyone is criticizing him.</p>
              <p>For example I mentioned about my Buddhist master turning into
              Christian based on his reading up of Buddhism. He used to criticize
              Buddhism a lot due to his utter lack of understanding of what
              Buddhism is about (he used to think of Buddhism as simply
              superstitions and a demonic religion). However he was informed that
              his approach is of little use and has in fact 'pissed off' people
              more than they actually change people or convert people. He was
              also challenged by his Uni professor to start writing a critique on
              Buddhism through his own studies and the professor will give him
              full support to do so, as that will be a more approachable way than
              insulting and denigrating the other religion without
              understanding.</p>
              <p>But after finding out what Buddhism is about, he converted, but
              he did not do so because Buddhists are criticizing his Christian
              faith. He did so because he was open, he was willing to find out
              what the others are teaching, he was willing to question and
              examine.</p>
              <p>If someone is already stuck to his own belief and unwilling to
              find out about other religion, then no amount of criticism will
              actually move a person.</p>
              <p>That is why I say, helping 'potential people' is better than
              criticizing people who have already chosen their paths.</p>
              <p>As I said, I am not saying that Christians are illogical or shun
              the use of logic.</p>
              <p>I am saying that logic cannot possibly explain the entire
              workings of God, just like logic cannot explain the entire workings
              of the universe (what we understand is like only an infinitesimal
              speck of the vastness of the universe).</p>
              <p>You haven't answer me, can you perfectly logically understand
              how God works? Yet you do have faith in Him right?</p>
              <p>Let me quote something from my other moderator Thusness from a
              few years ago:</p>
              <p><em>Faith is necessary because there is no certainty in
              knowledge. Even in exact science, no certainty is to be found. Of
              course certainty versus probable knowledge is a topic relating to
              Epistemology (the theory on Knowledge) but still, it is pivotal
              towards understanding why the need for faith at all. How science
              has led to the common misunderstanding that faith is not necessary
              is amazing but it is mostly due to the predictive nature of these
              scientific theories derived from thorough experimentation. This is,
              however, mainly due to the fact that the pool of data made
              available for the derivation of these theories does not go beyond
              our man-size world. As we know, Newtonian physics or classical
              science works well for a man-size world but not quite well in the
              macro and micro universe. Our ordinary experiences do not permit us
              to experience something having the mass of a star or traveling at
              half-speed of light, we presume that the entire universe must obey
              the laws of the man-size world. But when we are exposed to things
              not so ordinary, like traveling at a speed much faster then our
              ordinary experience of Â‘speedÂ’, we are lost because phenomena just
              donÂ’t behave the way we expected it to be. The idea that time
              travel slower when they are approaching the speed of light and halt
              at speed of light is mind boggling. Similarly when scientists begin
              to deal with the universe of the outer space Â– the macro universe,
              they are dealing with much more massive objects than the man-size
              world, a billion times more. The idea that space curves and time
              halt at the speed of light came as a shocked to the classical
              scientists. This applies true when we deal with the micro universe
              of the quantum world. The world of the electrons does not comply
              with Newtonian nor Einstein theory. This includes the spooky
              non-local behavior of particles that AEN brought up in another
              thread. <strong>When Heisenberg introduced the Â‘uncertaintyÂ’
              principle, it is so weird that even Einstein rejected it and thus,
              Einstein famous remark -- Â“God does not play diceÂ”. But Â“God does
              not play diceÂ” is a belief system!</strong> I canÂ’t remember where
              I read it but I could clearly recalled that even Stephen Hawking
              used phrases like Â“official dogmaÂ”, Â“deep emotional attachment to
              determinismÂ” to describe scientists like Einstein. Stephen Hawking
              even went further to say that Einstein was doubly wrong when he
              said Â“God does not play diceÂ”.<br> <br> I will not dwell too deeply into it but the purpose is simply to
              illustrate that our knowledge is nothing certain nor absolute.
              Science is itself a belief system for us to better understand the
              phenomenon existence. It is its certainty in predictability within
              a prescribed environment that convinces us that faith is not
              necessary. It creates the impression of certainty and made a
              probable knowledge appears absolute but in actual case, science
              itself is a belief system and a great deal of faith (maybe good and
              rational faith in this case) is vested in science
              unknowingly.</em></p>
              <p>...........</p>
              <p><em>...faith plays a vital role in our life and we are always
              investing faith in people, theories, concepts and belief systems
              unknowingly. Human is not just a rational being; to understand
              ourselves, we must also examine our emotional, mythical and
              psychological makeup.<br> <br> To touch on what is Â‘trueÂ’ and Â‘rightÂ’ free of our belief systems
              is a philosophical question that I do not wish to get into. Coming
              into contact with Buddhism is more of coincidental. My deepening of
              faith in BuddhaÂ’s words came only as a result of practice. It is
              experiential and subjective. It is sort of Â‘I know because I
              experience it.Â’</em> <em><img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></em></p>
              <p>..............</p>
              <p><em>'Right' implies complying with a pre-determined set of
              criteria. I think we must be aware of the distinction between
              "right faith" and "right attitude towards faith". If a certain
              belief system has a criterion "that one should have full trust in
              God", then 'testing God' is not 'right faith'. A half-hearted
              devotion will deny the relationship as well as the experience with
              God. To a rationalist this approach may not be appealing, but to
              some sages, their wisdom have penetrated deep enough to understand
              the entirety of our psychological and spiritual makeup. I do not
              see it as wrong. It is a practice that will similarly yield
              religious experiences. One should not be afraid to be blind in
              total devotion. Nevertheless if such practices are understood
              wrongly or fall under the hands of unscrupulous religious leaders,
              it can be devastating.<br> <br> On the other hand, I think "right attitude towards faith" do
              require us to question and check the basis of our belief systems.
              For the latter, it is the process of authentication that deepens
              the faith; however this can be quite challenging psychologically
              and dangerous too. It can lead one to a state of total
              confusion.</em> <em><br> <br> Both approaches are different in nature. In Buddhism there are
              different paths to suit different people, it is not a one and for
              all cases. It Â‘stagedÂ’ one according to their suitability and
              developed the necessary conditions for us to progress further.
              Spirituality is not an easy journey, we will learn along the
              road.</em> <em><img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></em></p>
              <p>Hmm... don't think you get what I mean yet. What I am talking is
              the Truth that precedes belief system, and the Faith the precedes
              separate belief systems. Belief systems are many and they all
              contradict each other, even within a single religion the different
              denominations contradict each other as well. But what I am talking
              about goes deeper than that.</p>
              <p>I think this video is good and explains what I mean especially
              the first 7:37 minutes: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04gdsFt_zDY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04gdsFt_zDY</a></p>
              <p>When you said that Christ is the only way to God, I will not
              refute that, but then the question is what exactly is the nature
              and substance of Christ. Most people are believing in their own
              image of what Christ is without any further experiential
              understanding. When you use your own conceptual understanding of
              what you perceive Christ to be to attempt to comprehend what Christ
              is, it will fail. No conceptual thought can capture Christ
              absolutely, it is only a limited pointer to the thing-in-itself. To
              know Christ, the egoic mind or the separate-self sense has to
              dissolve, and surrender to the direct experience of the Higher
              Power which you call Christ. It is not using thought to understand
              him, as my friend Thusness have said many years ago,</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>This reminds me of a medieval Christian book 'The Cloud of
              Unknowing',</p>
              <p><em>The book counsels a young student not to seek <a title="God" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God">God</a> through knowledge but through what the author
              speaks of as a "naked intent" and a "blind <a title="Love" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love">love</a>." This is brought about by putting all thoughts
              except the love of <a title="God" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God">God</a>, under a "cloud of forgetting"
              and thereby piercing <a title="God" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God">God</a>'s cloud of unknowing, with a
              "dart of longing love" from the heart.</em></p>
              <p>Furthermore it is said in the bible:</p>
              <p><em><sup>20</sup>I have been crucified with Christ and
              I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the
              body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave
              himself for me. (Galatians 2:20)</em></p>
              <p>Anyway I understand that no amount of talking about this will
              convince you since you are deeply rooted into the belief system.
              But if you do have such a mystical experience or union, your
              perspective will change, as you begin to see that this truth and
              experiential insight is universal, since it is prior to all belief
              systems, all concepts, can be touched only directly through a
              direct means such as total submission to a higher power and
              dissolving the false ego or the separate self sense..</p>
              <p>As Father Thomas Keating said, <strong>Faith precedes belief
              systems, which means that Faith means the consent or surrender to
              the divine reality or to the Ultimate Reality or whatever name is
              in the different religion, before it is broken down into different
              belief systems which are bound to be influenced by the cultural
              conditioning of the person or the reformers who worked on that
              religion. So when Faith becomes contemplative, it begins to precede
              the Oneness behind all religions, before the experience of God is
              broken down into various belief sytems. You have to have some
              belief systems because we are human, as a starting point as I was
              trying to say, the faculties have to be organized around the faith,
              (inaudible), as a stepping stone or a conveyer belt to take us to a
              further level of relating to this mystery which is more direct,
              which doesn't reject our former religious practices, but has a
              certain freedom towards them so that they are not abolutized, so
              the only Absolute becomes The Absolute.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>And on the other end of the spectrum which is an equally
              important is the separate sense, which is the 'I am' which Ken
              Wilber was speaking about, which begins to emerge in very early
              childhood, then becomes fully reflective and self-conscious in
              adolescence and so on. And this is the basic source of every human
              problem. It is the source of certainly every sin in the sense of
              'missing the mark', because it is the separate self sense that
              opposes reality, and the Truth, and which creates our own 'self'
              and ultimately our own 'hell', if the 'self' we are developing goes
              to the extremes of selfishness as our experience and those of many
              others realize it's quite possible. So on one hand you have the
              basic oneness of everything that is in its Source, and the basic
              issue of separating ourselves from that Oneness which then means
              that we're separating ourselves from our True Self and everybody
              else and from the cosmos in varying degrees in which we sin,
              meaning to miss the mark, which is to fail to recognize the truth
              of the situation. So the separate self-sense is what all the
              religions is trying to cure as far as I can see, and all the
              consequences of that development which psychologically speaking
              have been researched in our times, and such things as the private
              or psychological unconscious, the personal unconscious, the
              collective unconscious... this whole world of motivation that we're
              not aware of is the fruit of the development of the separate self
              sense into energiy centers like the first three chakras of the
              Hindu scheme of things, which are trying to find happiness in the
              wrong place. We have designed happiness so that you cannot choose
              anything else. Even to choose evil is in the hope of finding
              happiness somehow there, or even to kill yourself is in hope of
              getting away from pain that is intolerable. So happiness is
              confused with the gratification of the instincts of child -
              security, power control, self-esteem and approval, and these grow
              into the false self and the ego, and so when you come to adult with
              this baggage of possessive attitudes towards yourself and the world
              and other people that can't possibly work in the adult life, but
              unfortunately you have to live with six billion other people who
              have the same problems. So it is no wonder there are social
              problems, because unless this radical problem is addressed,
              societies which are made up of a bunch of false selves is not going
              to do too well.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>And hence to take the determination not to contribute to
              the messiness of the world by adding our own false selves projects
              to it is one of the greatest gifts you could give to humanity. And
              if enough people do this, then society will be transformed, and
              without it I don't think it can be. That's why religion, whatever
              it's forms are (and they are innumerous) is crucial because it is
              the only path, at least foreseeable path that leads most people to
              the experience of God. Now, other things can, like nature, or
              wonderful service of others, (inaudible), arts to some degree, but
              the holistic and concentrated ways that religion addresses the
              human problem are unmatched. But they also have to be gradually
              transceded, not by rejection, but by taking the steps in which we
              relate to God more and more maturely as we grow as human beings
              into adulthood. And love is certainly very crucial and motivating
              as to do so. And I suppose that's why the first commandment in the
              Judeo-Christian scheme of things is to Love the Lord your God with
              your WHOLE Mind, with your WHOLE Heart, with your WHOLE Soul, and
              with all your strength... it's impossible to do without
              contemplative prayer and the insights that that
              brings.</strong></p>
              <p>It is actually not the case. Mystics actually attempt to
              describe their experience in a very matter-of-fact way and many of
              them have profound understanding of the bible or their
              scriptures.</p>
              <p>Yes, I do not deny that. In fact that is what I am saying - that
              Buddhism differs from all other religions due to its lack of
              talking about an 'ultimate substance'. Almost all religions -
              Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, etc... all talk about an
              'ultimate substance'.</p>
              <p>But it is not that we do not experience the Ground, the
              Substance, it is that we also understand its empty (not
              nothingness, but interdependent origination - will not go too
              deeply into that) nature. I do not think I will go into this deeply
              here.</p>
              <p>Yes I noticed this too. lol</p>

              <p>Oh yes, I am aware that the bible also said that God is '<span style="font-family: Tahoma;">loving, righteous and just'. However it does not contradict that God is also angry, jealous, takes vengeance (for the purpose of seeking justice or whatever reasons), etc.<br></span></p>
              <p>It just means that God as depicted in OT is a personal God that has the full range (or much) of emotions that we do. We love others, but we sometimes also feel angry about others (for whatever reasons, maybe someone was really evil, etc), we also feel jealous sometimes, etc. Nobody including God (as depicted in OT) is angry or jealous all the time, those emotions arise out of a certain context.</p>
              <p>I see, in that case I agree.</p>
              <p>You see, if someone is already open to an alternative then he would be actively searching for the answers himself. It does not need someone to come to a forum to criticize their own faith. He will want to find out the truth of the matter regardless of whether anyone is criticizing him.</p>
              <p>For example I mentioned about my Buddhist master turning into Christian based on his reading up of Buddhism. He used to criticize Buddhism a lot due to his utter lack of understanding of what Buddhism is about (he used to think of Buddhism as simply superstitions and a demonic religion). However he was informed that his approach is of little use and has in fact 'pissed off' people more than they actually change people or convert people. He was also challenged by his Uni professor to start writing a critique on Buddhism through his own studies and the professor will give him full support to do so, as that will be a more approachable way than insulting and denigrating the other religion without understanding.</p>
              <p>But after finding out what Buddhism is about, he converted, but he did not do so because Buddhists are criticizing his Christian faith. He did so because he was open, he was willing to find out what the others are teaching, he was willing to question and examine.</p>
              <p>If someone is already stuck to his own belief and unwilling to find out about other religion, then no amount of criticism will actually move a person.</p>
              <p>That is why I say, helping 'potential people' is better than criticizing people who have already chosen their paths.</p>
              <p>As I said, I am not saying that Christians are illogical or shun the use of logic.</p>
              <p>I am saying that logic cannot possibly explain the entire workings of God, just like logic cannot explain the entire workings of the universe (what we understand is like only an infinitesimal speck of the vastness of the universe).</p>
              <p>You haven't answer me, can you perfectly logically understand how God works? Yet you do have faith in Him right?</p>
              <p>Let me quote something from my other moderator Thusness from a few years ago:</p>
              <p><em>Faith is necessary because there is no certainty in knowledge. Even in exact science, no certainty is to be found. Of course certainty versus probable knowledge is a topic relating to Epistemology (the theory on Knowledge) but still, it is pivotal towards understanding why the need for faith at all. How science has led to the common misunderstanding that faith is not necessary is amazing but it is mostly due to the predictive nature of these scientific theories derived from thorough experimentation. This is, however, mainly due to the fact that the pool of data made available for the derivation of these theories does not go beyond our man-size world. As we know, Newtonian physics or classical science works well for a man-size world but not quite well in the macro and micro universe. Our ordinary experiences do not permit us to experience something having the mass of a star or traveling at half-speed of light, we presume that the entire universe must obey the laws of the man-size world. But when we are exposed to things not so ordinary, like traveling at a speed much faster then our ordinary experience of Â‘speedÂ’, we are lost because phenomena just donÂ’t behave the way we expected it to be. The idea that time travel slower when they are approaching the speed of light and halt at speed of light is mind boggling. Similarly when scientists begin to deal with the universe of the outer space Â– the macro universe, they are dealing with much more massive objects than the man-size world, a billion times more. The idea that space curves and time halt at the speed of light came as a shocked to the classical scientists. This applies true when we deal with the micro universe of the quantum world. The world of the electrons does not comply with Newtonian nor Einstein theory. This includes the spooky non-local behavior of particles that AEN brought up in another thread. <strong>When Heisenberg introduced the Â‘uncertaintyÂ’ principle, it is so weird that even Einstein rejected it and thus, Einstein famous remark -- Â“God does not play diceÂ”. But Â“God does not play diceÂ” is a belief system!</strong> I canÂ’t remember where I read it but I could clearly recalled that even Stephen Hawking used phrases like Â“official dogmaÂ”, Â“deep emotional attachment to determinismÂ” to describe scientists like Einstein. Stephen Hawking even went further to say that Einstein was doubly wrong when he said Â“God does not play diceÂ”.<br><br>I will not dwell too deeply into it but the purpose is simply to illustrate that our knowledge is nothing certain nor absolute. Science is itself a belief system for us to better understand the phenomenon existence. It is its certainty in predictability within a prescribed environment that convinces us that faith is not necessary. It creates the impression of certainty and made a probable knowledge appears absolute but in actual case, science itself is a belief system and a great deal of faith (maybe good and rational faith in this case) is vested in science unknowingly.</em></p>
              <p>...........</p>
              <p><em>...faith plays a vital role in our life and we are always investing faith in people, theories, concepts and belief systems unknowingly. Human is not just a rational being; to understand ourselves, we must also examine our emotional, mythical and psychological makeup.<br><br>To touch on what is Â‘trueÂ’ and Â‘rightÂ’ free of our belief systems is a philosophical question that I do not wish to get into. Coming into contact with Buddhism is more of coincidental. My deepening of faith in BuddhaÂ’s words came only as a result of practice. It is experiential and subjective. It is sort of Â‘I know because I experience it.Â’</em> <em><img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></em></p>
              <p>..............</p>
              <p><em>'Right' implies complying with a pre-determined set of criteria. I think we must be aware of the distinction between "right faith" and "right attitude towards faith". If a certain belief system has a criterion "that one should have full trust in God", then 'testing God' is not 'right faith'. A half-hearted devotion will deny the relationship as well as the experience with God. To a rationalist this approach may not be appealing, but to some sages, their wisdom have penetrated deep enough to understand the entirety of our psychological and spiritual makeup. I do not see it as wrong. It is a practice that will similarly yield religious experiences. One should not be afraid to be blind in total devotion. Nevertheless if such practices are understood wrongly or fall under the hands of unscrupulous religious leaders, it can be devastating.<br><br>On the other hand, I think "right attitude towards faith" do require us to question and check the basis of our belief systems. For the latter, it is the process of authentication that deepens the faith; however this can be quite challenging psychologically and dangerous too. It can lead one to a state of total confusion.</em> <em><br><br>Both approaches are different in nature. In Buddhism there are different paths to suit different people, it is not a one and for all cases. It Â‘stagedÂ’ one according to their suitability and developed the necessary conditions for us to progress further. Spirituality is not an easy journey, we will learn along the road.</em> <em><img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></em></p>
              <p>Hmm... don't think you get what I mean yet. What I am talking is the Truth that precedes belief system, and the Faith the precedes separate belief systems. Belief systems are many and they all contradict each other, even within a single religion the different denominations contradict each other as well. But what I am talking about goes deeper than that.</p>
              <p>I think this video is good and explains what I mean especially the first 7:37 minutes: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04gdsFt_zDY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04gdsFt_zDY</a></p>
              <p>When you said that Christ is the only way to God, I will not refute that, but then the question is what exactly is the nature and substance of Christ. Most people are believing in their own image of what Christ is without any further experiential understanding. When you use your own conceptual understanding of what you perceive Christ to be to attempt to comprehend what Christ is, it will fail. No conceptual thought can capture Christ absolutely, it is only a limited pointer to the thing-in-itself. To know Christ, the egoic mind or the separate-self sense has to dissolve, and surrender to the direct experience of the Higher Power which you call Christ. It is not using thought to understand him, as my friend Thusness have said many years ago,</p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: normal;">(partial excerpt from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://simpo.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=insight&amp;amp;action=display&amp;amp;thread=193">http://simpo.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=insight&amp;action=display&amp;thread=193</a>)</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: normal;"><br>...It is the current mode of thinking and understanding God that is at fault.<br>As long as Reality is concerned, it is the wrong tool to use.<br>Analysis is the way of comparison and measurement, it is dual.<br>The Luminous Light 'knows' not through analysis.<br><br>'Knowing' to the Mystic is not to make an object in mind and study it.<br>It is "knowing" through oneness, it is "knowing" through Beingness.<br>It is losing yourself and finding itself in otherness.<br>It is an entirely different art -- Merely reflecting and simply IS.<br>If we are resistant to the idea of dropping the 'How' and 'What', <strong><br>then the path of faith and total submission towards God is preferred.<br>If we love God, do not analyse him, we are slaying him.</strong><br><br>The mysterious gate is ever open in the HERE and NOW.<br>To experience in full, let go completely and leave not a trace of ourselves...</span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This reminds me of a medieval Christian book 'The Cloud of Unknowing',</p>
              <p><em>The book counsels a young student not to seek <a title="God" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God">God</a> through knowledge but through what the author speaks of as a "naked intent" and a "blind <a title="Love" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love">love</a>." This is brought about by putting all thoughts except the love of <a title="God" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God">God</a>, under a "cloud of forgetting" and thereby piercing <a title="God" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God">God</a>'s cloud of unknowing, with a "dart of longing love" from the heart.</em></p>
              <p>Furthermore it is said in the bible:</p>
              <p><em><sup>20</sup>I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. (Galatians 2:20)</em></p>
              <p>Anyway I understand that no amount of talking about this will convince you since you are deeply rooted into the belief system. But if you do have such a mystical experience or union, your perspective will change, as you begin to see that this truth and experiential insight is universal, since it is prior to all belief systems, all concepts, can be touched only directly through a direct means such as total submission to a higher power and dissolving the false ego or the separate self sense.. it is the direct experience of that One God (THAT from which everyone and everything arise and subsides from), not divided by our conceptual/egoic mind into 'my God' vs 'your God'.</p>
              <p>As Father Thomas Keating said, <strong>Faith precedes belief systems, which means that Faith means the consent or surrender to the divine reality or to the Ultimate Reality or whatever name is in the different religion, before it is broken down into different belief systems which are bound to be influenced by the cultural conditioning of the person or the reformers who worked on that religion. So when Faith becomes contemplative, it begins to precede the Oneness behind all religions, before the experience of God is broken down into various belief sytems. You have to have some belief systems because we are human, as a starting point as I was trying to say, the faculties have to be organized around the faith, (inaudible), as a stepping stone or a conveyer belt to take us to a further level of relating to this mystery which is more direct, which doesn't reject our former religious practices, but has a certain freedom towards them so that they are not abolutized, so the only Absolute becomes The Absolute.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>And on the other end of the spectrum which is an equally important is the separate sense, which is the 'I am' which Ken Wilber was speaking about, which begins to emerge in very early childhood, then becomes fully reflective and self-conscious in adolescence and so on. And this is the basic source of every human problem. It is the source of certainly every sin in the sense of 'missing the mark', because it is the separate self sense that opposes reality, and the Truth, and which creates our own 'self' and ultimately our own 'hell', if the 'self' we are developing goes to the extremes of selfishness as our experience and those of many others realize it's quite possible. So on one hand you have the basic oneness of everything that is in its Source, and the basic issue of separating ourselves from that Oneness which then means that we're separating ourselves from our True Self and everybody else and from the cosmos in varying degrees in which we sin, meaning to miss the mark, which is to fail to recognize the truth of the situation. So the separate self-sense is what all the religions is trying to cure as far as I can see, and all the consequences of that development which psychologically speaking have been researched in our times, and such things as the private or psychological unconscious, the personal unconscious, the collective unconscious... this whole world of motivation that we're not aware of is the fruit of the development of the separate self sense into energiy centers like the first three chakras of the Hindu scheme of things, which are trying to find happiness in the wrong place. We have designed happiness so that you cannot choose anything else. Even to choose evil is in the hope of finding happiness somehow there, or even to kill yourself is in hope of getting away from pain that is intolerable. So happiness is confused with the gratification of the instincts of child - security, power control, self-esteem and approval, and these grow into the false self and the ego, and so when you come to adult with this baggage of possessive attitudes towards yourself and the world and other people that can't possibly work in the adult life, but unfortunately you have to live with six billion other people who have the same problems. So it is no wonder there are social problems, because unless this radical problem is addressed, societies which are made up of a bunch of false selves is not going to do too well.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>And hence to take the determination not to contribute to the messiness of the world by adding our own false selves projects to it is one of the greatest gifts you could give to humanity. And if enough people do this, then society will be transformed, and without it I don't think it can be. That's why religion, whatever it's forms are (and they are innumerous) is crucial because it is the only path, at least foreseeable path that leads most people to the experience of God. Now, other things can, like nature, or wonderful service of others, (inaudible), arts to some degree, but the holistic and concentrated ways that religion addresses the human problem are unmatched. But they also have to be gradually transceded, not by rejection, but by taking the steps in which we relate to God more and more maturely as we grow as human beings into adulthood. And love is certainly very crucial and motivating as to do so. And I suppose that's why the first commandment in the Judeo-Christian scheme of things is to Love the Lord your God with your WHOLE Mind, with your WHOLE Heart, with your WHOLE Soul, and with all your strength... it's impossible to do without contemplative prayer and the insights that that brings.</strong></p>
              <p>It is actually not the case. Mystics actually attempt to describe their experience in a very matter-of-fact way and many of them have profound understanding of the bible or their scriptures.</p>
              <p>Secondly, faith that has support of logic is better than blind faith, but such faith is still based on a belief system, a belief, and beliefs still have room for doubts, because it is still on the realm of thought and there is no inner conviction.</p>
              <p>True conviction arise when we submit totally to the higher power such that we feel we are being 'lived'. There will be no more doubts and conviction when it is born of direct experience. There is a direct certainty of that Being, or God, that is undeniable and undoubtable - even without thoughts. 'You' have dissolved into That.</p>
              <p>There is completely no room for blind faith anymore at that time - because you so completely see the Truth of it.</p>
              <p>Yes, I do not deny that. In fact that is what I am saying - that Buddhism differs from all other religions due to its lack of talking about an 'ultimate substance'. Almost all religions - Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, etc... all talk about an 'ultimate substance'.</p>
              <p>But it is not that we do not experience the Ground, the Substance, it is that we also understand its empty (not nothingness, but interdependent origination - will not go too deeply into that) nature. I do not think I will go into this deeply here.</p>
              <p>Yes I noticed this too. lol</p>
