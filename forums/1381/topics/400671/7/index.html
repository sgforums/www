              <p>No problem with what you said here, of course, being Christian
              you have to study His Word and use your reasoning abilities. No
              mystic will tell you to stop using your reasoning abilities in
              life, this is not going to a state of pre-rationality (like the
              realm of babies or animals): but something that is
              'trans-rational', in other words, you still continue to use
              rationality, but you also go one step further... after which you
              can still fully make use of your intellect as a God-given tool.</p>
              <p>I did not say that through mystical union you will discover
              God's plan and secrets, etc. This is not what I mean. <strong>I do
              not mean you can 'access God's personhood'.</strong> No creature
              can do that. God continues to be a mystery in union, just that you
              let go of your self, and 'Christ lives in you', in other words, you
              will feel an utter conviction of Christ and you are being 'lived'
              by Christ. You may not know 'how' Christ will live you, <strong>but
              you have no doubts that you are lived by God and there is no more
              'you' at the center of your life.</strong> You may not know where
              God's will is going to lead you, but nevertheless you have
              submitted to God's will (like 'Thy will be done' (<em>Matt.
              26:42</em>)). You will have no doubts about it when you experience
              it (of course, 'you experience' is just a figure of speech because
              by then it is no longer 'you' who lives). It is obviously not 'you'
              as a false self that has to put in effort here, that false self
              only needs to be 'crucified' and surrendered to Christ - it need
              not put in effort to gain entry to salvation. The only 'effort'
              (which is a non effort) is to have faith, love God, and submit to
              God.</p>
              <p>I did not think he is literally crucified obviously. I meant
              that he is submitting his being to God, such that he no longer
              feels 'he' is at the center of his life and living his life (the
              crucifixion), but he is being 'lived' by the higher power. Christ
              now 'lives him'.</p>
              <p>1) I must admit I do not claim to understand Christian mysticism
              well enough because I am not a Christian (and therefore I am just
              sharing the extremely limited knowledge that I know and hence
              people would do well by doing their own research).</p>
              <p>But according to Wikipedia,</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_mysticism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_mysticism</a></p>
              <p> <em>Within the broad spectrum of religious groups, it is
              believed that the spirit of man lost its original connection with
              God. The spirit of man longs to find this connection again and to
              intimately experience God. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Christian orthodoxy teaches
              that this connection can only be restored via the blood of Jesus
              Christ through His sacrificial death (Heb 10:19,20), orthodox
              Christian mysticism likewise has always maintained the necessity of
              Christ the One Mediator for a graced experience of God. The depth
              of this experience depends though on the Christian's purification
              and works of love, done through the grace of Jesus Christ, and on
              God's initiative in Christ and His Spirit to reveal Himself in
              special contemplative graces. Christian mysticism finds much
              biblical support for its practices and teachings. Though some forms
              of mysticism might disregard the blood of Jesus, especially those
              influenced by <a title="New Age Spirituality" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age_Spirituality">New Age Spirituality</a>,
              this is not true of the classical Christian mystical tradition,
              whether Catholic, Orthodox or Protestant.</strong></span></em></p>
              <p> As to your 2): Mystics do not reject the Word of God, in
              fact if you read my posted article about Protestant Mystics and
              Catholic Mystics - you'll see that mystics are very informed by
              scripture.</p>
              <p>No, I'm not talking about a god within, but the ground of our
              being that belongs to no one (and thus isn't confined to 'within
              anyone'), but from which springs 'everyone and everything'. If God
              is only 'within me', then that is not God. No mystics talk about a
              God that is 'me based' or 'self centered'.</p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: small;"><span> <span style="color: black;">Adolf Deissmann, in his classic
              treatment of the subject of Paul's mysticism, Paul: A Study in
              Social and Religious History, distinguishes between what he calls
              'union mysticism' and 'communion mysticism'. It is a useful
              distinction. Union mysticism, says Deissmann, involves being
              absorbed into God or discovering divinity in ourselves—the current
              fashion with New Age religion. In the process we lose our
              identities. Communion mysticism, in contrast, involves a
              relationship in which we experience the gracious paradox of 'I, yet
              not I' in our experience of the presence of the risen Christ. Paul
              says in his letter to the Galatians, "<strong>I have been crucified
              with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life
              I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me
              and gave himself for me</strong>" (Galatians 2:20). Paul is saying
              that the old independent 'I', in rebellion against God and out of
              fellowship with him, no longer exists. It received its death
              sentence through identification with Christ on the cross. However,
              in experiencing the presence of the risen Christ in his life,
              through the Spirit, the 'I' of the real Paul, created by God as an
              autonomous individual with God-like qualities, is more alive than
              ever. So we discover our true identity in the context of communion
              with Christ. Because Paul believed and experienced Jesus in
              communion mysticism rather than union mysticism, he was more
              concerned with ethics than ecstasy, a transformed life rather than
              an emotional experience. It is a loving relationship—and
              friendship—which leads to doing the will of the

No mystic will tell you to stop using your reasoning abilities in life, this is not going to a state of pre-rationality (like the realm of babies or animals): but something that is 'trans-rational', in other words, you still continue to use rationality, but you also go one step further... after which you can still fully make use of your intellect as a God-given tool.</p>

God continues to be a mystery in union, just that you let go of your self, and 'Christ lives in you', in other words, you will feel an utter conviction of Christ and you are being 'lived' by Christ.

              <p>You need to define what 'personhood' means first.</p>
              <p>If it is the separate, egoic identity, that feels like it is at the center of life, experiencing and creating and controlling life/things, then that sense of separate self is merely a fabrication of mind, it is not real, and its illusion can be removed through mystical union. If you be still and quiet for a moment, if you search for where this separate egoic self is, it cannot be found simply because it is mere fabrication. The lies perpetuated by this fabricated self is the source of all sins and needs to be 'crucified'. The problems that this fabricated, false, egoic self causes is being described by Father Thomas Keating in my post in bolded text (<a href="/forums/1381/topics/400671?page=4">http://christians.sgforums.com/forums/1381/topics/400671?page=4</a>)</p>
              <p>If however you are refering 'personhood' to the personality or personal conditioning which affects how he behaves and so on, then I do not think that mystical union actually removes that individuated personality. Mystics all have different personalities and continue to do so after 'union'.</p>
              <p>I also do not mean that once you have union, there is no more existence or life - existence still continues, Paul did not say "There is no longer life" or "There is no more existence" or "You are annihilated", he simply said "I no longer live, but Christ lives in me" which in other words means that existence and life continues without the fabricated, false self center. He did not deny 'living' or existence. Just that the false fabricated 'I' is being replaced by the true, 'Christ I'.</p>
              <p>It is just that now he no longer feels like the separate

              <p>Without this false fabricated 'I' in function, life continues to be lived effortlessly, but you clearly see it is not this 'you' who lives, but this higher power who is living and 'creating' and 'powering' your life from moment to moment, like the same energy source (electricity) is powering the different electrical appliances and the TV sets. It is clearly seen that we are all different expressions of the One Source.</p>
              <p>In that same analogy, the electrical appliances (an analogy for all the billions of people here on this planet) by itself has no ability to create life or live Life, it is the Source that creates life, that 'empowers' life, that gives Life to all the various 'expressions'. Without life we are just corpses.</p>

              <p>You need to define what 'personhood' means first.</p>
              <p>If it is the separate, egoic identity, that feels like it is at the center of life, experiencing and creating and controlling life/things, then that sense of separate self is merely a fabrication of mind, it is not real, and its illusion can be removed through mystical union. If you be still and quiet for a moment, if you search for where this separate egoic self is, it cannot be found simply because it is mere fabrication. The lies perpetuated by this fabricated self is the source of all sins and needs to be 'crucified'. The problems that this fabricated, false, egoic self causes is being described by Father Thomas Keating in my post in bolded text (<a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1381/topics/400671?page=4">http://christians.sgforums.com/forums/1381/topics/400671?page=4</a>)</p>
              <p>If however you are refering 'personhood' to the personality or personal conditioning which affects how he behaves and so on, then I do not think that mystical union actually removes that individuated personality. Mystics all have different personalities and continue to do so after 'union'.</p>
              <p>I also do not mean that once you have union, there is no more existence or life - existence still continues, Paul did not say "There is no longer life" or "There is no more existence" or "You are annihilated", he simply said "I no longer live, but Christ lives in me" which in other words means that existence and life continues without the fabricated, false self center. He did not deny 'living' or existence. Just that the false fabricated 'I' is being replaced by the true, 'Christ I'.</p>
              <p>It is just that now he no longer feels like the separate ego controlling or living life, it is no longer "he who lives, but Christ who lives in me" as Paul said.</p>
              <p>Without this false fabricated 'I' in function, life continues to be lived effortlessly, but you clearly see it is not this 'you' who lives, but this higher power who is living and 'creating' and 'powering' your life from moment to moment, like the same energy source (electricity) is powering the different electrical appliances and the TV sets. It is clearly seen that we are all different expressions of the One Source.</p>
              <p>In that same analogy, the electrical appliances (an analogy for all the billions of people here on this planet) by itself has no ability to create life or live Life, it is the Source that creates life, that 'empowers' life, that gives Life to all the various 'expressions'. Without life we are just corpses.</p>
              <p>It is the separate fabricated 'me' that is the source of all doubts.</p>
              <p>Without that false fabricated 'me' that the source of all sins, life continues to flow and function effortlessly by the power of the Source, and there is no longer a single doubts - only pure certainty because there is no longer a sense of division and separation.</p>
              <p>This is a life lived not by the false fabricated self (belonging to the mind which is the source of all doubts), but life lived without a self-center, but by the universal Source.</p>
              <p>It is not that this cannot be explained rationally, but that no rational explanation can be a substitute to the real thing just as explaining the colour 'red' to someone who is blind is not going to be very effective ultimately.</p>
              <p>(1) Because if it is not 'me' who lives and creates and controls life, then it is the universal Source who is living and creating our lives, in every moment. Even this is a mere complication of matters - in direct experience there is no need for reasoning, there is simply that direct experience and deep clear seeing which leaves no doubts.</p>
              <p>(2) If what is described is exactly the same then yes.</p>
              <p>(3) Beliefs are many, even within Christianity and its various denominations, there are many contradictory beliefs. See bolded text by Father Thomas Keating <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1381/topics/400671?page=4">http://christians.sgforums.com/forums/1381/topics/400671?page=4</a></p>
              <p>(4) This is a personal revelation and there can be no doubts about it, but I do not know what you mean by 'truth claim'.</p>
              <p>Acts 17:28 is a perfect example of what I am trying to say.</p>
              <p>You must read the whole sentence in context.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: ArialMT;"><em>Acts 17:28, “<strong>In him</strong> we live and move and have our <strong>being</strong></em></span><span style="font-family: ArialMT;"><em>”.</em></span></p>
              <p>It does not mean there is no more life and existence.</p>
              <p>It means our life and existence is lived by the Source. Life is simply referring to the "being", the "existence" that is naturally there. Nothing I am saying is refering to a nihilistic non-existence. It is only the false self that needs to be crucified, not life, not existence. This is not life-denying at all. It is in fact more life-affirming than anything else, because we see and appreciate our life as the manifestation of the divine Source.</p>
              <p>What is impeding people from this realization of being lived by the Source is that false, fabricated 'I' that Paul has 'crucified'.</p>
              <p>You need to understand what these words refer to, they all refer to different things, and once it is understood you will see no contradictions at all.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13pt; line-height: 16pt;">You are completely misunderstanding what 'union' or 'communion' that I mentioned earlier.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13pt; line-height: 16pt;">It is not that you become God-like. It is not that you become God in person. This becomes an egoic position which is 100% opposite of what true mysticism is about.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">we are talking past each other. you seem to find your place in the abstract and subjective but for me, i think that no amount of language can reconstitute reality and posit another "ultimate reality", for which there is no logical or verifiable basis and cannot comport with reality. in other words, there is no check &amp; balance, it all depends on the individual's experience. In this way, what you're describing lies beyond the realm of truth. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">secondly, if as you wrote, "The lies perpetuated by this fabricated self is the source of all sins and needs to be 'crucified'" - then isn't it contradictory to claim that the "separate, egoic identity" is an illusion because after all, it is a lie that this "fabricated self" of yours had constructed this idea too. In other words, that "fabrication of mind" you claim to be unreal is the very same one that is giving you the illusion that it is an illusion. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">To be sure, if all of it were an illusion and a fabrication of your mind, how could you know it? Could that illusionary mind of yours be fabricating yet another illusion? This concept contradicts the idea that one can have knowledge that it is an illusion, the contradiction renders this concept incoherent and not epistemically defensible. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">About Acts 17:28, in my earlier reply to you, i already posited that  "<em>No evidence of mysticism in the first two words, as demonstrated in </em><a href="http://www.trinityfoundation.org/journal.php?id=198"><em><span style="color: #5d5ebc; text-decoration: none; ">this article</span></em></a><em>."  </em>If you click on that link, the writer explains why the first 2 words of that verse, "in him" or "in Christ" cannot be used mystically. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">When we "have our being", we are still unique and differentiated from God and we do not enter into a "union" with Him of any sorts. </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">As in my earlier post, the 3 verses (Gal 2:20, 2 Peter) do not indicate support for mystic ideas. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Thanks for the sharing, AEN. But i think where rationality doesnt exist, the laws of logic don't apply. for example, if the law of non contradiction doesn't apply, if you claim that "level of existence" (for lack of a better word to suit what you've described) exists, it wouldn't be wrong for me to claim that it doesn't exist too. </span></p>

              <p>No, it is not a lie, it is an experiential insight. Lie means it's false. The notion that a separate self is at the center controlling, living, experiencing, creating life is false because such a 'self' entity simply cannot be found anywhere. Once this is exposed and surrendered to the higher power, there can be no more doubts about this point. This is not an idea, the absence of such separative self is a living experiential truth.</p>

                                                  knowledge that it is an illusion, the
