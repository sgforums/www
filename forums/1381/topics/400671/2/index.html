              <p>yes big bang is a theory and not proven, thats why it is called generally accepted theory in the scientific community. but then u expect me to believe that a divine being created the earth in a mere 6 days?</p>
              <p>you witnessed? where, when, what? do u think i believe your words than the placebo effect appearing in reputable science journals and periodicals.</p>
              <p>next time if there is a miracle healing, pls call up the reporters and tell them to report this in the newspapers. anyone can say anything they want. can you get your miracle healer to cure of cancers, HIV, heart diseases and so forth. if you can do that, then I will believe you.</p>

              <p>it is important to analyse every wording of the bible instead of

              <p>God is really bloodthirsty to kill the firstborn of the
              Egyptians. He did not follow the principle that he has set. He told
              others to show mercy but yet he himself showed no mercy for
              others.</p>

              <p>thus far, you have not shown that you have "analyzed" the bible word for word before posting. from the article that i linked earlier, the answer to your question can be easily found if you had read the bible in context (you read it "word for word", leads you to dubious conclusions as you already have. See the big picture).  Which is the problem with non believers in general, they read the bible to find inconsistencies but end up embarassing themselves because they hadn't read it in context. karma or not, i'll leave it to your own conscience to determine whether this is really a good exercise in building up good karma, because from this side, it certainly doesn't look like good karma. </p>
              <p>once again, read the article because obviously you haven't. The author has addressed why God isn't bloodthirsty. (your karma seems to have reduced again...)</p>
              <p>your follow up question can be addressed by others in this thread... i look forward to discuss about the related problem of evil in the other thread on how evil originated. But i'll leave you with a verse from 1 John 4:8, "<span style="font-family: Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 25px; color: #1a1a1a;">Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love"</span></p>

              <p>Actually, the Buddha did criticize other people's religions. He criticized all the other kinds of beliefs that existed in his days. But he did so skillfully. Not that I wish to criticize anything here, but to cite an example, the Buddha has once said:</p>

                                                      ignorance <br>And he such inequity and injustice create? </span></em></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>However that being said, I do not see any points in criticizing other religions in other religions' forums.</p>
              <p>Even if you want to criticize other people's religions - you need to have the right audience, the right person to listen to. Otherwise what's the point, like why play piano to a cow?</p>
              <p>For example, what is the point of trying to convince a follower? There is no point. Firstly, it is unlikely if he is faithful to his belief that he will be changed by logic since he has already put faith ahead of logic. Secondly, so what if he or she is a Christian? That shouldn't bother non-Christians at all.</p>
              <p>If you're a non-Christian, for example you are an atheist who does not believe in religions, then Christians are just fine - there is no afterlife anyway, so anyone is free to believe/not-believe in anything and that doesn't even matter a bit, so if being Christian makes you happy - fine, go ahead, nothing bad will happen to you anyway.</p>
              <p>If you're a Buddhist, then you'll see that being Christian is also just fine the way it is - it's not like non-Buddhists will definitely go to hell anyway, since they are reborn according to karma.</p>
              <p>Only Christians feel bothered by their own belief that non-believers go to hell. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>My opinion is that, better to put our efforts in promoting what we believe to the right audience - for example, as a Buddhist, I only talk about Buddhism to those who are interested to listen. I do not disparage other religions (for the same reason as why would I want to play piano to a cow?) especially to non-Buddhists.</p>
              <p>Time will be better spent in your own spiritual cultivation (or if you are not spiritual, in doing any other things in life). If you're a Buddhist: time is also better spent promoting the teachings of Buddhism and bringing <strong>potential </strong>people into Buddhism, than putting down the beliefs of others who are already deep into their beliefs. Time is also better spent in trying to promote and strengthen the understanding of Buddhism among so called 'Buddhists', many of whom have little or no understanding at all of dharma and hence are in danger of being converted by evangelists from other religions.</p>
              <p>And who is to say that the other religion is not helping their followers? Their lives could very well be transformed by their religion in a positive way. So let's not discredit that.</p>

              <p>I agree that even if we want to criticize, we must criticize in a mindful, skillful, and respectful manner.</p>
              <p>I do note that at least "angry" or "vengeful" is biblically supported, as the old testament actually said that<em> "The LORD is a jealous and avenging God; the LORD takes vengeance and is filled with wrath. The LORD takes vengeance on his foes and maintains his wrath  against his enemies."</em></p>
              <p>Since Christians themselves recognise that their God at least in the old testament context is jealous, wrathful and vengeful as stated in the bible, I don't think it would be a criticism but simply a stating of biblical facts.</p>

                                                      Ignorance is the instigator of greed and

                                                      Ignorance is the master of ego that corrupts

                              suspicion, the composer of
                                                      dissension, the cultivator of jealousy, and the

              <p>If people are keen in criticizing other religions, they do need an audience. You can't actually go to the parliament, or a church, a christian fellowship, to criticize their faith. Why? Wrong audience. Wrong venue.</p>
              <p>Maybe in online forums there are those who are willing to debate. Then I say that's fine, but I doubt it is going to be very conducive unless the right audience are present.</p>
              <p>If one wants to share and explore truth on an open forum, the openness and willingness must come from both sides.</p>
              <p>If one has already decided to follow a certain faith and is practicing his faith at a rather deep level, how can you expect anything to change his mind?</p>

                              is intricately related to logic too. there's no such as blind faith
                              nor shld the true Christian advocate other believers to "just
                              believe and not question". </p>

                              do so is irresponsible and inhumane. you can criticize the message

If you are a true mystic that goes beyond the realm of concepts, beliefs, blind faith, into true experience, one will start to see a lot of commonalities.</p>

                               1em; padding: 0px;">Their understanding of God as the formless Ground of Being that underlies and gives rise to all existence and forms through direct experience and realization can be found in all contemplative parts of any religion. They will also not feel separate from God, they will feel their egoic self dissolve and surrender into the higher power, and being lived by that higher power. (e.g.  <em>"I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer

                               1em; padding: 0px;">However they fall short of total liberation from suffering and rebirth. They do not overcome views of being or non-being, they fail to grasp the principle of dependent origination, no-self, emptiness, etc and continue to reify an ultimate substance or an ultimate source.</p>

                               1em; padding: 0px;">However we recognize that other religions may teach partial truths but not get the whole picture, and they may at most lead their followers to a very high state of rebirth. However higher states of rebirth, even the heavens in the desire realm, the form realm, and the formless realms... are temporary (even though extremely long lasting), subject to birth and death.</p>

                               1em; padding: 0px;">Even if a Christian have no idea about things like 'Ground of Being', and their understanding of God is still personal and dualistic (as a person separate from him and his life), they may still cultivate wholesome qualities and virtues and attain a higher state of rebirth.</p>

Buddhism is certainly less exclusive than some religions (like, believe this or you're going to hell, etc).</p>

                               1em; padding: 0px;">Yes. During Buddha's lifetime he asked his monks to go out in different directions to spread the teachings. The means may be different though. But I am in fact sad that the 'proselytizing' of today cannot be compared to the Buddha's times, when his monks were actively going out and teaching others. Many monks today prefer to stay in their own monastery. Though my Master actually did walk throughout Taiwan in a period of six years to teach and meet new people.</p>

                              our minds. If you use reason to make persuasive arguments, i'm sure
                              some will be convinced if not persuaded. God made us in His image
                              and as such we all have the capacity to rationalize and think.

              <p>From my observation, there are such people, but not so often.</p>
              <p>For example, my Buddhist Master used to be a Christian pastor who actively preached and even wrote a book about the bible, but he eventually converted to become a monk after reading about the Buddhist teachings (there is a rather interesting history behind it).</p>
              <p>I have also ever heard of a Buddhist nun who converted into Christianity, can't remember why though.</p>
              <p>Most of the time, what I see is that people who convert have little understanding and faith about their own belief in the first place.</p>
              <p>My question to you is, do you see much 'changing of minds' in those who are 'deep into their beliefs' going on in sgForums lately?</p>
              <p>Of course I do encouarge open mindness and not following blind faith  - since the Buddha have always encouraged such an attitude with the following teaching,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"So, as I said, Kalamas: 'Don't go by reports, by legends, by

              <p>Hi Rooney9, </p>
              <p>I do not mean seeing God literally. I meant seeing God in a perspective of Him changing my life. </p>
              <p>You can't believe anything with just me talking. I doubt bombardment of bible verses will not help too. </p>
              <p>I believed after I experience God's love and healing. Yours may be different. </p>
              <p>God bless. :)</p>

              <p>does healing work on every christians? it seems not. if you read the obituaries in straits times, you will wonder why it does not. some are just too young to die. i will not hesitate to be christian if healing works on every christian.</p>
