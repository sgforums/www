              <p>miracles healing should perform in the hospital instead of on stage if it is true because all the real patients are in hospital, certified by the doctors that they are really disabled. invite non christians to witness the healing perform on the patients selected by non christians, that will be more convincing.</p>

              <p>yes big bang is a theory and not proven, thats why it is called

              mere 6 days?</p>
              <p>you witnessed? where, when, what? do u think i believe your
              words than the placebo effect appearing in reputable science
              journals and periodicals.</p>
              <p>next time if there is a miracle healing, pls call up the
              reporters and tell them to report this in the newspapers. anyone
              can say anything they want. can you get your miracle healer to cure
              of cancers, HIV, heart diseases and so forth. if you can do that,

              <p>Because when i was a buddhist I everyday break precepts many times. I lied and gossiped and other offense. Then when ppl invited me to church and introduced the sinful nature of human, I agreed instantly because I break precepts everyday.</p>

              <p>Its no harm understanding what it's about, so you will be able to understand thier point of view. So you will know where there is a clash in "truths".</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"> <span style="font-family: Tahoma, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;">Wrong. It
              is not a biblical fact. This is the problem when verses are taken out of
              context by non believers (intentional or otherwise).</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">In the
              same chapter, if you read further on, it also says that “the LORD is slow to
              anger and great in power and the Lord will by no means clear the guilty” and
              later, “he Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; he knows those who
              take refuge in him.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">Why do
              people tend to quote mine the scriptures for verses that will support their
              case (actually none) when they don’t want to acknowledge the other verses that
              declare God is also loving, righteous and just? You know these people are
              cherry picking when they deliberately quote verses out of context and deride
              the Christian God (as this thread has shown). Strangely enough, I’ve yet to
              come across a non believer who will highlight the verses in Scriptures that
              describe a loving God and use the example of Christ’s atonement to praise Him
              for His love and mercies. Actually not true also. In this case after they do,
              they usually come to faith. Haha…</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">So if one
              wants to affirm the truth of one verse, one has to affirm the truth of the
              other verses found in the other parts too. Especially if they’re talking about
              the same thing. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">Secondly,
              the OT was written in biblical Hebrew, not English. It’s easy to use our modern
              mindset to interpret it, and the word, ‘vengeance” has very negative
              connotations for us (immorality, cruelty, arbitratriness). However, in the OT,
              the concept of vengeance has a positive connotation, and has to do with
              lawfuness, justice and salvation. Most of the time when it’s used in other
              texts during that time, very few instances is the term used of blood vengeance
              on the part of an individual. Most of the time it refers to judgment of a group
              or God to defend one of its/his own. In all cases, the use of vengeful to
              describe God is wrong.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">Similarly,
              the idea of wrath/anger is often misinterpreted in the same spirit. While human
              wrath is destructive, the wrath of God refers to the moral outrage at true
              atrocity. Not a level that is easily reached like a hissy fit, as seen that God
              is ‘slow to anger’, but wrath is often used biblically as “the vigorous and
              welfare-motivated intervention by the Royal God, in breaking oppression and
              delivering His "dependents", by forceful removal of the habitually
              and aggressively treacherous from their lives, and by a re-structured reality,
              characterized by blessing and peace for the good.” As in the earlier example of
              the Israelites living in misery in Egypt, under the slave drivers and poor work
              conditions, God rescued them from the hands of the Egyptians to bring them to a
              better place.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">To be
              sure, to claim that God is ‘angry’ or ‘vengeful’ by drawing inferences from
              verses randomly without a biblical context and understanding demonstrates a
              misrepresentation of the Christian God and Christianity.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;"> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #333333;">If people are keen in criticizing other religions, they do need an audience. You can't actually go to the parliament, or a church, a christian fellowship, to criticize their faith. Why? Wrong audience. Wrong venue.</span></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">We might
              be understanding ‘criticizing’ differently, I understand it to be more of an
              evaluation, as in “criticizing an essay”. In that sense, one evaluates the pros
              and cons for the benefit of himself, not others, hence no audience required.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: ArialMT; color: #262626;"><em>If one has already decided to follow a certain faith and is

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">Through
              logic and reasoning. Some non theists in this forum claim to employ their
              faculties to perform these functions but don’t seem consistent. For example,
              the late Antony Flew “followed the evidence” to move from atheism to deism. To
              be closed off to all sound use of logic and reasoning and remain in one’s
              faulty beliefs indicates that one is close minded or fundamentalist at best.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;"><em> For
              example, can you claim to understand completely how God works or his plans for

              Him, right?</em></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">We differ

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">Because
              logic as described as “the principles of correct thinking” helps a person to
              develop a worldview and life view as well as in the pursuit of truth. Since God
              is truth, it follows that the use of logic is not divorced from faith in
              understanding God and to please Him. Biblical faith isn’t blind or mystical but
              requires knowledge. The Greek word of pistis means the result of being
              persuaded to believe something is true, even if it hasn’t happened yet or
              cannot see. Persuasion here is intricately related to the use of logic. </span></p>

              one will start to see a lot of commonalities</em></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">.</span></p>

              disagree. Truth is exclusive by definition. I’m sure there are common grounds
              but commonality doesn’t negate the exclusivity of truth. Fundamentals are the
              same because God has revealed Himself in the general creation but the
              conclusions reached are different. If I affirm the truth that Christ said He is
              the only way to God, by definition, I must exclude all other claims to God.
              Doesn’t sound politically correct but at least it’s intellectually honest. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">Then
              again, I’m not into blind faith and mysticism. I think the idea of promoting
              blind faith has done plenty of damage to Christian believers. The verses
              Christian mystics use tend to be misquoted or without a prior understanding of
              scriptures. Personal take is that most of the time, the mystic side of
              Christianity tends to confuse and confound with the use of flowery words to
              describe a subjective experiential event. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">We differ
              on this. Christianity affirms the existence of an “ultimate substance’ – truth.

              <p>Irregardless I feel that An Eternal Now is just sharing certain
              aspects of Buddhism under the context in this particular
              thread.</p>
              <p>Its no harm understanding what it's about, so you will be able
              to understand thier point of view. So you will know where there is
              a clash in "truths".</p>
              <p>To opinionate, discuss, refute or rebutt something , you must
              truly understanding what it is about first. Its like how one has to
              understand the law... to break the law. LOL!</p>
              <p>Thats how I feel at least.</p>
              <p>But of course there is a limit to where information begins and
              conversion ends.</p>

              <p><br>Faith?  Yes, one needs to have faith where healing is concerned.    Don't forget that God's will supersedes faith.  Even if one has the faith to be healed and unfortunately it is not within God's will he be healed, ultimately he will not be healed.</p>
              <p>Problem is generally christians always think that 1 + 1 = 2 and this is not always true where God is concerned.      Everything is God in Christianity.  Even God chooses to favour Israel, nobody dare to oppose Him.   </p>
