              <p>this is not my beliefs this is a fact. alot of our myths from our ancestors or ancient people were the result of the things they could not understand, because science were non existent them. they could not believe the earth was round instead of square, because in their minds, how could anyone live on a round surface.</p>
              <p>but its ok if you were reject this, as I know you will surely adhere to your beliefs anyhow. at least you do not resort to desperate measures like name calling unlike some here. maybe its early days yet. you may resort to name callings later.</p>

              <p>so called faith or miracle healing is not so miracle after all, it is placebo effect.</p>
              <p>as for how the earth was formed, science did explained. go google or wiki for it.</p>
              <p>u seriously you cant expect me to believe earth was formed in a mere 6 days by a divine being, come on.</p>
