              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>By all means use logic, but in the act of surrendering to God, you aren't analysing God, because if you are then the submission cannot be total because in total submission you are also submitting your own opinions, and not only that but your entire being, to Him. Not saying that there is no time and place for logic. There is a time and place for everything, including using logic, reading bible, reasoning, debating, etc. But logic can never totally grasp God, as you have said you don't and can't perfectly understand God's work. One can never hope to understand God through our limited human minds no matter how many times you read bible or how skilled you are in seeing logic - just like it is impossible to encapsulate the vastness of the universe into a single sentence - not saying that there is no merits in reading bible as it can serve as a 'pointer' to God.</p>
              <p>Of course, you as a person are not God. Your clinging to this separate self identity is the so called barrier with God. As you rightly said, <em>We are not meant to “share” in God’s substance and personhood.</em> The 'person' can never 'share' or 'know' God's substance. To 'experience' God, there is no room for your 'personhood'. That is why you have to 'surrender' your personhood to God until you feel that you no longer live, but God lives.</p>
              <p>"I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me" (Gal 2:20)</p>
              <p>This has nothing to do with New Age. Anyway, Christian Mysticism existed since the early days and is nothing close to being a modern invention. In fact the tradition of Christian Mysticism is as old as Christianity itself: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_mysticism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_mysticism</a></p>
              <p>The Mystic "know" this when <em><strong>'personal'</strong></em> experience has ceased.</p>
              <p>God lives and knows and takes over your life.</p>
              <p>All other mode of understanding is the understanding through your own egoic self, the personal, mental, conceptual perspective of God. It is not true understanding. Personal understandings are many and often contradictory (but none can ever grasp God), but God is One.</p>
              <p>None of those concepts can grasp God. In the realm of concepts there is always room for doubts, misunderstandings, self-contradictions, contradictions with others, etc etc. It is not true knowing, but more like personal 'belief'.</p>
              <p>True experience arise only when you simply surrender your entire being to God, be lived by God. <strong>In this union there is no room for doubts at all, only utter conviction.</strong></p>
              <p>True knowing arise when you no longer feel like a person separate from God. Because there is no more 'a person'. It is not a personal knowing and seeing, as Thomas Merton says,</p>
              <p>(<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com.sg/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;ct=res&amp;amp;cd=11&amp;amp;ved=0CBMQFjAAOAo&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.escapefromwatchtower.com%2Fmysticism.html&amp;amp;ei=6s4ETK2pNsHGrAfPi-ndAg&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHQZyWuwfd54vfdLurUz7qzTBqRrQ&amp;amp;sig2=uGtl0qyw9gzw5ZInQS1drw"><em><em>Mysticism</em></em></a>)</p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;">In the Christian tradition, then, we find this personal transcendence referred to as "having the mind of Christ" or knowing and seeing "in the Spirit of Christ." Spirit here being strictly personal, not just a vague reference to a certain inner emotional climate. This Spirit, who "fathoms everything even the abyss of God" and "understands the thoughts of God" as man understands his own heart, is "given us" in Christ as a transcendent superconsciousness of God and of "the Father" (see 1 Cor. 2, Romans 8, etc.)</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;">More specifically, all transcendent experience is for the Christian participation in "the mind of Christ" - "Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus . .</span></em> <em><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;">who emptied himself</span> <span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;">. . . obedient onto death . . Therefore God raised him and conferred upon him a name above all names." (Phil. 2:5-10) This dynamic of emptying and of transcendence accurately defines the transformation of the Christian consciousness in Christ. It is a kenotic transformation, an emptying of all the contents of the ego-consciousness to become a void in which the light of God or the glory of God, the full radiation of the infinite reality of His Being and Love are manifested.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;">Eckhart says in perfectly orthodox and traditional Christian terms, "In giving us His love God has given us His Holy Ghost so that we can love Him with the love wherewith He loves Himself. We love God with His own love; awareness of it deifies us." D.T. Suzuki quotes this with approval, comparing it with the</span></em> <em><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;">Prajna</span> <span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;">wisdom of Zen. (Suzuki,</span></em> <em><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;">Mysticism; East and West.</span> <span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;">p. 40)</span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Furthermore, medieval Christian mystic Meister Eckhart wrote:</p>
              <p><em>The eye with which I see God is the same with which God sees me. My eye and God's eye is one eye, and one sight, and one knowledge, and one love.</em></p>
              <p>In Buddhism, which differs from all other religions in the aspect that we do not posit an ontological substance. There is an Ultimate Truth, but this Truth does not refer to an inherently existing/independent essence but to a non-substantial unity of interconnectivity. In other words that Truth is present and cannot be denied, but it is not reified through understanding the interconnectivity and non-substantiality of everything.</p>
              <p>On first sight this seems to contradict the other religions including the mystics and contemplatives from other religions that I mentioned above. But it is simply a refining of views, it is still refering to the same experience. The luminous presence (which is given many names like God, etc) that is the source of all existence is not denied, it is rather a deepening of insight to include the non-dual, groundlessness and interconnectedness of the luminous essence. To understand more about what I'm saying you have to read about what <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.heartofnow.com/files/emptiness.html">'Emptiness'</a> means in Buddhist context. I hope I am not adding more confusion and complication, as this is not easy to understand and is one of the deeper and most profound teachings of Buddhism. However this is the difference between Buddhism and other religions or contemplative traditions.</p>

              <p>I’ve begun work on a lesson plan for a
               course on “the Protestant Mystics” that I will be offering at the First
               Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) Atlanta this spring (details as 
              to date and time, etc. still have to be worked out, but as soon as I 
              know the particulars I’ll post them here). For my research, I’m using an
               old, out of print anthology edited by Anne Fremantle, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000CM9AM/earthmystic">The
               Protestant Mystics</a>. The book features a wonderful introduction by 
              W. H. Auden, which I’ve quoted from on this blog several times over the 
              last few days. Fremantle and Auden set out to do this book because they 
              wanted to prove W. T. Stace wrong — Stace being a Protestant philosopher
               who said, “There are <em>no</em> Protestant mystics.” The anthology 
              includes a wide variety of voices, from Jacob Boehme to George Herbert, 
              George Fox to Thomas Traherne, William Law to Jonathan Edwards, John 
              Wesley to George MacDonald, Rufus Jones to T. S. Eliot, and so forth. 
              And while the authors seem to be more comfortable with heterodox mystics
               than I am (Emmanuel Swedenborg and Ralph Waldo Emerson are among the 
              other-than-orthodox figures represented), all in all it’s a wonderful 
              anthology and a clear refutation of Dr. Stace’s arrogance.</p>
              <p>But why would someone as eminent as Stace make such a sweeping 
              generalization? In his defense, probably most of the so-called 
              Protestant mystics would, themselves, be uncomfortable with the 
              designation. C. S. Lewis is included in the anthology, and he explicitly
               disclaimed himself as a mystic (see his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0156027666/earthmystic">Letters
               to Malcolm</a>). I suspect that Lewis would hardly be alone. For 
              Protestants, mysticism long was tainted by the perception that it arose 
              not from devotion to Christ, but rather from Catholic excess.</p>
              <p>In his wonderful book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0826428436/earthmystic">Beloved
               Dust</a>, Robert Davis Hughes offers a historical survey of the history
               of Christian spirituality, and suggests that, in the wake of the 
              Reformation, Protestants and Catholics alike began to view mysticism 
              with suspicion, seeing its claim to direct experiential union with God 
              as an affront to the good order of church authority as established by 
              God. Ironically, for Protestants the claims of mysticism were rejected 
              because it was too Catholic; for Catholics the same rejection implied 
              that mystical experience was too Protestant! Since to a large extent the
               Protestant / Catholic divide is an argument over authority, mysticism 
              with its experiential, but liminal, claim to personal authority directly
               given by God would be perceived as dangerous by both parties. Mysticism
               did not just go away, of course, but Catholics and Protestants 
              successfully marginalized mysticism in different ways. In the Catholic 
              world, mysticism became increasingly associated with persons who had 
              little or no ecclesiastical power: gone were the days when great 
              theologians or bishops like Augustine, Richard of St. Victor, Nicholas 
              of Cusa or Meister Eckhart were also the greatest mystics. In 
              post-reformation Catholicism, mysticism increasingly became associated 
              with women, and typically obscure women in religious life: Rose of Lima,
               Marie of the Incarnation, Thérèse of Lisieux, Faustina Kowalska, Emma 
              Gelgani, and so forth. Meanwhile, Marian apparitions at places like 
              Lourdes and Fatima became the province of children. Mysticism could 
              survive in Catholicism as an essentially non-threatening private 
              devotion, charming and pious but ultimately having little real impact to
               the larger church. Indeed, the “messages” promulgated by these 
              latter-day Catholic mystics all seem to be variations on a single theme:
               pray the rosary and obey the church. And it seems that when a Catholic 
              mystic does come along with a more transformational or visionary 
              message, he (or she) is soon marginalized by the church: think of 
              Teilhard de Chardin, Thomas Merton, or even Thomas Keating in our own 
              time.</p>
              <p>On the Protestant side, mysticism retained more influence, but only 
              by divesting itself of the name. Protestant mystics simply never were 
              called mystics, by either their supporters or their detractors. This, 
              Auden brilliantly explicates, has to do with the fact that Protestantism
               represented a fundamental break in the tradition: the Protestant 
              “mystics” did not have access to the same contemplative culture that 
              their Catholic brothers and sisters enjoyed. Thus, a young woman like 
              Thérèse of Lisieux could write a theologically nuanced book (and win a 
              designation as a doctor of the church) because she was immersed in the 
              living contemplative tradition not only of the Carmelite Order but of 
              Catholicism as a whole. Protestants, meanwhile, had only one reference 
              point for their experiential spirituality: the Bible. Thus, Protestant 
              mysticism tends to be scripturally informed in a manner that has not 
              been seen among Catholic visionaries since probably the time of the 
              church fathers (I do not mean to suggest that Biblical resonance is 
              absent from Catholic mystics. But figures like Julian of Norwich or John
               Ruusbroec derived their Biblical knowledge through the Divine Office 
              rather than through the culture of personal Bible study as promulgated 
              in the Reformed world, and their mysticism was as richly informed by the
               writings of the saints as by scripture).</p>
              <p>So this, then, is the defining mark of a Protestant mystic: an 
              experiential and direct knowledge/relationship with God, informed almost
               exclusively by scripture, and completely unconcerned to label itself as
               “mystical” or “contemplative.” After all, the words <em>mysticism</em> and <em>contemplation</em> (<em>theoria</em>) are of pagan rather than 
              New Testament origin. Does this, then, render the concepts of mysticism 
              and contemplation obsolete or unnecessary? I don’t think so. If nothing 
              else, they are markers that invite us to acknowledge the depth and 
              transforming power of the spirituality that figures like John Wesley or 
              Jonathan Edwards experienced. One could almost argue that the tradition 
              of Protestant mysticism, even among the great theologians like Wesley 
              and Edwards, falls under what Merton called “masked contemplation” — the
               experience of ordinary Christian men and women who seek to live a holy 
              and transformed life in Christ, but who don’t engage in any particular 
              method or technique of prayer and who lack any sort of 
              self-consciousness regarding their spiritual life. To me, this kind of 
              masked contemplation sounds healthy in its very humility and hiddenness.
               Perhaps we who fancy ourselves as contemplatives would do well to 
              follow their obscure example.</p>

              <p>By all means use logic, but in the act of surrendering to God,
              you aren't analysing God, because if you are then the submission
              cannot be total because in total submission you are also submitting
              your own opinions, and not only that but your entire being, to Him.
              Not saying that there is no time and place for logic. There is a
              time and place for everything, including using logic, reading
              bible, reasoning, debating, etc. But logic can never totally grasp
              God, as you have said you don't and can't perfectly understand
              God's work. One can never hope to understand God through our
              limited human minds no matter how many times you read bible or how
              skilled you are in seeing logic - just like it is impossible to
              encapsulate the vastness of the universe into a single sentence -
              not saying that there is no merits in reading bible as it can serve
              as a 'pointer' to God.</p>
              <p>Of course, you as a person are not God. Your clinging to this
              separate self identity is the so called barrier with God. As you
              rightly said, <em>We are not meant to “share” in God’s substance
              and personhood.</em> The 'person' can never 'share' or 'know' God's
              substance. To 'experience' God, there is no room for your
              'personhood'. That is why you have to 'surrender' your personhood
              to Christ until you feel that you no longer live, but Christ
              lives.</p>
              <p>"I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who
              live, but Christ who lives in me" (Gal 2:20)</p>
              <p>This has nothing to do with New Age. Anyway, Christian Mysticism
              existed since the early days and is nothing close to being a modern
              invention. In fact the tradition of Christian Mysticism is as old
              as Christianity itself: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_mysticism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_mysticism</a></p>
              <p>and</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://frimmin.com/faith/mysticismintro.php">http://frimmin.com/faith/mysticismintro.php</a></p>
              <p>The Mystic "know" this when <em><strong>'personal'</strong></em> experience has ceased.</p>
              <p>God lives and knows and takes over your life.</p>
              <p>All other mode of understanding is the understanding through
              your own egoic self, the personal, mental, conceptual perspective
              of God. It is not true understanding. Personal understandings are
              many and often contradictory (but none can ever grasp God), but God
              is One.</p>
              <p>None of those concepts can grasp God. In the realm of concepts
              there is always room for doubts, misunderstandings,
              self-contradictions, contradictions with others, etc etc. It is not
              true knowing, but more like personal 'belief'.</p>
              <p>True experience arise only when you simply surrender your entire
              being to God, be lived by God. <strong>In this union there is no
              room for doubts at all, only utter conviction.</strong></p>
              <p>True knowing arise when you no longer feel like a person
              separate from God. Because there is no more 'a person'. It is not a
              personal knowing and seeing, as Thomas Merton says,</p>

              "having the mind of Christ" or knowing and seeing "in the Spirit of
              Christ." Spirit here being strictly personal, not just a vague
              reference to a certain inner emotional climate. This Spirit, who
              "fathoms everything even the abyss of God" and "understands the
              thoughts of God" as man understands his own heart, is "given us" in
              Christ as a transcendent superconsciousness of God and of "the
              Father" (see 1 Cor. 2, Romans 8, etc.)</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua; font-size: normal;">More specifically,
              all transcendent experience is for the Christian participation in
              "the mind of Christ" - "Let this mind be in you which was also in
              Christ Jesus . .</span></em> <em><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua; font-size: normal;">who emptied
              himself</span> <span style="font-family: Book Antiqua; font-size: normal;">. . . obedient onto
              death . . Therefore God raised him and conferred upon him a name
              above all names." (Phil. 2:5-10) This dynamic of emptying and of
              transcendence accurately defines the transformation of the
              Christian consciousness in Christ. It is a kenotic transformation,
              an emptying of all the contents of the ego-consciousness to become
              a void in which the light of God or the glory of God, the full
              radiation of the infinite reality of His Being and Love are
              manifested.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua; font-size: normal;">Eckhart says in
              perfectly orthodox and traditional Christian terms, "In giving us
              His love God has given us His Holy Ghost so that we can love Him
              with the love wherewith He loves Himself. We love God with His own
              love; awareness of it deifies us." D.T. Suzuki quotes this with
              approval, comparing it with the</span></em> <em><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua; font-size: normal;">Prajna</span> <span style="font-family: Book Antiqua; font-size: normal;">wisdom
              of Zen. (Suzuki,</span></em> <em><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua; font-size: normal;">Mysticism; East and
              West.</span> <span style="font-family: Book Antiqua; font-size: normal;">p.
              40)</span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Furthermore, medieval Christian mystic Meister Eckhart
              wrote:</p>
              <p><em>The eye with which I see God is the same with which God sees
              me. My eye and God's eye is one eye, and one sight, and one
              knowledge, and one love.</em></p>
              <p>In Buddhism, which differs from all other religions in the
              aspect that we do not posit an ontological substance. There is an
              Ultimate Truth, but this Truth does not refer to an inherently
              existing/independent essence but to a non-substantial unity of
              interconnectivity. In other words that Truth is present and cannot
              be denied, but it is not reified through understanding the
              interconnectivity and non-substantiality of everything.</p>
              <p>On first sight this seems to contradict the other religions
              including the mystics and contemplatives from other religions that
              I mentioned above. But it is simply a refining of views, it is
              still refering to the same experience. The luminous presence (which
              is given many names like God, etc) that is the source of all
              existence is not denied, it is rather a deepening of insight to
              include the non-dual, groundlessness and interconnectedness of the
              luminous essence. To understand more about what I'm saying you have
              to read about what <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.heartofnow.com/files/emptiness.html">'Emptiness'</a> means in Buddhist context. I hope I am
              not adding more confusion and complication, as this is not easy to
              understand and is one of the deeper and most profound teachings of
              Buddhism. However this is the difference between Buddhism and other
              religions or contemplative traditions.</p>

              <p>Christians are not meant to be able to "perfectly understand" (if ever such a state is possible) God's work but He gives us enough revelation through His Word, and the use of faith and our reasoning abilities. Faith and reason work hand in hand to enable us to understand (not perfectly) God's work, the rest belong to God's hidden knowledge (Deut 29:29, "secret things belong to the LORD our God"). Not everything that is true of God has been revealed. That there are secret things anticipates the need to trust, obey and be humble before God. Any practice that tries to / encourages the acquiring of these secret things, e.g. knowledge, experience, doesn't recognize that these things "belong" to God and no other, thus ignoring the Creator-creature distinction. </p>

Your clinging to this separate self identity is the so called barrier with God. As you rightly said, <em style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;">We are not meant to “share” in God’s substance and personhood.</em> The 'person' can never 'share' or 'know' God's substance. To 'experience' God, there is no room for your 'personhood'. That is why you have to 'surrender' your personhood to Christ until you feel that you no longer live, but Christ lives.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">The
              verse (Gal 2:20) you keep citing never supports your view. Taken out of its
              context and viewed as a single verse, it does look like its consistent with
              your ideas. But if you just look a little earlier, Paul writes, “<strong>I have been
              crucified with Christ</strong></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">.
              It is no longer I that live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life that I
              now live, I live by faith in the son of God…” Do you think he means to
              literally claim that he was on the cross with Jesus as He was being crucified?
              If he has been crucified already, can he be writing this? I think not. Remember
              what I wrote earlier about understanding the context of the verse first before
              using it? It shld be obvious that he was using descriptive language – figures
              of speech and not literal statements.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">Christian
              mysticism has existed and still does in various forms throughout Christendom,
              levels of expression varying. However, I contend that it cannot be validly
              supported by sound exegesis of scriptures, and at its very core contradicts the
              gospel. Orthodox Christianity rejects it. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">Among many
              reasons why even I would reject mysticism as true Christian is that it
              contradicts <strong>several</strong></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;"> Christian beliefs. At its very least, it seeks to repeat what Eve was
              trying to do in Genesis 3, “to be like God.” At its very best, it is extreme
              subjectivism. It falsely equates religious emotionalism with Christian
              spirituality. Remember those twin tenets of all forms of mysticism: 1) The
              seeking out of a direct experience of God, without any mediator; 2) The setting
              up of the individual's subjective experience as the sole arbiter of religious
              truth. The mystic devises his theology on the basis of his subjective religious
              experiences; whereas the personal spiritual experiences of the true believer
              arise out of the knowledge of God which he receives through the objective
              written Word of God. Theology determines experience. Not the other way round.
              Expanding on (1), if there was a way to God without the need for mediator,
              there would be no need for Jesus Christ to act as one, thereby contradicting
              the core essence of Christianity.</span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">Mysticism
              pretends to be selfless but is in fact heavy on self-centredness. It’s very
              “me” based. GK Chesterton puts it this way, “'If I were to say that
              Christianity came into the world specially to destroy the doctrine of the Inner
              Light, that would be an exaggeration. But it would be very much nearer to the
              truth... Of all conceivable forms of enlightenment the worst is what these
              people call the Inner Light. <strong>Of all horrible religions the most horrible is
              the worship of the god within</strong></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">. Any one who knows any body knows how it would work;
              anyone who knows anyone from the Higher Thought Centre knows how it does work.
              That Jones shall worship the god within him turns out ultimately to mean that
              Jones shall worship Jones... Christianity came into the world firstly in order
              to assert with violence that a man had not only to look inwards, but to look
              outwards, to behold with astonishment and enthusiasm a divine company and a
              divine captain. The only fun of being a Christian was that a man was not left
              alone with the Inner Light, but definitely recognized an outer light, fair as
              the sun, clear as the moon, terrible as an army with banners'. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;"> The
              apostle Paul in his letters keep emphasizing the importance of the other people
              (e.g. 1 Corinthians). Jesus himself taught it as the second greatest
              commandment in Matt 22:39, “You shall love your neighbour as yourself.” Jesus
              Himself exemplified it when He put our welfare first and died in our place for
              our sins. True Christians are others-centred, but to seek a subjective
              self-edifying experience runs contradictory to the spirit of Christianity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">Thus
              mysticism has no place or value in true Christianity, it disguises itself as
              that but is easily exposed. While I’m referring to mysticism here specifically,
              by extrapolation, I also mean the other practices of religion that espouses the
              same virtues as mysticism. No offence to other religions, but as a worldview,
              Christianity comports with reality by accounting for origins, meaning, morality
              and destiny.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma;">Robert
              Dabney has rightly pointed out, the Christian believer, after he or she has
              been indwelt by the Holy Spirit, is 'still a separate person, a responsible
              free agent, and a man, not a God. The idea of a personal or substantial union
              would imply the deification of man, which is profane and unmeaning'</span></p>

                                          God's hidden knowledge (Deut 29:29, "secret things belong to the
                                          LORD our God"). Not everything that is true of God has been
                                          revealed. That there are secret things anticipates the need to
                                          trust, obey and be humble before God. Any practice that tries to /

              <p>No problem with what you said here, of course, being Christian you have to study His Word and use your reasoning abilities. No mystic will tell you to stop using your reasoning abilities in life, this is not going to a state of pre-rationality (like the realm of babies or animals): but something that is 'trans-rational', in other words, you still continue to use rationality, but you also go one step further... after which you can still fully make use of your intellect as a God-given tool.</p>
              <p>I did not say that through mystical union you will discover God's plan and secrets, etc. This is not what I mean. <strong>I do not mean you can 'access God's personhood'.</strong> No creature can do that. God continues to be a mystery in union, just that you let go of your self, and 'Christ lives in you', in other words, you will feel an utter conviction of Christ and you are being 'lived' by Christ. You may not know 'how' Christ will live you, <strong>but you have no doubts that you are lived by God and there is no more 'you' at the center of your life.</strong> You may not know where God's will is going to lead you, but nevertheless you have submitted to God's will (like 'Thy will be done'                         (<em>Matt. 26:42</em>)). You will have no doubts about it when you experience it (of course, 'you experience' is just a figure of speech because by then it is no longer 'you' who lives). It is obviously not 'you' as a false self that has to put in effort here, that false self only needs to be 'crucified' and surrendered to Christ - it need not put in effort to gain entry to salvation. The only 'effort' (which is a non effort) is to have faith, love God, and submit to God.</p>

                                          experience of God. The depth of this experience depends though on the

              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Mysticism pretends to be
                                          selfless but is in fact heavy on self-centredness. It’s very “me”
                                          based. GK Chesterton puts it this way, “'If I were to say that
                                          Christianity came into the world specially to destroy the doctrine
                                          of the Inner Light, that would be an exaggeration. But it would be
                                          very much nearer to the truth... Of all conceivable forms of
                                          enlightenment the worst is what these people call the Inner Light.
                                          <strong>Of all horrible religions the most horrible is the worship
                                          of the god within</strong></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">. Any one who knows any
                                          body knows how it would work; anyone who knows anyone from the
                                          Higher Thought Centre knows how it does work. That Jones shall
                                          worship the god within him turns out ultimately to mean that Jones
                                          shall worship Jones... Christianity came into the world firstly in
                                          order to assert with violence that a man had not only to look
                                          inwards, but to look outwards, to behold with astonishment and
                                          enthusiasm a divine company and a divine captain. The only fun of
                                          being a Christian was that a man was not left alone with the Inner
                                          Light, but definitely recognized an outer light, fair as the sun,
                                          clear as the moon, terrible as an army with banners'.</span></p>

              <p>No, I'm not talking about a god within, but the ground of our being that belongs to no one (and thus isn't confined to 'within anyone'), but from which springs 'everyone and everything'.

                                          distinction. 
                                                    Union mysticism, says Deissmann, involves being absorbed into

                                                    discovering divinity in ourselves—the 
                                                    current fashion with New Age religion. In the process we lose 
                                          our identities. 
                                                    Communion mysticism, in contrast, involves a relationship in 
                                          which we 
                                                    experience the gracious paradox of 'I, yet not I' in our

                                                    of the presence of the risen Christ. Paul says in his letter

                                          Paul 
                                                    is saying that the old independent 'I', in rebellion against

                                                    experiencing the presence of the risen Christ in his life, 
                                          through the 
                                                    Spirit, the 'I' of the real Paul, created by God as an

                                                    with God-like qualities, is 
                                                    more alive than ever. So we discover our true identity in the 
                                          context 
                                                    of communion with Christ. Because Paul believed and

                                          more concerned 
                                                    with ethics than ecstasy, a transformed life rather than an

              <p><br>Pepper, since you are new, it would be good to explore and find out about other religions as well.   I did not find out more about Christianity and simply jumped into it and was brainwashed.  It was much later then I realised that there are too many contradictions in the teaching and promises.    </p>
              <p>I hope you will use your intellect to understand and not just merely follow blindly to comply to not use intellect to understand God.   This is a major mistake which I made in the past.   It is easy prey on human beings to not use intellect so that they can go on to brainwash and people just accept whatever that come along.   </p>

              <p>I have found that most people on the net have very skewed and badly informed views about what Christian Mysticism is about. Not to blame them because Christian Mysticism is not a subject that most people focus on.</p>
              <p>But if you want to find out what Christian Mysticism is about, find a proper unbiased book by someone who is truly informed - i.e. a good source.</p>
