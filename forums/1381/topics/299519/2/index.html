            <div class='col-md body'>Not only that my physical body is pain due to the abortion, my heart is also very painful. Juz when i'm down and am in need of his love and support at this time, the mother's son of a bi<strong></strong>tch aborted me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Why does this have to happen to me?<br><br>My mother re-married to a man whom is a Christian. And she has since baptised and is now a Christian too. She invite me to live with her so that i could continue to enjoy the home cooked food. I started to feel the family bonding and love after all these years. I getting more mature and the invisible wound in me also started to heal soundlessly. Than, i met John in my working place. Although John doesn't have a stable job and income but he always there for me. Waiting for me in a quiet corner in my working place everynight just to see and send me home. He shower me with alots of love i missed from my previous love. His sincerity also touches me deeply. Soon, our love blomson very fast like a bullet train. :love4:<br><br>Financially, John is a poor chap. He has no bright future. But he can give me alot of love and care i have been lacking of since i was young. So, i dont mind giving him all i have in exchange for unlimited love i always wanted. I started paying for his everything. From his handphone bill to his football gambing debts. I dont mind doing that becos money is not important to me. But, i was wrong again. Due to the nature of my job, i met many male customers. John started to feel insecure and he feel worried that i might leave him for someone better and therefore he plant black magic on me so that i would be in control by him. He used the spirit of my aborted child to control me whenever i'm not with him. I would feel sick, restless and moody. But when i get back to him, i feel energetic. Is weird but no one feel anything amissed in me. As such, this thing was dragged for sometimes untill finally the sky opened it eyes for me. Â“VÂ—L ÂŠÃ¡!<br><br>Peoples around me started to realise that i sometimes talked to myself. As for me, i know i was not talking to myself. I was talking to a boy. I always see him around. Sometimes playing by himself, sometimes come near to me and therefore we talks. For this, my family sent me to the Woodbridge hospital again. I scolded the nurses there for restraining me. I struggle to break free from them and thus, they tight me up and isolate me in a pole bed. My mother and her family are Christian and therefore question like spirit and black magic would never come into her mind. They thought i was too stressful with work. It was my cousin that saved me. My cousin is a Buddhist. There was once when she was in the hospital visiting me, she saw me talking to someone she cant see but my eyes was looking down. She suspect that it is a child spirit talking to me. Quickly, she recalled that i had a history of abortion. As a Buddhist herself, she also believing that child spirits would continue to stay within their mother if ritual for them to reincarnation is not done after abortion. (Chinese believe that once a foetus is formed in a woman, it has heartbeat, it has life. That's why, the age starts counting from the month the woman got pregnant and that explained why every Chinese age is added with one more year above the date of birth)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>With the help of my cousin, the hospital staff was cooperative enough to let me discharged to seek consultation from a medium. By appointment, we went to Dua Ya Tua with my mother. Dua ya was firmed tat the child spirit i saw and talked to was a result of black magic. The child spirit is harmless but i need to do 3 years of ritual for him so that he can be directed back to where he came from and also a chance for reincarnation. For now, Dua Ya Pek has since broke the spell and instructed the child spirit to stay outside the temple and he will bring him back with him after the session. My mother was beside me.<br><br>She asked " i saw black image in our home too, was that the child?"<br>Dua ya says " what is your date of birth, let me check for you".<br>She replied "cannot, my religion dont believe this".<br>Dua ya than answered "then why you asked???"<br>She stucked! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>When i stepped out of the temple, i saw the child standing at a corner mean for the wandering soul beside the temple. I took a glance for the last time. I had not only removed his foetus in me, i had also removed his chance of reincarnation mecilessly. What i cant removed from him is his sadness. I wanted to say sorry to him but i dare not to. I know it would not help ease his pain. I will repay by performing 3 years of ritual for him. I know that is not enough but that is what i can do for him for now. I sincerely hope all the young people out there don't do what i have done so as not to be lived with only regretful. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>the end...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Fateemah.. like yourself Im a thinker, i have questions similar to you. I have found an answer 4 years back. Yes God exist and He is in control. He created a perfect world in the beginning but as human, we are not perfect, we have unrightous thoughts and action. He, been a holy God, cannot tolerate sin, hence He punish us too. God is also Love, He give his creation free choices. He knows that human will sin against Him, this did not stop him from loving us. He sent His sinless son to die for our sin. Jesus hence become our bridge to reach the holy God.<br><br>Look around you, we have so many systems in place. The universe system, the planet, the earth, the stars, they are in order. Our complex body system, each have its own function. The eco system how plant produce oxygen and food for us. They all have a creator behind them.<br><br>Look at a cup, the cup existed because someone first have an intention/thought to contain water, hence it was created. We too, we are on earth for a purpose. God has an intention for us. What you have went through, Im sure God has a purpose for you. Lastly let me share this with you.<br><br>http://youtube.com/watch?v=vY5Uo1PfZuY</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rigante, sorry that I have side track in my earlier post. Okie i have go thru the over 1 hr video.<br><br>The bishop can have his view, but that does not mean bible is not God's word. Im not very discipline yet when comes to reading bible but i do bring up questions and doubts to my elders and mentors who have spent their lifetime understanding the book. To me bible have recorded things that happened, happening and is going to happen.<br><br>What are the things you like to "debate" on?? The video is kind of lengthy, not many would spend time watching it. You might want to bring up a few points?<br><br>I would not consider myself a good christian and neither many that I have met. Of cos there are still nice one around. People usually be a christian or go the opposite way either because they have came across a good christian or met a nasty one.<br><br>In the video, it mention many horrible things cause by God's people, I would like to question how close are these people with God. Do they really know God's desire for mankind.</div>
