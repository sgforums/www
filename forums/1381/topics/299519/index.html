            <div class='col-md body'>Human beings are a bunch of intelligent animal. We are so intelligent that we can cook, eat, work and are thinker. We have questions. Egg first or chicken first? Does God really exist. Many questions but some questions would never have an answer. So are we really that intelligent?<br><br>If God really exist, i wish i could ask him why am i here to suffer? Didn't we were taught that we are to go through punishment in the hell for all the sinful things we had done in life before we get to reborn again? If that is true, shouldn't i says my sin has been purified? If is true that i've been purified and is sinless now, why am i here to suffer? Isn't it true that i should be get started refresh. If God really exist, shouldn't i says i would be in the heaven and not here again? I know no one can answer these questions. I wish i would never here. i know i can't change the fact. All because of a man that played in a rain without a raincoat and as a result, the woman got pregnant. The baby inside is me. And you know what, i never get to see the man. To make the matter worst, i was sent to my grandmother when i was juz a baby because my mum need to work and has no time for me.<br><br>My childhhood life was very care-free becos my grandmother is a addicted gambler and therefore she spent most of her time on a manjong table than me. When she is happy and have some money to spend, she would buy many taoist statues home to worship them for better luck. But if she lost heavily, she would sweep them all away and leave them under a tree in our apartment block below instantly. Maybe becos of what she did, the retribution actually comes to me. :cry3:<br><br>If you are old enough like me, you may still remember that during the early 80's, some of the lifts on the ground floor in the HDB were installed with CCTV and a small TV set would be installed outside the lift for people waiting outside to see the activity inside the lift car. That was to curb lift robbery. I was once waiting for the lift at my block below and i saw someone inside the lift coming down. But, when the lift car opened, there was nothing inside. I was too young to feel frighten then. I didn't bother to tell anyone becos i don't have anyone to talk to and no one would bother me. However, things get worst after sometimes. I start hearing someone talking to me so i answered them back. But people around me says i am crazy 'siao'. It was only after one of my grandmother manjong kakis brought me to a temple that saved me for awhile. I was told that my body was possessed with spirit. And that they can ward it off but the solution is only temporary. Becos my body is<br>sort of weak and it can be possessed by the spirit easily. The long term<br>solution is, i have to get a master which is a deity to possess on me,<br>another word means i have to be a medium so that the stateless spirit<br>cannot own my body.<br><br>We went through numerous times of unsuccessful trance before i was finally possessed by Qian Shou Qian Yen Guan Yew. the god of no mercy with thousand hands and thousand eyes. i was 17 then and i went thru juz only primary education. But surprisingly, i could read chinese porm without script and write chinese graphy very well like a pro.<br><br>Behind every successful temple is always women. With the helps of the mouth of the manjong aunties, words of our temple spread very fast n wide. Many visitors came to our temple juz to take a closer glimpse of me possessing the rare Qian Shou Qian Yen. Some visitors were purely Buddhists. They were there juz to seek direct enlightenment from the guan yin. Many whom are also very young professional. The temple were usually so crowded that peoples were so closed to me and i could feel their existance even when they are standing behind my back becos they were blocking my thousand hands movement. Of course, they were not doing it intentionally becos they can't actually see my virtual hands. Only i can feel it.<br><br>However, i feel very tired everytime after i detrance becos the load of the thousand hands were so heavy for me. It was very stressful for a young little girl like me. How many times or how many years do i have to go thru this? I'm only 17. I decided to quit after few months becos i cant take the stress in my body anymore.<br><br>With little education, i found a job as a waitress in a music pub. With little family bonding, i felt love for the first time easily. With little knowledge of evil in man (i mean some men) i fall unreservedly for him. juz when i thought the weather is fine for the day, it rain and we went without any raincoat. I got pregnant. i was not ready for this. Thus, i got the baby aborted. :runnynose:<br><br>to be cont...</div>
