              <p>Well said! If you seek God or Buddha in actuality, you can never find him. But if you seek God or Buddha in pure logic and devotion, you always find them in your imagination. When the Tsunamis and earthquake break loose, millions of innocents die. Where are the so called Almighty God or the good hosts of Buddha Gods? Isn't this better to shower your miracle instead of inside the church building to only your devoters. Or where are those Buddha Gods to stop the disaster.. o just blame to karma theory that these idotic damn people deserve suffering because of their past lives.. wat an awesome theory.  When world war breaks loose and hell breaks loose on earth, all the Gods have taken breaktime during this time.  Isnt it awesome time to take breaktime.</p>
              <p>Religions are practically useless and brings evil in the shadows of goodness.  They deceive us that we are good-natured people.  In christianity, you are reborn spirtually.. woot.. awesome..  In Buddhism, man are of a good nature and blame everything to the karma theory.  If you really believe in karma, you will always apply good. But the fact is you always apply good and evil for your own benefits regardless.  Even if you seriously believe karma, you do it becos of merit.  O well becos man is good nature, so whatever he does is good, and if it is lacking, it is due to lack of knowledge.  That is why Jack Neo fails.</p>
              <p>The koolest, nicest and warmest people are those non-christian and non-buddhist, who know they can be an assholes, but always try to choose not.  Be a free thinker today, dont get bonded with ultimate truths. ^ ^</p>
