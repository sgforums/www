              <p>there was once someone asked a monk whether buddha will get angry  if someone converted to christian and threw away the buddha statue. the monk answered, buddha will not get angry because sentiment beings need buddha more than buddha needs the offerings of sentiment beings. thus the loser is that person. that is why buddha has never stopped or condemned anyone who convert to other religion. this is very different from christianity which said the person will go to hell or condemned if one leaves christianity.</p>

              <p>to Fairyfairy86,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>by saying '' if the higher being is confident and powerful enough, he will not be threaten'', u have juz shown tat u misconceptualised christianity...u cannot compare buddha and the christian God on the same platform cos one is juz said to be the enlightened one but not the creator while the christian God claims to be creator...buddhism is abt following buddha's teachings which include leaving the religion if u can find the way out of suffering in another religion...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>like i have said from the start, when u look at christianity, u have to look at it from creation pt of view...the focus is not on getting out of suffering but rather where man came from and where man is destined to be after we die...one more pt to note...buddha himself left another religion and started his own...tat religion was hinduism...so how do u expect him to tell ppl not to leave buddhism when he was a defector himself?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>yet having said all these, there are similarities btw buddhism and christianity...i leave it for u to explore since i cun PM u which leaves me limited in the things i can share wif u...cheers...</p>
