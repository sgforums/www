              Only God lives forever! And he lives in the light that no one can come near. No humans has ever seen God or ever can see him. God will be honored, and his power will last for ever. Amen. (1 Timothy 6:15-16).
              <br><br>
              it's known that God lives in the light that no one can come near. What it means is that no people could see God as you see other people face to face without obstruction because God lives in the overwhelming light that could not be penetrated by anybody's sight. God's glory is too powerful so that when one is standing before God the only thing that man could see is the glory of God that is the overwhelming light which shines from God's face. Not even the figure of God could be recognized because of the sheer intensity of the light that is God's glory.
              <br><br>
              Numbers 6:22-27<br><br>
              The Priestly Benediction<br>
              22 	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,<br>
              23 	Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto them,<br>
              24 	The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:<br>
              25 	the LORD make <b> his face shine upon thee </b>, and be gracious unto thee:<br>
              26 	the LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.<br>
              27 	And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them.<br>
              
              <br><br>
              Of course the scriptures recorded that Moses was given the privilege of seeing God's back(past His glory) and the result was that Moses face itself shone a light which forced him to cover his face for some weeks unless he prays alone in his tent.

              <p>oh well..</p>
              <p>it is faith of a person.. or a lack of it..</p>
              <p>look at it this way... you have faith that someone is wrong while he has faith that you are wrong...</p>
              <p>so what? who cares? in the final tally, maybe there is a higher power.. it's not up you anyway..</p>
              <p>so just like he has no right to inflict his beliefs on you, you have no right to inflict yours on him...</p>
              <p>let everything be...</p>
              <p>religion is a personal thing.. and the best evangelisation out there to your personal beliefs is to live a good life.. a life so good that others want to be like you...</p>
              <p>currently, how many are actually doing it?</p>

              <p><br>Its hard not to be brainwashed. Especially when people bring children to sunday school. Children are most impressionable. And sitting down for 2 hours during worship service can really get you brainwashed. They sing some nice hymns to get you high. Then the pastor speaks "the truth" to get you to believe. And you see people dropping money into offering bags, you feel a need to drop it too. Then with that money they go on "missions" to brainwash more ppl from other countries.</p>
