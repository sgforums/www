              <p><br>the protestants call all christians saints..</p>
              <p>however, catholics look to Saints as those who have been canonised.. which takes a LONG time after all the research and stuff which goes into finding out the life of the person, miracles, beatification... the works..</p>
              <p>Saints include those who are martyrs... who have to be canonised too...</p>
              <p>to compare the (living) Pope to (physically dead but spiritually living in heaven) Saints in terms of "higher and lower" is kind of absurd..</p>

              <p>To say somebody is a saint means that person leads a holy life.</p>
              <p>If all Christians are really saints all of them would be able to perform miracles.</p>
              <p>The world would also be a much better place to live because Christians number 1/3 of the world's population.</p>
              <p>So if you say you're a saint do you claim to lead a holy life thus being worthy to be called a holy person?</p>
              <p>Peter the apostle was definitely a saint his mere shadow healed the sick</p>
              <p>The more recent Padre Pio a receiver of stigmata was also a saint.</p>
              <p>Catholics are also Christians.</p>
              <p><br>However all Christians have the capacity to be a saint if they decide to follow on the footsteps of Jesus. Unfortunately many professed Christians lead life far from the grace of God.</p>

              <p>To Protestant Christians, 'saints' are a designation, not of individual moral purity or miracle making prowess, but of spiritual union with Christ (Phil 1:1; Rom 1:7; 1 Cor 1:2). Therefore, we are all 'saints'. It's different from the Catholics who believe in 'Saints', persons formally canonized by the Catholic Church.</p>
              <p>I believe I am not able to be a holy person at all, but I am called to lead a holy life.</p>
              <p>That's why we call it the grace of God, because we don't deserve it. It's all from the giver, God. Christ's righteousness is cloaked upon us, and the Holy Spirit empowers our sanctification.</p>
              <p>How special is receiving stigmata within the Catholic Church?</p>

                  teachings from him, i wouldn't accept his infallibility even when

              <p>Hi 24/7 Oh that is what it meant for the Protestant.</p>
              <p>The reciever of stigmata would usually recieve a beatification to sainthood in the Catholic church. That is usually but not always. And they only receive beatification only after death. The majority are quite a long time after death so mother Teresa was quite an exception actually though she wasn't a stigmata receiver.</p>
              <p>As far as I know Padre Pio a reciever of stigmata hasn't been beatified yet or still in the process of getting it. But he has been known to be a saint to many people already. Julia Kim of Naju Korea another stigmata reciever who still lives even doesn't get the Korean church support. The Korean church doesn't acknowledge Julia Kim's miraces yet. Though she once visted the Pope(late John Paul II) in Rome and during the mass with the pope her eucharistic host tuned into flesh and blood.</p>
              <p>In another twist there was the famous Saint George the slayer of dragon  which the Church has erased from its official sainthood list. He's most probably just a myth.</p>

              <p>Hi everybody,</p>
              <p>Pope is a successor of St Peter (the head of the 12 apostle appointed by Jesus). Historical facts support that. Thus, he receive and command the kind of status because he is recognised as the representitive of Jesus. The Pope leads all the believers of Christ as the shepherd of his flocks.</p>
              <p>There is an interesting article (long though) that Christians (especially the Prostestant) should read with an open mind and start praying and searching ........ to seek the truth from God.</p>

              <p>Pope is a successor of St Peter (the head of the 12 apostle
              appointed by Jesus). Historical facts support that. Thus, he
              receive and command the kind of status because he is recognised as
              the representitive of Jesus. The Pope leads all the believers of
              Christ as the shepherd of his flocks.</p>
              <p>There is an interesting article (long though) that Christians
              (especially the Prostestant) should read with an open mind and
              start praying and searching ........ to seek the truth from
              God.</p>

              <p><br>I would say that among non-believers, there are different types and different levels of response. There are those like what he has mentioned that would make use of the name to try and 'trap' believers.</p>
              <p>There are also those others, who like you said Jesus is nothing to them. Jesus could even be the name of a regular person but they just don't care about this other person, much less use the name to 'trap' another person.</p>

              <p>Well, a friend of mine once told me - only 1 person read the Bible and 99 persons is reading the Christians. Therefore, what Christians says and do is important - right ?</p>
              <p>If you believe in Christ and follow His teaching, it is all about loving your neighbour. There are many beautiful stories in the Bibile when Jesus is trying to teach his followers that God is loving, forgiving, borderless etc...</p>
              <p>Sadly, some Christians have "twisted" the teachings and start dividing everybody - even within the household (knowingly or unknowingly)....</p>
              <p>Of course, we are all human and we do err and sin. What we do after that (mistake or sin) is important.</p>
