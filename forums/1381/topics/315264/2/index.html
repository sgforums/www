              <p>of course, christians should live a life which glorifies God, for the benefits of the non believers. i agree with you there.</p>

              <p>they forget that the difference between a christian and a non believer, is the grace that is shown for us. we're just as bad, if not worse than non believers. that's precisely why we're christians, we recognise that we pretty much messed up our lives, we've screwed up, we've lost tempers, we've hurt others, etc etc etc, and that there is forgiveness for all the guilt and we receive it. and it's so good to be forgiven, and loved for who we are, and we're telling others that it feels good to be free, and to be loved, because God is love and God is a good God.</p>
              <p>so it's kinda redundant when non believers refute it by saying God isn't a good God because christians aren't good.</p>

              <p>wah so many discussions...</p>
              <p>To ans TS's qus, firstly i'm a catholic therefore i recognize the pope as the head of the Catholic Church.</p>
              <p>and as mentioned "Saints as those who have been
                                      canonised" but to me personally it doesn't matter does it?</p>
              <p>its a recognization that one have indeed been living the christian life. How ever thats onli a title at the end of the day</p>
              <p>what we do now is the most important yes the pope represent God to us yet in the same way we represent God to others when we call ourselves christians/ catholics so at the end weather u recognize or not the pope as a leader is still ur own decision. more imptly we should respect and recognize the things that one has done in the name of God.</p>
              <p>don't forget the pope does not only handles religious matters, he has a say in politics too, so what he has done in making this world a more peaceful place is more impt then weather we should follow ever word he says.</p>

              <p>it is easier, sorry, but i am biased for action and i dont believe that a fault be apportioned due to lack of resolve from a party, clear all acts before looking at the biases and prejudice and wrongdoings</p>
              <p>if non believers entrap christians by nitpicking faults, again, its a common trait of every human bean, and i also dont believe that for a behaviour that is widely practised it can be simply categorised into christians-non believers divide</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if you strive to be a good christian, i believe that the amount of sins and wrongdoings committed are so minimal that anything else will be a simple matter of nitpicking, but are we coming to this stage yet?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>maybe when christians (heck, any person of any religion) stop justifying their wrongdoings by using god's name, will we see better days</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for your last point is, strive to be a better christian, what for look at the weaknesses and feel helpless? i know of christians who look at past failings and the environment around them to reflect upon themselves and strive to do better, why cant you?</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">The Bishop of Rome or the Pope is the head of Catholic
              Church. As successor of St. Peter, he shares St. Peter's special authority or
              primacy.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">(http://www.catholic.com/library/Authority_of_the_Pope_Part_1.asp)</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">More on this can be found in above link.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Saint is someone who is showing his/her love for Christ, who
              loves us by dying on the cross, by leading a holy life, keep His commandment
              faithfully. Some have even go as far as offering themselves to share the pain
              that Christ endure during the crucifixion, and when it was granted they bore
              the wound of Christ, which is called stigmata.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Some saints are granted by God special gifts to perform
              miracles. These miracles, I believe is a way for God to tell us to believe in
              Him, because He knows that it is not easy to believe.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Some saints who are recognized by the Church are canonized
              after their death. The canonization is a special recognition by the Church
              authority that he/she is holy, and that we as other Catholics can look up to
              him/her as good example in leading our life holy.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">An example is Anne Catherine Emmerich. <span> </span>She born from very poor family in Germany,
              she was sent to study music, but finding the organist's family very poor she
              gave them the little she had saved to enter a convent, and waited on them as a
              servant for several years.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I think she has not been canonized but she definitely is a
              saint.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">As part of their leading holy life and fulfilling the
              requirement of being in communion with the Catholic Church, they of course
              recognized Pope Authority. Maybe this is what you mean "Pope is higher
              than saints"?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Even Mother Teresa, where ever she go, she respect and obey
              the local priests, as the priests I believe is in the higher position in the
              hierarchy than herself as a religious sister.</p>

              <p>Hi Malcom,</p>
              <p>I am not sure about Anne Catherine but as far as Mother Teresa is concern, she is not a saint yet...but on her way.</p>
              <p>To obtain sainthood is a long process (that may take many years) and the Catholic Church cannot just confer anyone that title - they do it with divine's intervention.</p>
              <p>When  someone who live her life very Christ-like (like Mother Teresa) dies, the local Bishop will have to start the process to canonize he or her for Sainthood. The recoomendation will go to the Vatican and investigation will be made to confirmed that the person is worthly to be considered a Saint.</p>
              <p>Mother Teresa is Beatified and certainly on her way to sainthood but the Church has yet to declare her as one.</p>
              <p>One of the many criterion is to pray for divine sign of miracles that results from the intercession of the person (who is to be declared a Saint). An example of a miracle will be a person with terminal diease (medically proven) gets a complete recovery after asking for intercession from the person (who is to be declared a Saint) - again it must be medically proven. The Church will likely accept this as a miracle but I think (I am not sure) that at least 3 miracles is needed before the person can be declared a Saint.</p>
              <p>Therefore, it make sense for us to seek intercession from Saints to help us pray for our intentions.</p>
              <p>For dumbdumb who still insist that Christians are entitled to sin like others, I agree....many Christians do that. But, if any Christians are truely serious about their faith and believe, they should start (at least try lah) to like like Christ.</p>
              <p>Mother Teresa is one shining example of someone who can do it.  Of course there is only 1 Mother Teresa.....but we can at least stop that smoking, cursing, swearing, not respecting etc.... God teaches us not to do that but if one choose not to listen to God, they cannot blame non-believers for "entrapping them".</p>
              <p>Instead, they should look at themselves and reflect on what they do......and why they "entrapped themselve". If one loves God, he must stand up for him and the best way is to follow his teachings.</p>
              <p>God Bless All</p>

              <p>dumbdumb,</p>
              <p>I think you and laurence are somewhat talking on different planes. Laurence is talking about wrongdoing done in the name of religion, eg jihad or crusade wars (extreme examples but I hope you get my point).</p>
              <p>You on the other hand are talking about how Christians being human would still committ wrongdoings. Only that certain non-believers would make use to this to 'trap' Christians.</p>
              <p>I'm not too sure whether Laurence understands what you are trying to tell him, that for Christians we know that inspite of our sins, God has chosen to forgive us and die on the cross so that we may be saved. This however is different from his point about how Christians or members of any religion committ wrong doing in the name of their respective religions.</p>
              <p>Similarly I'm not too sure if you understand what he is driving at.</p>

              <p>hi laurence82,</p>

              <p>24/7, I think laurence is just making use of the chance to put his own point across.</p>
              <p>Actually, I do understand laurence's perspective.</p>
              <p>Let's just say, not all non-believers are the type that would go around nit-picking on the traits of others. Just as there are different types of Christians, there are different types of non-believers as well.</p>
              <p>Yes, nit-picking in itself is not a trait limited to only non-believers, neither are all non-believers like that. Probably I won't say it's a common human trait, but non-believers nit-picking is just one aspect of it all. There is, but to say everyone or that it's common is a different thing altogether. Maybe to some nit-picking is second nature, hence it seems common to them.</p>
