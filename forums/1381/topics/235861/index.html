The only thing about it is, it is not firm, meaning, it can be this today, but may not be this tomorrow.<br><br>so is being Static, just that its unchanging, means one can be sure that what it say today, is also what it says tomorrow.<br><br>personally, where faith is concerns, it need to be anchor on something that is firm and not shifting, policy and tradition may change/evolve, but truth should be firm, if not, how can we be sure if its true today, will it still be true tomorrow?<br><br>maybe something you can relate to, Jewish customs and traditions may have evolved throughout the ages, but the Torah have not. Hence we have here, the Torah (firm) guilding the customs/traditions/practices (evolving). How this happen is that these customs/traditions/practices though still guide by the principles in the Torah evolved to adapt to the needs of the people practicing it making it practical for them.
