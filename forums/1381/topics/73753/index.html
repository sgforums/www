            <div class='col-md body'>guys.. bear in mind that nobody here is actually a priesst or pastor. At best maybe a few CG leaders here n there.. so the answers we give may not be so accurate (we didn't study yrs of theology like the priests and pastors). so forgive mine if its not an accurate reflection.<br><br>anyway i read this i think in a philip yancy book (dunno the title though) . He mentios that heaven is a pure place. Wonderful and without sin. However, all of us have sinned .. thus we r stained. but given the sinlessness of heaven.. our stained garments (sins) make us unable to enter such a holy place. Thus, the only way to enter is to have our sins washed away. But who can wash away sins?? nobody except God! but what if you do not believe in him?? how do you forgive someone who doesn't believe in you. Because if u dun believe in him.. there's nothing God CAN do .. anyway... for such topics, i think nobody can give a satisfied answer. that why its called faith.<br><br>bottomline.. i believe in Jesus! there is no reason not to..  if you were a scientist.. yu would find it easiier to prove the existence that jesus did grace the earth than fnding prove of the existence of hitler or ceasar (seriously.. no kiddin). but again that is secondary.<br><br>I love God and i can feel him in my life... thats the most imporant.. and because i know .. i can't reject hm... its something like a polic committing a crime.<br><br>hope i dun offend ppl with this post</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One question always pop up in my mind whenever people post a topic on Christianity.<br><br>Twice, my friends have approached me and let me read literatures such as "The Last Bread" (did I get the name correct?) and explained to me how Jesus become their saviour. They were very passionate about it, and I appreciate their enthusiasm. But not once did they mention the following things, knowing their aim was to convert me:<br><br>...that I should be embracing Jesus into my life, or that God created 'us' which include me, or how we are sinful, and that we should let Him into our life to help us to clear our sins and so on.<br><br>Yes, they were passionate about it, but they never go beyond that.<br><br><strong>Why do some, if not all, Christians always talk about 'others'? </strong>"'Others' are sinful, and we should spread the good news.", "Leave it to God to judge the rest",<br><br>Yes, sillyme, I do agree this forum should only for believers. I believe one should talk about how Jesus save his life, or to post verses from the Bible.<br><br>Its irksome when one post a topic talking about 'others'. Such a topic is but a taint on the teachings of Christ.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pardon me if my english is poor.<br><br>To us, those who have believe, we address ourselves as 'us'.  So naturally, when talking about our faith, we address those who do subscribe to our beliefs as 'them'.  Maybe 'others' is not an appropriate term.  We're all the same, just that some have believed and some have not.  We're not a class above any others, just that Christians have their hope in God.<br><br>Anyway, I do not wish that this topic turn into debate on which religion is 'better'.  We find solace in different things and we decide how to live our lives.  To each his own. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

"hi! i'm going swimming today.. wad r u n the others going to do?" u see.. there's no malice there. and y do christians try n spread the gospel? because we care and trying to spread the good news of jesus to non-believers (i almost used others instead of non-believers .. u see.. no malice was involved).<br><br>Although some go abt it, admittedly, in the wrong manner, but  overall they r trying to help you.

And worse, some act upon it, from non believers being annoyed, or to forced baptism in some areas of the world.

            <div class='col-md body'>I get what you mean now laurence. As M pointed out in <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=70543&amp;page=3" rel="nofollow">another thread</a>, we spread the gospel because of the Great Commission.<br><br>I agree with you that the best way to do this is through our lifestyle and not overtly trying to influence them directly (which puts some people off).  And sometimes the extra effort gives the "we are superior" impression.  Let me say that we shouldn't be doing this. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=ROM+12:3&amp;language=english&amp;version=NIV&amp;showfn=on&amp;showxref=on" rel="nofollow">Romans 3:12</a> tells us this. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

We are saved from the fires of hell. Why would we be going there? Because we are all sinful and the wages of sin is death. One must realise that he is sinful and needs to be saved. Since we are all sinful, only God can save us. This is probably what ticks of most people, telling them that they are sinful.<br>so laurence82, do you believe this fact? Because this is the first acknowledgement we must make, we are sinful. Therefore when we believe in Christ, we gain salvation from our sins.<br><br>Granted, I feel that many Christians reached out a little to strongly. That's not right, accepting Christ should be done willingly. Perhaps what is absent nowadays is love. I qoute Corinthians 13:1-3<br><br>"If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames but have not love, I gain nothing. "<br><br>We need to love non-christians and help them in their needs, if they lack something we should give. We do this because we<strong> love </strong>them and through our <strong>actions</strong> we hope they can see Christ in us. This, laurence82 is what I believe you are trying to say?<br><br>However, ultimately, the acceptance of Christ must be the realisation of once sinful self and the need to be saved.<br><br>As for what I said, I was trying to tell Bontakun that since he wants to see for himself when he leave da mortal world if it is true or not, why not believe first, then see. It's no lost if I'm wrong or if I'm right.<br>If I sound deriding, I apologise, I meant no ill.</div>
