"Everybody living in Jerusalem knows they have done an outstanding miracle, and we cannot deny it. 17But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people, we must warn these men to speak no longer to anyone in this name."<br>18Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. 19But Peter and John replied, "Judge for yourselves whether it is right in God's sight to obey you rather than God. 20For we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard."<br>21After further threats they let them go. They could not decide how to punish them, because all the people were praising God for what had happened. 22For the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old.<br><br>-----------<br><br>The preaching of salvation through Jesus and the proclamation of Him being raised from the dead is unwelcomed by the Jewish religious because they see it as a threat to them. They repeatedly attempted to stop the disciples from speaking in that name but obviously the disciples didnt stop doing that.<br><br>Regarding this passage being relevant to this topic, I address the issue concerning Christians preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ and also on the emphasis that it is only through Christ can a person be saved. And why dun Christians just mind their own business and stop preaching to people the saving grace. I guess by reading the passage with a open-mind, one can discern the whole idea.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, I come in peace.<br><br>I feel after everything I have read I should share this:<br><br>1.  I was born Catholic. Thought "gao dim" already, no need to worry.<br><br>2. I grew up thinking I already know God but actually I didn't. So I went the way of the desperate Â— try this try that try the other thing. I am not joking: witchcraft, astrology, fortune telling (I can "read palms"), yoga, some Buddhism etc etc<br><br>3. The more I thought I knew the less I knew.<br><br>4. My mother has always loved Jesus. For some reason I thought, Know God can already. But I was wrong. My mother became terminally ill with cancer last year. She wanted me to know Jesus but she didn't say, she just prayed.<br><br>5. One month before her death I suddenly realised I didn't really know what it meant to be "saved". I thought Jesus is another Gandhi, big deal. Then I felt God make me ask a pastor in training. He showed me the history of time and how it is completely FACTUAL what happened in the Bible is true, every word. This excited and scared me. I have some VERY good friends who are Buddhist and wonderful people. I have very close Muslim friends. I thought, How can these people go to eternal fire if they love God so much? But when my pastor friend explained to me, it became VERY clear that Jesus is God's present to us. Free gift. Just accept. And it means we get to be with God forever.<br><br>I know it seems "too easy" but trust me, it is VERY difficult. It is probably the most difficult thing you will ever do in your life. Because it means you have to EXCLUDE all others. It's a marriage Â— you are married to Jesus and that's it. No affairs with all the other stuff. It means even if your parents disapprove of your heavenly "spouse" you have taken the vow and you must follow Him, not others, not even the ones who you love and are closest to. That's why it's hard.<br><br>6. When I finally accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour and the only one capable of saving me, I cried and cried. Because I remembered the friends who had died without knowing or accepting Him. Because I think of my friends now who still don't know Him and realise I have so much work to do!<br><br>7. On my mother's death bed I received the fullness of the Holy Spirit. I knew it was a gift she wanted me to have. And I will share what the Holy Spirit has done for me: I now know the Truth, and the Truth has set me free. I am a completely different person today than I was 5 months ago, and I praise God and thank Him!<br><br>To answer some questions:<br><br>1. Why do Christians have to go and evangelise and bring people to Christ? Because that's our job. We come to Christ not to be happy happy joy joy but to do His work, to be a labourer in a ripe harvest. We have to follow instructions, He is our King. Don't play the fool.<br><br>2. What happens to people who don't hear the Good News and have a chance to accept Jesus as their personal saviour? the Bible says that Jesus will not come again UNTIL THE WORD IS PREACHED TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH. So until everybody knows, Judgment Day will not happen.<br><br>I honestly do not know about the "innocents" but I believe God is merciful and it is really beyond all human understanding and knowledge to second-guess what He has prepared for these innocents -- children who die from diseases early in life, aborted babies (which are souls, so it's not like they're not counted).<br><br>I can only say God needs harvest workers. If you have heard the Good NEws and God gives you the heart to accept it, do not turn away, because you are needed to save others. Too many people in this world die from desperation. I wept when I read about the 34-year-old woman with cancer who killed herself and her babies Â— there is nothing more terrible than to be hopeless, and in Jesus rests ALL hope. This world can really suck, but if you have Jesus, it really doesn't matter because if you believe, this world is only temporary. No matter what people do to our bodies (shoot us, kill us, eat us) they cannot touch our souls. Pain on earth is temporary, but pain in hell is forever. And actually quite unnecessary.<br><br>You are all blessed. Have  a good and restful Sunday.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Two points need to be noted:<br><strong>1)	Unity does not require uniformity.<br>2)	Uniformity does not ensure Unity.</strong><br><br>There is a very good story on this:-- the story of the six blind men and an elephant. Each blind man went to feel a different part of an elephant and came away with their own representation of it.<br><br>If they practised Unity, they can discuss everything and yet be united. If one tries to practise uniformity, it is akin to the blind man who felt the elephantÂ’s tail and declare it to be like a snake!<br><br>And this is the problem of Christianity, because it seeks uniformity as a solution. That is why Christians try to convert. They have been doing that for 2000 years and what have they achieve? How much time do Christians need to convert the entire world? Another 2000 years or 20,000 years?<br><br>Let me be optimistic and say Christians need 1000 years and succeed, then they may have solved the problem of uniformity but not the problem of Unity.<br><br>Even now, there are many denominations in Christianity, and some will even denounce others as Â“cults or breakaway fractionsÂ”. If the goal was one of Unity, then there will not be such troubles. Differences can be celebrated; similarities and also be celebrated.<br><br>And I have to agree with NeonTetra that Truth is very offensive: it is offensive because people seek uniformity. Most people are not interested in knowing what is true, but in asserting what they think is true. If one wants to know the truth, one must seek the global truth, because oneÂ’s viewpoint can only be relative truth. If the six blind men combine their description of the elephant, they may see an adequate representation, if they insist on their own viewpoint, what they see is gross misrepresentation!<br><br>And since we are on the issue of viewpoints, let us look a bit deeper:<br><strong>1)</strong>	Muslims hold Jesus in high regard as a Messenger of God, as opposed to ChristiansÂ’ belief that Jesus is the Son of God.<br><br><strong>2)</strong>	Hindus accept God in any form, in the Gita, Lord Krishna said that he would appear in any form that the devotee is comfortable with.<br><br><strong>3)</strong>	In the Taoist Tao De Jing, if one subsititute the word Tao with God, one can hardly feel any difference when reading it. Good and Evil are both in Tao, but Tao is also beyond Good and Evil (God and Devil?).<br><br><strong>4)</strong>	Buddhism asserts that all religions are true in a way, but are not necessary needed. And there is one little-known story that may be of interest / shockÂ… (more later)<br><br>So where does these leave us? Christian truth is inside the truth of other religions, but the truth of other religions is rejected by Christians. As what I like to say to Christian friends,<strong> Â“The fishes that swim in the ocean of Truth do not prefer to go back into the river of truth, because eventually the fishes in the river must arrive back in the ocean.Â”</strong><br><br>As I said earlier, there is an Indian/Tibetian story that is of interest here. It is a record of the story of a man known as Issa (Arabic).  It is for those who are interested in seeing different viewpoints, those who wish to stick only to their own viewpoint can forgo it without loss to what I typed about.<br>Go to: <a href="http://reluctant-messenger.com/issa.htm" rel="nofollow">http://reluctant-messenger.com/issa.htm</a><br></div>

Unity here is important, and differences and similarities can be celebrated. It doesn't really matter whether you're a Methodist, Anglican, Lutheran, Baptist or Catholic. However, you use the example of "cults or breakaway fractions" which I feel is problematic. Are you suggesting the mainstream church should celebrate these differences?<br><br><blockquote>So where does these leave us? Christian truth is inside the truth of other religions, but the truth of other religions is rejected by Christians.</blockquote>You like talking in circles, but what's your point? You seem to advocate unity, that each of them reflects a part of the truth, and we should combine them to see the whole truth? Please correct my interpretation.<br><br>However, the problem here is that Christianity is an exclusive religion and preaches exclusive salvation through Jesus Christ. If you realize, this is the only "rule" in Christianity, that you must acknowledge the Lord as your saviour. Hence your analogy of the blind men touching the elephant is inappropriate. You're assuming they all touch a different part of the elephant and all religions reflect a different aspect of the truth or reality. But is this the case? If two blind men touch the tail and describe it differently, how do you 'unify'?<br><br>Hindus accept God in any form? Appear in any form devotee is comfortable with? So if the devotee is not comfortable, the 'form' is not God? So Jesus can be God or not God at the same time, depending on the 'mood' of the devotee?<br><br>And your Tao De Jing analogy is inappropriate. Good and Evil are both in Tao, but God is only good, no evil, so you can't substitute the word Tao with God.<br><br>All religions are true in a way. Such a vague statement cannot be argued to any satisfaction.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys.. didn't realise my post would cause such an uproar.. really didn't mean  to offend anybody. anyway. As Christian,we are not trying to practise elitism, we are not comparing which religion is better or which is more true. This really isn't an issue and it seldom crosses christian's mind.<br><br>I just hope i can explain to you the bottom line (even if it's a repetition of what you have heard a thousand times).<br><br>1. Man is sinful. (we can agree on that right.. we have sin at 1 time or another)<br><br>2. Jesus came to earth (this is a historical fact)<br><br>3. Who is Jesus? (To Christians - he is our saviour. To aethist- some say he is a good moral teacher, poitical matyr, etc..)<br><br>4. Jesus told us that he is the way and that no one comes through the father but through him.

The smaller problem cannot be solved by this approach; do you think that the bigger problem can be solved by this approach?

Please correct my interpretation.<br></strong><br>How can one be the First and the Last? On a circle, the first is also the last, because it has no beginning and no end. If you can see the global Truth, then see the Truth. If you cannot see the Truth, at least know that there are many relative truths.<br><br><strong><br>However, the problem here is that Christianity is an exclusive religion and preaches exclusive salvation through Jesus Christ. If you realize, this is the only "rule" in Christianity, that you must acknowledge the Lord as your saviour. Hence your analogy of the blind men touching the elephant is inappropriate. You're assuming they all touch a different part of the elephant and all religions reflect a different aspect of the truth or reality. But is this the case? If two blind men touch the tail and describe it differently, how do you 'unify'?<br></strong><br>Even in Christianity, there is ongoing debate about what it means to be saved. (see: <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_savj.htm#deed" rel="nofollow">http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_savj.htm#deed</a>). When you say Â“exclusiveÂ”, you have missed completely, the moral of the story is that there are Â“manyÂ”, because each of the blind man believes that his own representation of the elephant is Â“exclusiveÂ”. Blindness symbolises ignorance. And because the blind cannot see, he keeps saying the elephant is like a snake, to which those who can see knows that it is not true. And the two blind men who touch the tail can unify when their blindness is removed. Then they see the whole elephant. If they do not see the whole elephant, then two fools walk around saying that elephants look like a snake!<br><br><strong><br>Hindus accept God in any form?

Every year, the world is wrecked by natural and man-made disasters, there are the deformed, sick and homeless and Christians go on telling me that God is loving. A beautiful verse: Â“Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love.Â” Now, read it again and change it to Â“God is lovingÂ”, then it becomes ugly. If God is loving, and a person slaps you, then you can kill the person and God can forgive you, because God is loving.<br><br>No, God is Love. The Bible says so, and Christians misinterpret that God is loving. If a person slaps you, and you have Love in you, then you will at least ask for a reason. If you have no Love in you, you will fight without even asking for the reason. And it is more true to say Love is God, because God is not only Love, but also Light, Truth, etc.  God is Love, but I never corrected Christians who keep telling me God is loving. What happens when Christians say God is loving? They take Love, personified it as a person God and say God is loving, they just stopped short of building a statue. Why would Christians do that? Because they are more comfortable with a particular form than a formless God. So if you can accept that God is loving, you can also accept statues of Virgin Mary, Buddha, Shiva, Guanyin, etc. They are just forms to represent the formless.<br><br><strong><br>And your Tao De Jing analogy is inappropriate. Good and Evil are both in Tao, but God is only good, no evil, so you can't substitute the word Tao with God.<br></strong><br><br>I would have thought that God is an ocean, Tao is also an ocean. But if you like, you can think of God as a sea, Tao as an ocean, and for me, both are Water.<br><br><strong><br>All religions are true in a way.

            <div class='col-md body'>Wah, perhaps it is my poor comprehension ability, but I find your reply hard to understand. You did a good job of separating my comments and your reply, but sometimes I don't know whether you're answering my question or just writing your own comment. Hence it is inevitable that I think you're beating around the bush, not answering the question, throwing red herrings etc. In fact, Jesus' parables are easier to understand than your reply. No offense  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote>If you have understood that the situation is problematic, then it will help you see that how uniformity cannot be a solution, because uniformity cannot even be achieved by fractions within Christianity.</blockquote>This is a strawman. Who says uniformity is a solution? Christians acknowledge that there is no uniformity within denominations, so they won't expect uniformity even if they can convert the whole world.<br><br><blockquote>And so what happens even if you can convert the whole world to Christianity? They will still be differences, perhaps magnified many times over. </blockquote>Agree. Catholics and Protestants will still bicker over theology and the likes.<br><br><blockquote>The smaller problem cannot be solved by this approach; do you think that the bigger problem can be solved by this approach? </blockquote>This is a potential fallacy of composition in logic.<br><br><blockquote>How can one be the First and the Last?</blockquote>There's no need to use your circle to explain such common-sensical idea. Picture this. If a class has only 1 student, won't the student be first ... and yet last in class position?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> At least there's a beginning and end for this example.<br><br><blockquote>Even in Christianity, there is ongoing debate about what it means to be saved. (see: http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_savj.htm#deed).</blockquote>But you can't ignore the fact, when christians evangelise, they only list down one "rule", that you open your heart and acknowledge the Lord as your saviour. Don't throw a red herring and lead us to bicker over the nuances of theology. While Catholics and Protestants may bicker over the nature of Mother Mary, or whether good works contributes to salvation, no one doubts that only acknowledging the Lord as your saviour is a necessary condition for salvation.<br><br><blockquote>When you say Â¡Â°exclusiveÂ¡Â±, you have missed completely</blockquote>My point is about Christianity being mutually incompatible with other religions. While Islam and Judaism are also mutually incompatible, Christianity is stricter since it preaches exclusive salvation through Christ.<br><br><blockquote>, the moral of the story is that there are Â¡Â°manyÂ¡Â±, because each of the blind man believes that his own representation of the elephant is Â¡Â°exclusiveÂ¡Â±.</blockquote>I don't see how the blind men in the analogy can represent the religions in the world. Buddhism, IMHO, doesn't believe itself to be exclusive. And it is surely not ignorant.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote>And the two blind men who touch the tail can unify when their blindness is removed. </blockquote>What do you suggest to remove the blindness?<br><br><blockquote>Many Christians tell me that God is loving. Every year, the world is wrecked by natural and man-made disasters, there are the deformed, sick and homeless and Christians go on telling me that God is loving.</blockquote>Ah, the problem of evil. How to reconcile a loving God with the state of affairs now. Heehee.<br><br><blockquote>A beautiful verse: Â¡Â°Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love.Â¡Â± Now, read it again and change it to Â¡Â°God is lovingÂ¡Â±, then it becomes ugly. </blockquote><blockquote>If God is loving, and a person slaps you, then you can kill the person and God can forgive you, because God is loving. </blockquote>How does this relate to the verse (from 1 John?) you quoted? Or is this a sarcastic remark?<br><br><blockquote>No, God is Love. The Bible says so, and Christians misinterpret that God is loving.</blockquote>Is this a nuance of the English language? The subtle differences between 'God is Love' and 'God is loving'?<br><br><blockquote>And it is more true to say Love is God, because God is not only Love, but also Light, Truth, etc.</blockquote>This is stretching my logic. How do you arrive at the conclusion that Love is God? Surely God being Love, Light, Truth, and what you can think of, doesn't lead to that conclusion?<br><br><blockquote>Because they are more comfortable with a particular form than a formless God. </blockquote>Do Christians think that God is formless without the personification that you suggested? This is not the God of philosophy but the God who leaves his mark in history.<br><br><blockquote>So if you can accept that God is loving, you can also accept statues of Virgin Mary, Buddha, Shiva, Guanyin, etc. They are just forms to represent the formless. </blockquote>Wah, your argument makes big leap of reasoning. I need more time to ponder over it. Let's hope your next reply shed more light on the argument.<br><br><blockquote>I would have thought that God is an ocean, Tao is also an ocean. But if you like, you can think of God as a sea, Tao as an ocean, and for me, both are Water. </blockquote>Interesting. Look at what the Gospel of John has to say:<br>1 ÃŒÂ«Â³ÃµÃ“Ã�ÂµÃ€Â£Â¬ÂµÃ€Ã“Ã«Ã‰Ã±Ã�Â¬Ã”ÃšÂ£Â¬ÂµÃ€Â¾Ã�ÃŠÃ‡Ã‰Ã±Â¡Â£<br>2 Ã•Ã¢ÂµÃ€ÃŒÂ«Â³ÃµÃ“Ã«Ã‰Ã±Ã�Â¬Ã”ÃšÂ¡Â£<br>3 Ã�Ã²ÃŽÃ¯ÃŠÃ‡Â½Ã¥Ã—Ã…Ã‹Ã»Ã”Ã¬ÂµÃ„Â¡Â£Â·Â²Â±Â»Ã”Ã¬ÂµÃ„Â£Â¬ÃƒÂ»Ã“Ã�Ã’Â»Ã‘Ã¹Â²Â»ÃŠÃ‡Â½Ã¥Ã—Ã…Ã‹Ã»Ã”Ã¬ÂµÃ„<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote>Everything can be argued.

Surely not everyone with detailed arguments are beating around the bush?<br><br><blockquote>But what purpose does argument serve? I was looking for agreement, agreement brings me satisfaction.
