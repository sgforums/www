              <p>M&amp;P,</p>
              <p>I think there's a difference between addicting to pornography or the need to masturbate. If you watch pornography is to aid you in masturbating. Then probably you can start by doing so without watching pornography.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure what's the christian take on masturbation, however, at least in the medical point of view, it's natural for <strong>both </strong>men and women to masturbate. If it's for masturbation, when you have the urge, probably just get over and done with asap, hence giving you lesser time to grow the urge of watching pornography?</p>
              <p>It sounds weird but hope this post offends no one.</p>

              <p>Hi</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you sound like someone who is saying these</p>
              <p>'I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. "</p>
              <p>"For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing."</p>
              <p>**does this sound familar? probably so, I found myself in this situations many times (all the Alemak!s, Not again? ...etc)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>do you want to know the answer this person found to his problem?</p>
              <p>Thanks be to God—through Jesus Christ our Lord!</p>
              <p>Oh... This person who is lamenting about his weakness in the flesh is none other then the Apostle Paul</p>
              <p>(read Romans 7:7-25 about his struggle with sins)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can see that you had been trying and struggling with your weakness, and yet it seems the result seems temporal? and then you try again, and fall again... (if I offend you, sorry) but is it a bit insane to try to do the same thing over and over again and expect a different result?</p>
              <p>Instead of trying to change yourself, ever try surrendering to Christ and let Him do the changing instead? For it is precisely that we cannot save ourselves that Christ died on the cross, so that through Him we may be saved.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>remind me of the lyrics of a song:</p>
              <p>"little by little, He is changing me.</p>
              <p>little by little, He is changing me.</p>
              <p>Jesus is changing me. ..."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Be blessed.</p>

              <p>actually this issue has been milked dry many times over. as i'd said, proponents of either of these stance will adequately be able to quote verses to support their beliefs.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>no, salvation is independent of holy living. SIMPLIFIED VERSION: Salvation was achieved by the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is a one time act, it is a gift. The sole condition is that the individual accepts that act as a fact and accepts Jesus as his personal saviour and allow Jesus (and the Holy Spirit) to work on him to change his life gradually. Primary scriptural support: John 3:16 (there are other verses)</li>
              <li>yes, holy living is an integral part of salvation. SIMPLIFIED VERSION: Salvation is a process and because it is a process, holy living (or works) has to be evident and has to be actively pursued. If works failed or is lacking, the individual is deemed not to have salvation or not to have accepted salvation genuinely. Primary scriptural support: parables of Jesus on the separation of the sheep and goats and some verses in James with regards to having works being important.(there are other verses too). </li>
              </ul>
              <p>so back to your topic: <strong>Is every Christian obliged to live a holy life?:</strong> My opinion is YES. Our life will need to show or exhibit our belief, otherwise our belief will not be real. Therefore we need to be very concious with what we do and how we act. Is it going to be easy? NO!</p>
              <p>However, does this holy life (or holy living) play our part in salvation? I think not. In my opinion, salvation is a GIFT of God (actually this part is scripturally stated). <strong>Salvation should lead one to holy living</strong>, and should not be <strong>Salvation needs holy living to be valid</strong>.</p>
              <p>The rationale for my personal conclusion is: what is consider HOLY before it validates salvation? Is there such a thing as holier than others? If there is none, then we will never know if we are saved or not, that being the case our salvation is never assured.</p>
              <p>Note that I am not a trained theologian, and there WILL be others who disagree with me. So to those, it's ok, no need to get too worked out.</p>
              <p>For whatever you are facing, M&amp;P, don't think that other Christians are not facing them too.... it may be sexual sins, it may be greed, it may be doubts.... take heart, we all face them sometime or other. After one thing, it will be another. Sometimes you win, sometimes you don't.... but remember that God forgives, when you go to him in with a contrite heart.</p>

After one thing, it will be another. Sometimes you win, sometimes you don't.... but remember that God forgives, when you go to him in with a contrite heart.</p>

              <p>Dear Unker CE,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>your two statements</p>
              <p>1) no, salvation is independent of holy living, Salvation was achieved by the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is a one time act, it is a gift.<br>2) yes, holy living is an integral part of salvation. If works failed or is lacking, the individual is deemed not to have salvation or not to have accepted salvation genuinely.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do have a question on the 2nd statement, that says "If works failed or is lacking, the individual is deemed not to have salvation or not to have accepted salvation genuinely."</p>
              <p>This is based on whose perception?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The reason I have question on this is</p>
              <p>As you had said "The sole condition is that the individual accepts that act as a fact and accepts Jesus as his personal saviour and allow Jesus (and the Holy Spirit) to work on him to change his life gradually." Whether of not, the acceptance of salvation is genuine, is based on whether or not the person truely and sincerely "accepts Jesus as his personal saviour and allow Jesus (and the Holy Spirit) to work on him to change his life gradually". This is a heart issue, not a work/deed issue.</p>
              <p>1) yes for us, its true, from the outside, as what Apostle James said, "show me your faith with works", we can only see if this is true and sincere by the action/deeds we do, just like we know what tree it is by the type of fruits it bear, we know what type of faith we have by the type of fruits we bear.</p>
              <p>2) no for God, for on the day the person say in his heart, that he wants to truely and sincerely "accepts Jesus as his personal saviour and allow Jesus (and the Holy Spirit) to work on him to change his life gradually", God already know if this is really true and sincere, for God knows our heart.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then I would rather say:</p>
              <p>1) (copied yours) Salvation was achieved by the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is a one time act, it is a gift. The sole condition is that the individual accepts that act as a fact and accepts Jesus as his personal saviour and allow Jesus (and the Holy Spirit) to work on him to change his life gradually.</p>
              <p>2) Holy living is a result or fruit of having received this salvation which is a gift through Christ Jesus. Falling in love in Him and knowing we now lives in Him and for Him and no longer in the flesh in sin.</p>

              <p>Actually not Vince I've always lived a good man and paid the price for it as well as getting the reward for it. Well that except in this pornography stuffs that is in and out in and out. So you are right in away that there is a gap between what I'm aspired to be and my current condition with regarding living a true Christian life. And that's what make me feel bad... ashamed.</p>
              <p>@Yamizi I think masturbating still would me me feel guilty and I believe it is a sin too.</p>
              <p>@ChinEng, if the sign of salvation is holy living I think 99.99% of the world 's Christian population at any time would go to hell well except in the earliest church history. But I agree to what you wrote mostly. Living holy is more than being a good man. Living holy is to go beyond goodness.</p>

              <p>If you could love God madly you would get anything that you asked for. But no one could love God unless God gave him/her the love for Him.</p>
              <p>How many people really truly in love with God? Very few I think. Loving God is a blessing imo we just could not cultivate the feeling ourselves.</p>
              <p>It's different with falling in love with the opposite sex. That is a selfish love in that we expect in return to get what we want from her i.e, to have her as our spouse or girlfriend for example. That is why there is always jealousy in this type of love. And that's why we could be disappointed because we expect a return for our love.</p>
              <p>A true love for God doesn't expect anything in return. Love itself is what we after. We love God madly simply because we love God madly.</p>

              <p>No one is perfect in this world, we're all human.</p>
              <p>But difference is as Christians, we have God to depend on in the good times and in the tempation-ful bad times.  And that we are justified by faith in the step we take to believe Jesus as the Christ and that He died for our sins.  And that whosoever believes shall have eternal life abstracted from John 3:16.</p>
              <p>The term 'holy' i reckon is just to describe our God almighty, because since the fall of men (and women) through Adam, we have deemed ourselves unclean and at the mercy of God.  And its only through the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross that we can be cleansed. </p>
              <p>Even if we can't always abide by His precepts, but we can TRY to live by it, and asking for forgiveness whenever we stumble coz He will pick us up again, AMEN?</p>

It is advisable that leading a holy life will give one more peace and higher spiritual level, but when we have commitments we are responsible for them. Sometimes its hard to give up too.

              <p>actually i don't quite understand your question - a little tired this morning.</p>
              <p>if your question is solely: <strong>This is based on whose perception?</strong></p>
              <p>then, my answer is: <em>it is based on some discussion i've had recently on the issue of what good works have to do with salvation....</em></p>

              <p>I would like to share this verse,</p>
              <p>Luke 17:1-3 Faith and service</p>
              <p>Jesus said to his disciples:</p>
              <p>    There will always be something that causes people to sin. But anyone who causes them to sin is in for trouble. A person who causes even one of my little followers to sin would be better off thrown into the ocean with a heavy stone tied around their neck. So be careful what you do.</p>
