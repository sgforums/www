              <p>Hi;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do we Christians need to really break all sins and live holy? so, Is living holy a requirement of being saved?</p>
              <p>first of all, is it humanly possible to really break all sins and live holy, sometimes maybe, but all the time? and in all action, thoughts and intentions?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To be honest, humanly its impossible (even the Apostle Paul have this problem).</p>
              <p>So Nope. </p>
              <p>Make it this way, if living holy a requirement of being saved and its humanly possible to break all sins and live holy, then there is no need for Christ to be scarificed on the cross.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>God Bless...</p>

              <p>are u baptised? if you are, do u still remember what does baptism means to you and God?</p>
              <p>God knows all humans are not perfect and thus have a great tendency to sin. he knows our strengths and weaknesses. if you have really done your best to please and worship God. He will not fault you. but have you really done your best to resist satan's temptations? ask yourself that and u will answer the qn u post.</p>

              <p>Yes I'm baptized. Well I still think I haven't done my best as doing the best means living holy in my opinion. In my opinion each person has the capacity(potential) to live a holy life no matter who.</p>

              <p>since you are baptized, u surely know what is expected of you already. to really live a holy life like what the bible teaches, even alot of movies, games, books u have to forgo..</p>
              <p>at least u had asked for forgiveness..but also pray for strength to be given u through the HS to resist temptations to come. next time u feel the urge to b naughty again, stop and think if it pleases God. u know He can see u wank off. den mayb u wun feel so comfy to surf naughty sites again lor.</p>

              <p>No so long ago, there was a thread that discussed whether holy living is a requirement for salvation....</p>
              <p>.....it all depends on who you are asking.</p>
              <p>the myriad of answers will consist of the following:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>no, salvation is independent of holy living.</li>
              <li>yes, holy living is an integral part of salvation.</li>

              <p>i will tell you that proponents from either side will quote verses to support individual beliefs....</p>

              <p>Don't be too disheartened with what you have flaw. Focus on what
              you're good at and pray for transformation for your
              shortcoming.</p>

              <p>Yes I agree with what you wrote that once we take a deliberate choice in committing into the faith that we sould try to follow the ideal lifestyle according to the teaching.</p>
              <p>I talked to my pastor in a confession. He said that it was normal to have weaknesses. I hate to think it as an excuse to live in sin. But after sometimes being clean from porn I fell into it again for an hour or two then regretted it, the cycle keeps repeating. It seems that I took my salvation and God for granted whenever I fell for pornography.</p>

              <p>I don't think I have to forgo a lot of movies, books and games to follow an ideal life of Christian teaching.  I'm not afraid of movies, books and games as long as they are not contradicting to my faith. Even when they are controversial I still watch, read or play them. They are after all fantasy only. I intend to break all the myth and dispelled all the lies. Watching and reading Harry Potter is not heretic, practising withcraft is. Being afraid of Harry Potter makes no sense to me because I have a God who is alive. I have no problem separating what's real and what is not. There is nothing wrong with enjoying life as a Christians. Show me your satan and I show you my God and I would bet you my whole life that yours would fled. I learn that from past experience.</p>

              <p>Actually I found that pornography has plagued most boys or young male today even those actively involved in the church activities. I found that I was 'lightly' plagued in that I no longer accumulate those stuffs in my PC or think dirty all the time(Well don't keep them if you want to get rid of the dirty thoughts as keeping them means inviting yourself to see them over and over). Could it be that in heaven there would be a great majority of women?[chuckles] I know people won't marry in heaven but they do keep their gender.</p>
