              <p>yes. but to me.. if i understand correctly, holiness isn't a state. it's an attitude.</p>
              <p>living a holy life isn't about doing the right things etc, but rather it's the attitude of wanting to choose God's way.</p>
              <p>because we're human, we're bound to do wrong things, bound to fail etc, and we're going to occationally sin all the way till we die.</p>
              <p>it's different from the "bochup-ness", like oh, i'm a christian, but i choose to go geylang because pleasing myself is more important than pleasing God or others etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so yes. we are to live a holy life, sanctified and set apart for God.</p>

              <p><br>God's grace has allowed us the chance for salvation for letting JC/Yeshua died for us.purchasing us back.</p>
              <p>however, our works are just as important in the sense that the good works we do, witnessing, acceptable worship in God's eyes, how we apply biblical principle into our lives. with all these combined with God's grace,one will be saved.that is the reward for us to keep doing his words. the gift of ever lasting life.</p>
              <p>God knows humans even though redeemed by JC/Yeshua is still imperfect. and no way can we be sinless until we are perfect again. since we imperfect beings have the strong tendency to sin inborn to us. God cannot blame us as its our limit. but when we sin, we have to truly repent and work harder to avoid commiting the same or other sins. only that way can God choose to let us off.if we were to sin again and again wilfully, we jus screwed ourselves.</p>

              <p>Oblige to live holy life.     I was reading
              the thread in Chit Chat on a naked man.  Contrarily, the
              christian called Parn has issue with the pic of naked man but in
              another thread she invites people to rape her.   So what
              holy life are you guys talking about?</p>

              <p>But being holy is part of being righteous with God.  Holiness is being set apart to do God's will; living by the Spirit instead of the flesh.  That said, I agree being holy is very difficult, we are commanded to do so nonetheless.</p>
