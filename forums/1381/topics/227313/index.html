            <div class='col-md body'>My relationship with Christ is something hard to describe...its like having someone who's really perfect to have fellowship with. He filled me with His Spirit such that i can pray in heavenly languages (i'm pentacostal), He is there whenever i seek Him, be it in blessings or tribulations. He takes my worries away when i lay it out and speak to Him. He guides me in things i do by either talking to me, giving confirmation, giving me a sense of peace. He makes me feel loved and wanted, fills me with the Joy of the Spirit, the exuberant joy of being able to worship God the Father and being able to praise the Name of Jesus..the things He does in me makes me never want to throw this relationship away, its more than juz a religion, its a relation...its more than juz finding salvation...its the kinda degree of warmth and love and acceptance that u will never ever find in someone else in the world... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> Hee wad to say...I LOVE JESUS <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
