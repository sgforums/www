              <p>So, I find it nothing wrong holding a joss stick and pay respect
                  to one's late parents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I totally agreed with Laf.</p>

              <p>The same thing can be turned around, why do you have to hold joss sticks to pay respects to your parents? It is what is in your heart that counts and not your outward show. It is ultimately best that you pay your parents respects while they are still alive, once they are dead, will they know? They are sleeping already.</p>
              <p>The other reason, and the one that you will most probably want to argue about is that using joss sticks to pay respects etc be it ancestral worship etc has to do with praying to idols and the like and it is a commandment of Yahweh (G_d) that we not do so.</p>

              <p>yes its true that respect comes from the heart and you should respect them when they were alive. as its a chinese custom inbred into chinese culture, offering of joss sticks is considered as respect for the dead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but the issue here is not the offering of joss sticks. its the insensitivities where customs is concerned. how would you feel when someone near and dear to you told you in the context of a wake that, you should not offer joss sticks as its not in my religion to do that. its not only curt, but lack of sensitivity to that person's feelings. if next time you go to a wake in a chinese tradition, you wore a cross on your neck and someone in the wake told you to remove the cross, as its not in my religion to have someone wearing a cross during a wake, how would you have felt?</p>

              <p>I know some christians will tell you that the idol you are praying are satanic or made of wood when talking about religion. they will feel pity for you because in their minds, your religion are false and the god you are praying and worshipping are false too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>by the same token, arent they also doing the same thing, ie worshipping their god. other religions can also use their interpretation in their religion that the god you are praying are also false.</p>

              <p>whether your sis believe in god or not, I think thats her perogative, as long as she does not preach you or try to convert you to her religion, but I believe she will quietly, because she wont want you to go to hell and wish you to join her in heaven instead.</p>

              <p>but having said that, no matter what religion you are in, you should adopt common sense and human values on your life and decision makings. I know a lot of people do or avoid doing things based on their holy book or religion.</p>
