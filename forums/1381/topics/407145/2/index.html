              <p>Precisely, but saying illness is God's will are the Christians not me. Read Stardust post below and he is not the only Christian who say illness and everything that happens is God's will. His post is on page 1 and I'm responding to his post. I think you do not know how my argument started.</p>
              <p>Today, I've heard another Christian said that by praying to God, the rain will stop and that kind of thingy. She said she will pray to God, hoping that it will not rain on National Day and she says everything is possible by praying to God. Sigh.......................... If that can be done, there will be no flood in Singapore and the rest of the world.</p>

              <p>I think cancer can be caused by many different factors. I should not comment if it's God will or wadsoever.</p>
              <p>But prayer is a powerful thing.It really works.</p>
              <p>I also gt frenz who always pray abt rain esp when she goes out. The prayer works.</p>
              <p>Besides rain, u can pray on health,work and many things. Prayer is a powerful thing.</p>

              <p><br>Prayers of cos some are not answered by God. There must be a good reason why it's not answered.</p>
              <p>God's ways are higher than our ways, his thoughts higher than our thoughts.</p>
              <p>But for me most of the time it works.</p>
              <p>For me, the prayers are answered in a variety of situations. So i have deep and firm belief in God.</p>
