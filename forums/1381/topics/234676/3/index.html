Jesus is the Son, not God the father.  In his time as a mortal he did sin... which is why he is surprised at the question and asks - why do you call me good?  Jesus then goes on to declare that only God (the father) is good and thus the only one that has never sinned in his entire existence.<br><br><blockquote>..... <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">oh the Solomon thing??? welll bear in mind it was written much earlier in history.... so I don't think it counted</span></strong>.<br></blockquote>Wrong again.  How can you select which parts of the bible are true and which parts are false in order to support your own argument?  In case others are wondering whether it is "counted" or not, the apostle Paul writes very clearly after Jesus' death...<br><br><blockquote><br>Romans 3:12 NIV<br>...<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">there is no one who does good, not even one</span></strong>.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think sikibi is a muslim in disguise.<br><br>Read Mat 16:17<br><br><blockquote>He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"

Jesus said to him, "Have you come to believe because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed."

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">On Christ temptation,<br><br>The Angelic Doctor, St Aquinas explains it.</span></strong><br><br><blockquote>I answer that, Christ wished to be tempted; first that He might strengthen us against temptations. Hence Gregory says in a homily (xvi in Evang.): "<strong>It was not unworthy of our Redeemer to wish to be tempted, who came also to be slain; in order that by His temptations He might conquer our temptations, just as by His death He overcame our death</strong>."<br><br>Secondly, that we might be warned, so that none, however holy, may think himself safe or free from temptation. Wherefore also He wished to be tempted after His baptism, because, as Hilary says (Super Matth., cap. iii.): "The temptations of the devil assail those principally who are sanctified, for he desires, above all, to overcome the holy. Hence also it is written (Ecclus. 2): Son, when thou comest to the service of God, stand in justice and in fear, and prepare thy soul for temptation."<br><br>Thirdly, in order to give us an example: to teach us, to wit, how to overcome the temptations of the devil. Hence Augustine says (De Trin. iv) that Christ "allowed Himself to be tempted" by the devil, "that He might be our Mediator in overcoming temptations, not only by helping us, but also by giving us an example."<br><br>Fourthly, in order to fill us with confidence in His mercy. Hence it is written (Heb. 4:15): "We have not a high-priest, who cannot have compassion on our infirmities, but one tempted in all things like as we are, without sin."</blockquote>I think its quote well explained.<br><br>http://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/TP/TP041.html#TPQ41OUTP1<br><br></div>

Not that I support him fully though ..<br><br>1. You are begging the question by saying "Ask yourself this, if man is able, why send a saviour?" HUH? You are slipping the conclusion into the premise! And what is your conclusion? That man is NOT able!<br><br>2. Disagree. Man is not created perfect, Adam and Eve were not created perfect. Why did God give us, non-perfect people, the perfect law?<br><br>Furthermore the laws were given at Sinai. According to the Christian argument, Man was already depraved then. Why did God give depraved people the "so perfect" law?<br><br>I'm sorry, but you are turning God into a treacherous God who delights in seeing His people suffer trying to fulfill the "so perfect" law.<br><br>To quote an example from a rabbi, it is like putting a "physically-challenged" person (who has no legs but two stumps) at the start line and tell him to WIN the marathon. And when he can't do it, you slap him and punish him.<br><br>3. Here is my question - what is the price God has to pay for our salvation? ZERO! Did God lose a Son? Nope! Isn't the Son sitting at the right (or issit left) hand of the Father now?<br><br>In fact, Jews paid the price because the blood is on them and their children. Anti-semitism has its origins in the New Testament.<br><br>What about the physical suffering? Crucification is cruel but there is no need to exaggerate the punishment and suffering. The Jews have their fair share of martyrs. In one poignant episode, a sage was burned at the stake wrapped in no other than the Torah scroll that he taught despite the prohibition from Rome on teaching the Torah!</div>
