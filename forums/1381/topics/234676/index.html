            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Icemoon:<br>Actually it is not possible that you don't sin. Unless you are God. By the way, the Protestants think Jesus cannot be tempted. If he cannot be tempted, where lies the value in the temptation?</blockquote>When Jesus was reincarnated as a mortal and forgot his memories as a God, he did sin numerous times as a child and growing up into adulthood.  In this sense he is truly a normal human like the rest of us.  The only thing different is that Mary told him that he is the Son of God.  The other things Mary taught Jesus was to be righteous - firstly to do good deeds and try not to sin, if this fails... to always repent of his sins and have God absolve them according to the Jewish customs, and to make a sincere effort not to sin again.<br><br>Eventually Jesus learnt to control his human propensity for sinning after many failures while growing up and was able to live a perfect life without commiting any sin and doing only good deeds.  This was the time when God called Jesus to perform his ministry.<br><br>So where lies the value in the temptation?<br><br>Satan already had proof that Jesus could sin by watching him grow up.  Thus the temptation is valid.  Jesus' life is an example for all of us to follow that it is possible to sin less and less until eventually we have no need to sin at all if we are sincere in repentance and cultivate a good character and do good deeds.<br><br>But Jesus is "sinless"?<br><br>Yes, Jesus is sinless because he make the effort to repent his sins and have God absolve them.  Once our sins are absolved by God there is no more record in God's eyes.  Thus we can also be sinless and ascend to heaven like Enoch and Elijah.</div>

Satan could have leverage on his intelligence. If you believe the serpent was Satan, then Satan is one cunning bast*ard. In general, good guys very hard to win cunning people.<br><br>No joke .. Satan dared to meet God alone in Job. He even mingled with other angels (presumably good angels) and he still bo daiji. In the end, Satan escaped unscathed.</div>
