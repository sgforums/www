            <div class='col-md body'>Does Aquinas reasoning helps answer the thread?<br><br><blockquote>I answer that, Christ wished to be tempted; first that He might strengthen us against temptations. Hence Gregory says in a homily (xvi in Evang.): "<strong>It was not unworthy of our Redeemer to wish to be tempted, who came also to be slain; in order that by His temptations He might conquer our temptations, just as by His death He overcame our death."</strong><br><br>Secondly, that we might be warned, so that none, however holy, may think himself safe or free from temptation. Wherefore also He wished to be tempted after His baptism, because, as Hilary says (Super Matth., cap. iii.): "The temptations of the devil assail those principally who are sanctified, for he desires, above all, to overcome the holy. Hence also it is written (Ecclus. 2): Son, when thou comest to the service of God, stand in justice and in fear, and prepare thy soul for temptation."<br><br>Thirdly, in order to give us an example: to teach us, to wit, how to overcome the temptations of the devil. Hence Augustine says (De Trin. iv) that Christ "allowed Himself to be tempted" by the devil, "that He might be our Mediator in overcoming temptations, not only by helping us, but also by giving us an example."<br><br>Fourthly, in order to fill us with confidence in His mercy. Hence it is written (Heb. 4:15): "We have not a high-priest, who cannot have compassion on our infirmities, but one tempted in all things like as we are, without sin."</blockquote><blockquote> I answer that, As stated above (Article [1], ad 2), Christ of His own free-will exposed Himself to be tempted by the devil, just as by His own free-will He submitted to be killed by His members; else the devil would not have dared to approach Him. Now the devil prefers to assail a man who is alone, for, as it is written (Eccles. 4:12), "if a man prevail against one, two shall withstand him." And so it was that Christ went out into the desert, as to a field of battle, to be tempted there by the devil. Hence Ambrose says on Lk. 4:1, that "<strong>Christ was led into the desert for the purpose of provoking the devil. For had he," i.e. the devil, "not fought, He," i.e. Christ, "would not have conquered.</strong>" He adds other reasons, saying that "Christ in doing this set forth the mystery of Adam's delivery from exile," who had been expelled from paradise into the desert, and "set an example to us, by showing that the devil envies those who strive for better things."<br><br>Reply to Objection 1: As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ix): "Christ was known to the demons only so far as He willed; not as the Author of eternal life, but as the cause of certain temporal effects," from which they formed a certain conjecture that Christ was the Son of God. <strong>But since they also observed in Him certain signs of human frailty, they did not know for certain that He was the Son of God: wherefore (the devil) wished to tempt Him</strong>. This is implied by the words of Mt. 4:2,3, saying that, after "He was hungry, the tempter" came "to Him," because, as Hilary says (Super Matth., cap. iii), <strong>"Had not Christ's weakness in hungering betrayed His human nature, the devil would not have dared to tempt Him.</strong>" Moreover, this appears from the very manner of the temptation, when he said: "If Thou be the Son of God." Which words Ambrose explains as follows (In Luc. iv): "What means this way of addressing Him, save that, though he knew that the Son of God was to come, yet he did not think that He had come in the weakness of the flesh?"</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Icemoon:<br>I have to say my view on this is closer to Skibi than the Christians. Not that I support him fully though ..<br><br>To quote an example from a rabbi, it is like putting a "physically-challenged" person (who has no legs but two stumps) at the start line and tell him to WIN the marathon. And when he can't do it, you slap him and punish him.<br></blockquote>Excellent example.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Icemoon:<br>3. Here is my question - what is the price God has to pay for our salvation? ZERO! Did God lose a Son? Nope! Isn't the Son sitting at the right (or issit left) hand of the Father now?<br><br>In fact, Jews paid the price because the blood is on them and their children. Anti-semitism has its origins in the New Testament.<br><br>What about the physical suffering? Crucification is cruel but there is no need to exaggerate the punishment and suffering. The Jews have their fair share of martyrs. In one poignant episode, a sage was burned at the stake wrapped in no other than the Torah scroll that he taught despite the prohibition from Rome on teaching the Torah!</blockquote>From the mainstream view the answer is indeed zero.  However from the bible's point of view, the answer is that Jesus gambled his Godhood to prove that God's law of righteousness is fair and can be kept by everyone.<br><br><blockquote>Romans 8:3 NIV<br>For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the sinful nature, God did by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful man</span></strong> to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in sinful man,</blockquote>Jesus came to earth as a sinful man thus forfeiting his right to heaven and to be God from the very beginning.  If he did not purify himself within 30 years he will be destined to die as a sinner and never ascend back to heaven as a God.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aquinas has clearly explained why Jesus was tempted.<br><br><blockquote>I answer that, Christ wished to be tempted; first that He might strengthen us against temptations.

Hence it is written (Heb. 4:15): "We have not a high-priest, who cannot have compassion on our infirmities, but one tempted in all things like as we are, without sin."</blockquote>More importantly the Gospels said nothing of this sort. By sola scriptura, u are making a huge assumption.<br><br>John 5:23 - Jesus equates Himself with the Father, "whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him."<br><br>John 10:30 - Jesus says, "I and the Father are one." They are equal<br><br>Matt. 4:7; Luke 4:12 - Jesus tells satan, "you shall not tempt the Lord your God" in reference to Himself.<br><br>John 8:58 - Jesus says, "Before Abraham was, I AM." Exodus 3:14 - "I AM" means "Yahweh," which means God.<br><br>Ur belief did not even survive the test of time. As such, it cannot be the Truth as Christ said the gates of Hell will not prevail against it. Since that doctrine was killed, the gates of hades has indeed prevailed so it cant be the truth. Christ will not blind us from the Truth and leave us orphan.</div>

This just strengthens the argument that God has forsaken him. Or that Jesus thought God has forsaken him.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Hmm, Jesus was resurrected. And if Skibi theory is true, why is Jesus called Lord before he was borned?</strong></blockquote>Actually I dunno what is his theory. Still trying to fit him into one of the ancient heresies.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
