According to the bible this took him 30 years of training.  Knowledge of the scripture is not the issue here as being highly intelligent, Jesus was already well versed in the scripture when he was twelve years old.<br><br><blockquote>Luke 2:42,46 - 47 NIV<br>When he was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast, according to the custom.<br><br>After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers.</blockquote>Consider also...<br><br><blockquote>Matthew 13:54-57 NIV<br>Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?" they asked. "Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary, and aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas? Aren't all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?" And they took offense at him.</blockquote>It is recorded in the bible that people that knew Jesus as a child were astonished when he visited them during his ministry.  This shows that Jesus led a normal childhood and had the same failings as a normal boy would when he was growing up.  Thus the people that knew him closely in the first 20+ years of his life regarded him as a normal person instead of the Son of God, having witness his shortcomings as a child.<br><br>Side topic:  This text also proves that Mary had other children with Joseph besides Jesus.  It even lists their names clearly and mentions that Jesus had sisters as well.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Im gonna follow Summa Theologica Format<br><br>Objection 1:<br><br>Jesus began his ministry only when he was confident of not sinning. According to the bible this took him 30 years of training. Knowledge of the scripture is not the issue here as being highly intelligent, Jesus was already well versed in the scripture when he was twelve years old.<br><br>Objection 2:<br><br>It is recorded in the bible that people that knew Jesus as a child were astonished when he visited them during his ministry.

By arguing that Christ was not divine and that any man could be divine in 30 years of hard work is purely New-Age heresy. I denounce u Skibi, I denounce you.<br><br>Rebuttal 1:<br><br>Skibi argues that Christ was MAN until he turned 30. His arguments points that Christ (as man) was able to become GOD in merely 30 years. This is hardly a position of rationality as it bellitles God to merely perfected Man. I point the verse of John 1:1 and 1;14<br><br><blockquote>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. - John 1:1 </blockquote><blockquote>And the Word became flesh 9 and made his dwelling among us, and we saw his glory, the glory as of the Father's only Son, full of grace and truth - John 1:14</blockquote>The verses clearly proves that Christ was borned divine. Christ was not borned purely mortal or else John would have been mistaken as he argues that God was made flesh in the very first chapter of the Gospel.<br><br>Rebuttal 2:<br><br>This rebuttal seeks to go further and show that Christ was divine from conception. Clearly in Luke it says so:<br><br><blockquote>When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the infant leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth, filled with the holy Spirit,<br>42<br>cried out in a loud voice and said, "Most blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.<br>43<br>And how does this happen to me, that the <strong>mother of my Lord </strong>14 should come to me?<br>44<br>For at the moment the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the <strong>infant in my womb leaped for joy. </strong>45<br>Blessed are you who believed 15 that what was spoken to you by the Lord would be fulfilled."<br>46<br>And Mary said: 16 "My soul proclaims the <strong>greatness of the Lord</strong>; </blockquote>This clearly shows that Jesus was Lord even in Mary's womb as Elizabeth inspired by the Holy Spirit calls her Mother of Lord. The holy spirit cannot lie so we can safely assume Mary is the Mother of God and hence Jesus MUST naturally be God since conception.<br><br>Rebuttal 3:<br><br>The verse u have quoted has been refuted by elementary apologist and even the Reformers.<br><br><blockquote>Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and <strong>his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas,</strong> and Mary of Magdala.  John 19:25<br><br>Among them were Mary Magdalene and <strong>Mary the mother of James and Joseph,</strong> and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. Mat 27:56<br><br>Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James<strong>, the son of Alphaeus</strong>, and Thaddeus; Mat 10</blockquote>:3<br><br>Alpheus = Clopas in Aramic.<br><br>So James is the son of Clopas whose wife is Mary (Virgin's sister) and hence James and Joseph are Jesus cousins. Mark 6:3, the word 'brother' can also meen cousins in Hebrew. And Scripture ALONE clearly proves they are his cousins.<br><br></div>

I am not sure,<br>(Just my opinion, not really found in Bible) perhaps He need to grow older first as the people may not take the teaching of a young man seriously? perhaps He have to wait for people to be ready? or most likely, He is waiting for John the Baptist to begin his ministry and pave the way for Him as in prepare the heart of the people?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
