              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>How do God's Ten Commandments apply today?</strong> <br><br>Many people today feel that God's <span class="dynlink">Ten Commandments</span> are no longer valid because they do not apply to our current society. They look to the Ten Commandments as being outdated and full of inflammatory language which doesn't sit well with our politically-correct viewpoint. The Ten Commandments are also considered by many people to have been abolished by Jesus when He made a new covenant between God and man with His death and resurrection. <br><br>The problem in thinking that Jesus came to abolish the Ten Commandments is that Jesus never claimed to have abolished the Ten Commandments. Instead, in Matthew 5:17-18 Jesus says, "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished." <br><br>In this verse, Jesus gives a clear indication that the Ten Commandments are still to be followed and adhered to even in our generation and every generation to come until the day that Jesus returns. So what does all this mean to us and how do God's Ten Commandments apply today? <br><br>God's Ten Commandments are still valid because Jesus declared them to be. We are still called by God to honor the Ten Commandments and obey what they call us to do. Jesus also told us that obeying the Law or the Ten Commandments is not just a superficial act, but one that carries the essence of the law into our thoughts and hearts. <br><br>Jesus proclaimed that if we <em>think</em> something that is contrary to one of the Ten Commandments, we are to view it in the same light as if we had physically carried out the act. For instance, if we think to ourselves it is okay to slander or gossip about our neighbors, we are in essence breaking the ninth Commandment, "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor." If we are married and one day we see a handsome man or a pretty woman walking down the street and we lust in our hearts for them, we are breaking the seventh of God's Ten Commandments, "Thou shalt not commit adultery." <br><br>As Christians, we should not think that since Paul tells us "we are set free from the law" the Ten Commandments no longer apply to us. Paul is telling us that because we are now in a relationship with Christ, we are forgiven of our indiscretions when it comes to following the Ten Commandments. We are still called throughout the New Testament to obey God's Ten Commandments. <br><br>The Ten Commandments also apply to non-believers because in the end, they will be judged by the essence of the law and the Ten Commandments. This means that if they are guilty of breaking even one of the Ten Commandments, be it a lack of respect or reverence for God or some indiscretion between non-believers, it will be as if they were guilty of breaking all the commandments. <br><br>God's Ten Commandments are still the standard by which we should strive to live our lives. They are not some outdated laws that were only to be used by Moses. God meant the Ten Commandments to be permanent guidelines that we are still to follow in order to have a more meaningful relationship with God and each other</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>The Ten Commandments and Jesus - What did Jesus think of the Ten Commandments?</strong> <br><br>Ever wonder what Jesus thought of the Ten Commandments? The answer can be found in John 8:36 where it says, "If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed." <br><br>The Ten Commandments represent the law given by God to his people by way of Moses. In addition to defining God's idea of perfection, they provide a moral code for governing our lives. Most of us believe we are able to keep these commandments, but the truth is-none of us can. God's standards are so high, they are impossible to perfectly meet. <br><br>What did Jesus think of the Ten Commandments? He agreed that they are impossible for you and me to keep. That's why He came. <br><br>As a man, Jesus understood our limitations. But because He was also fully God, He was able to become the perfect, sinless man on our behalf. God's law demands a sacrifice for breaking His law. Jesus became that sacrifice. <br><br>If the Ten Commandments are impossible for us to keep, why did God give them? If we look closely, we'll see that the commandments are based on a simple, positive foundation of love. All of us would rather hear about what we can do rather than what we are forbidden to do. But an honest examination of the Ten Commandments reveals that God's message contains more what "to do" than "not to do" items. <br><br>The Ten Commandments teach us how to first love God, and then love our neighbor. When God is first in our lives, the rest comes naturally. Let's take a walk together through the 10 Commandments. . .where we'll discover they lead to Jesus. <br><br>The first commandment says, "You shall have no other gods before me" (Exodus 20:3). In other words, love God above everything. It's all too easy for us to push God aside in favor of the latest fad, fashion trend, or superstar. We can become easily obsessed with wrong ideas about success. If God is truly first in our lives, we'll find balance and grow to godly maturity. In time, we'll also discover we can be satisfied with what we have. <br><br>God wants us to use his name positively, not in vain. He wants us to concentrate on his word and his ways, on remembering the Sabbath day by honoring God with our choices. It is good to honor our father and mother; we should always treat family members with respect. <br><br>Do not kill, do not commit adultery, and do not steal. Those three commandments value life and relationship and respecting others. <br><br>Not bearing false witness against your neighbor, and not coveting what belongs to your neighbor applies to men and women, young and old -- everyone. Consider how much more peaceful our world would be if everyone kept these commandments. <br><br>Each commandment is a separate rule but together they offer directions on how to live without sin. As long as we are in this world, we will find it difficult not to sin. The good news is, Jesus came to rescue us from the penalty of sin. This does not mean we should willfully sin; as we've discussed, the Ten Commandments are given for our personal and mutual benefit. But if we accept the sacrifice of Jesus on our behalf, we can escape the judgment for sin -- which is eternal life, separated from God. <br><br>So, do you wonder what Jesus says about the 10 commandments? <br><br>His answer lies at the foot of a cross, but started a long time ago, when God used His Almighty finger to write some commandments to live by. And the one time He did, they were meant for all time. <br><br>Jesus did not do away with the moral law at the cross, but his sacrifice for mankind revealed the grace and forgiveness available to us. <br><br>If we live by these laws on our own, we would know heaven on earth. Because we are unable to, we live in a sinful world. That's why we need a Savior, and His name is Jesus. <br><br>What does Jesus say about the Ten Commandments? He asks us to look at the Cross of Calvary where he died to set us free. </span></p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>What are the Ten Commandments?</strong> <br><br>What are the Ten Commandments? The Ten Commandments are ten primary laws God gave humans to follow and obey. Jesus referred to these Ten Commandments in Matthew 22:37-40. In response to a question asked by one of the Pharisees, "Jesus replied: ' Love the Lord your God with all of your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and the greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments." <br><br>The Ten Commandments can be found in a couple different places in the Bible: Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5, of the Old Testament. We will be referencing the Ten Commandments found in Exodus 20. <br><br><strong>The first</strong> - Exodus 20:3: "You shall have no other gods before me." In Exodus 20:2, God states who He is and why He would permit no other gods before Him. He is the creator of life, and He brought the Israelites (our ancestors from whence creation started) out of a land of slavery. God does the same today through His Son, Jesus Christ. Jesus offers us deliverance from slavery, or bondage, to self-indulgent, self-destructive behavior (sin). Those who freely choose Jesus find real life here and eternal life with Him. <br><br><strong>The second</strong> - Exodus 20:4-6: "You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand {generations} of those who love me and keep my commandments." God, who is all wise and all knowing, realizes what happens to us when we worship anything other than our Creator. Because He wants the very best for us, and because He alone can handle being the object of worship, He adds this critical instruction. <br><br><strong>The third</strong> -Exodus 20:7: "You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name." God tells us it is imperative to be truthful and honest at all times. Many biblical scholars point to the example of a witness in a court case. As God's witnesses, we are not to swear by God's name falsely or under any false pretenses. In Matthew 5:33-37, Jesus discusses oath taking. Our answer, He states, should always be either yes or no. We must strive to be known for our honesty, instead of the need to take an oath. <br><br><strong>The fourth</strong> - Exodus 20:8-11: "Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your animals, nor the alien within your gates. For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy." On the seventh day of creation, God rested. Does God need to rest? Of course not! He did this as an example for us. In our contemporary, 24/7 society, we tend to think the Sabbath rest is optional. God does not! Jesus tells us in Mark 2:27 that: "The Sabbath is made for man, not man for the Sabbath." Which day of the week may not be important, but one of the seven needs to be devoted to godly rest. <br><br><strong>The Fifth</strong> - Exodus 20:12: "Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you." Whether or not our parents have been respectful toward us, the Bible commands that we honor them. Note that this commandment comes with a reason why: honor your parents SO THAT you may live long in the land. <br><br><strong>The sixth</strong> - Exodus 20:13: "You shall not murder." Intentionally taking someone's life is murder. In Matthew 5:21-22, Jesus tells us that anger and hurtful words are like murder. Romans 13 discusses Christian behavior regarding obedience to civil authority and patriotism. Scholars believe, and Old Testament sources support, that protecting one's country as in civil defense or during a time of war is not the same as murder. <br><br><strong>The seventh</strong> - Exodus 20:14: "You shall not commit adultery." Adultery is engaging in a sexual relationship outside of one's marriage. Jesus takes this further when he tells us in Matthew 5:28 we commit adultery when we even look on another person with thoughts of desire. <br><br><strong>The eighth</strong> - Exodus 20:15: "You shall not steal." Do not take <em>anything</em> that is not yours. In today's culture, one of the most prevalent forms of stealing involves copyrighted material. We may think it is OK to download music we don't pay for or gain access to software we did not purchase a license for. . .but the Bible says it is stealing. <br><br><strong>The ninth</strong> - Exodus 20:16: "You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor." In court, false testimony is called perjury and is punishable by law. Our testimony, whether before a judge or in the courtroom of life, should be true and accurate -- free of false information. <br><br><strong>The tenth</strong> - Exodus 20:17: "You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor." God wants us to learn to be content with what we have and not to desire what our neighbor has. He knows where jealousy and envy lead; His desire is to spare us the consequences of coveting. </span></p></div>

              <p>Althought we dun depend on keeping commandments for salvation as it's impossible to keep all commandments perfectly without breaking them. Break one commandment equals to breaking all commandments.</p>
