              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">August 13, 2011<br><br><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Dear brother and sister in Christ, <br></strong><br> Blessed hour of reading.<br><br> In Jesus name I am about to share you this letter. One morning 
              this week before going to school, I was caught up with the t-shirt worn by a lady. It was written
               there <strong>LOVE</strong>. “Nice print”, I said to myself but my eyes get on focusing unto the letter <em><strong>O</strong></em>.  Inside that letter was the inverted broken cross <em>(see the image below)</em>. I never wonder anymore because in my mind I know what the meaning of that symbol is.<br> <br> I want to share this thing to you my friend, for in my heart a 
              voice is sounding for the revelation of truth. I know many people like 
              me, those people who are called believers of Jesus Christ – the Lord 
              Jesus Christ in the Bible, are explaining and revealing also what God 
              has showed them. <br><br> Now, let’s get started with this symbol. During the Dark Age times <strong>this symbol, inverted broken cross, is the symbol of anti-Christ and was very popular.</strong> A symbol of course is the not just an emblem but an <strong>identity</strong> of a certain group or organization or a man. Anti-Christ are people who
               are against Jesus Christ- the Lord Jesus Christ in the Bible, I said it
               Jesus Christ in the Bible because there are many Jesus who are 
              “preaching and teaching” of many occults, false religions and groups of 
              people. <br><br> Maybe you’re thinking of this, “SO WHAT IF I 
              ALSO WEAR T-SHIRT WITH THIS SYMBOL”, or who cares if I had it?  First I 
              want to ask you, if you are a student wearing your uniform, isn’t that 
              you are telling your a student of certain school. If you are an employee
               wearing uniform, you’re telling others that you are an employee with 
              that certain company or our government. What I am telling is that, <strong>what you wear tells who you are.</strong> <br><br> Second thinking you might thinking is, ANYWAY I AM NOT BELONG TO
               THAT SO CALLED ANTI-CHRIST, IT IS JUST A T-SHIRT. We have our saying 
              and perhaps legalities where it states, “IGNORANCE OF THE LAW IS NOT AN 
              EXCUSE.” Well, in addition to that symbol, a man who wears that, is 
              UNCONCIOUSLY telling that he is MOCKING the LORD JESUS CHRIST in the 
              Bible. That symbol, created by the anti-Christ, has the goal to expose 
              it to people who didn’t knew yet it’s meaning for them to help their 
              allies-evil spirits to work on certain place even in your home and for 
              the mockery to Jesus Christ –in the Bible.  If you are a TRUE Christian,
               anti-Christ can’t cast a spell on you, even those practicing <em>Curse</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> or sorcerers - because they are afraid of who is in you who is JESUS CHRIST-in the Bible. But<strong> you, yourself can cast a spell on yourself. </strong><br><br> My very dearest friend, I wrote this letter for you because as 
              your brother in Christ, I want to tell how I care for my brethren like 
              you. I wrote this not because I am saying that you are bad person when 
              you are already using this symbol. But I’m just reminding that we should
               not be partakers of the evilness of this world.  That symbol is against
               God. You are a good creature created by God to do good things<em> (read Ephesians 2: 10)</em><br><br> May our God bless you with more wisdom and revelation. <br><br><br> Brother in Christ,<br><br><br><br> <em> Bro. Shamgar Mangida</em><br><br><br><br><br><em>This
               symbol below was big in the hippy era and still shows up imbedded in 
              with other occult symbols.  This is the Teutonic rune of Death. It is a 
              circle around an upside down broken cross.  It is interesting that the 
              ECU Building in Brussels was build in the shape of a broken cross<br><br>want more satanic or occult symbols click this link:</em><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.christhingych.com/DemonicSymbols/index.htm">http://www.christhingych.com/DemonicSymbols/index.htm</a></span></p>
