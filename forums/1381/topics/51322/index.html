            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Beyond Miracles and On to Jesus<br>Dr. Adrian Rogers<br>Love Worth Finding</strong></span><br><br>I believe in miracles, but I trust in Jesus. If you believe the Bible, you know that God is a miracle-working God. And God is not limited in any degree nor any respect. He is totally sovereign. Do you believe that? I hope you do. Believe in miracles, but don't put your faith in miracles. Put your faith and your trust in the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>Let's look at the miracle of the feeding of the five thousand as recorded in John 6. Great multitudes were following Jesus at that time, but why? John 6:2 gives us the answer, "And a great multitude followed him, because they saw His miracles which He did on them that were diseased". It is because <span style="font-style: italic;">they saw His miracles</span>. And people do that today, do they not? Now there are three things I want you to see about moving beyond miracles and on to JesusÂ…<br><br><span class="large"><strong>There Is No Problem Too Big For Jesus To Solve</strong></span><br><br>Do you have a problem today? Read John 6:1- 14. There was a monumental problem that day - 5,000 hungry people and hardly a bite of food! Jesus said to Phillip, "Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?" And Phillip answered, "Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little."<br><br>Now why did Jesus ask Phillip where they were going to buy bread? Was it because Jesus was seeking advice? No, John says that Jesus knew what He was going to do. Was He trying to learn something about Phillip? No, He already knew all about Phillip. Jesus wanted Phillip to gain some insight into himself. Phillip calculated the cost of feeding the people, but He left Jesus out of the equation.<br><br>You may have a very serious problem. Take that problem and double it. Now, double it again. Now, I want to ask you a question. Is it too big for God? Of course not. He is the Lord. The first part of Genesis 18:14 says, "Is any thing too hard for the LORD?" Put this down big, plain, and straight. There is no problem too big for Jesus to solve. Do you believe that? I hope you do.<br><br><span class="large"><strong>There Is No Person Too Small For Jesus To Use</strong></span><br><br>When Jesus solves problems, He uses people. Who was the person Jesus used in the miracle recorded in John 6? A little lad. Andrew, Simon Peter's brother found someone, "There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many" (John 6:9).<br><br>Here was a little lad and a little lunch. Meager in quantity, meager in quality, but the Lord Jesus blessed and fed the multitude with this little lad's lunch. And Jesus is blessing and feeding you and me today, two thousand years later.<br><br>Do you think this little lad went away hungry? When he gave it all to the Lord Jesus, then Jesus gave back to him. You cannot "out-give" God. Luke 6:38 says, "Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again."<br><br>God is not asking you to give what you don't have, He's asking you to give what you do have. God specializes in doing extraordinary things with ordinary people. You may be too big for God to use but you'll never be to small for God to use!<br><br><strong><span class="large">There Is No Hunger Too Deep For Jesus To Satisfy</span></strong><br><br>After Jesus fed the five thousand, He gave the message in the miracle - to go beyond the miracle and on to Himself. Open your Bible and read John 6:22-65.<br><br>Jesus said, "The only reason you want Me is because of the bread and the fish." In John 6:27, He gives them a command, "Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for Him hath God the Father sealed."<br><br>Then said they to Him, "What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?" (John 6:28 ). Jesus answered, "This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent" (John 6:29). This is what it's all about. That we believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>Jesus said, "I am the bread of life: he that cometh to Me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on Me shall never thirst" (John 6:35). Here is the message in the miracle. Jesus. You should seek nothing more, you should settle for nothing less.<br><br>You need Jesus - not some creed, code, or cause. You don't go beyond Jesus. You may go deeper into Jesus, but you'll never go beyond Jesus. The table is set. Come and dine.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>agreed! nice words.. but one of the reasons is tt why we dun put our faith in miracles is that cuz satan oso knows some cheap skate miracles. and we may be fooled and led astray. be God chaser. not miracle chaser.. but i tink in the Word, Jesus said smth like, "Do not believe me unless I do what my Father does. But if I do it, even though you do not believe me, believe the miracles, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father"<br><br>miracles are God's way of saying "yoo hoo! look at me, i exist and can work power in your life, this is just a demo, now, watch me work THROUGH you and IN you. just listen and obey."  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>God's miracles ultimately leads to salvation and building his church and people.<br><br>but when we become miracle chaser, satan goes "yoohoo! i exist too, look, i am  "god" and i can give you the same power, without any :price tags" forget abt your God, i'm "better"..<br><br>satan's miracles ultimately leads to distruction, bondage, death, and damnation<br><br>then we fall..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>but to show i am not a spiritual giant.. i am having problems believing that God is ultimately the provider.. i always leave him out of the equation of life.<br><br>its easy to read abt His providence.. but its not always so that i experience it. i only see my darker side. and my suffering  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br></div>
