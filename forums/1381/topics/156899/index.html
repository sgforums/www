It is enough to say that doomsday "prophecy" has been around since the resurrection of Christ, but to attribute each calamity to God, because He wants to punish these "sinful" people is totally unnecessary and uncalled for. What makes you less sinful than the folks in New Orleans or Bali or Bandar Aceh?<br><br>In each largescale calamity (naturally or man-made) there will be Christians (or Jews) who suffers. Can you then say that these people deserved to be punished? Or are you going to state that in the view of God's plan these folks are collateral damage?<br><br>In the local cases, be it, chopping kids or maids, or murder, they are part and parcel of social ills. The multi-car accident at any expressway, or the number of NS men dying? Or the issue with the Maths question in PSLE? God's hand in it?<br><br>If you choke on food and think that God is trying to tell you not to eat too much, that's your own business. But please to attempt to "spiritualise" the experience by saying that God is trying to warn all mankind not to eat too much.</div>

Saddam had killed &amp; tortured many political opponents like the Kurds &amp; opposition members. As many as a few million Iraqis r in exile if i got it correct.
