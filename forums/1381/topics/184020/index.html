            <div class='col-md body'>Let's have some humour in the house!<br><br><strong>The Answer?</strong><br><br>A new pastor moved into town and went out one Saturday to visit his parishioners. All went well until he came to one house. It was obvious that someone was home, but no one came to the door even after he had knocked several times. Finally, he took out his card and wrote on the back: Revelation 3:20 and stuck it in the door.<br><br>The next day, as he was counting the offering he found his card in the collection plate. Below his message was the notation Genesis 3:10.<br><br>Revelation 3:20 reads: "Behold I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice, and opens the door, I will come in to him, and will dine with him, and he with me."<br><br><strong>Time For Church!</strong><br><br>Genesis 3:10 reads: "And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked."<br><br>One Sunday morning, a mother went in to wake her son and tell him it was time to get ready for church, to which he replied, "I'm not going."<br><br>"Why not?" she asked.<br><br>"I'll give you two good reasons," he said. "One, they don't like me, and two, I don't like them."<br><br>His mother replied, "I'll give YOU two good reasons why you SHOULD go to church. One, you're 54 years old, and two, you're the pastor!"<br><br><strong>A Sure Cure!</strong><br><br>hree Pastors in the south were having lunch in a diner. One said "Ya know, since summer started I've been having trouble with bats in my loft and attic at church. I've tried everything--noise, spray, cats--nothing seems to scare them away.<br><br>Another said "Yea, me too. I've got hundreds living in my belfry and in the narthex attic. I've even had the place fumigated, and they won't go away."<br><br>The third said, "I baptized all mine, and made them members of the church... Haven't seen one back since!!!"<br><br></div>
