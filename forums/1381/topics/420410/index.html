              <p>You are unfair to God.</p>
              <p>Why you blame Him of the incident? Why don;t you blame the US government for not installing power lines underground? Why don't you blame the contractor for not installing a better power lines? Why don't you blame the man for not buying proper Fire Extinguishers?</p>
              <p>Is God your servant to do what you think He must do? Don't you think God has different thinking with you?</p>
              <p>And most of all, if you don't believe in God then what is the point to ask Him to be responsible? You are being inconsistent yourself, aren't you?

              <p>Please think about this: God has the authority, but men wants freedom, so men have to take responsibility.</p>
