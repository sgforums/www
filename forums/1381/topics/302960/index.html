            <div class='col-md body'>Top Ten Signs You're a Foolish Christian<br><br>10. You vigorously preach the existence of God, yet you frequently blame other supernatural beings for all the evils in the world, all the natural disasters, and everything else under the sun that is wrong in modern society.<br><br>9. You feel insulted and "dehumanized" when evolutionists say that people evolved from micro-organisms, but you have no problem with the creationist claim that we all were created in the image and likeness of a god,  sans his superpowers.<br><br>8. You criticize Atheists who believe in science and evidence, and say that it can't possibly be true because they're just phenomena created by god, yet you never question the bible which was written and sanctioned by mere men.<br><br>7. You can't seem to understand the primary differences between fundamental Muslims and fundamental Christians (Muslims believe in the god while Christians adores the holy man).<br><br>6. You say that evolution is full of fairytales, yet you believe all life forms including plants, trees, insects, birds, fish, reptiles and mammals were created from a snap of the finger - As if the bible isnÂ’t the biggest fairytale of them all.<br><br>5. You laugh at the scientists, even though they have calculated the odds of life forming by natural processes to be estimated less than 1 chance in 10 to the 40,000 power, much less than the number of galaxies in the universe Â– But you find nothing wrong with believing that the universe, billions of years old, was created only ten thousend years ago.<br><br>4. You accuse fundamental Muslims of being intolerant, judgmental and hateful, while you foam at the mouth calling them freaking lunatics, ignorant, weak-minded, stupid fundies, and hateful bigots.<br><br>3. You ignore scientific concepts like cause and effect, and you don't realize that a closed system can be defined however the observer wants, so you throw out technological phrases to try to ignore the implications of thermodynamics by saying the laws of physics are not set in stone.<br><br>2. While all evidence, logic and reasoning point to evolution and absolute truth, you prefer to hide behind relativism and a theory of creationism which does not, in fact, describe the creation of the universe at all, or why concepts of good and evil or morality exist.<br><br>1. Christianity fails to adequately explain the existence of forever evolving world, for it rejects the existence of an eternally changing universe. Christianity cannot offer man any eternal significance whatsoever. Flase hope in afterlife is insufficient, for then we live to await death -- there is no purpose in a universe full of supernatural overtone.</div>
