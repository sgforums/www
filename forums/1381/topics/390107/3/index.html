              500 years ago? The writers of the books of the bible wrote them almost 2,000 years ago and long before that for the old testament. Scriptures or holy book is not talking about contemporary things that will be out of date in a couple hundred years. What has been revealed in those books are still relevant today in regard with heaven, hell or world of the dead. Heaven and hell are still prophecies that will come soon and at the last day.

              The dead according to the Jewish people at the time and according to the bible descend to the world of the dead until Christ second coming.
              Just that nowadays mainstream Christian teaching has changed that teaching into immediate life after death and hence immediate judgment after death. Then went on to tell about awaiting physical resurrection even when one's supposedly already with the Lord in heaven. And the bible NEVER teach the resurrection of the physical bodies
                                <br><br>
              The early Christian concept of life after death is completely different from one advocated by the mainstream Christianity today! Many Christian has stopped being critical when reading the bible thus totally not understanding or misunderstand the concept of life after death that the bible teaches and instead accept other man's words for it. But I can't blame them I was one of them too and I changed not because my own wit and wisdom.

            <div class='col-md body'>If the early church members were alive this day they will find themselves the ONLY minority. even the denominations that advocate the descend of the dead into the world of the dead instead of immediate judgment fail in other interpretation that should have been OBVIOUS. For one the Jehovah witness believe that the world is going to be around forever. While the 7th day Adventist believe in a great prophet of theirs that the world doesn't know. I'm not saying that he or she was not a great prophet but [most] modern prophets do not work in public like the ancient prophets of Israel then and there's simply no need at all to give them rosy acknowledgment and praises. You don't praise the tool but the maker of the tool.</div>
