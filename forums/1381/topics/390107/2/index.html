              <p>Hi Goo...off track abit...is killing an ant a bad karma? I think
              so. Ant also a living thing. Killing an ant will have bad karma on
              oneself.</p>

              You can't read the bible like that. The notion that heaven is above us while hell is below the earth doesn't mean that heaven is literally above us and hell is literally below earth.
              The notion that heaven is above the earth means that the state of life on heaven is above the state of life on earth, and the notion that hell is below earth means that the state of life on hell is below that on earth. The same for the world of the dead that is referred to as below the earth which just simply means that the dead state of life is below that than the living people on earth.

              Not true....even if an unrepentant went on to become the pope he would still go to hell in the end. However one cannot expect to be given eternal life or even eternal power based on one's own merit because nothing could pay for eternal life or even eternal power. Not even a trillion lifetime of suffering or a trillion lifetime of self sacrifice. Salvation is much too expensive to be bought. No one deserves eternal life much less eternal power.

              <p>In those years of reading the bible, I did not come across it stated pluto is hell.  It was my christian friend who has just given up on christianity told me she read something like this but the bible did not mentioned directly that that was hell.</p>
              <p>Scratch my head.   </p>
              <p>I only read books on Jesus brought christian down to hell and it mentioned down, so I suppose hell is below earth.   and i read related christian stuff it mentioned hell is in the core of earth.    So confusing.</p>

              <p>The idea of a three-tiered universe is based upon our interpretation of your texts based on the context and belief systems of the people at that time. Pieces of writing have to be taken in context, one cannot logically claim that the factors listed in an argument 500 years ago are the same as today. By taking the beliefs of the people at that time into consideration, it seems logically sound to deny the validity of the biblical claim.</p>
