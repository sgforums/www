A christian is a minister. Our ministries vary though. How do we know the particular ministry God has called us unto?<br><br>it is determined by your spiritual gifts. What your gifts is or are, determines your  ministry in the body of Christ.<br><br>First you must know the gifts available [Study Romans 12, 1 Cori. 12]<br><br>Second, give your time trying on these gifts. Do them and you will realize what particular area or activity you are good at through the results and the comment of others in the church.<br><br>[note: spiritual gifts are different from talents]<br><br></div>

(J.I  Packer, Keeping in Step with the Spirit)</div></blockquote>Amen. i could not agree any better.<br><br>Christ is our head. We are members of Him. Paul used the analogy of the body in Cor. We do not have the same function in the body of Christ. Some of us are teachers [mouths] some are hands [helps] and etc. But it is not we who will chose our gifts. The Holy Spirit sovereignly gives each one of us as He wills.<br><br>Discerning Spirits--- obviously no Christian has this supernatural ability before his conversion.<br><br>Speaking in toungues--obviously no Christian has this supernatural ability before conversion<br><br>TEaching the Word--- is another. Though one may be a teacher in school trained in education and all that. Here comes one man who does not have any training in secular schools about how to teach and yet when both of them teach in Church, the congregation is just blessed with the latter individual so differently than the first.<br><br>The congregation marverls: WAW!!! BROTHER SO AND SO TEACHES JUST SO DIFFERENTLY, THERE'S JUST AN X-FACTOR IN HIM..<br><br>D.L. MOODY WAS NO GREAT SPEAKER. HE WAS NO ORATOR.

            <div class='col-md body'>This is where i am confused. I love music &amp; i know i have a talent for music. eg....i have been involved in church dramas, choirs etc...<br><br>However, people are also drawn to me. Whenever they need a listening ear, i am there. Even the advise i give would be pretty sound i guess! I am begining to believe i am a natural at it. So now i am wondering am i also cut out to be in the counselling ministry?<br><br>My setback is i am not a professional in this area. eg. certifications etc etc....<br><br>Oh &amp; does your ministry necessasarily have to be within the 4 walls of the church?</div>
