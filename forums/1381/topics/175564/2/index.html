They were eating the bread from heaven!<br><br>"And he took bread, and when he had given thanks he broke it and gave it to them, saying, Â‘This is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of meÂ’" (Luke 22:19). </div></blockquote>and that's the proof of transubtanstiation?<br><br>When he said: 'this is my body' was he not referring to his body that is about to be crucified in Calvary? He was using a figure of speech my friend. Just like when He said: "I am the door, anyone who enters in Me shall be saved" Does it mean then that He transubtatiated into a literal door or something?<br><br>Where in those verses does it say that the bread transubtantiated into the body of Christ?<br><br>The bread from heaven is the one sitting in the table holding the bread giving it to His disciples.<br><br>Here's the complete version:<br><br>Mt 26:26  And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, "Take, eat; this is My body."<br><br>27 Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you.<br><br>28 "<strong>For this is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</strong><br><br>Mt 26:29 "But I say to you, <strong>I will not drink of this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fruit of the vine </span></strong>from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom."<br><br>Was the Lord's blood shed at that time or later on the cross? Later of course as we know it. How come that His blood was shed? Because His body was broken on the cross later when He was crucified. The Lord was speaking<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> ANTICIPATIVELY</strong></span> of His death on the cross.<br><br>Furthermore the Lord said :'this fruit of the vine' referring to the content of the cup He was holding.<br><br>The account of Paul with regards to the Lord's supper makes it more plain that the Lord was talking figuratively:<br><br>1Co 11:25 In the same manner He also took the cup after supper, saying, "<strong>This cup is the new covenant in My blood</strong>. This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me."<br><br>Are we to understand that the New Covenant is inside the cup literally and anyone who drinks from that cup drinks in literally the New Covenant?<br><br></div>
