I have seen young Christians in public, behaving no different from ah bengs (at least to the general public). I am sure fellow Christians will just see you as living life without fear for He is with you, and being not shy to declare your faith in Him. I am not trying to be legalistic or controlling, but do you not think that by behaving as such, it would reflect badly on yourself and others of your faith? I have seen such 'Christians' talking loudly, laughing, taking out their guitar and strumming , disturbing the peace on public transport. I mean, without the Christian talk, anyone would just look to them as regular ah bengs and ah lians, wreaking havoc on the train. Knowing them as Christians made it worse I think though.

"Spiritually Young" Christians are not too easily visually identified.<br>You are right that it is disturbing. But I don't think it is really a "Christian" issue, it is probably more of an upbringing issues. Kids in my church are seen kicking a ball in the utility hall right in front of their parents' eyes and none of these "older" Christian do or say anything about them. The ball will be seen flying all over the place sometimes hitting other innocent bystanders.<br>On one hand such parents will be proclaiming how wonderfully spiritually strong such children are during cell group meetings when they lead songs and on the other hand, the same children will be using profane words they pick up from school when they speak among themselves.<br>The same is true for teenage Christians. They will be seen clutching on to the thick Bible but other than that one piece of accessory, their dressing and conduct speaks nothing of their faith.</div>

One of the important yardstick when being seen as a Christian is the measurement of self-discipline.<br>It is probably true that the general public will have a higher level of tolerance to, say a group of mat-rockers hanging around at the void deck doing Bob Marley than a group of Christians singing on top of their voice.<br>No one can say that public opinion is ever fair..... but that's one of the cost of being a Christian.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

One, which is the actual point of this topic, is the behaviour of Christians in the public eyes. Much had been discussed about this already.<br>Two, what you had brought out is an internal issue. Together with this will be people forgetting (intentionally or not) to put the mobile on silent mode during worship service as well as worshippers fighting over parking space and parents not controlling their bratty children. The church leadership or a few appointed individuals should take the initiative to address whatever friction that may occur. Not unlike Paul rebuking Peter in the Bible.<br>No one's talking about throwing wayward Christians out of church, just a reminder that Christians have the RESPONSIBILITY of carrying oneself more appropriately than the world.<br>Unfortunately, the church is one of the few institutions where there are so many rules that cannot be REINFORCED officially.<br></div>

"Spiritually Young" Christians are not too easily visually identified.<br>You are right that it is disturbing. But I don't think it is really a "Christian" issue, it is probably more of an upbringing issues.</div></blockquote>Indeed, the perception 'spiritually young' were unfortunately brought together with youths.<br>It is of great social concern when even church adults precieved youths as spiritually young.<br><br>marlboro have got the point, Then proper education about conducts should be <strong>further</strong> anchored onto Christians.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"><strong>Kids in my church are seen kicking a ball in the utility hall right in front of their parents' eyes and none of these "older" Christian do or say anything about them. The ball will be seen flying all over the place sometimes hitting other innocent bystanders</strong>.[/quote]<br><br>I was one of them in the past.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  Guilty.<br>Ahh well...Parents should stop actually.<br><br><blockquote><strong>On one hand such parents will be proclaiming how wonderfully spiritually strong such children are during cell group meetings when they lead songs and on the other hand, <span style="color: red;">the same children will be using profane words they pick up from school when they speak among themselves</span></strong></blockquote>There's no need for parents to promote their children anymore when the youths themselves automatically displayed such reverence and adoration onto a worship service and throughout the service, yet forsaken their 'godly' behaviour during weekdays.<br><br>It is really of great ponderance to how hyprocritical one can become.<br>This statement applies to all ages.<br>Then again, i heard from a friend of mine that Sunday is an expression....the rest of the days are true impressions.<br><br><blockquote><strong>The same is true for teenage Christians. They will be seen clutching on to the thick Bible but other than that one piece of accessory, their dressing and conduct speaks nothing of their faith.</strong></blockquote>Again i'll try my best to defend youths and this statement of yours speaks onto all ages.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>[quote]Originally posted by NeonTetra:</div><div class="quote_body">yup....Christians must live out their faith....in a manner that is suitable. <span style="color: red;">Preaching the good news, praying and reading His Word...no matter how offensive it seems to others</span>. Behaving in a nuisance way such as singing songs loud out there....if the songs has been changed into secular music and the christians being someone else...hmm...i wonder?</div></blockquote>Other then offering the good news to others. I don't see how the others may be offensive to the non believers.<br><br>If the songs, whatever songs have been sung loudly in inappropriate places. It'll definitely not be appreciated.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>______________________________<br>Of those which i have shared your views.<br>I wish to point out something about these short falls 'young Christians'.<br><br>One think about being young(spiritually) is having great passion, spiritually charged up and desires. But lacking knowledge is like having Map without compass.<br><br>Apart from growing with the readings and meditation of bible, sermons and prayer.<br>Young needs to be educated about 'proper conduct'(if there's any of such code.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> )<br>Educating on inappropriate conducts doesn't mean throw verses at them or correction wih reproach.<br>otherwise accusing them of spiritually shallow.<br><br>Let me cite one example:<br><br>Few years ago when my classmate and i were having lunch.<br>We bought food and placed it on the table.<br>Then she prayed....and opened her eyes right after closing and said to me with tone of accusation: 'Eh, you didn't say grace!'<br>Mind you she has been a believer for ten over years.<br><br>And i told her that i don't have to close my eyes and give thanks.<br>She looked at me eyes wide open and asked. 'But why?!'<br>Then i realised this very mindset that christians have adopted onto legalistic conducts.<br><br>-From that point, i begun observing how people misused the verses and to restrict themselves of certain actions which in NT have offered freedom.<br>-How believers misquoted verses but in good intention to help correct another breathren.<br><br>All these without proper teaching from the pulpit(first, then onto other forms of leadership) - Education.<br>We can say believers are word strong...but not practically understanding and execution of the word will derieve to unstable Believer's Life.<br><br>Anyway, my last point being. Even to the minor details of christian conduct, education is responsible for 'true transformation'<br><br>P.S These are just some personal opinions, and it could be disagreed.<br><br></div>

Actually tough to reinforce 'cos say too much, others will accuse you of not having enough "love" and being too legalistic.<br>Once, I was chided for coming to church in bermudas. I had to teach a class with very very young children and need to sit on the floor. Apparently my reason was not accepted and was given the look that I was disrespectful. Nowadays, we have ang moh worshippers (probably Aussies) who also turn up in bermudas and no one gives a hoot.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MÂ©+square:</div><div class="quote_body">quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>The same is true for teenage Christians.
