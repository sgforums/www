Isn't tat the same as allowing murder to take place ?<br><br>ans: U will definitely be caught, punished or blacklisted. The punishment may not be now, but u will never escape. God will judge u accordingly when ur life ends. I do not think someone who has done anything evil will not be troubled by his own conscience. This is already punishment when he is still alive.<br><br>2. U contradict the statement u write above. If it means tat all the laws have to be followed such as not eating prawns etc. Why r u not following them ?<br><br>ans: There is no contradiction. If u think eating prawns will make u worship the lord better, by all means. If not, it does not matter becoz "it is not the food that defiles u, but words that comes out from ur mouth."<br><br>3. Tat is something really puzzling. We r made to be his worshippers ? If tat is so why hide ? If he appears without any concealment everyone including me will worship him<br><br>ans: He will SIS. It is said in the bible all will know him and worship him.<br><br>4. If men is perfect, he becomes god.<br><br>ans: Yes. Perfect means sinless. But man can never be without sin coz all have fallen short of glory, so he can never be like god, who is without sin. There is a difference between 'become god' and 'be like god'. Men, who are GOD's creations, can never become gods.<br><br>5. Including christainity ? If u think tat men invented the other religion, why not believe tat christainity is invented by men themselves<br><br>ans: Becoz the bible is the true word of god, i say it by faith and conviction.<br><br>6.

God set the rules, who are we to say he is fair/unfair? If u or someone u know make a serious crime/sin, would u not like GOD to forgive u too? Or do u prefer god to send u to hell immediately, giving u no chance of repentance.<br><br>In the bible, before GOD demands something, he gives more to the pple in abundance. If god wants u to be his slave, Christ wouldn't have humbled himself e.g wash his apostles' feet. He should have make the apostles wash his feet instead. This shows that Christ wants to serve, and not make slaves out of men.<br><br>It is sad that u see it as an exchange. GOD loves, and just want u to love him, regardless of ur level of faith. GOD is faithful, even when u reject him. GOD always open his arms to u, u r the one who is running away. Hope u one day see that he loves u.<br>Cheers!!!<br></div>
