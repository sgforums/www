            <div class='col-md body'>1. U r not answering the question. IS HE HIDING OR NOT HIDING IN THE PRESENT AND THE PAST 2000 YEARS. I am explicitly saying tis time period only.<br><br>Ans: He is not hiding. To u, he probably is becoz u have never prayed/asked him urself. But to many of us, he isnÂ’t.<br><br>When GOD revealed himself to the world, the pple also donÂ’t believe him. It is understood that when u never see him, u doubt him even more.<br><br>2. If he doubt god, then god doesn't make him perfect as wat u claim. He is designed to eat the fruit after a specific time<br><br>Ans: He is perfect as in sinless. He is designed to worship the lord and to enjoy him, not to fall from grace. Men make that decision and suffer the consequences. GOD wants to bring men back to him, but it is men who is rejecting him.<br><br>3. In short, u r saying u can't give a real answer to why is the bible true, u can only say u believe it to be true. Tat means u can be wrong, and IMO very likely to be so. I mean some crazy people believe he is superman or wonder woman. Just because u believe in it doesn't make it a fact<br><br>Ans: U wouldnÂ’t be stupid enuff to believe someone who says he is a superman or wonder woman without checking isnÂ’t it? That's the difference between false/true prophets...<br><br>4. How much chances do u think he has given to lets say a born muslim living in a predominantly muslim society ? I don't really not hm not giving good reasons to believe in him yet expect us to do so as forgiving.<br><br>Ans: U are not the born muslim, how do u know GOD never give him chances?<br><br>5. I think it should work the other way. Come out before I believe he is true. Otherwise I will find myself terible busy having to pray to muslim god, buddhist god, cult god, taoist god or hindu god to see who answer first<br><br>Ans: U canÂ’t challenge him, and u will never be able to make him reveal to u this way. Like what i said, pray and ask him urself. Humble urself first, and he will show u his wisdom.<br></div>

Muslims also believed Allah is the only way and most Christians/Jews will go hell becoz of their unbelief. Similiarly, there can never be compromise for Christians in this aspect. </blockquote>Cults can believe christ is the way like jehova witness.<br><br><blockquote>Well, we have the bible, and u do not believe it.<br><br>It is definitely different from praying to a cookie. Trust GOD, not trust me/a cookie. </blockquote>Muslim has the quran and jews torah. So wat if there is a bible ? Books r so easy to write<br><br>Definitely different ? To me wat is the difference between talking to thin air and talking to a cookie.<br><br><blockquote>we are not designed to be mindless robots. GOD has shown himself many times in the bible, but men still strayed away. The book of Exodus showed u that clearly. </blockquote>The people tat god showed himself do not turn away from him. Does abraham or moses or noah turn away ? If he show himself then people will believe in him. He show himself in exodus and jews come about. But strangely he do not show himself now. We r not mindless robot, then don't make people believe blindly out of faith and not rationality.<br><br><blockquote> have read the bible, I have checked with pple who have testimonies, I have my own experiences to tell me GOD is with me</blockquote>Have u read the quran or torah or buddhist scriptures ? Have u check with testimonies of people from other faith ? If u go around, u will find tat the points u said r really nothing unique<br><br><blockquote>We can never know for sure, and I will never be able to answer u this on behalf of that muslim. But if u believe GOD is JUST, then he will have his provisions for him. After all, Christ's yoke is light and not a burden to men. </blockquote>how do u know he is just ? Wat just acts have he perform before ?<br><br><blockquote>Similiarly, I also believe GOD will know what to do with his covenant pple - the Jews. Everything is within GOD's plan, and u can expect results to be positive not negative.</blockquote>put it tis way, u don't know but u just believe in tis blindly and thought he will do something good for u.  Your only answer is really "I don't know, I don't know why he do the thigns he does or say the things he did but I just blindly believe in him. U can show me 1 million examples of the wrong he did but I am just gonna stick to the fact tat he is gonna lead us to good just because I think he is gonna lead us to good. I have no other reasons or explanations". Tis is a very poor answer. Same as u r trying to tell a lunatic tat superman don't exists and show him evidencs and contradiction but he can only give the answer superman exists.<br><br><blockquote>Refer to 3. Instead of just challenging me, pray to him and he will show his ways to u. It is a matter of perspective. U can either see Christians as really believing in GOD, or u can compare them to lunatics who sees superman. </blockquote>Asking me to pray to god is akin to asking u to pray to superman. Why don't u pray to superman and then u will know he exists. U probably will not because u do not believes he exists. Same as me here. U need to convince peopel he exists befoe he start to pray to him. The people who had pray and see him is already convinced and from the psychology aspect, he probably can sense anything<br><br><blockquote>Just a thought: Even if GOD reveal himself to u now, will u believe in him as a loving god? Or will u probably use ur sense and logic and see him as an alien invader who come and kill all mankind?</blockquote>If he reveals, then I will believe he exists. Whether is he loving or not depend largely on his actions, not just by his claims. A boastful guy can claim anything<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. He say they will go to hell, if I am nto wrong it is probably immediate after death according to OT. So no matter wat is the time they go to hell. Unless he lies tat they don't. If he neevr changes his mind then u guys should follow the OT laws now<br><br>Ans: Yes. Pple are going to hell, I never deny that. Thru Christ we have grace, which is why we are not bound to the OT laws now. We follow GODÂ’s commandments out of love for him, not out of requirement/fear.<br><br>2. U see, u can't give a proper answer to many question. U just escape from it by bringing out something totally different. It seems to me u believe without any proper reason and even when some parts seems totally senseless to u. Doesn't it a sign tat your faith could be wrong ? Wat if there is no god ? Doesn't tat make u a fool for believing in something which is nothing but a lie ?<br><br>Ans: U have ur own opinions and I respect that. It is ur assumption that there is no god. What if there is god and u were wrong?<br><br>3. tat sounds like u believe in it before u even read the bible.<br><br>Ans: No, in fact even when I start reading the bible I was still skeptical.<br><br>4. Cults can believe christ is the way like jehova witness.<br><br>Ans: U are right. Even cults can believe in Jesus, but itÂ’s up to their own interpretation who Christ is.<br><br>5. Muslim has the quran and jews torah. So wat if there is a bible ? Books r so easy to write<br><br>Ans: U can start writing a holy book on ur own now and see whether it is easy to right. The bible/quran was not compiled by one man, but by many.<br><br>6. Definitely different ? To me wat is the difference between talking to thin air and talking to a cookie.<br><br>Ans: Yes, u can talk to thin air, but a cookie is meant to be eaten, not talked to.<br><br>7. The people tat god showed himself do not turn away from him. Does abraham or moses or noah turn away ? If he show himself then people will believe in him. He show himself in exodus and jews come about. But strangely he do not show himself now. We r not mindless robot, then don't make people believe blindly out of faith and not rationality.<br><br>Ans: So do u believe GOD show himself to pple, since u believe he showed to Abraham or moses or noah? Agree with u that we should not believe blindly, rather we should test ourselves what is true/false. And do not underestimate ur prayers, they will be answered, just in a matter of time.<br><br>8. Have u read the quran or torah or buddhist scriptures ? Have u check with testimonies of people from other faith ? If u go around, u will find tat the points u said r really nothing unique<br><br>Ans: I have muslim friends who told me about the quran. I counter check what I was told on the Internet. I have read Buddhist Scriptures b4. My muslim friends believe in a one sovereign god call Allah. Even Buddhists do not reject the idea of god/gods. So why do u not believe in GOD?<br><br>9. how do u know he is just ? Wat just acts have he perform before ?<br><br>Ans: Base on what was written in the bible. U can do a search in google for all the acts he have done, since u dun read the bible.<br><br>10. put it tis way, u don't know but u just believe in tis blindly and thought he will do something good for u. Your only answer is really "I don't know, I don't know why he do the thigns he does or say the things he did but I just blindly believe in him. U can show me 1 million examples of the wrong he did but I am just gonna stick to the fact tat he is gonna lead us to good just because I think he is gonna lead us to good. I have no other reasons or explanations";. Tis is a very poor answer. Same as u r trying to tell a lunatic tat superman don't exists and show him evidencs and contradiction but he can only give the answer superman exists.<br><br>Ans: Then it is ok. If god doesnÂ’t exist, I will have my just desserts. But what if u are wrong? Even though u may be 99.99 percent sure, there is this 0.01 percent god exists, and it is hard to dispute that.<br><br>11. Asking me to pray to god is akin to asking u to pray to superman. Why don't u pray to superman and then u will know he exists. U probably will not because u do not believes he exists. Same as me here. U need to convince peopel he exists befoe he start to pray to him. The people who had pray and see him is already convinced and from the psychology aspect, he probably can sense anything<br><br>Ans: U dun even want to pray, how do u know he wonÂ’t answer? But humble urself first, and he will show u his ways. Personal experiences are not something which u have, if not, it will not be call Â‘personalÂ’ already. U have to have this kind of experience urself, by praying, reading the bible and applying these principles in ur life.<br><br>12. If he reveals, then I will believe he exists. Whether is he loving or not depend largely on his actions, not just by his claims. A boastful guy can claim anything<br><br>Ans: Refer to 11. Pray first, seek his wisdom. GOD is not boastful, if he really want to do he can do it. Even my muslim friends agree with me on this. We should not challenge him by telling him to show/send miracles, becoz Christ says: Â“The only sign u will have will be the sign of Jonah.Â”<br></div>
