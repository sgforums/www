No different from any claim that such and such a hawker center has the best beef noodle. It is an opinion. Unless I can prove that such incidences did not exist, I cannot correct the view.

            <div class='col-md body'>i think laoda is dragging this issue of what my gender is into the debate unfairly. my issue with him was his view about homosexuality because that is discrimination against human rights in my personal view. as for my disagreeing with modern day human christian philosophy, its also to do with my personal views, i don't see how u can start accusing me of being sensitive because i am a 'she' or a 'he' or whatever u want to label me. the issue was clear b4, don't cloud it. if u want to debate my gender, its a seperate issue. i think his head is clouded up and he's just muddying up the argument.</div>
