              <p>I dont actually think that pastor prince preaches that its not okay to be poor. He preaches that when u place your trust in god you will be rich. Rich however does not mean just in a materialistic sense but also in a spiritual sense.</p>

              <p>I think it is commendable that you want to do society good...but your thinking is not just unrealistic, its pure naivity.</p>
              <p>First of all, what are you talking about 'primitive christianity' ? A small little church that is not a 'megachurch'. The very first church at 1AD was like 200,000 strong. It taught tithing, there was heirachy, leadership and structure similar to a modern day church.</p>
              <p>Without these basic functions of leadership and structure, no organisation can function. Think of it like if your family has no role who is the father, mother, son and daughter...the father will cry at home and sell the daughter away to work, while the mother plays computer games.</p>
              <p>If you are against scripture and think that the church should not be based on scripture alone, then why call it a church? Then its just a club.</p>
              <p>Then who is your God in this church? If you don't believe the bible, then on what basis do you believe God, Jesus or the Holy Spirit? </p>
              <p>You're self contradiciting.</p>
              <p>Then what's the purpose of its existence? To have fun? There're so many other places more fun than your 'church'.</p>
              <p>I seriously think.....you might need some psychological help.</p>

              What do you mean a radical church? The church refers to congregation of believers in Christ. So if you said Radical church that would literally mean radical people who has put their faith in Christ. And radicalism is usually associated with extremism and violence which is the opposite thing that Christians are aspired to be.<br><br>
              
              What do you mean hardcore Christian?

              <p>sermon = there's no need to read the bible and goto church. instead we must go to a desert (metaphorical or otherwise) to discover ourselves.</p>

              <p>  Hello guys. I think it would be abit unwise to actually put this thread's title as "Forming a radical church"; seems abit negative. Hmm, forming a Church, that is a very beautiful idea.</p>
              <p>  The Church is the heart where are believers enjoy the communion with God yeah? A place we would want to be every weekends for Mass, for sermons, confessions, or even any time when we feel that we should. Hmm, if you actually see it this way; the Church signifies the coming of all God's people to be in union with Him, so even if there is no Church, but the people who's heart are bent on the communion with Him: we don't need a Church, we as a whole are the Church itself.</p>
              <p>  I think we must understand the very heart of Christianity; be it Catholics or Protestants. Christianity, is the cradle of God, and it is upon Faith to God that the unwavering Church has existed, very long enough. The importance of Faith can be very well related to Passion of the Christ; Faith undoubtedly, is the first virtue: just as how Christ the Anointed One gives His full belief (Faith) to the Lord, Father, that we all should too, unendingly and unwavering.</p>
              <p> The following is what the Church is about; the choosing of either the liturgical and canonical practices of Catholicism, or the Protestant's. Though both ways, through the ethical and cultural context might differ, they both served instrumental to the Lord.</p>
              <p> The Bible is the essential part of all Christians, it is a must for all of us believers to read the word of God. In my personal opinion, which might be wrong and I ask for forgiveness, that; Bible does not only illustrates and seek to explain the events, but it is through the explanation of connotative events such as the notion of Jesus praying in Garden of Gethsemane that it was revealed to all of us the beauty of this universal language Christianity is all about. The Bible, not only a storybook, it is the collection of beautiful and wondrous Morals and Virtues written by the Servants of God via the help of God through the intercessory of Holyspirit sent forth by God, and we should give thanks and cherish it as long as we all live. If we have the Bible with us, and do not seek to cherish it, what would have become of the believers in the past when there were no Bible?  That is why the more we should take care, and cherish the Bible well.</p>
              <p>  Bible is not read literally, not that I know that it should be fully read it in such way, as it should not have been; but as such in the ways spiritually where the precious hidden values are surfaced. My mum and aunt the non-believers once told me that Bible is the scripture of priceless treasure, and I see its value now :)</p>
              <p>  The Bible should be good enough as a guide for the Church, especially those who are under the Ministry of God, responsible for the vocations. It is eminent to follow and teach just as the Bible says; no more, or no less, so that the message is well received in a precise manner.</p>
              <p>  Hmm, as far as I know,  there are no wisdoms that are past, wisdoms should survive through past and present and future. See it this way, we don't need to be in Sahara Desert, the world we are living in is one Sahara Desert if any of you knows what I am implying, a Desert so big, that it is times that of Sahara Desert, enough temptations for all of us to cope I guess.</p>
              <p>  A very beautiful idea for the forming of Church :)</p>

               Yes the bible should not be read literally. It hides some hidden spiritual meanings. Some contain wisdom which are more obvious to see and some contain hidden truths whose real meanings are only visible to those who really understand what it meant. <br><br>
                                                  
              Even Jesus disciples when they were still with Him didn't understand quite a lot of things and they were too afraid to ask directly.

              <p><strong>About Sola Scriptura</strong><br>I think a clarification is in order for the benefit of everyone. Sola scriptura ("bible alone") is the protestant doctrine that asserts that God's word is revealed to us through the bible <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">alone</span></strong> and no other means. The Catholic Church agrees 100% that God's word comes to us through the bible which the Church cherishes and encourages all Catholics to read.</p>
              <p>What the Catholic Church rejects is the belief that it is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span></strong> through the bible that God's word is revealed to us. This is false and unbiblical. God's word comes to us through the bible <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span></strong> his Church, which existed even <em>before</em> the bible was completed. The bible is a collection of writings by various persons, including the Apostles. These writings were all inspired by God most certainly, but the inspired authors (and God) never intended for these writings to be the be all and the end all of the Christian faith.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Catknight, if you want to reign in the influence of these megachurches, it would probably be more effective for you to lead an exemplary Christian life (not saying that you currently do not) and to always share with those around you - friends, colleagues, family, in online forums etc, why their teachings are not the whole truth; always done in a friendly and charitable way of course. It won't be easy because humans are suckers for promises of material riches but with prayer, everything is possible.</p>

              <p>  Good afternoon. Hey the clarification of the sola scriptura was good, I guess all of us has a better understanding of the liturgical and all the traditional practices of Catholics and Protestants. But again, I would like to stress that despite of their religious beliefs and practices, "...they both served instrumental to the Lord". I hope these would actually set forth the direction at which things are going here in prevention of a debate or quarrel about the authenticity of divinity observed by both religious groups sparked by the "indifferent traditional practices".</p>
              <p>  I would say Faith is the most important thing as I have echoed "Christianity, is the cradle of God, and it is upon Faith to God that the unwavering Church has existed, very long enough. The importance of Faith can be very well related to Passion of the Christ; Faith undoubtedly, is the first virtue: just as how Christ the Anointed One gives His full belief (Faith) to the Lord, Father, that we all should too, unendingly and unwavering." And it is Faith, that the Catholic Church was made possible by Christ's declaration "I will build a Church upon this rock". Well there are many speculations of what the rock is, it can be St. Peter ectera; but the point is, the rock signifies Faith in the Holy Trinity, which is in God we trust.</p>
              <p>  Doctrines are essential, but without Faith from both religious groups, none of their practices are significant.</p>
              <p>  I am a Catholic myself by the way; I love the richness of doctrines and practices of Catholicism; but we always have to be aware when addressing a place public, remembering the duality of things in nature.</p>
