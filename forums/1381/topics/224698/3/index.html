Also, you will never be able to learn because you've already made up your mind not to learn anything from Christianity, whether it is good or bad, right or wrong. As long as it is Christian, you would dismiss it right away.<br><br>I also notice you're racist and a bigot. Not a very good example of a buddhist either. Thankfully I have friends who are true buddhists in real life and they are not like you. And despite how offensive and irritating you are, you are no excuse for me or anyone to start attacking buddhism blindly.<br><br>You are just the black sheep among the buddhists.</div>

Lacking in apathy for other animals. No matter how you try to ruin my reputation by calling me names, as long as I can prevent people from being taken in by your Christian lies, it's okay for me.

Unlike you however, would blame eveything on Christianity.<br><br>Quite honestly, your arguements are weak as compared to some of the other atheists who are genuinely seeking discussion. You however are a different case altogether. In fact, those aren't even arguements, they're just petty personal attacks.</div>
