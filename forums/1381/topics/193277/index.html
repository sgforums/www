Nice analogy.<br><br>___________________________________________________<br><br>The Barber Who Believed That God Doesnt Exist:<br><br>A man went to a barber shop to have his hair and his beard cut as always. He started to have a good conversation with the barber who attended him. They talked about so many things and various subjects.<br><br>Suddenly, they touched the subject of God. The barber said:<br>"Look man, I don't believe that God exists as you say so."<br>"Why do you say that?" - Asked the client.<br>Well, it's so easy, you just have to go out in the street to realize that God does not exist. Oh, tell me, if God existed, would there be so many sick people? Would there be abandoned children? If God existed, there would be no suffering nor pain. I can't think of a God who permits all of these things."<br><br>The client stopped for a moment thinking but he didn't want to respond so as to prevent an argument. The barber finished his job and the client went out of the shop.<br><br>Just after he left the barber shop he saw a man in the street with a long hair and beard (it seems that it had been a long time since he had his cut and he<br>looked so untidy). Then the client again entered the barber shop and<br>he said to the barber:know what? Barbers do not exist."<br><br>"How come they don't exist?"-asked the barber. "Well I am here and I<br>am a barber."<br>"No!" - the client exclaimed. "They don't exist because if they did<br>there would be no people with long hair and beard like that man who<br>walks in the street."<br>"Ah, barbers do exist, what happens is that people do not come to me."<br><br>"Exactly!"- affirmed the client. "That's the point. God does exist, what happens is people don't go to Him and do not look for Him that's why there's so much pain and suffering in the world."<br><br>...live passionately...laugh frequently...love extravagantly..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>God claimed to be omniscient and omnipotent. A barber does not.</blockquote>I agree with the above point. A barber is not there to prevent people from growing hair. He is there to cut hairs when it grow too long. Men growing hairs is beyond the control of barbers. However god being omnipotent has the means to stop sickness and evil etc. It is within his control yet he do not exercise it. A better analogy is when a teacher is in class, and he has control over his students, u will not see fighting in the class. If u did see fighting and the teacher did nothing, then the teacher is not doing his job<br><br>By the way the definition of omnipotence is tat it is not limited and can do watever he please</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>how about men themselves ? Should they also stop doing evil ?

When u r born, u r already consider to have sin. When u did not think of god, u also sinnned. If u r a buddhistm no matter wat u sinned. In fact even if u can program a man, u can't stop him from sinning due to the impossible requirements of it (being borned = sinning).<br><br>Should god prevent ? I think he should. U can give away an arm and eye to prevent yourself from suffering hell (if your right arm cause u to sin, cut it out and throw it away etc etc etc). Why not just remove the possibility of committing evil from men so they will always go to heaven.<br><br><blockquote>sorry, i amended my question since a second reading of your post found u already answered.

I will turn out to be convincing u to become a free thinker while u will convince me to become christian. Chances r we r gonna remain as wat we r from the beginning. Tis is gonna take out too much time and frankly i can't afford the time...<br></div>
