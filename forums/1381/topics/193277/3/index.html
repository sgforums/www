He can choose not to but He can also choose to. God mostly choose not to. God choose to depend on man. It is what gives meaning to man's life.

It is an incredibly personal thing and if you experienced it, you know. Just like unless you reached puberty and have had sex; you cannot understand what people are talking about. So I prefer to use Jesus' words as recorded in the Bible and encourage people to experience it for themselves. The Buddhists will hate me for saying this, actually it is what the are looking for. Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that sincere Buddhists will receive revelations from God directly. The Bible said many times in many places that God does reveal Himself to seekers but they "refuse." Now it turns out that Christians similarly "refuse." They insist on looking at the finger and holding on to the finger that is pointing to the moon.</div>
