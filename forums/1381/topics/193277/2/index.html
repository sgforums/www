            <div class='col-md body'>I think there is a need to define the word "threat" and "woo" properly<br><br>woo<br><br>To tempt or invite.<br><br>threat<br><br>An expression of an intention to inflict pain, injury, evil, or punishment<br><br>I get both definiton from dictionary.com<br><br>The similarity between "woo" and "threat" is making a person perform an action which he will not do otherwise. In "woo", u use incentive or something "good" for the person to pursuade him to perform tis action. In "threat", u use punishment such as pain or burning etc to convince him to do tat action. An example of "woo" is god saying men can live in heaven if he is a believer. An example of "threat" is god force men to go to hell if he is not a believer.<br><br>Hence in the case of hell, it is really using "threat"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>
