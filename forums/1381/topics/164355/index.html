            <div class='col-md body'>i believe in Conservative Evangelical theology:<br><br>a) Salvation by grace through faith alone in Christ [sola fide]<br><br>b) Trinity- three persons in the Godhead but one God<br><br>c) The Bible as innerrant from Genesis to Revelation and therefore authoritative and the only source for faith and practice [sola scriptura]<br><br>As to Calvinism and Arminianism:<br><br>I am a four-point Calvinist, i do not accept all the five tenets of Calvinism.<br><br>I accept only: a) Total Depravity b) Unconditional Election c) Irrisistible Grace and d) Preservation and perseverance of the Saints.<br><br>I reject Calvinism's doctrine of Limited Atonement; that Christ died only for the elect and not for all men.<br><br>I believe in Universal Atonement. The Atonement is universal and sufficient for all but efficacious only for those who believe. The atonement is universal but limited only because of man's unbelief.<br><br>As to my system of interpretation:<br><br>I am a  Normative Dispensationalist  like Scofield, Chafer, Swindoll, Ryrie, Pentecost, Barnhouse, Gray, Henry Allan Ironside, Woodrow Kroll and etc.<br><br>Essenstials of Dispensationalism:<br><br>a) Normal and plain interpretation of the Bible from GEnesis to Refelation, recognizing figures of speech but looking for the plain meaning behind the figure.<br><br>b) We Believe that the Church is not Israel [unlike covenant theology]. The Church is a distinct entity from Israel. A new creation.<br><br>c) We believe that God's goal of History is to glorify Himself.<br><br>d) We believe in one method of salvation in all of time [unlike Ultra Dispensationalist].<br><br></div>

God gives empowerment Christians to evangelise?<br>God gives empowerment to study theology then.<br><br>2) Please define Theology.<br>I sense that you're trying to present theology as 'ultimate, the absolute'<br>To have good foundation, one must go through the study of Theology?<br>What is your product then? Theology?<br><br>How many Theological camps are there, and which are you talking about?<br><br>3) On the hand, you said it very well, and it is the best form of Christian Living.
