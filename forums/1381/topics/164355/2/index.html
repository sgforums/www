We'll leave that to other topic in the future.<br><br>'has it ever come to anyone's mind that these people did not have the Holy Spirit in them from the beginning?'<br><br>It is easy to discount by the fact that those people did not have H.S in them from the start.<br>We are talking about different group category, which i believe have presented in the earlier.<br>:::One who have experienced the indwelling of Holy Spirit.<br><br>So who causes the rejection?<br><br>Thanks for responding. </div></blockquote>yep. true. I suppose the most important point in a Christian lifestyle is living a life for God then. sure we may sin and falter sometimes, but as long as we confess and repent and not repeat it, the blood of Christ is sufficient to cover them.<br><br>yeah. well perhaps in that case its Satan? However, there is the verse in the Bible, "Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you." - James 4:7 (NKJV). Perhaps they have distanced from God, hence they allowed the devil to deviate them. However this argument is rather circular, as you can then question why they distanced from God in the first place. so i do not have any real answer for this.<br><br>perhaps someone with a better understanding can explain this?</div>
