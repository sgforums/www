It's several priests squeezed inside, including the serving parish priests and some retired priests that only come out once in a while.  Also some meeting rooms are also built within the priesthouse for the parishioners to have their regular meetings etc.</div></blockquote>Bungalows are supposed to be small.<br><br>From wikipedia:<br><br><blockquote>A bungalow (Hindi: बुन्गलोव<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> is a type of single story house. The word derives from Hindi word bangla from 1676. It literally means a house "in the Bengal style".[1] <strong>Such houses were traditionally small</strong>, only one story, thatched and had a wide veranda.[2] Bungalows today are a type of house that is usually single story or one and a half stories, and can be quite large.</blockquote>Bungalows today can be quite large, but size of living space alone does not mean much. Condos are small, but people pay for the facilities. Some condos are quite small, swimming pool also non existent, but people still pay for it. Privacy I guess? A priesthouse might be small to you, but the compound is HUGE. No swimming pool for the priest (maybe baptism pool? LOL), but the priest is free to wander around the church compound. It is different from wandering under the void deck because mata will come and question you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Regarding meeting rooms, it depends on the parish bah. See the Holy Cross so small, obviously cannot compare with St. Joseph at Bukit Timah. The latter even has columbarium and a separate building for functions. I attended catechism class in the building before .. lol I suppose they have meeting rooms inside also?<br><br>On average, you have 3 serving priests for a parish. Add in retired priests at most you have how many? 6?</div>

True that many Singaporeans cannot afford that.  But if you give away such 2nd hand car with car plate starting with SBK... you think any Singaporeans will want?  Most Singaporean rich or poor only want to drive 1-2 year old car.  This brings me to another question about pastors drawing high salary: Do they need so much money so that they can drive better and newer cars (2 Litres car instead of 1000 cc)?</div></blockquote>If you give away 2nd hand cars, make sure you give petrol vouchers every month also. Also make sure the car is in reasonable good condition, i.e. it shouldn't break down every 200km.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>It is not the age of the car, but what you do with it that's more important.

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyoh, you need to panic yet lah. I think at the end of the day God knows the heart of each person and he will be judged accordingly.<br><br>It's hard to judge from external actions onlyÂ… I mean a person may live apparently on very simple means but his heart is absolutely fixed on getting more and more things and the external frugality is only a faÃ§ade. On the other hand, a person might be blessed abundantly by God but sees his blessings as just that- blessings that he appreciates but thinks nothing of if they are taken away.<br><br>Once again it's hard to judge. I mean we can see the telltale signs but at the end of the day we can never really be sure. The thing is this: I do not think we ought to "cap" the surplus expendable salary of our leaders if we are not willing to apply the same logic to our lives. What they do with the money is really between them and God as is the condition of their hearts in regards to material wealth. I would only step in if I was sure that what I was giving was being abused for the wrong ends.<br><br>But I don' think we can draw down a line in the sand that says "you all must be poor or have no excess". Because then we will be determining the standard of life for them and their children while it is very likely we have no such restrictions ourselves. This may make us feel better that we are not being "cheated" but I think its fundamentally unfair. It just strikes me as a tad odd. I think it's most important that there is accountability across the church board for the expenses and just how the money is spent. It does say something about not muzzling the ox that turns your mill. Either way we realize it's not up to us, and drawing it down in legalistic terms will hurt, not help the situation. Instead of having a real attitude of giving and sharing we are reduced to counting dollars and cents and obsessing over car types and PDAs.<br></div>
