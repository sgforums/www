Pastors are to work full time, not just during office hours.<br><br>Provide car -- this is also reasonable cuz they WILL need transportation for their work (house visits, hospital visits etc).<br><br>Serving the church is a religious vocation, not a professional job like Managing Director or what.  There is no reason for a pastor to draw a 5 digit pay.</div>
