But why should the congregation donate their money to feed the pastor's family, unless they also contribute their service to the church (I know most of them don't)?<br><br>If we ask about how high is high....<br>Ok...  I will take a look at a real life example of someone I personally know - a sole breadwinner in a family who has a sick spouse and two kids to support.  She is taking home only $1,500.  This is already enough for the whole family's basic expenditure, whole family's insurance, her daughter's piano and piano lesson, children's medical bill (when they fall sick from time to time) and her spouse's regular medication.<br><br>So I guess, S$2000 or more is too high for a church minister.  Unfortunately, many church ministers will not want to settle for something less than that.  They will claim that their children need so much expenditure. but if my friend can survive with the family with only $1,500, why do pastors need twice or thrice more than that?  If you talk about pastors having to drive to hospitals, homes etc to do their duty, petrol should be covered by the church then cuz it's official matters.  Even if they want to pay petrol from their own pocket, how much is the petrol every month?  $1,200 or $1,500?  The petrol cost should not be so high unless they drive high cc or performance car that eats up more fuels.  But then, I won't be surprise if they drive such cars.  After all, they can draw big fat pay from everyone's donation.</div>

It's several priests squeezed inside, including the serving parish priests and some retired priests that only come out once in a while.  Also some meeting rooms are also built within the priesthouse for the parishioners to have their regular meetings etc.<br><br>Their cars are old cars and they drive the same old cars for years.  True that many Singaporeans cannot afford that.  But if you give away such 2nd hand car with car plate starting with SBK... you think any Singaporeans will want?  Most Singaporean rich or poor only want to drive 1-2 year old car.  This brings me to another question about pastors drawing high salary: Do they need so much money so that they can drive better and newer cars (2 Litres car instead of 1000 cc)?<br><br>Their holiday is usually sponsored by their own family.  Holiday is not a must.  No money, dun go, instead of no money - go get high salary &amp; then holiday.  Serving the church is a religious vocation, not a CEO job.<br><br>If a pastor has 5 children instead of 3, does he have to ask for a higher salary?  Or will he work harder in getting tithes from every church member?</div>
