            <div class='col-md body'>Let's not drift far from the topic (or escape from discussing the main issue).<br><br>Is it right for a pastor (who earns from donations, contributions) to apply for a platinium card and purchase a prestigious club membership?  Is it right for a pastor to draw $10,000 pay a month and who decides the pay?  The pastor himself or the community?<br><br>And from the $10,000 salary a month, how much is donated willingly by the community without pressure and how much is contributed through the Pastor's effort (appealing for donating during church service and meetings)?<br><br>Let's stick to Singapore's context since we already have personal testimonial.  By the way, a pastor (who owns an expensive club membership) just said hi to me at the clubhouse.   <img src="http://forum.ido.com.sg/style_emoticons/default/ph34r.gif"></div>

But the most highly paid ones are not the Methodists, but mostly the non denominational ones, namely the mega church.<br><br>The worst thing is... the one drawing the high salary is always the one appealing for donation at every service.<br><br>Anyway the Methodist Church is now reviewing the internal procedure to correct what has been done wrong.  I always trust that the main stream who strive as much as possible to follow the system properly.  Right now I still trust they will and have learnt from their mistake.<br><br>Laoda, you still in Presbyterian Church?</div>
