            <div class='col-md body'>Well for starters, satanic music claims are not new. Claims of backmasking has been around for years.<br><br>What is backmasking?<br>1. Extra sounds placed at the "lower" less audible sound frequency? Is this done on purpose - <span style="font-style: italic;">the artistes or the sound people purposely putting it there.</span> Or does it occur naturally - <span style="font-style: italic;">a combination of sounds when played backwards sound funny. </span>If it is done on purpose - then can we assume a cover version of the same song does not have the extra "sound", or if it is naturally, then whether we sing it, or listen to it, or speak it, it is also Satanic?<br><br>2. Does it work on everyone? Ie, if an older person hears this "backmasked" sound, does it affect this person. So an auntie accustomed to Chinese opera suddenly listens to Eagles or Styx, she suddenly becomes brainwashed?<br><br>3. What does this "backmasked" sound do to you? How many people actually listened to John Lennon and goes out to kill another person? Likewise, I can also link driving to satanism because of the amount of road rage.<br><br>Too many people have been quoting wikipedia. It's probably a good start point, but I'd hardly consider a reader-editted site to be a standard for reference. However right at the bottom of the wiki-backmasking page, there is a series of reference that can be helpful to you, especially on frauds in backmasking.<br><br>So is there backmasking? Probably! But what effects does it have on the listener? Totally uncertain. In a blind test conducted, A passage from one of the Psalms was read backwards to a group of participants where previous suggestions were made that this reversely read Psalms is satanic, the participants actually heard the name of Satan mentioned.<br><br>Those who go looking for the devil is bound to find him.</div>

So are u saying that your rock kind of "hillsong" also  depicts sex, perversion, magic and satan? Hey, you gotta make your stand clear?<br><br></blockquote>The cover of Sgt.

Peppers cover indeed has that Crowley's picture. But that does not mean anything about satan. Sgt Pepper cover shows famous people during/past era.<br><br>One more thing, if you feel offended on certain genre, don't listen. It's that simple. You dun have to come out here and tell people that its satanic or what. People will only begin to argue with you and find you a nuisance.<br><br>The way you speak will only offend more people who likes the Beatles and this will do nothing to your religion. Don't you guys think you are the one who are aways trying hard to brain washed people? So what if Beatles are satanic(I don't think so)? You got nothing to proved even if you managed to do so? Are you going to be the next Jesus Christ? HELL NO!<br><br>Jesus was a very wise person who leads people with his wisdom. He does not goes around telling people that if you did not follow him, you will go to hell. But instead, he share his wisdom. I believe he will never say anything about satan because he knows that he want to help people instead of scaring them off. But sadly, It you guys(Christian) who are always trying to scare people off by telling them those kind of thing and instead of respecting, they began to loathe Christianity or even Jesus(POOR GUY)<br><br>Although i hate to turn this thread into a religious one. But do think carefully before you typed things like that<br><br>IMO, When Beatles said that they are bigger the Jesus, they just simply meant that they are so famous. Beatles are so famous for their pranks on media and what Beatles said is just trying to boast their popularity. It's that simple.<br><br>Reminder: Wikipedia may not always contain the correct info.<br><br>If you feel offended, don't listen to them.<br><br></div>
