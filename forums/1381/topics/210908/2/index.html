            <div class='col-md body'>Aliester Crowley is without a doubt, the main spiritual "teacher" of rock music. Crowley's mission in life was to destroy Jesus Christ and Christianity, while exalting sex perversion, drugs, magick and Satan.<br><br>Aliester Crowley spews his hatred of Jesus Christ in The World's Tragedy:<br><br>"I do not wish to argue that the doctrines of Jesus, they and they alone, have degraded the world to it's present condition. I take it that Christianity is not only the cause but the symptom of slavery." (Aleister Crowley, The World's Tragedy, p. XXXIX)<br>"That religion they call Christianity; the devil they honor they call God. I accept these definitions, as a poet must do, if he is to be at all intelligible to his age, and it is their God and their religion that I HATE and will DESTROY." (Aleister Crowley, The World's Tragedy, p. XXXI)<br><br>In the introduction of The World's Tragedy, Israel Regardie says:<br>"This long, almost epic poem is one of the most bitter and vicious diatribes against Christianity that I have ever read."<br>Crowley's most famous teaching, "Do what thou wilt shalt be the whole of the law" became the "mantra" of the 60's revolution of drugs, sexual perversion and anti-Christianity. "Do your own thing" Â— "If it feels good do it".<br>THE BEATLES &amp; CROWLEY<br><br>According to The All Music Guide, The Beatle's Sgt. Pepper album, "will forever be known as the recording that changed rock &amp; roll". Time magazine said, Sgt Pepper's was "drenched in drugs." (Time, Sept. 26, 1967, p.62)<br><br>The cover of Sgt. Pepper's showed the Beatles with a background of, according to Ringo Starr, people "we like and admire" (Hit Parade, Oct. 1976, p.14). Paul McCartney said of Sgt. Pepper's cover, ". . . we were going to have photos on the wall of all our HEROS . . ." (Musician, Special Collectors Edition, - Beatles and Rolling Stones, 1988, p.12)<br><br>One of the Beatle's heros included on the cover of Sgt. Pepper's was Â— the infamous Aliester Crowley! Most people, especially in 1967, did not even know who Crowley was Â— but the Beatles certainly did.<br><br>Sgt.
