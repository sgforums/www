If the rich peeps are there, then their grade or sporting achievement has to make it. Were you from ACS?<br><br>Come to think of it, if your parents are rich and you don't have super good grades (to take S papers and get president scholarship), why would you continue to study in JC? You don't need JC to enter overseas university. And between local Uni and overseas uni, obviously overseas uni is a more attractive option. Plus you get your degree faster.<br><br>Divorce is higher among rich people. Go ACS and ask around.</div></blockquote>huh? doesnt make sense<br><br>whats wrong with them making it out with either a good grades or winning a sports medal?<br><br>is it a need for rich kids to pursue S papers and President Scholarships? and definitely overseas will be a better choice, but its because local unis are sucky anyway, so it means for these reasons they have the chance to go overseas they are considered spoilt?<br><br>i think you and i have a different definition of the word 'spoilt'. my view of spoilt is with the character of the person, not his background. look at my sister, my family is not that rich and my father is a strict disciplinarian, but she is pretty spoilt and spend money taken from my parents as if money supply dont end.<br><br>if they have the chance to study overseas and they dont do well in jc knowing they can go overseas, well, to me that is not spoilt. its seriously a view of the character for me<br><br>i dont agree that divorce is a only issue with rich people, how about my frens who are poor and their parents are separated or divorced since even young? my experience with these issues started when i was in NS, so many cases like these, and there is nuthing to show their income size is a key to the divorce....<br><br></div>
