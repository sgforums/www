Many denominations and evil doings by a big group of people (the Nazis, the Crusaders) doesn't make truth relative. </blockquote>There r many truth in the world tat is not simple. Your statement of people being clouded already highlight the fact tat truth is not a simple thing to grasp. If truth is simple, then we expect everyone to believe in the same religion. Many denomination and evil doings by a big group of people misled by a few really show tat they do not know wat is the truth<br><br><blockquote>Lawyers are there to make the judge or jury sees the details and dig out the flaws in their opponent. Let's say Took really killed Huang Na and he wasn't insane at that time (meaning he is culpable for his actions). This is the truth - very simple .. Took murdered someone. And let's say the former air stewardess threw the girl down the block. This is the truth - very simple .. she murdered someone. These truths are what the court sought to establish. Why they take so long to establish you can imagine .. prosecution and defence summoning their own witnesses, attempts to discredit your opponent by digging into events few months back, etc. </blockquote>If truth is so simple, then we wouldn't see Took able to escape police attention even after 2 interviews. If truth is simple there wouldn't even be a debate on whether is Took insane or not. If truth is simple, then we don't need lawyers nor jury since everything can be decided easily. U say tat court sought to establish the truth. Isn't tat already a sign tat the truth is hidden, obscure and hard to establish and requires the work of a team of people using a lot of time to only come out with a version of wat they preceive as the truth. The real truth may be something else and tat is why there r cases of people wrongly jailed of hanged. Shouldn't we also employ the same method of assessing truth by rigorously thinking and studying and after the studies, be ready to accept the viewpoints from the other side of the fence since all men err.<br><br></div>

And worse still tis form of cencorship is encouraged, and the knowledge and perceptions of millions is controlled by very few individuals. Tis is an unhealthy phenomenon as history from time to time shows tat it leads to fanatism and eventually leads to disaster. From the reply of laurence I do not find any fault when he asked why does they only see things from the christian viewpoint while ignoring the non-christian views. The answer to it is a bit surprising as to me, it sounds like laurence is right when he made these remarks and it is something to be proud of. Is it a proud and good thing to say tat because u r a christian, u r entitled and encouraged to ignore the viewpoints from people of other belief ? Is it healthy to think tat one is always right and other criticisms can be dismissed without second thoughts ? Tis really is disturbing and the manner which some christian believe in christainity is apalling...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why remain stagnant and in denial by just wanting to discuss things from a christian perspective, and label any non christian view that do counter your own view as negative or to be ignored? </span><br><br>I think some of the problems of some christians is tat they view the bible and christians as the only reliable source of information and totally disregard wat the other part of the world is thinking or any new information found. And worse still tis form of cencorship is encouraged, and the knowledge and perceptions of millions is controlled by very few individuals. Tis is an unhealthy phenomenon as history from time to time shows tat it leads to fanatism and eventually leads to disaster. From the reply of laurence I do not find any fault when he asked why does they only see things from the christian viewpoint while ignoring the non-christian views. The answer to it is a bit surprising as to me, it sounds like laurence is right when he made these remarks and it is something to be proud of. Is it a proud and good thing to say tat because u r a christian, u r entitled and encouraged to ignore the viewpoints from people of other belief ? Is it healthy to think tat one is always right and other criticisms can be dismissed without second thoughts ? Tis really is disturbing and the manner which some christian believe in christainity is apalling...<br><br></div></blockquote>SIS, please read my post carefully, we are all humans, we have a mind... we are free to regard or disregard as we see fit for each of our lives. There is no encouragement to ignore the viewpoint of another belief, but YES I AM ENTITLED TO DISREGARD THE VIEWPOINT OF ANOTHER BELIEF should I find that it does not sit well with me. We all have the freedom to choose. Similarly, you are also entitled to disregard my viewpoint should it not sit well with you.<br><br>If I as a christian or other christians choose to disregard the viewpoint of another person or belief, how is that being proud? How do you know that we have not evaluated the other belief system and have decided that it does not sit well with us.<br><br>All of us believe in something or nothing. To accuse a person of being proud just because they don't accept your viewpoint is also pride. If a person thinks that a certain belief system is right for him and chooses to follow it, I do not think that there is anything wrong with that. You have your viewpoint and you make it known here in a Christian forum, we have read it, but we are under no obligation to accept it. The reverse is true as well, you listen to our view point, but you do not have to follow it.<br><br>SIS It is a free world, you choose what you want to believe in, but don't expect others to believe that you have the right viewpoint as well. Like I said, it is a viewpoint, how or which view point you choose is up to you again. I have given examples of my own life.. I have been to the buddhist ceremonies and the taoist temples... and they do not sit well with me, so I chose a different path, one that I believe in (and know that is the right one)... not that I am saying that buddhism etc is wrong, but it is not for me and the other Christians here as well otherwise we would not believe in Jesus and God would we?<br><br>To Christians, the BIBLE is the living WORD of GOD. It is right and true and it is the very basis of our faith, if we did not believe in it fully, then why become a Christian? Similarly, if muslims or buddhists did not believe fully in what they did, then why become muslim or buddhist or any other religion for that matter... As Christians we are called to be hot for God all the time, we cannot and will not fence sit. We believe in what we believe, you can choose your own path, we don't condemn you for it. Your choice.</div>

We counter everything or discuss everything from a Christian perspective because we believe in it very strongly.. (at least I do) and for me it is not a religion, like some of us here have stated, it is a personal relationship with GOD. I speak from a Christian stand point because it defines who I am in Christ and it is very much a part of me... you can say that it has become part of my life, I talk to God everyday and meditate on the bible everyday too... not to sound holy and preachy... but it means that much to me. I have lived the non-christian life for half my life and it never got me anywhere or gave me much contentment or fulfilment, that is why I don't ever want to go back to where I came from... my parents were buddhists and then became taoists... and I was made to go to temple with them all the time... now they are free thinkers and when you look at them, they have no peace... but I get to wake up every morning with this peace that I cannot describe. You want me to give up that kind of assurance and peace for something temporal? Being a christian is not all about theology... its bigger than that!<br><br>What you are adding is not spice to everyday fare, but putting down another persons belief system... what we say here in EH stays here in EH...<br><br>You take out your "hurts" on the new christians here because of what others in the past have done... I think it is time to let it go. We newbies here do not go to other forums to preach and cause trouble... at least from what I can see.. so just back off on that point. Like I said before, if you want to have a civilised discussion, we can... but no more name calling either... you jump up and down when SIS gets called SISsy... and you call me a what?<br><br>You want to give a non-christian view point, you are welcome to... it is after all a public forum, but remember, there is a tone to this forum.. a DECIDEDLY CHRISTIAN ONE... live with it and move on... we believe strongly in what we believe in, and if people ask the question... don't ask us to sugar coat it. We are all adults.. if you don't like what we say, you are welcome to ignore it. You have a mind, you decide what you want to believe in or not. All of us have free will, we all choose to believe what we believe... in the same way you think that us Christians are pushing people to become Christians... some Christians here might think that you non-believers are trying to push your view points on us... keep a discussion to a discussion.. all of us have viewpoints so take your own advice and be more open minded... ok?<br><br>Also if your friend is a mod, then where is he? Have not seen him here at all... </div></blockquote>u were the first one to laff at him rem? i was pointing out this in a thread, while mcsquare were pointing out what he doesnt like to see in ur points at another thread, it was on what books christians read...<br><br>sheesh, i rem pointing out this to u, but u choose to ignore, then u come ard and pretend not to know..sheesh<br><br>breying donkey stays<br><br>and no, too bad, contrary to what u want me to do, i cant accept that, having christians views doesnt give u space and authority to do what u want as u like, again, i will as a non believer push my views, not on everything u want to practise, but what i can see as having consequential effect, and really when it come to this, i dont budge...<br><br>i wish there will reach a time christians like u watch the stuff that come out from ur mouth, rather than showing people how bright u are before u open ur mouth...<br><br>this post of urs confirm my fear what kind of modding will take place in this forum, and i believe my misgivings are true...<br><br></div>
