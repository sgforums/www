If you go ACS, then it will be different story. Those with sucky grades, they know they are rich to go overseas to study, so they heck care their O or N levels.<br><br>And those are obviously rich peeps. Their dads own shangari-las and oil refineries one.<br><br><blockquote>Doesnt mean if they are divorced they should nto associate themselves with any faith.</blockquote>It tarnishes whatever religion they are in. Just my 1 cents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When i mean most of them are Buddhists or Taoists, i meant my frens parents, not the whole population of Singapore.<br><br>Alamak.<br><br>What i was trying to point out was that there  is no clear figures enough to say rich people dont go temple or kopitiam uncle dont go churches. It is your own personal observation, so it might not be representative enough of the whole population.<br><br>Again, another generalisation. How do we know most of these peeps gave up studies because they know their parents are rich enough to send them overseas? Anyway, JC and A level is a sucky scheme. Seriously, most of what you said do clash with what i observe when i was in JC.<br><br>I am afraid to say, its like saying rich people shouldnt be rich at all. They are being blamed and ostracised, just for being rich?<br><br>For the last part, it depends on whose faith you are talking about. I know for Roman Catholicism, divorce is not allowed. How abt Anglicans, when King Henry separate the church from RC when he need to get a divorce?<br><br>And i dont see divorces being an issue in other faiths, other than christianity, islam and jewish.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Told you liao .. what you see in JC is "controlled". If the rich peeps are there, then their grade or sporting achievement has to make it. Were you from ACS?<br><br>Come to think of it, if your parents are rich and you don't have super good grades (to take S papers and get president scholarship), why would you continue to study in JC? You don't need JC to enter overseas university. And between local Uni and overseas uni, obviously overseas uni is a more attractive option. Plus you get your degree faster.<br><br>Divorce is higher among rich people. Go ACS and ask around.</div>
