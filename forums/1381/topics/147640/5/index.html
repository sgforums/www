            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by stupidissmart:<br>Maths is simple, no doubt but how about issues such as religion etc ? If truth is so simple, then there wouldn't be many different religions, and in the case of christainity, it split into many denominations in the world. If truth is narrow, why spread itself to catholic, jews, islam and even johava witness ? </blockquote>The truth is simple, but people are clouded so as not to see it. Many denominations and evil doings by a big group of people (the Nazis, the Crusaders) doesn't make truth relative.<br><br><blockquote>How about the case of murder when a driver swerve to hit an innocent man to save his family lives ? Is it simple as 1+1 ? If things r tat simple then again we don't need lawyers</blockquote>Lawyers are there to make the judge or jury sees the details and dig out the flaws in their opponent. Let's say Took really killed Huang Na and he wasn't insane at that time (meaning he is culpable for his actions). This is the truth - very simple .. Took murdered someone. And let's say the former air stewardess threw the girl down the block. This is the truth - very simple .. she murdered someone. These truths are what the court sought to establish. Why they take so long to establish you can imagine .. prosecution and defence summoning their own witnesses, attempts to discredit your opponent by digging into events few months back, etc.<br><br>To establish a truth presupposes the truth exist. In your analogy, things may not be that simple due to the lack of laws in a certain country. For example, if Philippines lacks a "Computer Misuse Act", it will be difficult to prosecute a hacker in their courts. In that case, the analogy doesn't apply.<br><br>So in your case, the driver may be culpable for manslaughter, depending on how the law is phrased (legal definitions are usually very precise). He may be convicted for manslaughter (truth established) but his sentence awaits the judge's decision. Here we see another function of lawyers - they plead with the judge to reduce your sentence.</div>
