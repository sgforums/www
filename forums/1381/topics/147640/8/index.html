God does the job. We say biblically that those who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ will have eternal life. [God has predestinated that those who placed their faith in Jesus Christ will enter His kingdom.] Of course, there will be some who will use the "given authority" to condemn people. Who are we to condemn people to hell, right? We are to be judged afterall. Do you think all who believe in Christ will be in heaven? I afraid I have to say no. God judges our heart. The bible is clear that not all who "perform deeds" in His name will enter the kingdom of heaven. Sometimes, I even worry that He will say this to me at that time.<br><br>So, all in all, when we justify, we justify biblically. I understand that there are some verses or theology or teachings in the bible which is hard to accept and reconcile with our logic thinking. Initially I have a hard time to digest and reconcile certain verses, theology and teachings too. But I search with all my heart to understand what God wants from us. As I slowly, finally understand what Christianity is all about, I find that I can slowly understand the meaning of certain verses, theology and teachings. It really takes me quite some time to take a closer step to understand God. It is tough really. Because the bible told us that God uses the foolish things in the world for His plan. That is why the Gospel seems to be foolish to many people.<br><br>Brothers, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth. But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. He chose the lowly things of this world and the despised thingsÂ—and the things that are notÂ—to nullify the things that are, so that no one may boast before him. (1 Corinthians 1:26-29)<br><br>I do not know why God wants to do it that way, but He told us in the bible that His way is higher that our way.</div>
