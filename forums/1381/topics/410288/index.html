              <p>i just read a police report on how a 3 yr-old girl was sexually assaulted and then drowned by a man............</p>
              <p>since Christians will say that the girl died becoz God wanted her in heaven..............</p>
              <p>now, if i were to ask why the little girl must die so horribly...............you'll say God works in mysterious ways.....</p>
              <p>now why can't God just use a snap of his fingers, eh ?</p>
              <p>also, by making the man kill the girl.................the man goes to hell..............but it was God that did it !</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so tell me how you people make sense of this NON-sense ?</p>

              <p>Normally i would not bother replying such a thread cos of the confirm flaming... but this time dunno why i feel like it..</p>
              <p>One thing i can confirm for you now, is that it was not "God's will" that the girl, or anyone should die. The Bible says that Death is an enemy, and will be conquered when Jesus returns.</p>
              <p>God definitely did not make that man kill anyone, He does not make anyone do anything. Everyone has a free choice. God didnt create robots. You can choose to eat char kuay tiao today for lunch, you can choose not to. There are some things God will not do for several reasons, for example, God cannot lie, and God will not enforce his blessings on someone without being asked. </p>

              <p>All are born in Sin, but there is an age of accountability whereby people are responsible for their own sins, which is around the age of 10. why 10yrs?  Cos all jewish kids learn the Torah(written law) by 7yrs, and the Talmud(spoken law) by 10 yrs old.  Therefore the standard is set at 10yrs.  Paul says once he was alive, but when he learnt the Law, the law killed him.</p>
              <p>The key here is that accepting Christ means you let Jesus take your place of judgement, and you take His place of righteousness.</p>

              <p>Who ever told you "God works in mysterious ways" does not really know God. The Bible says "if you see me (Jesus), you have seen the Father.(John 14:7)  And all throughout the Gospels, we see Jesus raising the dead, healing ALL who came to Him, the deaf hear, the blind see. Jesus is God's will in action.</p>

According to some, few family members experienced the same thing and some is a family member experienced the same thing over and over again. I shall not elaborate. As the bible did mention that the road the heaven is narrow and few will find it. So to speak, not all the Christians will go to heaven, only the good ones may be.</p>

              <p>I was also told of these experiences, like Buddhists saying my father's father stuck in limbo cant be elevated or something as he was buddhist, and my mum's side praying that he goes to "heaven" , but whatever it is, the Buddhist master claimed that in the end everything was fine and nothing to be worried about anymore.</p>
              <p>So in this instance, is it the prayer of my mum's side or my dad's side that resulted in it? U see the problem here. Or both are equally insane while both can equally be as logical.</p>
