              <h3>Jesus Commanded Forgiveness</h3>
              <p><strong>Mark 11:25 ESV</strong> And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.”</p>
              <p><strong>Matthew 6:14-15 ESV</strong> For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, (15) but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</p>
              <p><strong>Luke 17:3-4 ESV</strong> Pay attention to yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him, (4) and if he sins against you seven times in the day, and turns to you seven times, saying, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive him.”</p>
              <p><strong>Matthew 18:21-22 ESV</strong> Then Peter came up and said to him, “Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?” (22) Jesus said to him, “I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven.</p>
              <p><strong>Luke 6:36-37 ESV</strong> Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful. (37) “Judge not, and you will not be judged; condemn not, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven;</p>
              <p><strong>Matthew 5:44 ESV</strong> But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,</p>
              <p><strong>Luke 23:34 ESV</strong> And Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” And they cast lots to divide his garments.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>Stephen Was An Example Of Forgiveness</h3>
              <p><strong>Acts 7:59-60 ESV</strong> And as they were stoning Stephen, he called out, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” (60) And falling to his knees he cried out with a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” And when he had said this, he fell asleep.</p>

              <p>God forgives sins but does that mean the doer will not have to suffer the consequence of his actions ? For instance, a muderer was caught and put to jail. He repents and God forgives him. God's forgiveness does not take away the pain of the lost of the victim's loved ones. What is done cannot be undone.</p>

              <p><br>.............. so it is better to think of the consequence of every actions. There are many things which are irreversible even with God's forgiveness and grace. So, don't think that forgiveness is readily available and can act recklessly without thinking of the harm that your actions will bring to others.</p>

              <p>if u are referring to the case when a christian kills another, then judgement will be upon the christian who killed. however, is it to the pt when God will disown him and chase him out of the hse(heaven)? will u chase ur child out of teh hse and disown him if he killed another of ur child?</p>

              I was very touched by a Elder from certain church preached a statement that is still ringing in my mind. 
              "When God choose you, He will not unchoose you!"
              
              That's the theology of Salvation. :)
