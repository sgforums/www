              <p>fortmax77,</p>
              <p>I read your good fortune #1 - #7.</p>
              <p>Looks like if you pray to your god, bad spell were turned into good endings. That's good for you.</p>
              <p>May I know roughly what is your percentage of good endings over the total number of your praying/wishing ?</p>
              <p>+ I understand it is hard to estimate, let's say it is about 1%, that's 1 hits over 100 praying. That's maybe low.</p>
              <p>+ Or let's be optimistic, let's say 50%, that's 5 hits per 10 praying. This is too luckly, if you are in this category, I would like to be your best friend :)</p>
              <p>+ Generally, I believe 10% is acceptable. 1 answered per 10 wishes. I am in this category and I don't need to thank any supernatural being. I thank my good fortune. I don't need to attribute my 9 other failures to any supernatural being.</p>
              <p>What do you said when you have unanswered prayers ?</p>

              <p>I do not know a percentage overall but so far I know its 100% whenever things get really out of hand and almost beyond I can bear.</p>
              <p>No doubt, my prayers do not get answered all the time. Lottery for example <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> but not being a multi millionaire is not beyond what I can bear.

              <p>atheists claim there is no proof for creation...actually wad
              they mean is there isnt GD ENUFF proof for creation cos
              creationists do have proof. its juz tat the atheists feel the proof
              not gd enuff...</p>
              <p>the reverse is also true...atheists claim to have proof tat God
              dun exist...evolutionists try to produce evidence to prove
              evolution. however, the creationists feel tat the proof provided is
              NOT GD ENUFF... so i guess at the end of the day, the issue is not
              whether there is proof but rather whether there is GD ENUFF proof
              for the respective sides...it must be noted that juz as atheists
              can claim the evidence provided by creationists is flawed,
              creationists can also do likewise...so wads the conclusion? wads gd
              enuf evidence to one may not be gd enuff evidence to the
              other...like the saying: one man's meat is another man's

              <p>Christianity is about faith, not about facts. It's not based purely on evidence but it's definitely supported by evidence....and the faith is strengthened by personal experiences.</p>
              <p>Of course for non-believers, they have to be supported by facts.</p>

              <p>Well, everybody claimed that they experience with their Gods (all religions) or Buddhas . So, which experience one should believe in? of course, the God or the Buddha the individual  experience with, right ? That is why there are many followers in all the religions.</p>
