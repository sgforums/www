              <p>I don't think anyone can claim to be knowledgeable in such
              areas, its like someone claiming to be a astrology expert. If
              historical sources do not mention a large infanticide on such a
              scale, makes it very likely that it never happened at
              all.  </p>

              <p>Herod was notorious for the ways he settled scores and murdering rivals, including his own wives and children. Is it not possible for him to murder the children of peasants whom he thought was a threat to his reign?</p>

              <p>How can that one line in Matthew's gospel be a "proven opinion"? It is possible for Herod to have done that, but no evidence suggests he did. It is also possible that the US could have caused a nuclear Armageddon, but that does not mean it did. The ability to execute an action and the execution of an action are two different things. As for your last point, that is completely baseless </p>

              <p>Well it depends on your starting philosophy. If you believe in a naturalistic universe which is a closed system with no outside intervention possible, then miracles and the supernatural are of course, out of the question. All appearance of the supernatural would then have entirely natural causes.</p>
              <p>Even if evidence of the supernatural was presented, one will not believe it on basis of that philosophy. It's like if I don't believe in ghosts and I happen to see one, I could explain it as a matter of the nerves or an illusion.</p>
              <p>That's why I find all these arguments of evolution/miracles/science largely pointless... it depends on your starting philosophy. The weight of evidence itself is not enough to convince a person on either side in any way.</p>
