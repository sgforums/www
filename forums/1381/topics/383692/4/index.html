              <p>Hi Laffin, if I am not wrong, you are a free thinker. I was like
              you who thought that after a person passed away, that is the end of
              the story. However, the ugly truth is that it is not the case
              because I have some encounters which I shall not elaborate here. I
              hate the truth but have to face it. I have found my religion and
              found peace. Sincerely hope that you will find answers and
              peace soon. </p>

              <p>I believe what you said. The reason why there are many followers in other religions is also because their followers' prayers were answered or else they will not stick to their religion. Of course there are times when your prayers did not come true, or else all christians on earth will live to ripe old age which is not happening all the time.  Just to share with you, Buddhism taught us to get to the roots of the problem instead of keep praying whenever you face a problem. The roots of the problem we face got to do with our karma (cause and effect). You must be a good guy, that is why your prayers always come true. Once you understand about karma and know how to rectify or face with it, you will realise that you have less problems in life and things will go well along the way even without praying.</p>

              <p>I can help him reply you. christians dun believe in karma and rebirth. all they believe is the power of their god. they believed that they will go to heaven when they die, to meet their creator and enjoy heavenly bliss forever.</p>

              god and science concurring that god exists, has that happened yet?
              bible was written by men, and the good men of churches doing good
              things were men too. if these were considered as proof, then may I
              inform you thats not good enough evidence to substantiate it.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000066;">QUESTION: You say there is no evidence for the existence of a god. But what about miracles?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #990000;">ANSWER:</span> There are many who believe that miracles are proof of gods existence. We hear wild claims that a healing has taken place but we never get an independent testimony from a medical office or a surgeon. We hear second-hand reports that someone was miraculously saved from disaster but we never get an eye-witness account of what is supposed to have happened. We hear rumours that prayer straightened a diseased body or strengthened a withered limb, but we never see X-rays or get comments from doctors or nurses. Wild claims, second-hand reports and rumours are no substitute for solid evidence and solid evidence of miracles is very rare. However, sometimes unexplained things do happen, unexpected events do occur. But our inability to explain such things does not prove the existence of gods. It only proves that our knowledge is as yet incomplete. Before the development of modern medicine, when people didn’t know what caused sickness people believed that god or the gods sent diseases as a punishment. Now we know what causes such things and when we get sick, we take medicine. In time when our knowledge of the world is more complete, we will be able to understand what causes unexplained phenomena, just as we can now understand what causes disease.</p>

              <p>the mother is sad because she could not accept that death to her daugther has happened early in her life and also her attachment to her is very strong. she is asking why her daughter needed to die so early when other children can live to a ripe old age. some foetus do not even get the chance to get born and some infants do not survive past their year old birthday. if you ask me why, all I can explain is sickness and diseases are part and parcel living in this world. the strong can become weak one day.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000066;">QUESTION: You say there is no
              evidence for the existence of a god. But what about
              miracles?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #990000;">ANSWER:</span> There are many who
              believe that miracles are proof of gods existence. We hear wild
              claims that a healing has taken place but we never get an
              independent testimony from a medical office or a surgeon. We hear
              second-hand reports that someone was miraculously saved from
              disaster but we never get an eye-witness account of what is
              supposed to have happened. We hear rumours that prayer straightened
              a diseased body or strengthened a withered limb, but we never see
              X-rays or get comments from doctors or nurses. Wild claims,
              second-hand reports and rumours are no substitute for solid
              evidence and solid evidence of miracles is very rare. However,
              sometimes unexplained things do happen, unexpected events do occur.
              But our inability to explain such things does not prove the
              existence of gods. It only proves that our knowledge is as yet
              incomplete. Before the development of modern medicine, when people
              didn’t know what caused sickness people believed that god or the
              gods sent diseases as a punishment. Now we know what causes such
              things and when we get sick, we take medicine. In time when our
              knowledge of the world is more complete, we will be able to
              understand what causes unexplained phenomena, just as we can now
              understand what causes disease.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately for you, there are medically proven cases but it is just that you don't want to google and read up about them.....and even if you do, you will discount them anyway. No reasons is needed for you.</p>
              <p>And there are also miracles that have been studied by scientists and doctors who cannot provide any concrete answers to dispute what is factual.</p>

              <p>I am a Christian so I will tend to speak up for God. But
              also God has helped me in many ways and I shall share some exaples

              <p>1) Was lost sad and lonely. Life in mess, trouble with law and
              very depressed seems all alone in this world. Prayed for
              companionship, along came my GF (now my wife for coming 10
              yrs).</p>
              <p>2) NS. Kena tekan. Emotionally weak to be away from GF. Prayed
              for help. Posted out of unit which tekan me and got stay out
              vocation.</p>
              <p>3) ORD. Lost dunno what to do. Prayed to go o/seas to pursue
              degree. Went o/seas to pursur degree.</p>
              <p>4) Start degree. Lost because 3 years no study and returned all
              my knowledge to my Pre-U teachers liao. Prayed for wisdom. Caught
              up very quickly graduated with 1st Class.</p>
              <p>5) Graduated looking for job. No income got to support my self
              in menatime. This one is interesting and unconventional. Prayed for
              Finance. Went casino won $1000 + every week for about 2 months. By
              the last two weeks didn't even try. Walk into casino with $500
              place first bet on anything/any game (even a stupid game like
              Casino Wars) win once win twice win thrice go home. - 10 mins total
              - $1500.</p>
              <p>6) Got interview. decided I like job. Pray for job - employed
              almost immediately. After employed began losing at Casino, but got
              God's msg that Casino was only supplying finances temporarily. So
              decided to stop going regularly and focus on work and family.</p>
              <p>7) Feel that I have a very pleasant life know with good job,

              <p>fortmax77,</p>
              <p>I read your good fortune #1 - #7.</p>
              <p>Looks like if you pray to your god, bad spell were turned into good endings. That's good for you.</p>
              <p>May I know roughly what is your percentage of good endings over the total number of your praying/wishing ?</p>
              <p>+ I understand it is hard to estimate, let's say it is about 1%, that's 1 hits over 100 praying. That's maybe low.</p>
              <p>+ Or let's be optimistic, let's say 50%, that's 5 hits per 10 praying. This is too luckly, if you are in this category, I would like to be your best friend :)</p>
              <p>+ Generally, I believe 10% is acceptable. 1 answered per 10 wishes. I am in this category and I don't need to thank any supernatural being. I thank my good fortune. I don't need to attribute my 9 other failures to any supernatural being.</p>
              <p>What do you said when you have unanswered prayers ?</p>

              <p>Hi Laffin, if I am not wrong, you are a free thinker. I was like
              you who thought that after a person passed away, that is the end of
              the story. However, the ugly truth is that it is not the case
              because I have some encounters which I shall not elaborate here. I
              hate the truth but have to face it. I have found my religion and

              <p>Dawnfirstlight,</p>
              <p>maybe my earlier post with a fool made you think I am a free thinker. That was when I wanted to be open minded and asked a series of question, but that fool was too skeptical and did not want to answer my question.</p>
              <p>So without any satisfactory explanation on the existence of supernatural being, I want to maintain my conviction of evolution and natural selection have the most convincing explanation to life. With this and of course the knowledge of religious history, I conclude that god is manmade stuff.</p>
              <p>I think you are a religious person who felt that religious scriptures are not trustworthy and you enjoyed the spiritual strength this religion offer.</p>
              <p>If I am right about this, you can convince yourself that you don't need a 'name' religion, you just need a righteous guiding light in your heart and you will just find peace without religion.</p>

              <p>You have pinned too much hope on miracles. Read the obituaries in the Straits Times and you will not be so naive. You will see many christians who die young, in fact too young to die.</p>
              <p>There is another force which is greater than God and that is karma (cause and effect). I have read a lot about casue and effect, it says one of the immediate cause and effect is ill treating the parents. You observe carefully for those who have ill treated their parents, they will definitely end up with no good ending in this life. I have seen with my own eyes. This proves the existence of karma. Karma applies to everybody regardless of your faith and will never go wrong, no bias and no favourtism.</p>

              <p>+ an atheist do not subscribe to anyone's view, he/she is matured enough to judge thing rationally with reasoning and evidence and decide for himself/herself. For example: I don't blindly follow every words of charles darwin or carl sagan and I don't idolize them.</p>

              <p>you seems to accord ranking to an agnostic and an atheist with
              reference to carl sagan's knowledge.</p>
              <p>+ an atheist do not subscribe to anyone's view, he/she is
              matured enough to judge thing rationally with reasoning and
              evidence and decide for himself/herself. For example: I don't
              blindly follow every words of charles darwin or carl sagan and I
              don't idolize them.</p>
              <p>+ an agnostic is sitting on a fence and I have less respect for
              this group of people than for faith-following people.</p>

              <p>......because he was a famous scientist. He said that it's very difficult to prove or disprove the idea of a creator of the universe. Was he wrong?</p>
              <p>An atheist knows that there's no God but does he?</p>

              <p>well, the concept of omnipotence is flawed to begin with. this just proves one thing, you and your brethren will do whatever, just to defend the concept, however flawed or the weak arguments they may be. its plain for all to see here.</p>

              <p>atheists claim there is no proof for creation...actually wad they mean is there isnt GD ENUFF proof for creation cos creationists do have proof. its juz tat the atheists feel the proof not gd enuff...</p>
              <p>the reverse is also true...atheists claim to have proof tat God dun exist...evolutionists try to produce evidence to prove evolution. however, the creationists feel tat the proof provided is NOT GD ENUFF... so i guess at the end of the day, the issue is not whether there is proof but rather whether there is GD ENUFF proof for the respective sides...it must be noted that juz as atheists can claim the evidence provided by creationists is flawed, creationists can also do likewise...so wads the conclusion? wads gd enuf evidence to one may not be gd enuff evidence to the other...like the saying: one man's meat is another man's poison...quoting wad miracles &amp; prophecies have said b4...''theres private proof but public proof? no way...'' the same can be said abt atheism...</p>
