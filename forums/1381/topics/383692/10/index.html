              <p>The authors of the 4 gospels are said to have written the gospels from 60-110 BC, at least 3 decades from the death of jesus and this refers to Mark. Why would the gospels appear only 3 decades later? It is equally likely that it is a perpetuated myth, especially since the jesus story is highly simillar to parts of pagan mythology</p>

              <p>in the first testament, god was portrayed as petty, vicious, capriciousness, always angry etc</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>second testament god was portrayed all all merciful, kind, compassionate etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>clearly it was written by authors of a different era, so bible was in fact written by men.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>another paradox I have observed is that how could god have the characteristics of humans, like anger, compassionate, petty etc. since god is a divine being, it shouldnt have the characteristics of a humans, since god is never a human. it should have characteristics befitting of a divine being isnt it.</p>

              <p>so man is evil because we take after god who is also evil. but there are many buddhists who vow no killing and vegetarian. this shows that man can be  better than god.</p>
              <p>if what you say is correct, man is evil because we take after god. then why submit yourself to an evil god. i don't know why you want to portray your god as an evil god, just to show why god has human characters ? or because you have no explanation for why god has human characters ?</p>

              <p>Yes, it is a view held by many scholars, thus the basis for the distrust in the accuracy of the bible, and whether or not the disciples were who they claimed they were. The writers of the 4 gospels, only 2 claimed to be disciples. Another point of contention is the claim of the masscre of the infants by herod, only mentioned in one gospel and mentioned no where else in any historical text. Questionable? You may google these issues and find out</p>

              <p>Another area of contention. The selection of which passages to be taken literally and which are not to be. The passages that should be taken literally in the past may be symbolic now, who decides? By what criteria does the priest/pastor decide? For example if the bible says something, like black is white, when proven wrong the religious would just say the bible meant white when it said black. A book such as the bible can be spun into all sorts of things when depending on what people choose to think.</p>

Or the other nasty passages of human sacrifice, male superiority? If not, one must ask why they choose to conceal the parts that do not aid their cause in drawing in more people.
