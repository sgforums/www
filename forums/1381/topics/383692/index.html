              <p>Ya, laffin123, I remember this quote by Prof Richard Dawkins. His website, richarddawkins.net, has many more quotes of reason.</p>
              <p>Here are more quotes of reason:</p>
              <p><em>"It is far better to understand the Universe as it really is than to pretend to <br>a Universe as we might wish it to be"<br>- Carl Sagan, astronomer, astrophysicist</em><br><em></em></p>
              <p><em>"Science has proof without any certainty,</em><em> Creationists have certainty without any proof"</em>- Ashley Montague</p>
              <p><em>"They were wonderful stories, but the truth is so much more remarkable" <br>- Richard Feynman, physicist</em></p>

              <p>There is no need to be defensive. </p>
              <p>In essence, Charles Darwin's or Richard Dawkins' publications do not want us to blindly follow them. Their teachings want us to open our eye, open our mind, look at the evident and decide for ourselves. </p>

              <p>You don't have to be defensive.....as you said, we should  open

              <p>REASON and EVIDENCE is pointing to you making illogical conclusion based on your lack of understanding......</p>

              <p>So from an idea of opening one's mind, you can drag on to include so much stuff.</p>
              <p>I have told you I can't move beyond Genesis 4:17 and I could not understand it from head to toe. This is my inability of understanding. Can you people help me ? This verse contains no REASON and EVIDENCE. Can I still quantified TRUTH that the bible contains. Even in GENESIS chapter 1 talking about EVE and ADAM, this has so much in common with the Islamic quran. Why is there so much hate between ISLAM and CHRISTIAN ?? Are they originate from a community donkeys years ago. Earth is created in one day?? ONE DAY ???? I want to open my mind about this, can you teach me how ? The jewish, islamic and christianity originate from Abrahamic faith. Why are you people fighting ? Is this political ? And you keep on telling people here to prove the god is not real. Wait for judgement day for god to punish them who badmouthed god ? Come on if the supernatural being is real, come get us now. Don't play play wait for judgement day while your flock leaders get rich and your homosexual priests can hide behind religion. god is not real, it is manmade stuff, you want the proof? Read the history. GO READ THE HISTORY OF THE ORGIN OF RELIGION! I have studied the history, that's why I am here.</p>

              <p>Ha..ha..ha... now you said you are trying to understand? You think this is the correct platform for you to truely learn about the faith or any faith? Come on.....you are not here to understand the faith....who are you kidding?</p>
              <p>If you are really keen to open your mind and learn, you should go and find a Church or organisation that you think will be able to help you....I can suggest to you if you pm me only if you are honest and sincere about it.....</p>

              <p>Still, I wonder how you can conclude when you really did not understand and that's why I said that's illogical......when you made conclusion based on something that you could not understand.</p>

              think this is the correct platform for you to truely learn about
              the faith or any faith? Come on.....you are not here to understand
              the faith....who are you kidding?</p>
              <p>If you are really keen to open your mind and learn, you should
              go and find a Church or organisation that you think will be able to
              help you....I can suggest to you if you pm me only if you are
              honest and sincere about it.....</p>
              <p>Before you can even understand, you are making plenty of
              accussations and insults and yet you said you are very patience and
              polite??</p>
              <p>By the way, I am not here to keep telling people to proved that
              God is not real....I am only asking people who claimed that to
              prove their case......and sad to say, none of them can back up what
              they said......</p>
              <p>Still, I wonder how you can conclude when you really did not
              understand and that's why I said that's illogical......when you
              made conclusion based on something that you could not
              understand.</p>
              <p>I am not trying to be rude and calling you names as you have
              claimed.</p>
              <p>What good debate you want?</p>
              <p>All I am saying here in this thread is to highlight that Dawkin
              misrepresented the Bible and that's a fact. And one's mind and eyes
              cannot be opened by misrepresented facts..........unless they make
              illogical conclusions.</p>

              <p>Ya, laffin123, I remember this quote by Prof Richard Dawkins.
              His website, richarddawkins.net, has many more quotes of
              reason.</p>
              <p>Here are more quotes of reason:</p>
              <p><em>"It is far better to understand the Universe as it really is
              than to pretend to<br> a Universe as we might wish it to be"<br> - Carl Sagan, astronomer, astrophysicist</em></p>
              <p><em>"Science has proof without any certainty,</em> <em>Creationists have certainty without any proof"</em>- Ashley
              Montague</p>
              <p><em>"They were wonderful stories, but the truth is so much more
              remarkable"<br> - Richard Feynman, physicist</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2><br></h2>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The quote by Carl Sagan is very subjective. How sure is he that the universe he describes as it really is, is not a universe that he wishes it to be???</p>
              <p>Also how can Ashley Montague be so sure creationists have certainty without any proof?</p>
              <p>And to Richard Feynman, who knows the remarkable truth that he speaks about could well be just wonderful stories too... it is all subjective... you see what you want to see.</p>

              REASON and EVIDENCE. Can I still quantified TRUTH that the bible
              contains. Even in GENESIS chapter 1 talking about EVE and ADAM,
              this has so much in common with the Islamic quran. Why is there so
              much hate between ISLAM and CHRISTIAN ?? Are they originate from a
              community donkeys years ago. Earth is created in one day?? ONE DAY
              ???? I want to open my mind about this, can you teach me how ? The
              jewish, islamic and christianity originate from Abrahamic
              faith. Why are you people fighting ? Is this political ? And you
              keep on telling people here to prove the god is not real. Wait for
              judgement day for god to punish them who badmouthed god ? Come on
              if the supernatural being is real, come get us now. Don't play play
              wait for judgement day while your flock leaders get rich and your
              homosexual priests can hide behind religion. god is not real, it is
              manmade stuff, you want the proof? Read the history. GO READ THE

              <p>Hey I am a christian and normally I do not engage in such discussions on religions and faiths online and I do respect personal choice of belief but just to point out something here about your thought process.</p>
              <p>You say you ask a question inside this forum, nobody can answer you, and so you made a conclusion. Is that right?</p>
              <p>Now, by making a conclusion because nobody in this forum can answer your question is like going to a tribe deep in Africa and ask them do you know Breadtalk? And just because they dun know the answer or could not answer you, does not mean you can draw the conclusion that Breadtalk does not exist. Ridiculous it may sound, but I think you get what I mean.</p>
              <p>Nobody can answer you in this forum on questions about God does not mean God does not exist. It only simply means nobody can answer you because they either do not know or they do not know. How would that translate into a conclusion otherwise?</p>
              <p>Vice versa, does not mean if someone can answer questions, it means God is real. It just mean that person can answer the question.</p>
              <p>So if you conclude that God is fake/not real/a hippie/a junkie or making any sort of conclusions just because people inside this FORUM cannot answer your questions, I suggest, and just a suggestion, refine your thought process.</p>
              <p>going to a church and talking to pastors or going to apologetics forums would probably help you to "conclude" better and more credibly.</p>

              <p>My science consideration is the report from carbon dating. I removed this idea totally and guessed 100 years should be okay. Okay, let's ignore all the days verses and earth creation and stuff, how can I feel the presence of god ? So far, I have not experience it.</p>

              <p><br>Hey, its good to want to know more. But its not fair to make conclusions based on the responses here since this is a forum and a more social platforum rather than a religious authority.</p>
              <p>I have never talked to you before and so do not want to make assumptions about you and your motvies but the fact remains that this is a social forum and will never be a good platform for serious or sincere discussions on these issues. Thus, of course you can still ask, but if you are serious to get answers, go talk to the people who are authorities on this.</p>

              <p>Maybe we have to try to hold a serious talk here. Otherwise, this forum becomes very shallow.</p>
              <p>On a side note: I find that sgforums.com has the world class standard discussion in public bus and train. It is amazing to read some subtle details of bus/train that I could never see myself. :D</p>
