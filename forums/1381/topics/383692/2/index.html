              <p>As you can see from my previous posts, I adopted an open mind. You and gasband still skeptical of my intention. Let's be open and do it here, why the need of pm ?</p>
              <p>I want to find out if supernatural beings exist. That's the very basis of faith. So far I have never experience it. If I cannot feel it, what kind of faith is it for me? If you invite me to your church/temple/mosque, can your priest point out where to feel a supernatural being? I don't think anyone here in this thread can confidently bring me there. If I don't feel it with your priest, I don't know what you want to say to me. If there is a supernatural being, I hope he will come out now and convince me now.</p>
              <p>So I turn to reading. And I learnt more about religion origin. I came to know Darwin and feel very satisfied with his explanation.</p>
              <p>I guess the discussion with you will lead to nowhere as you are skeptical of my motive. Whoever can convince me, I will follow your teaching. If it is so powerful, it can melt my heart of stone.</p>
              <p>I still maintain "faith means NOT wanting to know more".</p>
              <p>Luckily, I am a curious person who will keep on searching for cold hard facts. You can carry on label me as illogical person. My conclusion is maintain "no supernatural being whatsoever" and I have no regret labelled as a illogical fool. If a supernatural being come to know what I am typing now, please help me not to be illogical now.</p>
              <p>If I am in an african tribe, guess Breadtalk will never fly to me. But if a supernatural being can perform miracle, come to me now, why wait to reveal yourself. If not powerful to perform miracle, then I prefer to satisfy with  Darwin's teaching and it is still strengthening/correcting by cold hard facts everyday now. It provides far more REASON and EVIDENCE than what 'faithful' people here have been dodging me. </p>
              <p>If you still question my "support of REASON and EVIDENCE", please show me the evident of "FAITH" now. I can't experience a god, I need someone to provide me an evident.</p>
              <p>You are welcome to ask me any question of evolution and natural selection, I try my best to answer you. </p>

              <p>2) Yes, you are right, science is constantly answering the origin of life and we will find out one fine day. Preliminary studies: the universe is about 4 - 5 billion old. Trillion and trillions of chemical reactions took place since, and one chemical reaction successfully give birth to one living cell. As time slowly evolve, one cell become an intelligent being like us aided by natural selection. This is the origin of life. On why the universe exist, it is not very clear, although it has been forecast the universe will contract after expansion. Then it will collapse to a singular point and big band cycle continue again. This is my best ability to explain simply as possible. Hope to hear anyone helping and correcting me.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>How well do you think humans know the universe?</p>
              <p>Remember all scientific theories including big bang theory are theories. i.e. They are accepted until something shows it to be false. They are not gospel infallible truths.</p>
              <p>Some scientists have explained that Genesis account of creation can be explained by Einstein's theory of relativity. i.e. time is not absolute so the one day in Genesis could mean a couple of million years. But again there is no way to verify this theory.</p>
              <p>All I can say is that I believe in the God of the Bible since HE has touched my life in many ways. I know that HE is beyond our underatanding and our science is nothing compared to his knowledge!</p>

              <p>I want to find out if supernatural beings exist. That's the very basis of faith. So far I have never experience it. If I cannot feel it, what kind of faith is it for me?</p>
              <p>From a Song by Michael Card (Its a pretty nice tune if you can find it):</p>
              <p>"To see with my heart,</p>
              <p>To feel with my soul,</p>
              <p>To be guided by a hand I cannot hold,</p>
              <p>To believe in a way that I cannot see. Thats what faith must be."</p>
              <p>To a Christian, faith (that Christ died for you) and faith alone is the only thing that can bring you through the gates of heaven - That is the fundamental basis of all Christianity.</p>
              <p>No one can meet God's standard otherwise:</p>
              <p>HIS law (Forget Human Perception of Law)</p>
              <p>Lust = Adultery (Penalty: Eternal Death)</p>
              <p>Hate = Murder (Penalty: Eternal Death)</p>
              <p>I guess that basically disqualifies every human on earth from entering the gates of heaven.</p>

              <p>2. Can they even agree on the findings? And yes, they are unclear over many issues and everything boils down to this....they are speculating......and there is no way they can prove the one cell thingy nor the bang bang theory. What reasons and evidence are we talking about? Yet, your hearts is melted by those speculations?</p>
              <p>3. Don't you already know my opinion on the origin of life? It's beyond your understanding or perhaps, your refusal to try and understand and to know more...</p>
              <p>Despite saying that you are keen to learn and open minded etc..., you continuously post the same old crap...why not spend some time to read up the alterantive? At least in the spirit of wanting to know more and satisfy your curious litlle mind.....a little more than those crappy misrepresented facts....</p>
              <p>I am not even asking you to beleive in God.....I am only telling you right from the start, I am providing an alternate view from TS. You said you want people to open up their minds? How ? By trusting in those misrepresented facts? Or for people to read and view both versions and come to a conclusion themselves?</p>
              <p>It's ok not to believe in God but at least know the reasons....and if you want to come to a Christian forum to says God does not exist, at least show some proof....</p>

              <p>Hi Fortmax, thanks for replying. I can see that you are a reasonable person.</p>
              <p>i) It is interesting to learn from you that scientist used relativity to explain Genesis. It could be a giant gravity in the past somewhere in space, that warp time and accelerate the birth of earth. This could be done in one day if the gravity is that huge. So this is a possibility of verifying Genesis' one day arguement.</p>
              <p>ii) Also you raise another point that one day could represent a million year in the Genesis. This is another point of view. Can be acceptable for argument sake.</p>
              <p>iii) My point (i) above also raise another controversy. Why does the author of Genesis know it is one day (with accelerated Einistein's relative theory) ?</p>
              <p>sincerely</p>

              <p>No offence, I am somebody who does not believe in creator. Why Christ must die for us ? In the first place, God shouldn't create us and this world. If God has really created human beings and this world, I think He has somehow lost control of what he has created.</p>

              <p>1. I don't think you have tried at all from your posts.....it is
              you who said you have an open mind and I should not define it for
              .... you should I ? How's a mind that is filled with anti-God
              thoughts for open mindedness? Resons and evidence should tell
              you.</p>
              <p>2. Can they even agree on the findings? And yes, they are
              unclear over many issues and everything boils down to this....they
              are speculating......and there is no way they can prove the one
              cell thingy nor the bang bang theory. What reasons and evidence are
              we talking about? Yet, your hearts is melted by those
              speculations?</p>
              <p>3. Don't you already know my opinion on the origin of life? It's
              beyond your understanding or perhaps, your refusal to try and
              understand and to know more...</p>
              <p>Despite saying that you are keen to learn and open minded
              etc..., you continuously post the same old crap...why not spend
              some time to read up the alterantive? At least in the spirit of
              wanting to know more and satisfy your curious litlle mind.....a
              little more than those crappy misrepresented facts....</p>
              <p>I am not even asking you to beleive in God.....I am only telling
              you right from the start, I am providing an alternate view from TS.
              You said you want people to open up their minds? How ? By trusting
              in those misrepresented facts? Or for people to read and view both
              versions and come to a conclusion themselves?</p>
              <p>It's ok not to believe in God but at least know the
              reasons....and if you want to come to a Christian forum to says God
              does not exist, at least show some proof....</p>

              <p>2) Yes, the science result findings are overwhelmingly plenty and sometimes they contradict each other. Okay, scientist identified the contradiction and they dig deeper to understand. We are willing to owe up to any wrong finding. Why are you dodging the contradiction of Genesis 4:17 and tell me about REASON AND EVIDENCE ?!?!!!!!!!!!
