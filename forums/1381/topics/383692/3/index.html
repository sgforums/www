              <p>Hi laffin123,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i) It goes something like this. According to Einstein, time and space are relative unlike the Newtonian, Galilean point of view in which time and space are absolute. This ties in nicely with the outcome of the Michelson-Morley experiment which serves to confirm the constancy of the speed of light regardless of the velocity of the frame of reference.</p>
              <p>This is nicely explained if time is relative. i.e. an observer on a spceship travelling close to the speed of light will note that a unit of time in his frame of reference will translate to a longer period of time in a stationary of reference (Google time dilation). E.G 1 sec to that guy in the spaceship could be 1000 years on a stationary frame of reference.</p>
              <p>Now who is to say that God is at rest or moving with whatever velocity. But say supposing he is moving very close to the speed of light during the creation period then he can indeed say that 1million or billion years in our frame of reference = 1 day to him.</p>
              <p>Please be advised that this is just trying to use our limited scientific knowledge to <strong>possibly</strong> account for the creation and is not definitive.</p>
              <p>Remember this is man trying to fit God into his observations but that does not imply God is bounded by any physical laws. He is infinite we are not. We are subject to laws of physics which govern even the stars and planetary motion, HE is not. In fact all are subject to his commands including the laws of physics and the stars.</p>
              <p>ii) see (i)</p>
              <p>iii) The author of Genesis is probably what he saw in a vision of God or audience with God. Remember God intended the Holy scriptures to pint the way to man's salvation and his glory, not as a text on how everything came about. If he did we probably would not be able to understand much if anything at all consideru=ing our limited mental capacity compared to HIS.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>No offence, I am somebody who does not believe in creator. Why Christ must die for us ? In the first place, God shouldn't create us and this world. If God has really created human beings and this world, I think He has somehow lost control of what he has created.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Hi DawnFirstLight,</p>
              <p>God created everything for his glory and honour. Now, before I go on let me make it clear that God is not egoistic. Its just that he simply deserves all glory and honour. Imagine a super big sparkling diamond. Everyone would give due attention to its glory and beauty right and you cannot say that the diamond is being egoistic right? I mena Its just so beautiful. Well God is something like that only in this case even the diamond, the stars, the planets and the angels themselves are giving due attention to HIS glory.</p>
              <p>So my point is God's will is to lead to ultimate glorification for HIMSELF and that is the whole point of Biblical history. He did not create this world for us to satisfy us but HIS will. So no one can say whether God should or should not create this world.</p>
              <p>Christ came to die for God's elect (i.e. those who accept HIM) so that we could enter HIS kingdom to serve HIS purpose. Like it or not the whole human race is going to hell because of the first sin unless we accept the death and resurrection of Christ. Now I know many will say then this is not fair but then how can we humans use our standards and perceptions to judge the Creator.</p>
              <p>Remember, God is not elected to be in power by us or the angels or anything at all. He does not have to answer to us or anything at all but everything has to answer to him. Even if he were to condemn all and not save a single soul we still cannot fault him for if that is his will then he is right. Yet out of his grace and loving kindness, God himself in the form of Christ came to Earth to teach us, live like us and suffer one of the cruelest forms of death in history so that he can bear our punishment and save HIS elect.</p>
              <p>Somewhere in Exodus, God says "I shall have compassion on whom I shall have compassion and I shall have mercy on whom I shall have mercy" - Not our choice, not our logic, not our decision but all HIS.</p>
              <p>If a human judge were to say that openly in court he would probably be questioned, fired or face other consequences. It is not within his power to do as he pleases but to apply the law which has been agreed by the people via parliament.</p>
              <p>However, in God's case he says that openly and made an open declaration in HIS word clearly indicating HE can do whatever he pleases and is not accountable to anyone but HIMSELF. His laws are not agreed on or subject to a vote from the people, democarcy does not apply in this case. If he has chosen to love you, he has chosen to love you and there is nothing you or anyone can do about that remember you don't earn HIS love it is purely by grace so if he has chosen you for his salvation all you can be is grateful for HIS graciousness.</p>
              <p>And God certainly has not lost control. Everything is moving exactly according to his will to achieve HIS ultimate purpose which no one on Earth can understand or fathom. All we can do is sit and wait and enjoy whatever blessings HE has chosen to shower us with and for those who have accepted Christ show gratitude for HIS salvation.</p>

              <p>Hi Fortmax, no offence. Let's takes this as a religion exchange of view. I believe your God does exist because Buddha said so and there will not be so many followers if He does not exist. Many of his followers are smart guys. However,  your God is a loving God, He will not create a horrible place called earth. Heaven is also not the place where I wish to go because I do not wish to live all over again and live forever ( I will definitely feel bored), not even in a nice place like heaven. Whether a person feels happy or not does not depend on the environment he lives but how his heart feels.  Buddhism emphasise on taking control of our hearts and feelings. Merry Christmas to you guys!</p>

              <p>Fortmax77,</p>
              <p>you are a more likable person to talk to than happyinfo2.</p>
              <p>i) &amp; ii) It is very insightful explanation from you. Clearly it is not known why the supernatural being wants to travel very close to the speed of light during the birth of the universe. Why is it not travel that fast now ? Is there any mention in any religious books? One more point I like to add: gravity force is needed in Einstein 's general relativity, maybe you want to consider gravity as well.</p>
              <p>iii) You are very right that people in the past wrote something which was applicable to that time. Maybe it is written to glorify his name. But you know my intention: bible contains so many confusion points and attracts my questioning. This is a free world, I reserve my right to ask and to make conclsion. And people here said I am Out of Context or illogical even though I try my best to be open minded.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>i) It goes something like this. According to Einstein, time and space are relative unlike the Newtonian, Galilean point of view in which time and space are absolute. This ties in nicely with the outcome of the Michelson-Morley experiment which serves to confirm the constancy of the speed of light regardless of the velocity of the frame of reference.</p>
              <p>This is nicely explained if time is relative. i.e. an observer on a spceship travelling close to the speed of light will note that a unit of time in his frame of reference will translate to a longer period of time in a stationary of reference (Google time dilation). E.G 1 sec to that guy in the spaceship could be 1000 years on a stationary frame of reference.</p>

              <p>Hi DawnFirstLight,</p>
              <p>God created everything for his glory and honour. Now, before I
              go on let me make it clear that God is not egoistic. Its just that
              he simply deserves all glory and honour. Imagine a super big
              sparkling diamond. Everyone would give due attention to its glory
              and beauty right and you cannot say that the diamond is being
              egoistic right? I mena Its just so beautiful. Well God is something
              like that only in this case even the diamond, the stars, the
              planets and the angels themselves are giving due attention to HIS
              glory.</p>
              <p>So my point is God's will is to lead to ultimate glorification
              for HIMSELF and that is the whole point of Biblical history. He did
              not create this world for us to satisfy us but HIS will. So no one
              can say whether God should or should not create this world.</p>
              <p>Christ came to die for God's elect (i.e. those who accept HIM)
              so that we could enter HIS kingdom to serve HIS purpose. Like it or
              not the whole human race is going to hell because of the first sin
              unless we accept the death and resurrection of Christ. Now I know
              many will say then this is not fair but then how can we humans use
              our standards and perceptions to judge the Creator.</p>
              <p>Remember, God is not elected to be in power by us or the angels
              or anything at all. He does not have to answer to us or anything at
              all but everything has to answer to him. Even if he were to condemn
              all and not save a single soul we still cannot fault him for if
              that is his will then he is right. Yet out of his grace and loving
              kindness, God himself in the form of Christ came to Earth to teach
              us, live like us and suffer one of the cruelest forms of death in
              history so that he can bear our punishment and save HIS
              elect.</p>
              <p>Somewhere in Exodus, God says "I shall have compassion on whom I
              shall have compassion and I shall have mercy on whom I shall have
              mercy" - Not our choice, not our logic, not our decision but all
              HIS.</p>
              <p>If a human judge were to say that openly in court he would
              probably be questioned, fired or face other consequences. It is not
              within his power to do as he pleases but to apply the law which has
              been agreed by the people via parliament.</p>
              <p>However, in God's case he says that openly and made an open
              declaration in HIS word clearly indicating HE can do whatever he
              pleases and is not accountable to anyone but HIMSELF. His laws are
              not agreed on or subject to a vote from the people, democarcy does
              not apply in this case. If he has chosen to love you, he has
              chosen to love you and there is nothing you or anyone can do about
              that remember you don't earn HIS love it is purely by grace so if
              he has chosen you for his salvation all you can be is grateful for
              HIS graciousness.</p>
              <p>And God certainly has not lost control. Everything is moving
              exactly according to his will to achieve HIS ultimate purpose which
              no one on Earth can understand or fathom. All we can do is sit and
              wait and enjoy whatever blessings HE has chosen to shower us with
              and for those who have accepted Christ show gratitude for HIS
              salvation.</p>

              <p>look who is talking. asking you for proof that god exists and you let on that the bible, the churches that do good are proof enough that god existed. if thats proof, thats a lame proof so to speak. proof means carbon dating, tv screen capturing the images of god and science concurring that god exists, has that happened yet? bible was written by men, and the good men of churches doing good things were men too. if these were considered as proof, then may I inform you thats not good enough evidence to substantiate it.</p>
              <p>earlier someone mentioned that the onus is to proof that god exists and someone pointed out how can one proof if it doesnt exists. apparently someone here lack some common sense and logic. need I continue anymore?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you even have the cheek to claim that science has proved that god exist? can anyone backup this unabashedly claim? in which science journals that appeared scientists has proven that god existed, could you please quote me the name of the article and year of the journal?</p>

              <p>Hi Fortmax, no offence. Let's takes this as a religion exchange of view. I believe your God does exist because Buddha said so and there will not be so many followers if He does not exist. Many of his followers are smart guys. However,  your God is a loving God, He will not create a horrible place called earth. Heaven is also not the place where I wish to go because I do not wish to live all over again and live forever ( I will definitely feel bored), not even in a nice place like heaven. Whether a person feels happy or not does not depend on the environment he lives but how his heart feels.  Buddhism emphasise on taking control of our hearts and feelings. Merry Christmas to you guys!</p>

              <p>Dawnfirstlight - No offence taken happy to discuss your questions.</p>
              <p>1. Why do you call Earth horrible. Certainly it is not perfect and its horrible only depending on which part of Earth you live on. But many such horrors are human inflicted.</p>
              <p>2. You have not been to heaven and neither has anyone on earth. What gives you the conception that you will feel bored?? Remember you will be with God on a personal level and he will be your friend/comforter/Father. Do you know how nice heaven is? Its beyond human imagination and there is no way we can comprehend it untile we get there.</p>
              <p>On the contrary, do you know how horrid hell is. Again its beyond human imagination. All the images of hell eg fire (for Christians), they grind you up/mash you up (for Taoists) are not even close to representing how bad that place is. I heard of someone who had a vision of hell in her dreams 1 night. Result: Cried nearly continuously for 5 mths and still recovering from shock after that - Asked by pastor to describe what she saw opened her mouth but nothing came out - Basically because there is no way of describing such horrors in the human language or expression.</p>
              <p>Basically, it is a place describe so horrible that even if your most hated person in life were sent there you would mourn for him.</p>
              <p>3. Think of your life as 1 mm on a ruler and compare that with the distance between Sg and New York just for scale. Well Eternity is much longer that so I hope everyone reading this does give some serious thought to after death. It will happen to all of us soon enough.</p>

              <p>4) Start degree. Lost because 3 years no study and returned all my knowledge to my Pre-U teachers liao. Prayed for wisdom. Caught up very quickly graduated with 1st Class.</p>
              <p>5) Graduated looking for job. No income got to support my self in menatime. This one is interesting and unconventional. Prayed for Finance. Went casino won $1000 + every week for about 2 months. By the last two weeks didn't even try.

              <p>Hi Laffin, if I am not wrong, you are a free thinker. I was like you who thought that after a person passed away, that is the end of the story. However, the ugly truth is that it is not the case because I have some encounters which I shall not elaborate here. I hate the truth but have to face it. I have found my religion and found peace. Sincerely hope that you will find answers and peace soon. </p>

              <p>I believe what you said. The reason why there are many followers in other religions is also because their followers' prayers were answered or else they will not stick to their religion. Of course there are times when your prayers did not come true, or else all christians on earth will live to ripe old age which is not happening all the time.  Just to share with you, Buddhism taught us to get to the roots of the problem instead of keep praying whenever you face a problem. The roots of the problem we face got to do with our karma (cause and effect). You must be a good guy, that is why your prayers always come true. Once you understand about karma and know how to rectify or face with it, you will realise that you have less problems in life and things will go well along the way even without praying.</p>

              <p>thanks for the offer, but no thanks, thanks. I will not believe in any religion that centred on a god or many gods. I rather be a free thinker and not get trapped in a paradigm or concept that is flawed from the beginning.</p>
