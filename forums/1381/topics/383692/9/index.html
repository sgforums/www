              <p>Difference is that say the father is Jerry, the son is James, is Jerry = James? They may share simillar characteristics, in this case the sirname, but eventually they are distinctly different. This is incoherent as an example of jesus = yahweh = holy spirit. Using your example, the best i can come up with is that the tan family is 1 unit of god<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>.</p>
