              <p>Has anyone actually heard a sermon where the priest/pastor reads out a passage from the old testament telling people to kill the person who tells you to convert to other religions? Or the other nasty passages of human sacrifice, male superiority? If not, one must ask why they choose to conceal the parts that do not aid their cause in drawing in more people. Hiding the nasty parts in a whitewash of religious text</p>

              <p>so violent sia. killing people for this is indeed lame. what sort of religion is this when the priests told people to kill others. killing will always be wrong, religion or no religion. what kinda of a wacko priest was that?</p>

              <p>Note that i did not give a quote, however the books of deuteronomy and Leviticus seems to be rife with these teachings. Precisely because of the new testament, with the softer approach, do I feel that these two testaments seem inconsistent. In one testament god seems to be genocidal, racist, and among other things, but in the new testament jesus is portrayed as compassionate and kind. Due to these disparities, I find it hard to believe that the god in both are one and the same. Since Christianity recognises both, I request for everyone to show a degree of skepticism</p>

              <p>I welcome your skepticsm. Sometimes, different times need different approach. Its like how very visible big miracles doesnt seem to happen any more in a large scale, hundreds of thousands of people witness back in the old testament  daysn hardly any of such magnitude in the new testament.</p>
              <p>Its evolutionary, but u will notice that its for the better. As u notice we no longer sacrifice animals, the bridge between man n God in the old testament is broken, and Jesus's time brought about new understandings, teachings of love and the likes.</p>
              <p>So yeah, no doubt u feel skeptical.</p>

              <p>Yes, it is a view held by many scholars, thus the basis for the
                  distrust in the accuracy of the bible, and whether or not the
                  disciples were who they claimed they were. The writers of the 4
                  gospels, only 2 claimed to be disciples. Another point of
                  contention is the claim of the masscre of the infants by herod,
                  only mentioned in one gospel and mentioned no where else in any
                  historical text. Questionable? You may google these issues and find

              <p>Well, u gotta look at the context of it. If you got a satanic group trying desperately to convert you, hey, its you or them. Now its Thou Shalt not murder, doesnt mean u cant kill. And when i say kill, doesnt mean i justify killing. Alot of this kind of talk, we really have to understand the message the bible is trying to send us. It never said ..KILLING.. is O&gt;K. Go out there, KILL ALL WHO CONVERTS.  They may say God justified, but who are we to judge them in the end. All i know is i wont.

              <p>cos you are defending the atrocities of the old god from the old

              being up there (its existence is still debatable till now) will
              surely know killing is wrong. how can you justify killing esp for a
              lame reason like killing those who wants to convert you. imagine
              there is a  religion who sprang up and then its priests
              demanded its followers to justify killing those who wish to convert
              them, whatever the reasons. they may say their god justify the

              <p>exactly what I have been pointimg out. there seems to be 2
              different god. the earlier god was somewhat petty, always angry and

              <p>in movies and tv production, this is called scripting by the
              scriptor. the stories plots and sub plots, heroes and villians were
              written by the scriptor. so the old and new testament were also
