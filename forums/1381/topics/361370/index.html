              <p><br> It would be best if you write the whole passage then ask for discussion on that specific verse. Anyway I read from verse 1 to 6 and here's what I think.<br><br> I dissect this to two points:<br><br> Jesus: "I am THE WAY and THE TRUTH and THE LIFE"<br><br> Jesus: "NO ONE comes to the Father EXCEPT through Me"<br><br> Jesus: "I am THE WAY and THE TRUTH and THE LIFE"
                          Jesus said He is the way, the truth and the life.
                          To me Jesus was emphasizing that whoever choose to live(THE LIFE) that is to live in eternity should believe and follow Him in His teaching thus He said it that He is the way and the truth. Jesus was saying BELIEVE IN ME, FOLLOW MY TEACHING and YOU SHALL HAVE LIFE. Worthy of another note is that Jesus didn't say that He was merely way, truth and life but He was saying that He is THE WAY, THE TRUTH and THE LIFE. This is emphasizing that Jesus is the ONLY way, the HIGHEST or SUPREME truth [to that way/to life] and that He was offering the HIGHEST life.<br><br> Jesus: "NO ONE comes to the Father EXCEPT through Me"
                          Thus the second point wraps it up, backing the first point by saying that "No one comes to the Father except through Me". So we can be assured that No one that is no one can really know God and have a true relationship with God, the father except through putting faith in Jesus and following Jesus teaching because Jesus is the ONLY way, the SUPREME truth to life everlasting(life with God, the highest life or the best of life).<br><br> In other words Jesus was saying by speaking those words that <strong>"He[Jesus] is the only way, the supreme truth to the highest life"</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I other words:</p>
              <p>Follow my teaching(My way),</p>
              <p>believe in Me(as I am the Truth, believe in what I've said and promised)</p>
              <p>and you will have the best of life(The life)</p>

              <p>I have but not to you, at least those people are left wondering if they still refused to believe in God: I didn't know man could do that, or in cases when they do believe in God they would see supernatural.But I can't do anything that's why to you I can only give my testimony. Anyway God rocks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you want proof seek God yourself like a thirsty man wanting to find water. Nobody owns God afterall. God pitied me even though I'm a sinner, in no way perfect or worthy even today so I don't see why He wouldn't pity anybody else.</p>

              <p>Hey Andrew, hi again... =)</p>
              <p>I wonder if red is your preferred color, cos it really cause a wrong impression (to me) that you're out for blood. (Haha, we know it's not true)</p>
              <p>But seriously, like wat M&amp;P says, you may want to seek God through the bible... Just let me have a chance to share the faith with you... I guess if at the end of the day you still do not agree, at least both of us get to know a friend... =)</p>
              <p>The Bible says: "You will seek Me and Find Me when you seek Me with all your heart." (Jeremiah 29:13)</p>
              <p>You might never know what you'll discover, right?</p>
              <p>By the way guys/gals, my church having a "Citadel" games event at The Central, Clarke Quay (NVPC) on Wednesday (27/06) at 7.30pm. Interested please PM me... =)</p>

              <p>You know most Christians do not know that in the end it boils down to power.</p>
              <p>Men of all ages have been trying to gain power out of their own strength and for a time or two they succeeded  . . . . until death came to them and then they became nothing.</p>
              <p>Satan too is basically trying to gain power to replace the authority of God. And according to the bible in the end of time It would seem to be successful through the antichrist but the antichrist is too only a human and that means his power would only last his life time.</p>
              <p>But do you know what God offers to those that He elects?</p>
              <p>POWER. I'm talking authority, the power to rule and not just some power but a wholesome of power like never known before. And God gives it and will give it to those He elects for FREE and for ETERNITY. In the end it boils down to power. And in the end God's people will prevail.</p>
              <p>If you think the world is not enough for you, you should seek God and I hope the very best[literally] for you in the end.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't think I'm up to it, I have too many weaknesses and a short memory but if God were to show that power again from day to day I probably could.....lol you know like a positive reinforcement for ...pet. I believe it's meant for the holy and true saints. The chosen people of God. Damn very lucky people indeed. How much I envy them. Kings of this world would gladly throw their worldy power just to get less than half of what these people would receive for eternity IF ONLY they KNEW. God is the repayer of holiness indeed.</p>

              <p>I feel that this verse is one of the hardest lines for christians to defend.</p>
              <p>1.  We are all enabled with choice.  god has given us the human right to choose.  but if you were given a choice between eternal hellfire and brimstone versus eternal cavorting with the angels, what kind of a choice is this?  It's like one of those insurance agents coming up to you and asking you whether you want to make money.  Of course everyone wants to make some money!  so OF COURSE he is the way, truth, life, blah blah because if not him, then to hell with you (literally)!</p>
              <p>2.  Why jesus?  why particularly him?  because a book of fiction says that he is the son of god?  first of all, prove that the bible itself is not a volume of inconsistencies and hypocrisy.  secondly, if i go straight to god by circumventing jesus, will i still go to hell? because i dont necessarily need a middle man in order to clear my path to heaven, if it exists at all.  why does god need an agent in this way?</p>
              <p>3.  hero worship.  it's my way or the highway.  i respect your opinion and beliefs, in fact, I welcome criticism and open debate about religion and beliefs.  but i'm going to give you a lifetime of soldiers in my army to tell you about me and invite you to their churches.  If during your lifetime if you dont accept me as the one and only method to achieve eternal life, then you've missed your chance, so burn in hell.  BUT I STILL LOVE YOU!</p>
