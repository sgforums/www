            <div class='col-md body'>firstly, im not an anti-christ. i do believe in the bible n stuff. (to some extent). i was grown in a christian primary school. i sang all those songs every mornin for like 6 years in primary school. i did believe, i did pray till recently. i have attended church. first few times, i enjoyed it. after sometime, i found something really "wrong" about the place. as though i dun belong there. so i stopped going. after a few times, i went back on several occasions and stopped and went again...but i still felt something wrong..<br><br>and some background info. my parents juz recently became christians. my mum was lik antichrist sometime bac, and very "freethinker". so now, suddenly they r like possessed ppeople. they never fail to go church. everything that is related to church, they will join. for example, my mum juz joined the choir, and they keep going for those care group or whatever group they call it. and they r soooo obssessed to the extent that they even go for bible class n stuff...WHAT is this?????<br><br>they start talkin weirdly, like "we're only worried about your salvation??". let me first state wad annoys me the most. it is when christian talks as though their religion is the NUMBER 1 or smth. like it's the truth, it's the definite. im sure mani of the nonbelievers get annoyed by their behaviour. out of their normal conversation, they will pop a "god" in once in awhile. even muslims or pple of other religion dun realli mention their god out loud. they just quietly worship their god. for buddist or whatever, you dun know until they say. but if someone starts god here god there, u obviously know his a christian...<br><br>and one thing, christians have this arrogant aura. they pretend to be humble. they talk in another tone to nonbelievers, and worst, they try to convert everyone they see. they r lik tryin to build an army of pple. or to promote their church or smth. very very weird, and of cox, very annoying...<br><br>of cox, im not talking about every christian out there. basically i know alot christians. my entire family and their frens r christians. even my brother has been infected. all of them started to give me that "go away you outcast"-look. or "either u believe or go away..". they feel as though nonchristians r inferior or something.<br><br>when i first went to church. pple were very friendly. infact over friendly. they r those kind that take e initiative n stuff to talk to u. it was quite fun, n i dun deny that they r quite alot chiobus around. and sometimes i go on sunday juz to for this reason. i min it's sunday and everyone just dolls themselves up and go there to "worship"...., how mani pple r realli serious about worshipping god?<br><br>now, i juz give an excuse like. " ughh, im lazy to wake up on sunday morning". the truth is, i believe, but i dun wan to be a christian...</div>

It is the only truth the only way and life. The bible has clearly stated this(you can ask me to quote the passage<strong>s </strong>if you need)<br><br>Also, Jeses commaned us to preech the gospel to ppl of the world which is y they try to 'advise' you to believe in christ.<br><br>You said that ur parents r infected. They were a very free thinker and now become a christian. This should show you how true our religion is that it can lead your parents to believe than make you think that the religion is weird.<br><br>Christians love you which is y they try to preech th gospel to you. You may feel irritated or annoyed but they want you to be saved thats y they like that. If it was me i woulnt even care whether you die in hell and get burnt eternally or not cos i dont care for u<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unfortunately, you don't dislike Christianity.<br><br>You merely dislike what you <strong>think</strong> is Christianity.<br><br>Like for example, like my friend who once commented to me that Christians convert because they 'want to build a powerful church', to me that is bullshit. Christians preach because they believe it is the truth. I can even accept Buddhist and Muslim evangelists if they believe it is the truth. In fact, they HAVE TO PREACH if it is the truth. And if truth offends you, that is because truth is intolerant of untruth. I cannot stand the way most people think nowadays, that each religion must have a share in the market of ideas. Perhaps we live in an egalitarian society, but it makes no sense to adopt that attitude regarding truth.<br><br>And instead of dismissing what your parents said, really, I urge you to think of your salvation.</div>

No one comes to the Father (the only end) except him alone (the only means).<br><br>I'm sorry if any Christians forced the gospel on anyone. They should have preached in love. However, according to Jesus, he did not come to condemn, but to save (which you reject), but whoever does not believe is already condemned. Are you trying to portray Jesus as a lovey dovey personality? He is not. He is a just ruler just as he is a loving God.</div>
