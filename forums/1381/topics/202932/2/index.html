(to some extent). i was grown in a christian primary school. i sang all those songs every mornin for like 6 years in primary school. i did believe, i did pray till recently. i have attended church. first few times, i enjoyed it. after sometime, i found something really "wrong" about the place. as though i dun belong there. so i stopped going. after a few times, i went back on several occasions and stopped and went again...but i still felt something wrong..<br><br>and some background info. my parents juz recently became christians. my mum was lik antichrist sometime bac, and very "freethinker". so now, suddenly they r like possessed ppeople. they never fail to go church. everything that is related to church, they will join. for example, my mum juz joined the choir, and they keep going for those care group or whatever group they call it. and they r soooo obssessed to the extent that they even go for bible class n stuff...WHAT is this?????<br><br>they start talkin weirdly, like "we're only worried about your salvation??". let me first state wad annoys me the most. it is when christian talks as though their religion is the NUMBER 1 or smth. like it's the truth, it's the definite. im sure mani of the nonbelievers get annoyed by their behaviour. out of their normal conversation, they will pop a "god" in once in awhile. even muslims or pple of other religion dun realli mention their god out loud. they just quietly worship their god. for buddist or whatever, you dun know until they say. but if someone starts god here god there, u obviously know his a christian...<br><br>and one thing, christians have this arrogant aura. they pretend to be humble. they talk in another tone to nonbelievers, and worst, they try to convert everyone they see. they r lik tryin to build an army of pple. or to promote their church or smth. very very weird, and of cox, very annoying...<br><br>of cox, im not talking about every christian out there. basically i know alot christians. my entire family and their frens r christians. even my brother has been infected. all of them started to give me that "go away you outcast"-look. or "either u believe or go away..". they feel as though nonchristians r inferior or something.<br><br>when i first went to church. pple were very friendly. infact over friendly. they r those kind that take e initiative n stuff to talk to u. it was quite fun, n i dun deny that they r quite alot chiobus around. and sometimes i go on sunday juz to for this reason. i min it's sunday and everyone just dolls themselves up and go there to "worship"...., how mani pple r realli serious about worshipping god?<br><br>now, i juz give an excuse like. " ughh, im lazy to wake up on sunday morning". the truth is, i believe, but i dun wan to be a christian...</div></blockquote>are you talking about city harvest?<br>Their zeal turns me off. I was a member 8 years odd there, decided to stop going cos of the people. But i get where you're coming from, i am a christian too and there was this guy in my class in sec 4 he kept ranting on and on about it, like almost every conversation for a year. So you can imagine how it got on my nerves, i mean sure they have good intentions, but i guess there's a good lot out of christians out there that need refinement in techinique of spreading the word, so it makes the concept more palatable<br><br>I guess the tread starter's referring to people like that? The one that wants to 'convert' people, where ironically, make them put off about accept christ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>all religion teaches everyone of us to be good.<br>think for urself and believe what is true.<br>try to look at different religion and see what is right and what is wrong and lastly compare about which religion road is the right way back to heaven.<br><br>i am a vegeterian because my religion teaches me to spare the lifes of those animals, they too feel the pain and emotions too THEY ARE LIVING THINGS !<br>My religon says that all the religon actually are all the same but only different LEADERS. Example a tree, the Tree is the heaven and those roots are those angels aka god that came down from heaven to teach the fellow humans.<br>angels, gods cant say alot of secrets from the heaven so human trys to interprete the message and tuas create a followers of the belief and the religion is born. you can pm if you want to know more.<br><br>i can try to lead you to the path but only you can do the walking.<br><br></div>

(to some extent). i was grown in a christian primary school. i sang all those songs every mornin for like 6 years in primary school. i did believe, i did pray till recently. i have attended church. first few times, i enjoyed it. after sometime, i found something really "wrong" about the place. as though i dun belong there. so i stopped going. after a few times, i went back on several occasions and stopped and went again...but i still felt something wrong..<br><br>and some background info. my parents juz recently became christians. my mum was lik antichrist sometime bac, and very "freethinker". so now, suddenly they r like possessed ppeople. they never fail to go church. everything that is related to church, they will join. for example, my mum juz joined the choir, and they keep going for those care group or whatever group they call it. and they r soooo obssessed to the extent that they even go for bible class n stuff...WHAT is this?????<br><br>they start talkin weirdly, like "we're only worried about your salvation??". let me first state wad annoys me the most. it is when christian talks as though their religion is the NUMBER 1 or smth. like it's the truth, it's the definite. im sure mani of the nonbelievers get annoyed by their behaviour. out of their normal conversation, they will pop a "god" in once in awhile. even muslims or pple of other religion dun realli mention their god out loud. they just quietly worship their god. for buddist or whatever, you dun know until they say. but if someone starts god here god there, u obviously know his a christian...<br><br>and one thing, christians have this arrogant aura. they pretend to be humble. they talk in another tone to nonbelievers, and worst, they try to convert everyone they see. they r lik tryin to build an army of pple. or to promote their church or smth. very very weird, and of cox, very annoying...<br><br>of cox, im not talking about every christian out there. basically i know alot christians. my entire family and their frens r christians. even my brother has been infected. all of them started to give me that "go away you outcast"-look. or "either u believe or go away..". they feel as though nonchristians r inferior or something.<br><br>when i first went to church. pple were very friendly. infact over friendly. they r those kind that take e initiative n stuff to talk to u. it was quite fun, n i dun deny that they r quite alot chiobus around. and sometimes i go on sunday juz to for this reason. i min it's sunday and everyone just dolls themselves up and go there to "worship"...., how mani pple r realli serious about worshipping god?<br><br>now, i juz give an excuse like. " ughh, im lazy to wake up on sunday morning". the truth is, i believe, but i dun wan to be a christian...</div></blockquote>its ok to be annoyed with christians for all christians are not perfect. Just dont be bitter about it in the longer term and also bitter with God about it.....we cannot get close to God in our anger and bitterness.<br><br>sometimes, we keep on wanting to judge unto what others are not doing - because we only see what they are doing. Strange. We proclaim that our Creator is Almighty, we say we believe, yet we cannot seem to surrender our everything to His Power and His Love but keep some, for our own pleasurable judgements.<br><br></div>
