(to some extent). i was grown in a christian primary school. i sang all those songs every mornin for like 6 years in primary school. i did believe, i did pray till recently. i have attended church. first few times, i enjoyed it. after sometime, i found something really "wrong" about the place. as though i dun belong there. so i stopped going. after a few times, i went back on several occasions and stopped and went again...but i still felt something wrong..<br><br>and some background info. my parents juz recently became christians. my mum was lik antichrist sometime bac, and very "freethinker". so now, suddenly they r like possessed ppeople. they never fail to go church. everything that is related to church, they will join. for example, my mum juz joined the choir, and they keep going for those care group or whatever group they call it. and they r soooo obssessed to the extent that they even go for bible class n stuff...WHAT is this?????<br><br>they start talkin weirdly, like "we're only worried about your salvation??". let me first state wad annoys me the most. it is when christian talks as though their religion is the NUMBER 1 or smth. like it's the truth, it's the definite. im sure mani of the nonbelievers get annoyed by their behaviour. out of their normal conversation, they will pop a "god" in once in awhile. even muslims or pple of other religion dun realli mention their god out loud. they just quietly worship their god. for buddist or whatever, you dun know until they say. but if someone starts god here god there, u obviously know his a christian...<br><br>and one thing, christians have this arrogant aura. they pretend to be humble. they talk in another tone to nonbelievers, and worst, they try to convert everyone they see. they r lik tryin to build an army of pple. or to promote their church or smth. very very weird, and of cox, very annoying...<br><br>of cox, im not talking about every christian out there. basically i know alot christians. my entire family and their frens r christians. even my brother has been infected. all of them started to give me that "go away you outcast"-look. or "either u believe or go away..". they feel as though nonchristians r inferior or something.<br><br>when i first went to church. pple were very friendly. infact over friendly. they r those kind that take e initiative n stuff to talk to u. it was quite fun, n i dun deny that they r quite alot chiobus around. and sometimes i go on sunday juz to for this reason. i min it's sunday and everyone just dolls themselves up and go there to "worship"...., how mani pple r realli serious about worshipping god?<br><br>now, i juz give an excuse like. " ughh, im lazy to wake up on sunday morning". the truth is, i believe, but i dun wan to be a christian...</div></blockquote>I think many Christians believe that God is employing a Multi-level Marketing System up there in the heavens.<br>"For each person you convert, you get "x" no. of credits"<br>"For each person that you converted, and he converts someone else, you get commission... urm.. sorry... I meant "x" no. of referral credits"<br>"For each level of heaven you wish to reach, you must have a total no. of credits before you can apply"<br>"the rest? go to hell"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Hmm... then why are we so pissed off with Multi-level Marketing in the human world?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Being pushy is one thing.. It pisses me off when I hear christians condemning other religions as devils worship, and their worshippers bound for 1 way trip to hell...<br><br>Think you guys are extremely "heng" to tio a ticket to heaven? Come on loh, it's only pure faith. Care to prove to me when you reach heaven? Call it humanistic perception or I'm too blinded to see the "truth"... Presently. you people are making life miserable for others and maybe even yourselves... &amp; you want to talk about life after death?<br><br>So much for peace and religious harmony, when you people don't even understand the basis of mutual respect...
