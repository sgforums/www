            <div class='col-md body'>I seldom post replies, but this topic so happen to bite me. Let me say this first: i am not an anti- christ. What happened is that, sometime back, a friend of mine (guy) fell for this girl, who happen to be a non- christian. But she not anti- christ... she infact, encouraged him to continue his faith, go cell group, get involved with the church activities... they were actually doing fine, until guy decided to tell his brothers after cell group. His so-called brothers, would have almost wacked him, they were yelling at him, saying all kinds of stuff: "i am so disappointed in you", "she is not meant to be", "you have changed"... No one in his cell group were happy for him, happy that he found love after being single for so many years. Then the brothers decided to tell their pastor about it, then that very night, he received messages from his churchmates, saying things like "if she's not a christian, then is not wat God has meant for you, meaning, this relationship will not work out". They were telling him to just give it up, dump the girl.<br><br>My point is, what ever religion it is, i though we were supposed to be sharing this "love", "care", etc.... so that you can probably impress people well enough to be interested in your religion? How can u spread the teachings by drawing lines, boundaries and controlling your heart?<br><br>One of the explanation my christian friend gave was that, you must find someone of the same faith, so you will not sway or drift further from God, so that it is "meant" to be. but if your faith is firm enough, why worry? I have seen how a non- christian was converted into a christian becoz his wife had been patient and prayful.<br><br>guy dumped girl, coz cannot take the stress, girl upset, but can understand, but girl has totally changed her perception of christians.... is that what and how it should be? Instead of using this opportunity to let someone get to know this religion better, she was being pushed away. Talking about salvation....<br><br>Then, some of the die hard christians, have anti- christ parents at home, dun dare to tell parents that they are christians, so choose to lie, deceit... sometimes even deny. So what happened to the Filia Piety part? the explanation i got is that: you can't choose your parents. Ya, i get that, but u chose to lie, to deceit... that is just as wrong.<br><br>someone pls change my perception too, coz being taught in a missionary school for 11years, i am honestly very disappointed in how the message is being spread nowadays....</div>

Its a very wrong approach. I'm sorry your friend had to go through that.<br>Yeah they're christians out there like that,  many however, aren't like that, maybe you would advice your friend to go to another church if he hasn't already.<br>But for now, just bear in mind that many christians are in a world of their own, blinded by their own ignorance, and trying to impose their wills on others, which ironically puts them off.</div>
