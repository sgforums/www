            <div class='col-md body'>Marriage is a sacred institution in the eyes of the Catholic Church, hence your dilema. What you should do is confess to all your sins and carry on praying for your redemption regardless whether you remarry or not. God is all merciful, pray that our Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit will help you reunite with God in your sufferings and sins, and pray for the intercession of our most holy Mother.<br><br>Pray for redemption always, and the inner peace of knowing you have it.<br><br>Good luck and All the Best,<br>SupaFatty</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't know the grounds for divorce in your case. In the Catholic church, you cannot divorce, but you can have an annulment of marriage if it can be shown that your marriage was not proper in the first place. Eg. if your wife is related to you or already married/divorced at the time and you didn't know...ok, sounds  far-fetched.<br><br>The other way out is to wait until your wife leaves you and takes up with another man. The church (Catholic or Protestant) does not recognize legal divorce as a termination of the marriage bond:<br><br>He (Jesus) answered, "Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her. [Mark 10:11]<br><br>However, if she commits adultery first, some churches will allow divorce based on this teaching:<br><br>I (Jesus) tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, and marries another woman commits adultery.

But the marriage was perfectly kosher....at the time Henry married Catherine, she was single and of course the annulment was denied.<br><br>Actually Henry VIII probably would have been better off with Catherine than his other 5 wives. Only 'fault' of Catherine was that she could not give him a son, only two daughters. However, Henry's retribution came when after 6 wives (two of whom he beheaded) and a break from the Catholic church, he still had no male heir and his daughters ascended to the throne one after the other...as Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth I.</div>

Oxford mushroom, i think u should study the history of the new testament carefully b4 stating these.<br><br>i suggest the thread starter be clear of where he stands as a christian. Ultimately, christianity is not a religion, its a relationship with God.<br><br>Divorcing whether on any grounds, is still a divorce. but think about the consequence of divorce. is it gonna make things better? is it gonna benefit both of you? is it gonna help u stand straight and confident before God?<br><br>Also, i tink Churches that ask its member to leave because of sin, is a church you should flee from. Rather den solving a problem, they wanted a problem-free church. den what is the church for? no church is perfect, and yet no man is perfect either. church come in place to help, not to escape.<br><br>Best way is to look for a church pastor, if not, a marriage counsellor in church.

            <div class='col-md body'>the main thing here my brother is if you believe that Jesus died to save you from your sins and that you have confessed and believe you are saved... we are no longer in a time of law, we are under grace...  there is no where in the bible that says that you won't be saved... adultery is a sin, but Jesus died to save you from your sins... Jesus is offering you GRACE so while adultery is a sin, it is not the unpardonable sin... and if Jesus says you are regarded as righteous you are... point... King David, remember his story, he committed murder and adultery and what did God say about him? God called him a man after my own heart... the key here is always repentance... God is gracious and willing to forgive and accept that forgiveness my brother and don't let satan lie to you any longer... Christians today are so eager to judge people who go through divorce and are very legalistic and have a holier than thou attitude, what ever happened to grace? Unless these other people have gone through a divorce, who then can say? Do not judge someone unless you have walked in his shoes.. and what did Jesus do with the woman who was caught in adultery when the people wanted to stone her? He said let him who has no sin cast the first stone.... we are all sinners and to God there is no big sin or small sin, sin is sin so guess what unless we rely on Christ as our sanctification, we are not clean at all... only Jesus make us sinless because He took our sins upon himself...</div>

Jesus is offering you GRACE so while adultery is a sin, it is not the unpardonable sin... and if Jesus says you are regarded as righteous you are... point... King David, remember his story, he committed murder and adultery and what did God say about him? God called him a man after my own heart... the key here is always repentance... God is gracious and willing to forgive and accept that forgiveness my brother and don't let satan lie to you any longer... Christians today are so eager to judge people who go through divorce and are very legalistic and have a holier than thou attitude, what ever happened to grace? Unless these other people have gone through a divorce, who then can say? Do not judge someone unless you have walked in his shoes.. and what did Jesus do with the woman who was caught in adultery when the people wanted to stone her? He said let him who has no sin cast the first stone.... we are all sinners and to God there is no big sin or small sin, sin is sin so guess what unless we rely on Christ as our sanctification, we are not clean at all... only Jesus make us sinless because He took our sins upon himself...</div></blockquote>moral of the story commit all the sins you like just embrace jesus before you face reckoning  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>*hides to get away from flames*</div>
