              <p>Hello all Brothers and Sisters in Christ!<br><br>WE NEED TO PRAY. Can you sense it? A revival will soon break out in Singapore. Form groups to pray for others, for a revival. Meet up daily, nightly, weekly, monthly, to PRAY! Get more people to turn away fully from vain, worldly pursuits and join in prayer, for GOD says in 2 Chr 7:14 that,<br><br>"if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land."<br><br>GOD works on earth through the prayers of His saints. He WILL ANSWER, as He has promised.<br><br>"And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it." (John 14:13-14)</p>
              <p>NEVER underestimate the power of Prayer<br><br>Every revival has start through a group of people in concerted, united and sustained Prayer.<br><br>-Welsh Revival in 1904<br>Seth Joshua had been praying for years that God would raise up a young man from the pits to revive the churches. That young man, Evan Roberts, soon had a spiritual experience, and a message that stirred the whole nation to embrace GOD. <br>Effects: Conservative estimates reported 150000 saved in the 1st 6 months. Wales again became a God-fearing nation. Bars became empty. Crimical offences grew so little that magistrates did not have to handle court cases and policemen went out of job. Men whose language were filthy before began to talk purely, so much so that the coal miners' ponies became disobedient(they were so used to being sworn at that they could not understand these 'new commands' by their riders.) People who owed money paid up, and enemies became friends again. Blessings were received and freely given everywhere.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.welshrevival.com/"><span style="color: #3b5998;">http://www.welshrevival.com/</span></a><br><br>1857 Prayer Revival in America<br>Jeremiah Lamphier felt led by God to start a noon-time weekly prayer meeting in which business people could meet for prayer, in New York. The first day, Lamphier prayed alone for half an hour. In 3 weeks, over a hundred prayer were praying not weekly, but DAILY, including many unsaved. Within one month, more prayer meetings began in other New Yok churches. The meetings abounded with love for Christ, love for fellow Christians, love for prayer, love of witnessing, and an awesome sense of God's presence. Newspapers begun to report on meetings. Similar meetings sprung up across America. Churches across Americans statesl;Boston, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Richmond, Charleston, Savannah, Mobile, New Orleans, Vicksburg, Memphis, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Philadelphia, were so filled they had to turn down people half an hr before the meeting began. In the six years which followed, the rest of America was filled with GOD's Presence so strongly that many, many ships reaching its coastline reported revivals onboard. Fraternal delegates from Ireland came to witness this awakening, and when they went back to give report, revival broke out in Ireland and the British Isles. In America, 6.6% of the population were saved in 7 years!!<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.truthkeepers.com/prayer1.htm"><span style="color: #3b5998;">http://www.truthkeepers.com/prayer1.htm</span></a></p>

              <p>in a way, that's a good thing !</p>
              <p>it shows that people are very committed to their religions..................</p>
              <p>if only they were as committed to investigating whether their religion makes sense or not in the 1st place..........</p>
              <p>1) blindly following what they've been taught in thier childhood is a big mistake.</p>
              <p>2) following a religion becoz it promises its followers a ''free ride to paradise'' also a big mistake..............</p>
              <p>3) following a religion becoz it's perceived to be the ''coolest'' or ''modern'' one out there is a huge mistake.......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>once these people look closely into the reasons why they believe in Christianity in the1st place, they'll realize it's becoz of 1 or more of the above stated reasons............</p>
