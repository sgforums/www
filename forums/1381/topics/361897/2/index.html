              <p>There's a difference between temptations and sin...</p>
              <p>Let's suppose here that we all agree that cheating is sin. So let's say you're playing a game and someone in your team urge you to cheat so that you can win. That someone is tempting you. If you go along with the suggestion to cheat, then it is sin. But if you choose to hold back and play the game by the rules, then you've resisted temptation and therefore have not sin.</p>
              <p>So in the same way, Jesus was tempted, but He resisted those temptations and did not sin.</p>

              <p><br>Actually it's simpler.</p>
              <p>Bisexual organisms can multiply itself faster than asexual ones. Most likely due to compartmentalising the reproductive process.</p>
              <p>Rather than that of the human's idea of intelligent design, the bisexual organisms simply outbred the asexual ones and given its larger numbers/possibilities has a better chance of evolving over the asexual ones.  </p>
              <p>Maybe 50,000 years ago, there might have been a strain of humans that was smarter in every way, devoid of the need for excessive material needs and physical lusts.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, they would be outbred and wiped out by the strain that is extremely violent, with a love for indulging in rape and murder . Dependant on the high from particpating in violent and dangerous endavours.   </p>

              <p>That applies ONLY to men like us.....whereas God should be free from temptations right? Someone is tempting you is not the same as you are tempted. to have temptations means you have such thoughts to sin. Which means you have a choice to make, to do good or bad. So are we implying God have these thoughts in Him? That He have choices to make between good and bad? If so, then i think we are mocking God coz like i said, God is free from temptations, thus free from such thoughts. </p>
              <p>If we are free from such thoughts, if someone tempt us, we will dismiss it immeditely without thinking of going the bad route. If we think of going the bad route means we are having temptations. Thus ths implies Jesus have such thoughts, but he eventually choose the right path.</p>

              <p>New Testament? there is a difference between the Testaments? God changes his words and inpsire the writer of the New Testament? Or man changes the writing to suits him? So u telling me the Old Testament is not reliable? Don't you find all these different versions of the Bible with different accounts of same events puzzling? If a man go to court and tells 2 diff versions of the same story, he is deemed unreliable. Can we apply this to the Bible?</p>
              <p>Out of curiousity, what does the New Testament say of this event?</p>

              <p>if you know the story of lucifer, you will know that lucifer's wants the throne of God. he wants to be God. so it is not surprising that the devil would tempt Jesus who was in his weak state ( in man's form) that's how the devil sees God. he sees himself higher than God.</p>
              <p>you are correct that God is free from temptation. Jesus is God and he is also Man. Fully divine and fully man. Jesus has two natures. so being sinless but still was temptde in his human nature.</p>

              <p>if you know the story of lucifer, you will know that lucifer's
              wants the throne of God. he wants to be God. so it is not
              surprising that the devil would tempt Jesus who was in his weak
              state ( in man's form) that's how the devil sees God. he sees
              himself higher than God.</p>
              <p>you are correct that God is free from temptation. Jesus is God
              and he is also Man. Fully divine and fully man. Jesus has two
              natures. so being sinless but still was temptde in his human
              nature.</p>

              <p>Jesus is a man and God..i dont get that? So there is another God when Jesus is doing his part as man? So there are 2 Gods?</p>
              <p>Lucifer wants the throne of God? So he saw an opportunity to overtake God when God is man? Can we actually believe God will put himself into a state of weakness so that the Devil can try to do that? God created the Devil, not to tempt himself but to tempt man.</p>

              <p>we believe in the Trinity. the Father, the Son (Jesus), and the Holy Spirit. all 3 forms are fully God but they are one. There is ONLY 1 God. our knowledge is limited as human it is beyond our comprehension. just like a sun, it's heat and light are 1 but in 3 different forms.</p>
              <p>Jesus said: "I and the Father are one." (John 10:30)</p>
              <p>"He who has seen Me has seen the Father." (John 14:9)</p>
              <p>If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him. (Rom. 8:9)</p>
              <p>and no God did NOT create the devil. God created Lucifer, an angel of God. he brought a third of angels together with him to rebellion against God and thus all of them were cast down on earth.</p>

              <p>Dear All,</p>
              <p>As posted in another topic, I admit, my intention here is to discuss but it seems like this
                                      have turned to into an endless and pointless 'flaming' topic.</p>
              <p>Let me say this for one last time here. We are one; in our path
                                      towards God and Heaven. We come from the same origins. As we are
                                      all brothers and sisters, i have nothing but love to all those
                                      sincere God-fearing Christianss</p>
              <p>My sincerest apologies to everybody to whom i have offended.</p>
              <p>For that, i have decided to leave before I say something i
                                      should not say and aggravate the situation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>P.S : xalkyrie</strong>, <strong>Herzog_Zwei, Stevenson101, </strong>thanks for the company guys...Great that we can have healthy non-confrontational discussions...i hope i have not offended any of you guys.</p>
