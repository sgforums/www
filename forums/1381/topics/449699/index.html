              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>In a reverse lawsuit filed by debt-collection company Redemption Strategies last year, the Kopers have been accused of forging documents to obtain items such as several vehicles, jewelry, a boat, motorcycle, and life insurance. </span><span>The debt collection company was registered with the state by a TBN attorney one day before it filed suit against Mr Koper.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>They accuse Mr McVeigh of also receiving thousands of dollars from the non-profit without their authorization.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>That lawsuit against Mr McVeigh and Mr Koper was later dropped by the court, but not before Mrs Koper and two in-laws were added as defendants.</span><span><br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>Mrs Koper countersued, alleging that TBN's attorneys formed Redemption Strategies to retaliate against her for whistleblowing.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>Her suit doesn't list TBN as a defendant, but it alleges that Mrs Koper was fired and made to turn over her house, condominium, life insurance policy, car, furniture and jewelry as 'an act of Christian contrition' when she complained about the financial misdeeds at TBN.</span><span><br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>In the similar suit filed by Mr McVeigh, he alleges that TBN attorneys also targeted him as part of a campaign of retaliation for his reporting of their lavish spending.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>TBN attorney Colby May called the McVeigh's lawsuit a 'tabloid filing' and said the allegations in both cases were 'utterly and completely contrived.' TBN suspects McVeigh, who claims he received a $65,000 loan from the family empire, was working with the Kopers to steal money from the ministry, Mr May said.</span> <img class="blkBorder" style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 1px initial initial;" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/03/23/article-2119493-124E4C9A000005DC-822_634x419.jpg" alt="Attacks: The family feud could draw further scrutiny of TBN after its previous trouble with allegations of a homosexual encounter by Mr Crouch and a five-year battle with the FCC" width="634" height="419"></p>

              </div>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>The network's spending is in line with its mission to spread the gospel throughout the world, Mr May said, and the Crouches travel by private jet because they have had 'scores of death threats, more than the president of the United States.'</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>The ministry keeps large amounts of cash in reserve because incurring debt goes against the Biblical exhortation to 'owe no man any thing,' he said.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>'The answer is, there is no fire there,' Mr May said. 'They pay as they go and every now and then one of the things that they pay as they go on is the acquisition of a broadcast facility and that's a multi-million dollar transaction.'</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>The outbreak of legal skirmish offers a rare window into the secretive world of the sprawling religious non-profit and exposes a family feud that could draw more outside scrutiny of TBN. Attorneys from both sides say they have contacted police and the Internal Revenue Service.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>The Crouches founded TBN in 1973 and grew it into an international Christian empire that beams prosperity gospel programming — which promises that if the faithful sacrifice for their belief, God will reward them with material wealth — to every continent but Antarctica 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</span></p>

              </div>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>The lawsuit attention comes at a bad time for TBN, which has seen viewer donations drop steeply. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>TBN raked in $92 million in donations in 2010 and cleared $175 million in tax-free revenue, but its net income plummeted from nearly $60 million in 2006 to a loss of $18 million in 2010, the most recent year available. Donations fell by nearly $30 million in the same period — a hit the network blames on the bad economy.<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>At the same time, Mrs Koper's father — the eldest Crouch son — resigned abruptly as vice president and chief-of-staff late last year. The unexplained departure of Paul Crouch Jr. roughly coincided with his daughter's legal battle and came just months after he launched iTBN, a project to expand the network's online and mobile reach.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>TBN places a premium on privacy and it's almost impossible to divine what is going on behind the scenes. Yet televangelist empires built largely on charisma often encounter choppy waters as their founding personalities age.</span></p>
              <div class="artSplitter" style="min-height: 1px;"><img class="blkBorder" style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 1px initial initial;" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/03/23/article-2119493-124E4835000005DC-884_634x699.jpg" alt="Needs: The attorney for Mrs Crouch, seen shielded by security in New York, said the Crouches travel by private jet because they have had scores of death threats, more than the president of the United States" width="634" height="699">

              </div>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>'It's true that in these large ministries, they do become family enterprises ... and in many ways that can be a most precarious problem for them,' said David E. Harrell, a professor emeritus of American religion at Auburn University, who has written about well-known televangelists. 'Business squabbles, if they're complicated with family squabbles, can get nasty indeed.'</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>Mr May dismissed the idea of family turmoil and said the reason behind the legal fight was simple: Mrs Koper and her husband stole from the network.<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>'They're attempting to create a diversion and to create as much public spectacle as they can in the vain hope that this will all get resolved and that's simply not going to happen,' he said.<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>TBN's reach and programming are expansive, but what is more impressive is the amount of money it receives from viewers — even in a downturn.</span></p>
              <div class="artSplitter" style="min-height: 1px;"><img class="blkBorder" style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 1px initial initial;" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/03/23/article-2119493-124E3B07000005DC-781_634x435.jpg" alt="Sex scandals: The suit also accuses the network, whose headquarters is pictured from the roadside, of using funds to cover up additional sex scandals according to the Los Angeles Times' review of the suit" width="634" height="435">

              </div>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>During TBN's Praise-A-Thon earlier this month, a preacher exhorted viewers to bellow 'Fear not!' three times, count down from 10 and then rush to the phone with donations. In exchange, he said, they would receive a miracle from God 'about this time tomorrow.' Within seconds, all 200 phone lines were busy.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>Ministry watchdogs have long questioned how TBN — which declared more than $800 million in net assets in 2010 — spends that wealth.<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>TBN files reports with the IRS, but the Crouches run nearly two dozen other organizations that are harder to track and they operate extensively overseas, said Rusty Leonard, who founded Wall Watchers, an organization that monitors the financial transparency of church ministries to which its members donate.<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: 1px;"><span>Wall Watchers gives TBN an 'F' for financial transparency and keeps them on its list of the 30 worst ministries.</span></p>
