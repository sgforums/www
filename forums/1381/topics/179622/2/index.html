John is a very common name also in Jesus' time. Jehohanan in Jewish language. I forgot the translation. Very common name in the streets. That's why a fisherman son called John the son of Zebedee. An ah beng.<br><br>But maybe not so common in the priestly family of Zechariah. That's why his relatives(prob well to do) refused to name his son John until the angel loosed his tongue &amp; Zechariah spoke giving the prophecy abt his son's name &amp; destiny to prepare the way of the Lord.</div>
