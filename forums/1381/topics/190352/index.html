Jesus can be married, the Bible can be compiled by humans, the Church can be evil, but God still loves you! Notice how in all the prayers very seldom or never was Jesus ever mentioned?<br><br>It is about realizing we are all not perfect. The bishop certainly was not. But he repented with a contrite heart, same for Silas!<br><br><blockquote>Aringarosa looked at the briefcase filled with bonds and immediately looked away, feeling only shame. "Yes... thank you." He paused while working his fingers across the seam of his bedsheet, then continued. "Captain, I have been giving this deep thought, and I need to ask a favor of you."<br>"Of course."<br>"The families of those in Paris who Silas..." He paused, swallowing the emotion. "<strong>I<br>realize no sum could possibly serve as sufficient restitution</strong>, and yet, if you could be kind enough to divide the contents of this briefcase among them... the families of the deceased."<br>Fache's dark eyes studied him a long moment. "A virtuous gesture, My Lord. I will see to it your wishes are carried out."<br>A heavy silence fell between them.</blockquote>At least the bishop felt the shame. Forgiveness of sins is not about confessing your sins and full stop. It is about action also.</div>
