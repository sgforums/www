Trying hard to please the world, they have become so worldly that they have become salt that has lost its taste.<br><br>Christians should stand up for what they believe in. The teachings of Christ will arouse anger and opposition from the world. The Greek word for the church is to be  'called out' from the masses. If our teachings and beliefs are so pleasing to the world, there is no need to call us out from the world.<br><br>I say stick to the teachings in the Scriptures. As for the issue that was mentioned, ie. homosexuality...there is no question in my mind. The Bible condemns it and so Christianity does not condone it. Christians in positions of influence and authority (and there are quite a number in our society) must unite against any attempt to introduce an alternative gospel or a liberal version of christianity.</div></blockquote>ha. the bible? the bible is tainted by human influence and written by human hands. it is in no way a 100% accurate reflection of what God says, can't all of you see? Its not even 100% representative of what Christ said or taught. Instead it was used to cover up whatever the human leaders of the church didn't want the public to know or used to mislead the masses into thinking something else. Why don't you fools wake up?</div>

So are u very sure when u say nobody informs and prevents attacks from happening? For eg do u know, recently b4 the London attack, how many other attacks on London have been thwarted? if you can't answer this, then u really have no right to accuse the muslim community of NATO.</div>

Am I right to say, it is the duty of every Christian to spread the words of Christ?<br><br>Evangelism exist in Christianity, sorry to say, on a level not matched by any other faiths. Now I am not going to discuss value judgement on this, by saying its good or its bad. But sure as hell, or heaven if you like, its going to provoke some sort of reaction.<br><br>I dont think its seriously about non believers not believing the tales or teachings that are written in the bibles, i mean, you also wont believe in reincarnation or Kali right?<br><br>I think its because of the persistence, by massive number of Christians, that have provoked such reactions. You have to spread the word, some got pushy, the other side got annoyed, then they'll come in to question, you say its allright, u doing for god, the other side got more annoyed, because thats not a logical answer..the cycle goes on.<br><br>Seriously, my advice is, for the nth time, change oneself to influence others.
