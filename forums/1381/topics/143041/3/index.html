            <div class='col-md body'>And of course.. you do get to see far too many christians trying to hard-sell christianity, talk about theology beyond EH..<br><br>Just look at the Pope bash Homosexuals thread.. The majority of the last 100-150 posts are not related to topic..<br><br>Even within EH, the Christians are bad-mouthing the atheist, the Myanmar Buddhist monk..<br><br>Also, you need to define "bashing".. I haven't see Christians kanna mugged (other than 1st-2nd centuries), I haven't seen Christians kanna discriminated by law (except JH or maybe mormons, if you guys wanna classify them as Christian community).. If Christians are taking a more active and forceful approach to denounce other people's beliefs, and these other people defend against such on-slaught, I will not see it as bashing..</div>

Trying hard to please the world, they have become so worldly that they have become salt that has lost its taste.<br><br>Christians should stand up for what they believe in. The teachings of Christ will arouse anger and opposition from the world. The Greek word for the church is to be  'called out' from the masses. If our teachings and beliefs are so pleasing to the world, there is no need to call us out from the world.<br><br>I say stick to the teachings in the Scriptures. As for the issue that was mentioned, ie. homosexuality...there is no question in my mind. The Bible condemns it and so Christianity does not condone it. Christians in positions of influence and authority (and there are quite a number in our society) must unite against any attempt to introduce an alternative gospel or a liberal version of christianity.</div></blockquote>another way to look at it is: the present society that Christianity has found it's foundation has developed so much that religion and politics are divorced.. religion itself cannot address most of the societal problems.. however, a few centuries ago when religion is politics, the Christians are the aggressors.. Just look at the wars started in the name of Christians in the past..<br><br>For muslim countries (specifically the middle east) The religion and politics are still very much intertwined.. But then, these are the countries that were not as developed as the Europeans or US.<br><br>so your stand is "Traditional Christians" are never liberal.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>As for the issue about homosexuals.. It will be OOT if we talk about it here. Hence, will not debate against this point..</div>

However, it does not mean we have a free license to sin since we cannot keep all the laws. Rather, we follow becoz we love god, not out of fear.<br><br>no...i do not believe it is continuously revised...once god given it to us, like what I told SIS, it is eternally binding, just that we are no longer punished for the sins.<br><br>yes i agree it is a guideline given by god...not just any other guideline which u said full of mistakes and inaccuracies...<br><br>if u understand the message of grace, then everything in the bible will be clear to u....if u only understand the bible by morality/legalism, then everything will not make sense to u becoz u will think it is full of contradictions.</div>
