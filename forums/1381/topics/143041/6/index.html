Its pretty old, and within the hall there are some storerooms which u can only enter from the hall itself. I knew the storeman in charge of the sports store. Once i was supposed to go collect some stuff from him, but he wasn't around. I had a rec with me, both of us wanted to slack a bit, so instead of going back to e office, we decided to wait in his store, since he never locks the doors. The doors were the normal double doors with a door latch, which opened outwards. The hall itself is enclosed by steel shutters when its not used. That day when we were there, it was all closed up. We entered the hall by a small access door at the back of the hall.<br><br>We went in, and i stood beside some stores facing the center of the room, my guy was sittin on e table in the store facing the door. While we were talking, he suddenly shifted his eyes to look at something beside me. I turned and saw the door opening slowly and steadily outwards. Then as we were looking, it stopped, then slowly and steadily closed back. Just b4 it closed completely, it suddenly slammed shut with a loud bang. That spooked me and i got him out of the store immediately. There was no wind, since the whole hall is enclosed, and the door to the hall is within the hall itself. And i am doubly sure its not the wind because the door opened OUTWARDs 1st, since it can only open outwards, and the store itself is also enclosed.<br>You are not ugly.

NCC cadets can be both male or female, and personally having been an NCC cadet and been to that camp as part of my NCC course, I'm offering evidence that my having been in stagmont alone doesn't pinpoint my gender.<br><br>2nd one: in there i'm explaining that i have a diesease, and nowhere do i see that i say i am insulin dependent. indeed, just because i have that disease does not make me insulin dependent, and u only have your own ignorance of the disease to blame for making the assumption that everyone with this disease needs insulin.<br><br>so its your own ignorance and lack of logic that is misleading u, who are u to blame me for misleading u? perhaps u would do well to read up more n read less of those hairy potty books, which only serve to delude u into thinking u can hex people when u can't.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

Its pretty old, and within the hall there are some storerooms which u can only enter from the hall itself. I knew the storeman in charge of the sports store. Once i was supposed to go collect some stuff from him, but he wasn't around. I had a rec with me, both of us wanted to slack a bit, so instead of going back to e office, we decided to wait in his store, since he never locks the doors. The doors were the normal double doors with a door latch, which opened outwards. The hall itself is enclosed by steel shutters when its not used. That day when we were there, it was all closed up. We entered the hall by a small access door at the back of the hall.<br><br>We went in, and i stood beside some stores facing the center of the room, my guy was sittin on e table in the store facing the door. While we were talking, he suddenly shifted his eyes to look at something beside me. I turned and saw the door opening slowly and steadily outwards. Then as we were looking, it stopped, then slowly and steadily closed back. Just b4 it closed completely, it suddenly slammed shut with a loud bang. That spooked me and i got him out of the store immediately. There was no wind, since the whole hall is enclosed, and the door to the hall is within the hall itself. And i am doubly sure its not the wind because the door opened OUTWARDs 1st, since it can only open outwards, and the store itself is also enclosed.<br>You are not ugly.

Otherwise, in my view, the contents of that book is too tainted by humans to be considered holy. Perhaps u're the one who's blinding yourself to that fact. It does u no good to keep telling me that the laws given to us by god are perfect yada yada. I never contested that it wasn't, but I AM contesting whether the contents of the bible can safely be taken to be 100%, perfectly accurate, and whether we are in any danger of believeing and following any wrong ideas due to human tamperations with the contents of the bible in the past.</div></blockquote>i understand ur concerns.<br><br>As a Christian, my faith and my experiences tell me the book is indeed his word and his laws. I would guarantee it with my faith. If you do not believe the bible is the word of god, probably u still have not realise what Christ has done for u yet. He has come to fulfill those laws for u so that u can be free from the shackles of law.<br><br>For myself, I believe the bible is 100 percent perfectly accurate without any human addition. If I do not believe, then I should leave the faith and be a muslim/jew instead.<br><br>What is past is past. The law is a thing of the past. Now we have grace. Hallelujah!</div>
