God is indeed a perfect and good god who want the best for/from his children.<br><br>By receiving grace from god i say it is perfect, as Christ came not to abolish the laws, by to fulfill it for us.<br><br>it is still perfect, just that we now have his grace and god no longer punish us for sins.<br><br>i will pray for u. Hope u can pray urself also. Acknowledge the lord in all ways, and not lean on ur own understanding, and he will make ur path straight.<br><br></div></blockquote>you just don't understand do u? i never said his laws are imperfect. but HOW can u be so SURE that all the contents in that book ARE indeed his word and his laws, and that no human has ever altered the contents for their own human causes and interests? CAN u gurantee that for me? If u can gurantee it beyond doubt, with sufficient evidence, then I will accept it. Otherwise, in my view, the contents of that book is too tainted by humans to be considered holy. Perhaps u're the one who's blinding yourself to that fact. It does u no good to keep telling me that the laws given to us by god are perfect yada yada. I never contested that it wasn't, but I AM contesting whether the contents of the bible can safely be taken to be 100%, perfectly accurate, and whether we are in any danger of believeing and following any wrong ideas due to human tamperations with the contents of the bible in the past.</div>
