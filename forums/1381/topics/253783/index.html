Surely not because they have business or political genes in them (c.f. Jewish moneylenders, Henry Kissinger etc.). If you read history, Jews were marginalised people and subjected to persecution. (c.f. Spanish Inquisition, holocaust etc.) Special treatment? Yeah right ..<br><br>They are special because God set them aside to be an example to all nations! To 'preserve' this special group of people, God gave them the Torah which consists of all the commandments they have to obey .. which include not eating unclean food like pork and lobster.<br><br>Adam and Eve had no race, they were just human beings.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By the way, Judaism does not subscribe to the "you must believe in the Saviour to be saved" idea. Yes, they believe in a saviour but this belief is an article of their faith and not binded to their salvation. In a sense, it is incorrect to use the term 'salvation' for Judaism.<br><br>Which is why their theology has lesser problems compared to Christianity.

            <div class='col-md body'>pwnz0r,<br><br>Christians often miss the point when they impose their belief system onto other faiths.<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.religionfacts.com/judaism/beliefs.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.religionfacts.com/judaism/beliefs.htm</a><br><br><strong>Unlike Christianity and Islam, Judaism has no official creed or universal doctrinal requirements for membership. </strong>In general, a person can be considered "Jewish" whether he adheres to a complete system of beliefs about God and the afterlife, holds only a few simple beliefs that give meaning to ritual, or even (at least in liberal Judaism) does not believe in God at all.<br><br><strong>This diversity in Jewish belief arises in part because actions (good deeds and the mitzvot), not beliefs, are the most important aspect of Jewish religious life.</strong> In addition, the term "Jewish" can be used to describe a race and a culture rather than a religion, so some who identify themselves as Jewish may have little interest in the beliefs and practices associated with the religion of Judaism. </blockquote></div>

They have paid the price in blood and will continue to pay because God is unable to protect those who break the covenant.  Like everyone else, the door to salvation determined by the covenant is still open to them.  The question is... will they accept it?  Or will they fill their hearts and minds with hate and revenge thus rejecting the savior till the bitter end?<br><br><blockquote>Matthew 27:22-25 NIV<br>22"What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called Christ?" Pilate asked.<br>They all answered, "Crucify him!"<br><br>23"Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate.<br>But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"<br><br>24When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility! "<br><br>25All the people answered, "Let his blood be on us and on our children!" </blockquote></div>
