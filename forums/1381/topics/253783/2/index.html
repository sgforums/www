Because you said:<br><br><blockquote>The Jews in general have long since passed the point of no return with regards to their covenant the moment they cruxified the very savior they had been waiting for.</blockquote>If Jesus did not go through the passion leading to the crucification, there will be no salvation. According to Christians, there are verses in the OT that hints about the passion and calvary.<br><br>Here is another contradicton .. all thanks to you. You maintain that all things are possible with God, but God CANNOT LIE. Which means He cannot contradict what the bible said because the bible is from God.</div>

By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. 2God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don't you know what the Scripture says in the passage about ElijahÂ—how he appealed to God against Israel: 3"Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me"[a]? 4And what was God's answer to him? "I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal."[b] 5So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace. 6And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace.[c]<br><br>7What then? What Israel sought so earnestly it did not obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened, 8as it is written:<br>"God gave them a spirit of stupor,<br>eyes so that they could not see<br>and ears so that they could not hear,<br>to this very day."[d] 9And David says:<br>"May their table become a snare and a trap,<br>a stumbling block and a retribution for them.<br><br>10May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see,<br>and their backs be bent forever."[e]<br><br>11Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious. 12But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring!</div>

They blinded themselves thru their greed, hate, envy and thirst for revenge.  It is by the wisdom and power of God that good will triumph over evil turning misfortune into blessings for others.  Paul laments with regret that if the Jews had been loyal to God the blessings produced would have been so much more.<br><br>Thus instead of sharing the blessings along with the Gentiles, the Jews have to pay for their crimes...in blood.  This is the lament and regret of Paul the Apostle.</div>

I've never seen the resurrection. But yet, i believe. We do know that the early Christians were chastised and persecuted and there even the Roman empire got a tad worried.

So what if the whole Isreal was at sinai? And when Jesus and the Apostles performed miracles, the whole nation wasn't there.
