Religion is one of the best tools to forward political agendas.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laoda99:</div><div class="quote_body">IMHO, Jesus was executed mainly becoz of blasphemy</div></blockquote>well .. I tend to take ben's balanced approach that other factors are in play too.<br><br>Actually the dulan thing is Jesus was clearly blasphemising according to the law of Moses .. and He did not bother to clear up His name.<br><br>In fact, I make the argument that what Jesus did before the resurrection did not indicate that He was God - 100% God. As we can see, His disciples were unsure of His identity. They thought He was the Messiah. The most Peter said was .. "You are Christ, Son of the Living God".<br><br>I'm not sure Peter understood the Trinity. But his statement was ambiguous. He could very well meant Jesus was some kind of supernatural human being.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since we're on this issue, i thought i should raise something. Some Christians whom i talk to, tend to think that the events in the bible were isolated. But they were many extravaneous forces prevailing too. And sometimes, i think we must take into considerations these events.<br><br>Furthermore, it's like sometimes during dialogue, people throw around the crusades/ inquisition like it was a solely religious event. But imo, that cannot be further from the truth. And again, historical context and politics must be considered</div>
