            <div class='col-md body'>5:1-2. The opening verses of the Sermon on the Mount indicate that this message deals with the inner state of mind and heart which is the indispensable absolute of true Christian discipleship. It delineates the outward manifestations of character and conduct of the true believer and genuine disciple. A dispensationalist, Lawlor writes: "We do not find basic, fundamental Law here, for law cannot produce the state of blessedness set forth herein" (cf. G. Lawlor, The Beatitudes Are for Today, p. 11). Rather, the quality of life herein described is the necessary product of grace alone. As Jesus states the outward legal requirements of the law and then carries His listener beyond the letter of the law to the true spirit and intent of the law, He describes a life-style which no human being could live in his own power. Thus, the life of the believer, described by Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount, is a life of grace and glory, which comes from God alone. To make this quality of life the product of man's human efforts (as does the liberal) is the height of overestimation of man's ability and underestimation of his depravity. To relegate this entire message, Jesus' longest recorded sermon, to a Jewish-only life-style, as do hyper-dispensationalists, is to rob the church of her greatest statement of true Christian living!<br><br>The depth of spiritual truth proclaimed in this message of the kingdom, however, does not present the gospel of justification by faith in the death and resurrection of Christ. Pink states; "Its larger part was a most searching exposition of the spirituality of the law and the repudiation of the false teaching of the elders' (A. W. Pink, An Exposition of the Sermon on the Mount, p.13). Jesus made it clear that the spirit of Christ goes beyond the outward demand of the law. The Christian, though not under the law, is to live above the law.<br><br>It has always been difficult to clearly draw the distinction between the relationship of law and grace. Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones has observed: "Some so emphasize the law as to turn the gospel of Jesus Christ with its glorious liberty into nothing but a collection of moral maxims. It is all law to them and there is no grace left. They so talk of the Christian, that it becomes pure legalism and there is no grace in it. Let us remember also that it is equally possible so to overemphasize grace at the expense of the law as again, to have something which is not the gospel of the New Testament" (D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones, Studies in the Sermon on the Mount, pp.12-i 5). He goes on to note that the Sermon on the Mount and the message of the kingdom do have definite  application to the Christian today. It was preached to people who were meant to practice it not only at that time but ever afterwards as well. Boice (p.9) observes that the "World" of the Sermon on the Mount cannot be restricted to life in the future millennial kingdom, since it includes tax collectors, thieves, unjust officials, hypocrites, and false prophets.<br><br>Embodied in the Sermon on the Mount is a summation of Jesus' basic ethical teaching of the life of a born-again man.  While the Sermon on the Mount is not a way of salvation, neither is it only a message to those under the law, for it obviously goes beyond the law. It is a presentation of Christian discipleship which can be wrought in the soul of an individual only by the power of God. This message does not tell one how to be saved; it tells one what it is like to be saved. It explains the quality of the life changed by the saving grace of God. Its basic truths are reiterated everywhere throughout the New Testament epistles. There is no fundamental contrast between this message and the message of Paul. Both are in agreement that "the just shall live by faith!"<br><br>In the Sermon on the Mount Jesus states the spiritual character and quality of the kingdom which He wished to establish. The basic qualities of this kingdom are fulfilled in the church which He would establish. Virtually every section of this message is repeated in the substance elsewhere throughout the New Testament. There is nothing here to indicate that this message is to be limited in its application only to the people of Israel. Notice in the opening verse that his disciples had come to Him and he . . . taught them the following message.<br><br>a. The Beatitudes: Character described. 5:3-20.<br><br>3. Blessed means "happy." This is a basic description of the believer's inner condition as a result of the work of God. Kent states that it is virtually equivalent to being "saved" (H. A. Kent Jr. Matthew, in Wycliffe Bible Commentary, p. 15). These Beatitudes, like Psalm 1, do not show a man how to be saved, but rather describe the characteristics of one who has been saved. The poor in spirit are the opposite of the proud or haughty in spirit. These are those who have been humbled by the grace of God and have acknowledged their sin and therefore their dependence upon God to save them. They are the ones who will inherit the kingdom of heaven. It is obvious in this usage that the kingdom of heaven is a general designation of the dwelling place of the saved.<br><br>4. Those that mourn . . shall be comforted. The depth of the promise of these statements is almost inexhaustible. Those who mourn for sin shall be comforted in confession. Those who mourn for the human anguish of the lost shall be comforted by the compassion of God.<br><br>5. The meek. . . shall inherit the earth refers again to those who have been humbled before God and will inherit, not only the blessedness of heaven, but shall ultimately share in the kingdom of God upon the earth. Here, in the opening statements of the Sermon on the Mount, is the balance between the physical and spiritual promise of the kingdom. The kingdom of which Jesus preached is both "in you" and is yet "to come."  The Christian is the spiritual citizen of the kingdom of heaven now.<br><br>6. These future possessors of the earth are its presently installed rightful heirs and even now they hunger and thirst after righteousness. They experience a deep desire for personal righteousness which is, in itself, a proof of their spiritual re-birth. Those who are poor and empty in their own spiritual poverty recognize the depth of their need and hunger and thirst for that which only God can give them. To hunger means to be needy. It is joined with to thirst; the born-again man has a God-given hunger and thirst (inner passion) for righteousness.  This hungering and thirsting continues throughout the life of the believer. He continues to hunger and to be filled and to hunger and to be filled. God supplies his every spiritual need daily. This act of hungering and thirsting after righteousness is the by-product of a regenerated life.<br><br>Lawlor (p.60) rightly states that this is the description of a man who has already been saved. Nowhere does the Bible command unbelievers to hunger after righteousness in order to be saved. Rather, Paul clearly states "there is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God" (Rom 3:11).  The biblical writers make it clear that while man must come to Christ for salvation, it is not within man's normal ability and desire to want to come to God. Therefore, God is depicted throughout the New Testament as the seeking Saviour going after the lost. They shall be filled (Gr chortazÃ¤) refers to complete filling and satisfaction. The psalmist proclaimed: "He satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness" (107:9). This filling comes from God, who is the total source of satisfaction of His people. It comes now and it will continue to come throughout eternity to those who hunger and thirst for it.<br><br>7. Those who are merciful . . . shall obtain mercy has reference to those who have been born again by the mercy of God.  Because divine love has been extended to them, they have the work of the Holy Spirit in them producing a mercy which defies explanation by unregenerate men. Jesus Himself became the ultimate example of this when He cried from the cross, "Father forgive them for they know not what they do" (Lk 23:34). The form of proverbial teaching should not confuse the order of these statements; for example, the believer does not show mercy in order to obtain mercy, he shows mercy because he has obtained mercy. In so continuing to show the evidence of the grace of God in his life he continues to receive that grace. In other words, he is not saved simply because he shows mercy and is kind to people. He shows mercy and is kind because he saved.<br><br>8. Those who are truly saved shall see God. These are the pure in heart. Their lives have been transformed by the grace God. They are not yet sinless but their position before God has been changed. They have the new birth, saving faith and holiness. The process of sanctification is ever conforming them to the image of Christ (Rom 8:29), which image consists in "righteousness and true holiness" (Eph 4:24). Purity of heart is both the end of our election and the goal of our redemption. We read in Ephesians 1:4, "He has chosen us that we should be holy" and Titus 2:14, "who gave himself for us that he might redeem us unto himself a peculiar people." To which we add Hebrews 12:14, "Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord."<br><br>9. The next description deals with the peacemakers. They are the ones who are themselves at peace with God and live in peace with all men (cf. Rom 5:1). They are called "the" peacemakers for these are not social reformers, but rather the ones reformed by the regenerating power of the gospel. They are peacemakers because they themselves are at peace with God.  They have entered into the peace of Christ and thus are able ambassadors of God's message of peace to a troubled world.  Hence, they shall be called the children of God. These only shall be called the sons of God! Throughout the Beatitudes Jesus clearly underscores that only those who have the life-changing qualities herein described are citizens of His kingdom.<br><br>10. As Jesus develops His message He makes it clear that such a life causes His people to be in direct contrast to the world in which they live. Therefore He reminds, Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake. The plural use of ye in verse 11 indicates that He foresaw this persecution as touching all His followers. Notice II Timothy 3:12, "Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."  The nature of this persecution (Gr diÃ¤kÃ¤) implies a driving chasing away, a withstanding or keeping one from his goal. This does not mean that every Christian will necessarily suffer physical abuse as evidence of true salvation. While many Christians have sealed their faith with their blood, many more have had to withstand the social temptations and pressures of the world in order to live effectively for Christ.<br><br>11. Again, Jesus warns that men shall revile you, and persecute you. This became true during His own ministry, in the lives of the apostles and throughout the history of the church.   But in Tertullian's words, "The blood of the martyrs became the seed of the church." The persecution spoken of here is twofold.  First, it involves a physical pursuing of the persecuted and secondly a personal attack of slander against them.<br><br><span class="small"><a href="http://www.biblepath.com/commentary/beatitudes5a.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblepath.com/commentary/beatitudes5a.html</a></span></div>

Maybe he is on fire since today is Sabbath.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I'm quite surprised both of them never point out the crux of the matter. The discussion should not be about obsolete laws or a fickle minded God but something more basic than that. <strong>IMHO, we must first understand the point the author of Hebrews is trying to put across.</strong><br><br>First, a careful reader of Hebrews with good knowledge of the Old Testament will realize one glaring point - <strong>those verses in Hebrews are NOT original</strong>. They were plagiarised! But from where?<br><br>From the prophetic writings of Jeremiah:<br><br><blockquote>Jeremiah 31:<br><br>31 The days are surely coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah. 32It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of EgyptÂ—a covenant that they broke, though I was their husband,* says the Lord. 33But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 34No longer shall they teach one another, or say to each other, Â‘Know the LordÂ’, for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, says the Lord; for I will forgive their iniquity, and remember their sin no more. </blockquote>Here are the verses from Hebrews, both taken from NRSV for consistency sake:<br><br><blockquote>Hebrews 8:<br><br>8 God* finds fault with them when he says:<br>Â‘The days are surely coming, says the Lord,<br>when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel<br>and with the house of Judah;<br>9not like the covenant that I made with their ancestors,<br>on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt;<br>for they did not continue in my covenant,<br>and so I had no concern for them, says the Lord.<br>10This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel<br>after those days, says the Lord:<br>I will put my laws in their minds,<br>and write them on their hearts,<br>and I will be their God,<br>and they shall be my people.<br>11And they shall not teach one another<br>or say to each other, Â“Know the LordÂ”,<br>for they shall all know me,<br>from the least of them to the greatest.<br>12For I will be merciful towards their iniquities,<br>and I will remember their sins no more.Â’ </blockquote>They are damn freaking similar!! There is no doubt that the author of Hebrews was thinking of Jeremiah 31 when he wrote that. In other words, the author of Hebrews was trying to bring across the point that Jesus Christ is the new covenant Jeremiah was speaking about.<br><br>However, was Jeremiah writing about Jesus? Highly unlikely, almost to an impossibility.<br><br>Jeremiah uses the term 'House of Judah' and 'House of Israel', no doubt referring to the two royal houses. In Jeremiah's time, the Kingdom of Israel had already been destroyed. Judah was either in the midst of destruction or was just destroyed. The fact that the two politically-laden term were used, instead of the generic 'Jew', 'Israel' etc., is telling. <strong>It means that Jeremiah was speaking of a time when the two royal houses would be restored.</strong><br><br>Hebrews 8:10 talks about "This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: .. " The 'days' here refer to the verse earlier - Â‘The days are surely coming, says the Lord, when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah".<br><br>Hence 'after those days' seem to refer to some sort of reunification of the two royal houses into a single House of Israel. Perhaps this is why only the House of Israel is mentioned in verse 10?<br><br>To cut the story short, the verses couldn't be about Jesus Christ because the two royal houses were not restored in his time. In fact, it became worse with the destruction of the Temple in AD 70.</div>
