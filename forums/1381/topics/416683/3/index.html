              <p>It is not a matter of faith. Some Christians believe that temples are satanic, so it is against God and will go to hell if do that.

              <p>Hi June, it's all a matter of intentions. For example, when we attend a wake where there are joss sticks, showing respect to the deceased by holding joss sticks is okay, especially if such an action brings comfort to the loved ones of the deceased. As a Christian, we are called to love others and not to judge.</p>
              <p>Don't worry about offending God just by holding joss sticks, the act of love and concern to others is more important.  </p>

Joss sticks are just a different form of incense, so i don't see why they can't use it. My relatives are predominantly Christian (i'm not) so no issue but i think certain people get too carried away and interpret that offering joss sticks = praying to idols, devils, etc...</p></div>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">You are asking a valid question. Most probably, you or someone around is struggling with this issue of taking joss stick. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">A joss stick is but a joss stick, it is made from wood powder that is mixed with perfume. In the ancient day, it was used as an instrument to communicate with the higher beings that we called god. Besides, it was burn in rich man home to refresh the room. As air fresher was not invented back then. In today context, people use it as aromatherapy in the spa or home which for the latter purpose. At the same time, people used it for religious purpose like the former. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The issue arise especially when a Christian need to honour the dead which is our parent or forefather. Of course, the converted Christian will take the joss stick to respect the dead as it is in the custom of Chinese. In order not to upset the family and relatives present at the mourning or memorial occasion. However, if she does so, it may invite reprimand from the church mates for this simple act. The churchmates presence might associate the act of taking or burning of joss stick to demon worship. However, there is a saying, “When you are in Rome, do as the Romans do.” We need to question the act through proper analysis. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Firstly, does it cause harm to oneself or the others. Secondly, how can one parent or forefather who gave birth to us be a demon? Thirdly, if you attend a Catholic funeral, you will notice that incense is offer to God as purification for the dead body. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Last time, when I was a Christian, I love to burn incense in my room as an aromatherapy, however I was staying with a church mate. He was uncomfortable with it. He will associate the simply incense to demon worship. One fine day, when I was away, he came into my room, took the incense holder kit and threw away. When I realise it, it was too late. It taught me a lesson. People can be over spiritual and zealous still one forgot how to respect people property. Why a born again Christian should fret over an insignificant incense kit and associate it with demon. Isn’t the God, he serve more powerful than any other name? What is there to fear? That made me embarks on a faith searching journey.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Anyway, once I run into a Christian who was buying some incense offering in a shop. I ask him, “Why is he doing this since he is a Christian.” He replied, “At my mum death bed, she was having a hard time passing on despite of my plea for her to receive Christ. She rejected my plea and she made me to promise her as the only son to continue made offering to her when she passed on. When I agreed, she died peacefully.” </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">“Despite of my church mate’s objection, I will continue to make offering to her. Because it is a pain to see my mother who give birth to me to struggle at death bed. I would prefer to see her died in peace then pain. A promise is a promise. I will fulfil it as a filial piety act, as long as I am alive” He lamented.</span></span></p>
