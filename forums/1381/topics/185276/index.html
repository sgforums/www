            <div class='col-md body'>stop using religion as an excuse. u just cannot control your life between virtual games and real social life. addiction to games is just that you don't have a strong determination and perserverance against entertaining stuffs. religion just buff up what humans lack off in controlling themselves. and like most stories, it'll include some of the current trends to make it more realistic.<br><br>live as u like, without any regrets.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Are online games evil? </div></blockquote>Here's where I think the problem of the church when they start to meddled with such issues - a wrong identification of problems. This one of the few things I fought with in my church and with my sons' school. To identify these as firstly "a satanic" bond is really mislabelling the problem when the problem is obsession. Back in the old days when kids were failing the exams and not studying because of marbles and kites, you do not see pastors condemning marbles and kites, you get parents holding the cane and getting the kids back into the home to study.<br>I wrote to my boys' school to share with the teachers that when they condemned Harry Potter and Pokemon trading cards, they missed out on the Manchester United and Chelsea cards. If the boys are obsessed with ManU and Chelsea trading cards, all their condemnations are useless because they are barking up the wrong tree.<br><br>I don't play online games - I prefer puzzle games.<br>My younger son don't play online games - he's more into television, arts and crafts and pop music.<br>My older son is in DOTA - he's disciplined enough to moderate his play time, spends huge amount of time in the school website to get his assignments done. An almost straight A student.<br><br>I do not believe that online gaming is evil per se.... like anything else, it can go out of control, or if the user is discipline enough, it's a good form of entertainment.<br><br>"Those of use who goes around looking for the devil is bound to find him - even under a rock"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It isn't about "evil" or "god" or whats not. Basically it ends up with yourself.<br>I am a hardcore and if i may say competative gamer. I train hard, join compys. sit at my com from the moment i get back from school till sleeping time. Of course i got a life la . But this happens almost everyday. But i too am a good student. I listen in class though i dont do my homework. I did pretty good in O lvls  (Good enough to go a respectable JC) but i chose to go to a poly.<br><br>Everyone thought i would fail cause i didn't even pick up a book to study for Os but i did better than all of them. I have a great social life with both gamers and non-gamers.<br><br>Lemme tell you all this is bullshit. So lets say you dedicate your time to go to church, is that an obsession? so is that evil ?<br><br>There is no "good" or "evil" . There is only what you percieve as "good" or "evil"</div>

The issue is really what such genres does to you.... a person can enjoy gaming if the gaming part doesn't grip the person.</div>
