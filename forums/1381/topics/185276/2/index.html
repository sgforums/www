The pastor preached that anything which leads to obsession is most likely used by the devil to get a hold on the person and lead him away from christ and God.  The church also invited 2 witness to come on stage and share their experience.<br><br>The witnesses went on stage and gave a testimonial on how they were addicted to online gaming that they played the game for almost 14 hours a day. They also mentioned that because of their addiction, bad things happened to them, e.g(1 of them failed his O lvls badly).<br><br>And somehow when they asked for help, God came into their life and helped them. One of the witness online game account was hacked into and he lost every item and equipment in it. He eventually gave up playing that game because he felt "xian".<br><br>The pastor therefore urged people to destroy copies of their online games and appeal to young fathers, who may have young childrens, not to be influenced by the game and stop playing games totally. The pastor also says self control is impossible for the long term. As online games are structured in such a way that it is impossible to gain satisfaction just by spending 1 hour or less playing it.<br><br>What do you think?
