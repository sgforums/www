              </span></p><p>I am going to Hell but not for long.</p>
              <p>I am an unrepentant sinner. I admit my faults but knowing my personality, I know that I mentally justify my sins. I am good at self justification. This aspect of my personality has been fixed for life. My sins are mostly of the self embellishing kind. The types of sins that are self serving. Not meant to harm but more to aid myself in my path of life. Sins nevertheless. I know I will go to hell but when saved God spoke to me and assured me that hell is just and that I would only be there for a short time.</p>
              <p>It seems that my sins are considered of the minor type and that since I can only sin for a short time, 120yrs, to go to hell for 12000000000000+yrs, God considers unjust.</p>
              <p>It seems that the penalty fit’s the sin in hell. Large sins cause a longer duration and small sins give a smaller duration of punishment. I know that this view is contrary to scripture but was assured that this was just. God is just.</p>
              <p>If you are unduly worried of your conduct through life, rest assured that God will consider your whole life and the degree of sin and not just arbitrarily send you to hell forever. It seems that hell is not forever.</p>
              <p>When saved I was either deluding myself which negates my being saved or it was a true experience and God seems to disagree with scripture.</p>
              <p>Debate or comments.</p>
              <p>Is hell an everlasting blemish on/in God’s countenance for simmers or do most sinners eventually get to heaven?</p>

              <p>CS Lewis wrote, "There are only 2 kinds of people - those that say 'Thy will be done' to God or those to whom God in the end says, 'Thy will be done'. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"><br><br>If I read u correctly, you paint a caricature of hell this way: God gives us time (120 yrs??), but if we haven’t made the right choices by the end of our lives, he casts our souls into hell for all eternity. As the poor souls fall thru space, they cry out for mercy, but God says, “Too late! You had your chance! Now you suffer!”<br><br>I contend that this is a poor understanding of evil. The biblical picture is that sin separates us from the presence of God, which is the source of all joy and all love, wisdom or good things, etc. Only in His presence will we thrive, flourish, etc. If we were to lose His presence totally, that would be hell – the loss of our capability for giving or receiving love or joy. <br><br>It’s like in Luke 16:24-31, where it says that more than enough information has been given to people to make an informed choice about their destiny. And all God does, is as Romans 1:24 says, “gave them up to… their desires.” All God does in the end is to give them what they most want, including freedom from himself. What could be more fair than that? <br><br>Philosophically, man’s justice system works like this too: punishment last longer than the crime. It takes less than a minute to kill a man, but the punishment last a lifetime. Robbing a bank take about 3 minutes, but the punishment can last 25 years or even a life imprisonment. If a person concedes that punishment can (and generally does) last longer than the crime, his argument against an eternal hell becomes self-defeating.</p>
              <p>From Christian POV, the idea of eternity being too long for punishment is an appeal from emotion. Who would argue that heaven cannot be eternal because God would be unjust to reward us for “so long??” I think that the eternity of heaven and hell fall and stand together – both come from the mercy and justice of God. Matthew 25:46 tells us where we go during judgment day. Wicked to everlasting punishment, righteous to eternal reward. If a Christian believes that God rewards eternally, one shouldn’t disbelieve that God punishes the same too.</p>

              <p>The anomaly that I wish to point to is that penalties fit crimes.</p>
              <p>To take a minor sin and say that it's penalty is the same as a larger sin is unjust. The penalty must fit the crime. Scripture usually calls for closer to an eye for an eye. This is more fair by far. Scripture also says that God's will is to not lose any of His souls. Scripture also says that all of God's works are perfect. This would include our souls and natures. If we are given to do something by our nature then why would God punish a person for following the blueprint that He Himself provided. That makes no sense at all.</p>

              <p>until you can show me how having less fire is more fair than God giving us freedom, this statement remains a groundless assertion. And a rather poor one.</p>

              <p>Two queries – what is ‘our nature’? What is the ‘blueprint’ that God provided?</p>

              <p>Jesus admit that it is impossible to stop people from sinning but he said whoever made other people to sin is in for a harsh punishment.</p>

              <p>But whoever in the end condemned to hell will have to bear his shame and sufferings for eternity. No worry God is fair. God is not a man. Whoever condemned to hell is because he deserves it. In other words he can only have himself to blame.</p>

              <p>the cycle will never end. A steal B's things. next time B steal A's thing. unless we decide to break out of this cycle. just stop doing the wrong things. be the nice guy and stop the cycle, and forget about things that had happened.</p>
              <p>i m not a christian, but imo, god doesnt punish. i believe god is kind. god should be the one teaching people to stay away from bad and not punish the baddies. those who dont stay away from doing bad things just punish themself.</p>

              <p><br>That is offending the buddhists.    Though I question reincarnation I don't see the need to offend the buddhists.  Christians must check their attitudes when the faith preaches love, there  is hardly love from christians.  </p>
