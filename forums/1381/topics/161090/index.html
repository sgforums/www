They are trying to say that how come a 70-million year tissue fragments from a Tyrannosaurus rex femur are still flexible and resilient and when stretched returns to its original shape. I think they are trying to say that the scientists could be wrong. If I'm not wrong the Paleontologists are re-looking into the matter and they are hoping museums around the world would start cracking open bones and looking for soft tissue in their fossils.<br><br>Extracted from msnbc site:<br><br><blockquote>The finding certainly shows fossilization does not proceed as science had assumed, Schweitzer said.</blockquote>and<br><br><blockquote>"Preservation of this extent, where you still have this flexibility and transparency, has never been seen in a dinosaur before." Feathers, hair and fossilized egg contents yes, but not truly soft tissue.</blockquote>The scientists may not always be right, right? Keep an open mind.
