            <div class='col-md body'>Paid in Full<br><br>After living a "decent" life my time on earth came to an end. The first<br>thing I remember is sitting on a bench in the waiting room of what I thought<br>to be a courthouse. The doors opened, and I was instructed to come in and<br>have a seat by the defense table.<br>As I looked around I saw the prosecutor-he was a villainous-looking gent who<br>snarled as he stared at me. He definitely was the most evil person I have<br>ever seen.<br>I sat down and looked to my left and there sat my lawyer, a kind and gentle<br>looking man whose appearance seemed very familiar to me. The corner door<br>flew open and there appeared the Judge in full, flowing robes. He com-manded<br>an awesome presence as he moved across the room and I couldn't take my eyes<br>off of him. As he took his seat behind the bench he said, "Let us begin."<br>The prosecutor rose and said, "My name is Satan, and I am here to show you<br>why this man belongs in hell." He proceeded to tell of lies that I had told,<br>things that I had stolen, and how I had cheated others in the past. Satan<br>told of other horrible perversions that were once in my life, and the more<br>he spoke the further down in my seat I sank. I was so embarrassed that I<br>couldn't look at anyone, even my own lawyer. as the devil told of sins that<br>even I had completely forgotten about.<br>As upset as I was at Satan for telling all these things about me, I was<br>equally upset at my representative who sat there silently not offering any<br>form of defense at all. I knew 1 was guilty of those things, but I had done<br>some good in my life-couldn't that at least equal out part of the harm I'd<br>done.<br>Satan finished with a fury and said, "This man belongs in hell he is guilty<br>of all that I have charged; and there is not a person who can prove<br>otherwise. Justice will finally be served this day"<br>When it was his turn, my lawyer first asked if he might approach the bench.<br>The Judge allowed this, over Satan's strong objections, and beckoned him to<br>come forward. As he got up and started walking I was able to see him now in<br>his full splendor and majesty. Now I realized why he seemed so familiar,<br>this was Jesus representing me-my Lord and my Savior.<br>He stopped at the bench and spoke softly to the Judge, then turned to<br>address the court. "Satan was correct in saying that this man had sinned, I<br>won't deny any of these allegations. And yes, the wages of sin is death, and<br>this man deserves to he punished.'<br>Jesus took a deep breath and turned to his Father with outstretched arms and<br>proclaimed. "However, 1 died on the cross so that this person might have<br>eternal life, and he has accepted me as his Savior, so he is mine.<br>My Lord continued with. "His name is written in the book of life, and no one<br>can snatch him from me. Satan still does not understand yet, this man is not<br>to be given justice but rather mercy.<br>As Jesus sat down, he quietly paused, looked at his Father and replied,<br>"There is nothing else that needs to he done. I've done it all."<br>The Judge lifted his mighty hand and slammed the gavel down and the<br>following words bellowed from, his lips-This man is free-the penalty for him<br>has already been paid in full, case dismissed."<br>As my Lord led me away I could hear Satan ranting and raving, "I won't give<br>up, I'll win the next one!"<br>I asked Jesus, as he gave me my instructions where to go next, "Have you<br>ever lost a case?"<br>Christ lovingly smiled and said, "Everyone that has come to me and asked me<br>to represent them has received the same verdict as you, 'Paid in full.'"</div>
