These are not issues that will not rob one of the salvation. Of course the parties concern need to account to God when they meet up eventually, but life happens, sometimes inspite of everything that is being done to salvage the situation. Those who married non-Christians (deemed unequally yoked) need to bear the consequences of such actions, again, it has nothing to do with eternal life.<br><br>The picture of being unequally yoked has connotations towards the farming community where two oxens of different size are yoked (the wooden thingy that pulls the plough) thereby making the entire farming/digging process extremely difficult.<br><br>My personal view? The Corinthians verse does not refer to marriage specifically but more towards on the general relationship between believers and unbelievers. It is a warning to potential conflicts that will arise eventually. Be it marriage or a business dealing, a Christian need to know that the conflict of interest will be present.<br><br>Unlike some Christians, I do not turn livid when I hear about Christians wanting to marry non-Christians. It's their personal choice and they bear the consequences. I can only wish them all my best. The argument that the non-Christian will pull the Christian away from God is at best an assumption. Many God loving folks in my church eventually brought their spouse to church after a long time.<br><br>My church follows the doctrinal stand of being unequally yoked, but carries it with a tactful understanding and loving heart that God works for those who love Him.</div>

If there is an annulment, it means that there was no valid marriage in the first place.</div>
