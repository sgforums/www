Jesus might as well have sent up Judas or someone else to die for Him instead if that is the low view we take of grace. Obviously the forgiveness does not come through the personal atoning action, but through the grace bought by the perfect sacrifice, but a person who truly grasps the magititude of this sacrifice would want to reconcile, rather then use it as a proxy to avoid interpersonal repentence.<br><br>I suspect grace demands many things of us, but in different ways as we would expect of a legal system.

In the same way I am not convinced that life is easy to dispense just because it is abundant here.<br><br>Of course to omnipotence all this are easy, to I guess I just mooted myself. :p Though I might still objectively argue that grace is not cheap.<br><br>Well, the I suspect repentance is a thing of volition, which seems to me an issue of free will now, be it under grace or law, neither can coherce the son to repentence. However they seem to me to provide the framework in which such repentence is possible... the law sets up the rules to conduct this activity, and grace is the safety net onto which the inperfect creature can fall and come back again to adhering with the law.<br><br>I do not think the father has the right to demand the older brother forgives the prodigal... but I suspect he has the right to demand that the older loves the younger, and perhaps even for things such as harmony in the house. As with all things, it turns out that personal offence is not such a personal thing after all, with many things staked on it.<br><br>The older brother would then have to, if he knows the right thing to do, forgive the prodigal not because it was demanded from him, but because it was indeed the thing to do... for he is too a fallen creature and I suspect that only a perfect creature can truly withold forgiveness without any dire consquences...<br><br>Could it be the command to forgive is for our own good, for the law is really far more complex then we suspect? Not it it's form, but in the way it's applied. Could anything but grace make it's pratice perfect by fallen creatures?</div>

Obviously the lack of the human factor is a defect in understanding grace... but those who realize it know what they have to do.<br><br>I might not however, be tempted to judge the merit of Christianity based on the merit of it's people... if that was the case one might consider other religions in which merit and virtue really shines in their members. Buddhism might be a good example.<br><br>This is of course not to say that merit and virtue are unimportant, but rather that I suspect the merit and virtue demanded of Christians are all but humanly impossible. RC C.K Chesterton did state that the Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting... it has been tried and found too difficult.<br><br>It would be so much simpler to just go and live by the law then having to mix in some strange hybrid of grace that perfects the law and run into all the mess and nonsense that comes out of messing up this new thing.
