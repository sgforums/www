            <div class='col-md body'>the mystery of the trinity is one of the most complex in history. theologians are still trying to find a definite way to explain it. all i can say is tat jesus is God in human flesh...if God is all-powerful and everywhere, y cun he manifest himself in flesh too yet still be everywhere? when u breathe in oxygen, is there still oxygen ard u? is the oxygen u breathed in diff. from the one in the atmosphere?jesus prayed to the Father out of respect cos God is his heavenly fatehr...when we say they are 3-in-1,we mean tat they are equal in power. jesus is below God onli in terms of positioning...he is the son of the father...but jesus had the same power n authority given to him by God the father...</div>

We will finally worship God &amp; Jesus together. Let me show you here in Revelations:<br><br>Rev. 5:13: And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard saying: "Blessing and honor and glory and power Be to <strong>Him who sits on the throne</strong>, And <strong>to the Lamb</strong>, forever and ever!"<br><br>You see two Persons are mentioned. God the Father &amp; Jesus the Lamb of God. But since they are trinity, they are both tog on the throne at the same time. Maybe with Jesus sitting to the right of God.<br><br>Rev 4: 1 After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven. And the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, "Come up here, and I will show you things which must take place after this." <strong>2 Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne set in heaven, and One sat on the throne. 3 And He who sat there was F28 like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance; and there was a rainbow around the throne, in appearance like an emerald. </strong>4 Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white robes; and they had crowns F29 of gold on their heads. 5 And from the throne proceeded lightnings, thunderings, and voices. F30 Seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne, which are the F31 seven Spirits of God. 6 Before the throne there was F32 a sea of glass, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back. 7 The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature like a calf, the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.<br><br><strong>8 The four living creatures, each having six wings, were full of eyes around and within. And they do not rest day or night, saying: "Holy, holy, holy, F33 Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and is to come!" 9 Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever, 10 the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying: 11 "You are worthy, O Lord, F34 To receive glory and honor and power; For You created all things, And by Your will they exist F35 and were created." </strong><br><br>So you see from Rev 4, you have God who is worshipped &amp; this is NOT Jesus the Son of God. Here God is mentioned as the Creator &amp; Almighty.<br><br>So both God the Father &amp; Jesus the Son are worshipped together.</div>

Maybe i presume the Holy Ghost is inside us the believers so we dont worship the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost helps us to worship God in spirit &amp; in truth. Anybody any ideas where is the Holy Ghost in the worship of God? Thanks.</div></blockquote>Since the Holy Ghost is in you, shouldn't you pray to Him? More effective mah. What for pray to the Father in Jesus name? So long winded.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Repented John 2:<br><strong><br><br>I think you got it wrong. We will finally worship God &amp; Jesus together. Let me show you here in Revelations:<br><br>Rev. 5:13: And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard saying: "Blessing and honor and glory and power Be to [b]Him who sits on the throne</strong>, And <strong>to the Lamb</strong>, forever and ever!"<br><br>You see two Persons are mentioned. God the Father &amp; Jesus the Lamb of God. But since they are trinity, they are both tog on the throne at the same time. Maybe with Jesus sitting to the right of God.<br><br>Rev 4: 1 After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven. And the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, "Come up here, and I will show you things which must take place after this." <strong>2 Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne set in heaven, and One sat on the throne. 3 And He who sat there was F28 like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance; and there was a rainbow around the throne, in appearance like an emerald. </strong>4 Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white robes; and they had crowns F29 of gold on their heads. 5 And from the throne proceeded lightnings, thunderings, and voices. F30 Seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne, which are the F31 seven Spirits of God. 6 Before the throne there was F32 a sea of glass, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back. 7 The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature like a calf, the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.<br><br><strong>8 The four living creatures, each having six wings, were full of eyes around and within. And they do not rest day or night, saying: "Holy, holy, holy, F33 Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and is to come!" 9 Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever, 10 the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying: 11 "You are worthy, O Lord, F34 To receive glory and honor and power; For You created all things, And by Your will they exist F35 and were created." </strong><br><br>So you see from Rev 4, you have God who is worshipped &amp; this is NOT Jesus the Son of God. Here God is mentioned as the Creator &amp; Almighty.<br><br>So both God the Father &amp; Jesus the Son are worshipped together.[/b]</blockquote>so why do Christians worship Jesus more than the Creator Himself?? Shldnt God be above everything?? How can there be 2 Gods at the same time?? And the Holy Ghost...what is It actually...??</div>

And the Holy Ghost...what is It actually...??</blockquote>we do not worship Jesus more than God...it is juz tat jesus is the one who brings us to the Father..."no one comes to the Father except thru me"...God is above everything and so is Jesus...remember i said both have same authority and power? Jesus is onli inferior in terms of positioning...both are one God...we dun worship 2 Gods...Holy Ghost is part of the trinity...so we have 3-in-1 God...in science, we have CO2...wads tat? its 3 components of carbon n oxygen coming tgr to form 1 element...and for carbon dioxide to exist, all 3 components must exist tgr...but they belong as one element...same with the trinity...God consist of the Father, Son n the Holy Ghost...<br><br>Holy Ghost is actually the Spirit of God...it existed rite even b4 the beginning of time...Gen1:2 <strong>THE SPIRIT OF GOD</strong>...was hovering over the face of the earth...like we humans have body, mind n soul...God is like the mind...Jesus, the body and the Holy Ghost, the soul...can we survive without any one of these 3(body, mind or soul)? n our body acts according to our mind, tat does nt mean our body is inferior to our mind, it juz mean that our mind tells our body how to react to certain situations...its like jesus obeying the words of his Father...so God is the initiator, Jesus is the doer...but they are the same God...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Forget the trinity for a while and look at it this way, God the father, Jesus and the Holy Spirit are one. All 3 forms of God are one.
