            <div class='col-md body'>A valid criticism of Christians... but I don't think such a thing was ever meant to be even a part of any kind of mere Christianity. But I suspect it's one of the scandals and abuses that would rise up from having such a Grace.<br><br>Reconcilation as far as possible is certainly important, if not required everytime we mess something up. Ignoring it is most likely another evil in itself. I do for that matter think it's important for Christians to reconcile as much as they can, but I hardly think such a common failing is an indication of a defect of this Grace... it seems to me more of an abuse from a defect and callous viewing of our salvation then an inherent flaw in the notion.<br><br>It seems to me to be an issue of having a lack of heartware to sustain the rigours that Grace demands of us. If I wanted to right a wrong I would certainly have to make it right with that person, but yet of course know that I still have the safety net of Grace to fall upon, and the the ultimate forgiveness is assured. Sad that we should view such an incredible thing as a reason to avoid the discomfort of living the lifestyle that Grace should make us live. Maybe many of us do take it for granted.<br><br>But yet in nowhere have we gotten near a proper criticism of the invalidity of Christian Grace. It is a scandal I admit, but no where near the scandal that the infinite should become as lowly as the finite and ignorant such as us in order just to demostrate some weird thing call Love that even the best of our saints have barely started to understand.<br><br>One might as well critique free will for allowing so many evils to happen  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SingaporeTyrannosaur:</div><div class="quote_body">This is certainly true... but then again it turns out that all sins against another person will end up being a sin against God... and I suspect the offence against God is larger in just about any sin we care to do to others.</div></blockquote>Agree.<br><br>I mentioned before, the 10 commandments can be divided into roughly two groups, those dealing with God and those dealing with fellow human beings. That is why Jesus can summarize all commandments into "love your God" and "love your neighbours".<br><br>I also mentioned before that the Jews have this rather interesting belief:<br><br>The Jews bo heed God and sinned against Him in the OT, as a result their nation/Temple was destroyed and they went into exile/diaspora. But this lasts for only 70 years. Fast forward to the time of Jesus Christ. Now the Jews were extremely pious (too pious like the pharisee, you'd say) but they were heartless to fellow human beings. There was even this suggestion the Sabbath was above human life. So extreme were they that the invading Romans once attacked them and the Jews, instead of taking up defence, continued their Sabbath observance! (guess what happened to them?)<br><br>And the results? The nation/Temple was destroyed .. for 2000 years!<br><br>Thus the Jews believe that the sin to fellow human is greater than the sin to God. But of course, if you sin against fellow human, God will also be angry, and it is fair to say that overall you have sinned against God. This is evident from the simple logic:<br><br>if you love me then follow my commandments =&gt; if you don't follow my commandments mean you don't love me!<br><br><blockquote>Can He forgive the personal offense against the victim? I suppose that's up to the very victim to forgive, but the victim might do well to realize that that God had forgiven the larger and more profound fault against <span style="font-style: italic;">Himself</span> in this affair, not to mention also paid the price that all sins required of.</blockquote>God paid the price? Did the victim receive any "compensation"? So God paid the price to who?</div>
