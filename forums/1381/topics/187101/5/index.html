That is up to Him to forgive... and in the most mind-boggling of things to do he chooses to help me foot the bill for that beasty act (the sin against the individual)... and demands of His daughter to accept it as well.<br><br>Stranger still He demands that we eventually end up loving each other as brother and sister would, but I digress.<br><br>Another view I might suggest that is of my own logical speculation of how interpersonal sin affects God... it is He after all the sustainer of all reality and existence and demands a certain order of it. Any direct sin on any aspects of his sustained creation would very well be a direct attack on Him... in a way what we do to others we do to Him.<br><br>After all that unfortunate young lady may be an individual, but she is not truly an individual in the sense that she is a totally self-contained and self-sustained creation. If that was the case then all my sins against here are well and truly her own offence to keep and to which the cross might very well have no legal effect.<br><br>But that is not the case of course, the dear miss turns out to be an existence sustained by His very hand, and in fact her very ability to be hurt and sinned against are made possible by his sustaining of her very existence and free will.<br><br>In that light, an attack on this part of his system would consitute a very direct attack on Him (in a sense it is 'raping' God, pardon my inpious language), and also in the way that the cross is valid payment for it all.<br></div></blockquote>Agree in general.<br><br>Let's just say if you sin against fellow human beings, God will be heartbroken.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Jesus might as well have sent up Judas or someone else to die for Him instead if that is the low view we take of grace. Obviously the forgiveness does not come through the personal atoning action, but through the grace bought by the perfect sacrifice, but a person who truly grasps the magititude of this sacrifice would want to reconcile, rather then use it as a proxy to avoid interpersonal repentence.<br><br>I suspect grace demands many things of us, but in different ways as we would expect of a legal system. It seems to demand a lot more of the heart as well. We ought to be as sad as at the death of the child everytime it is abused.</div>
