            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Contrition and Attrition: The difference</strong><br><br>Many people forego repentance until their old age. They say: Â“I will repent when I am at the threshold of eternity.Â” And so when they are in their gray head days they Â‘repentÂ’.<br><br>But what is repentance? Repentance is actually a change of attitude towards sin, God, self and Christ.<br><br>The repentant says:  Â“This is wrong against God. I have sinned against the moral Governor of the Universe. I am in this hopeless and helpless state of sinning. I donÂ’t deserve heaven. I will turn to Christ.Â”<br><br>Repentance at its earlier stage starts out with attrition.<br><br>What is attrition? It is changing ones ways for fear of the punishment. But it does not stop here. For repentance to be true and genuine, it [attrition] must mature into contrition. Sadly, many just stop at attrition, never moving forward into contrition.<br><br>What is contrition? It is when the sinner realizes that sin is sin and that it grieves the heart of God. God who is sooo good and gracious and loving worthy of all my all. Why should we sin against Him? And so the contrite sinner turns away from sin because it is a sin against God nothing more, nothing less. Not because of the threat of hell or the promise of bliss in heaven. Even without hell the contrite sinner turns away from sin. Even without heaven the contrite sinner turns away from sin. He is focused on what this blessed and Holy person delights.<br><br>What would you do of a woman wanting only to marry you because you are rich? She only wants to escape poverty thatÂ’s why she wants to marry you. IÂ’m sure youÂ’d dispense of that woman right? You want someone to marry you because of you. ItÂ’s the same way with God. God is a person. He is touched and moved when a sinner turns away from sin with the motive that he [the sinner] does not want to grieve Him. He stops his sinning because he wants to honor God for who He is. This is true repentance.<br><br>Contrition is the work of God in a sinner. The human heart cannot just be contrite by its own. It is desperately wicked and it cannot change. Only GodÂ’s grace can break a rebellious heart.<br><br>Repentance is not the payment for sins. WE must not rely on it for salvation. However, it is the condition to salvation. The payment for sins is in Mt. Calvary. You must go there for salvation. In order for you to reach there, you must leave sin. In order for you to accept the gift of salvation, you must lay down your arms. Surrender those weapons of rebellion. Your hands cannot receive the gift of salvation if it is full of rebellion.<br><br>When you came to Christ did you come to Him just because you want to escape hell or did you come to Him because of sin?<br><br>[Note: The heart is sooo deceitful. Sometimes because of fear of impending death a person displays seeming Â‘repentanceÂ’ from sin. He really feels that he has Â‘repentedÂ’ and Â‘acceptedÂ’ Christ only to find out on the other side that he was never saved at all.<br><br>Yes, deathbed repentance is possible so long as it is true repentance. But in order for you to be sure that you have really repented, why not repent now when you are healthy and strong. So when imminent death comes and you are lying in your bed you wonÂ’t be bothered by the thoughts: Â“Are you really repentant? Really? What if itÂ’s only attrition? How will you know?Â” .........But if you have repented as early as now when you are healthy, then you will be assured that your repentance is true and is not only  a product of attrition for you have repented from your sins even when the threat of death was remote].<br><br>Why not repent now? Turn from your sins. God is to be revered and honored. Self [with its sins] is to be judged. Christ is to be relied on for salvation.<br><br></div>
