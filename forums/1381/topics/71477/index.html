            <div class='col-md body'>and other related shows.... wonder how long it will take the censors to pass the rating for The Passion of The Christ... anyone looking forward to it??<br>*******************************************************<br><br><strong>Christ dominates the big screen (Straits Times, 28 Feb 2004) </strong><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Three Christian films will be shown here soon but movie distributors say the trend is just a coincidence </span></strong><br><br>By Foong Woei Wan<br><br>A CHRISTIAN revival is sweeping the big screen.<br><br>Besides Mel Gibson's controversial The Passion Of The Christ, two other Christian films will be shown here soon.<br><br>On March 18, distributor United International Pictures will release The Gospel Of John, which is the tale of Christ as told by his apostle John.<br><br>On July 8, distributor Shaw Organisation will release Luther, a biopic of Martin Luther, the 16th-century German leader of the Protestant Reformation.<br><br>John is a 2003 Canadian-British co-production narrated by Christopher Plummer and stars relative unknown Henry Ian Cusick as Christ.<br><br>It is a word-for-word adaptation from the American Bible Society's Good News Bible.<br><br>Luther is a 2003 European production based on the play by Briton John Osborne and stars Joseph Fiennes in the lead role.<br><br>A spokesman for Shaw says it will be on a limited release.<br><br>Gibson's dramatisation of the last hours of Christ's life is likely to be released here on April 1, says Warner-20th Century Fox.<br><br>UIP and Shaw say the trend is just a coincidence.<br><br>Other distributors, including Cathay-Keris Films and Golden Village Pictures, say they have no plans to release Christian movies.<br><br>'We were on the lookout for a Christ movie before Passion generated such a controversy,' said Mr Nicholas Yong, UIP's managing director for Singapore and Malaysia.<br><br>'The time was ripe. The Gospel Of John was released in the United States recently,' he said.<br><br>Gibson's film has come under criticism for allegedly showing the Jews in a bad light, and also for its violent scenes.<br><br>Still, it made US$23.6 million (S$40 million) in the US and Canada on its opening day on Wednesday.<br><br>Passion may become the most-watched religious-themed movie since The Ten Commandments and Ben Hur.<br><br>Warner-20th Century Fox has sent a print of the film to the Media Development Authority. No rating has been announced for it.<br><br>UIP's Mr Yong expects a PG rating for John.<br><br>'It's not as violent as Passion, it's more family-friendly,' he said.<br><br>A spokesman for Shaw said of Luther, which has not been rated: 'All along, we've been planning to release it in July.'<br><br>On top of these three films, a Christian play, The Gospel According To Mark, is in its second week, and is now at The Substation Garden. It stars stage and TV actor Rodney Oliveiro as Christ.<br><br>World-In-Theatre's playwright, Sonny Lim, says it is playing to houses that are 'more than 50 per cent' full.<br><br>But he doubts that the crowds have been drawn by the controversy over The Passion Of The Christ.<br><br>It just happens that his Christian play is 'the first in years', he says.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder why the Jews should be upset over the movie, when it was just a stating of historical fact! Truth is, none of us or our people are exactly clean in history and culture either, so what's the beef about a movie showing a time when we weren't exactly nice? It's historical fact.<br><br>Besides, it wasn't the Jews or the Romans which crucified Christ, it was really humanity. The hand that held down Christ's hand to be nailed in the movie was none other then Mel Gibson's own.<br><br>As for the violence, what's the beef again? The truth is, the who event cross was a pretty violent affair not anything like the politically correct versions we would like to imagine it as. The truth is, the cross is a place of immense suffering and to see it in it's full violence will best help us to realize just a little of the magnitude of the sacrifice that Jesus made which we can't even start to imagine..</div>

This ambitious motion picture follows the Gospel precisely, neither adding to the story from other Gospels, nor omitting complex passages.<br><br>Narrated by renowned Canadian actor Christopher Plummer with a distinguished cast from Canada and the United Kingdom selected primarily from Canada's prestigious Stratford Festival and Soulpepper Theatre Company, as well as Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company and Royal National Theatre , it features British actor Henry Ian Cusick in the seminal role of Jesus Christ.<br><br>John is the best-loved but least understood of the gospels, presenting a uniquely human portrait of Jesus. Intimate and reflective, THE GOSPEL OF JOHN provides audiences with an unparalleled opportunity to understand the tumultuous period in history at the time of Jesus Christ.<br><br>British actors Stuart Bunce (John), Richard Lintern (Leading Pharisee) Scott Handy (John the Baptist) and Lynsey Baxter (Mary Magdalene) plus celebrated Canadian talents Diego Matamoros (Nicodemus), Stephen Russell (Pilate), Daniel Kash (Simon Peter), Cedric Smith (Caiaphus) and Nancy Palk (Samaritan Woman) are among the highly-praised cast. THE GOSPEL OF JOHN is directed by acclaimed British director Philip Saville ("Metroland", "Hamlet", Oedipus the King" ), and co-produced by legendary Canadian producer Garth H. Drabinsky ("Ragtime", Phantom of the Opera", "Showboat" )  and celebrated British producer Chris Chrisafis ("The Count of Monte Cristo", "Reign of Fire" ).<br><br>Executive producers are EmmyÂ® Award winner Sandy Pearl, Joel B. Michaels, Myron Gottleib and Martin Katz. Together they assembled a brilliant creative team including award-winning screenwriter John Goldsmith ("Victoria and Albert", "Return of the Saint"; "Great Expectations" ), veteran production designer Don Taylor ("The House of Mirth", "Little Voice" ), Academy A wardÂ®-winning Sound Mixer David Lee ("Chicago" ), AcademyÂ® Award winning makeup artist Trefor Proud ("Topsy Turvy", "Gladiator", "Star Wars" ) award-winning costume designer Debra Hanson, and highly regarded director of photography and film editors Miroslaw Baszak and Michel Arcand.<br><br>More info here: <a href="http://www.gospelofjohnthefilm.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gospelofjohnthefilm.com/</a></div>
