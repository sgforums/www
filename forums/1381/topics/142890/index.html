When we do something, it is always "<strong>I...I...I...I</strong>" "<strong>I </strong>want...<strong>I </strong>want...<strong>I </strong>want...<strong>I </strong>want..." "<strong>I </strong>can....<strong>I </strong>can...<strong>I </strong>can...." "<strong>I </strong>will...<strong>I </strong>will... <strong>I</strong> will..". We forgot about our family members, our frens and even GOD. By focusing on ourselves only and believing we are ever in control of our own destiny, we forget how to love others, and most importantly, GOD.<br><br>When we meet with a bad situation, very often we asked: "Why he/she do this to <strong>me</strong>?" "Why GOD let this happen to <strong>me</strong>?" "Why must it be <strong>me</strong>?" "Why GOD never answer <strong>my</strong> prayers?" "GOD/others are cruel to <strong>me</strong>" When we met with a problem, it is always others who are at fault. When we point the accusing finger at others/GOD, we forgot about our own mistakes. We failed to reflect upon ourselves our own actions/decisions. We failed to see when is the last time we really prayed earnestly to GOD. We failed to see what others/GOD have done for us in our lives. When natural disasters struck, we failed to look upon ourselves how much we cared for this earth and blamed GOD instead.<br><br>When we are showered with blessings from others/GOD, it is always:"I am lucky" "I deserve it due to <strong>my own effort</strong>" "I deserve it as it is <strong>my turn</strong> now" "It is <strong>my lucky break</strong>". We forgot when is the last time we thanked others/GOD for these blessings. We took these blessings for granted.<br><br>my questions:<br><br>1) Are we so conceited that whatever we do/say are <strong>always focus on ourselves</strong>, so much so that we forgot all about others/GOD?<br><br>2) Are we always so busy making ourselves acceptable to others, by striving to become as rich/successful as possible with unscrupulous ways, so much so as that we forgot our own identity and forgot how to love others/GOD?<br><br>3)With our science/logic/reasoning, can we do without GOD ("...he never answered my prayers anyway?" "<strong>We</strong> are always in control of our own destiny..<strong>I</strong> have knowledge/science/reasoning..<strong>we</strong> can become GODs ourselves..<strong>we</strong> ourselves can reach enlightenment thru perfectment of <strong>ourselves</strong>...<strong>I am </strong>like that..science shows that I am like that, so <strong>i dun need to change</strong>...etc etc<br><br>4) Ironically, do we <strong>put GOD in the persecution stand</strong> when things do not go our way?<br><br>5) Are we really sure that at the end of the day, we will just turn into ashes and there is no reward of paradise and punishment of hell? ("Is there a GOD in the first place? I never hear him or see him leh/he never send me 4D/Toto numbers mah?" "If <strong>I</strong> do enuff good, <strong>probably</strong> <strong>i </strong>will have good also" "It is <strong>my own choice </strong>and if i go to hell so be it"<br><br><strong>My question is: Can one really bear the consequences? </strong><br><br>6) For Christians, do we often focus on <strong>doing our own will </strong>and not GOD's?<br><br>These are just my thoughts of the day, just to share... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br></div>
