He told them of his experience and how it came about, and had removed the cartoons from his blog after he was questioned.<br><br>When contacted, Char asked that he not be identified for he feared he might lose his job, which he wanted to keep before entering a local university in August.<br><br>Describing himself as a freethinker, he said he had posted a cartoon that depicted Jesus as a zombie biting a boyÂ’s head in January. The following month, he received an online message asking him to remove the image.<br><br>Char did not reply to the message but chose to irk the person instead. He searched the Internet for more pictures depicting Jesus and published three of them on his blog.<br><br>Looking back, he said he felt he had made an Â“unwiseÂ” move.<br><br>In its statement on Tuesday, the police also advised the public Â“that it is a serious offence for any person to distribute or reproduce any seditious publication which may cause feelings of ill will and hostility between different races or classes of the population of Singapore.Â” Offenders can be jailed up to three years or fined a maximum of S$5,000 (RM11,514) or both.<br><br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has also said the government would act against anyone making remarks threatening SingaporeÂ’s racial and religious harmony, whether done online or offline. Race, language and religion remain sensitive issues here, and a younger generation must grow up learning the Â“eternal truthsÂ” about Singapore, he said last year when three young Singaporeans were charged under the Sedition Act.
