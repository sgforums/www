            <div class='col-md body'>Dear ppl,<br><br>its been a wonderful few years in sgforums. know some true friends and met interesting virtual characters.<br><br>behind every nick is a treasured soul, a person created and fashioned in the image of God.<br><br>My 'fanaticism' about God, and the gospel of Jesus Christ has in many ways offended ppl. In this post-modernist society, where people constantly reject the idea that an absolute truth exist. To be certain of truth is equal to arrogance and even intolerance.<br><br>However, before i leave this forum. I want to reaffirm my stand on the truth found in the gospel of Jesus Christ. That there is absolutely no salvation apart of Christ Jesus. The thinking that all religions are true cannot be propagated further because when everything is true, nothing is true at all. Truth is exclusive, one truth simply means the other contradictions are lies and false in its nature.<br><br>Exclusivity is offensive and seen as arrogance. But i want to say that all i did so far is like 'a beggar telling another beggar where can the bread be found.' I am not God, I am a sinner at best...wretched sinner at worst.<br><br>With that, I will leave this place reason being that i have other commitments that require my time, effort and devotion. They have a higher priorities in my life. All the best wishes and blessings to everyone here and may you find better purposes and meaning in life. Real life. Not virtual reality nor even hyper-reality. Truth is absolute, not defined by the person who wants it to be nor by social norms.<br><br>For those of you who are believers in Jesus Christ. Don settle for second best. God has a better calling, a higher ground for you to walk on. Based and ground your entire life firmly upon God and His infallible word. That is the only source of certain hope in this uncertain world.<br><br>The Lord bless and keep you always.<br><br>NeonTetra</div>

I wont and will never compromise. I cant say Jesus saves..but other ways can also. That is first of all not true and also secondly not the way to say. might as when dun preach in the first place.<br><br>I desire to present truth at its most plain form, The holy scriptures the way it is, the way it meant to be. I never sugar-coat the scriptures and the issues it talks about. thats why.<br><br>The offensiveness from the gospel comes from the fact it is gloriously exclusive. It is not to bash ppl and say they r sinners and we r holy. they to hell and we to heaven and never say anything about it. I present the consequences, I present too the plan of salvation ...that God, not me... gives to all who truly repent<br><br>The gospel is hurting but also comforting. This who sees the hurting and offending part but reject the comfort of Christ's salvation will only stay at the point of being offended.<br><br>I wish you the very best in all you do.</div>
