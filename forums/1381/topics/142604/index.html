            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporeans take their faith seriously. An overwhelming majority - 86 percent - have a religion. Even among those with no religion, 70 percent believe in GOD.

RELIGION NO by Aaron Low looks into a Mr Tan who believes in a monothestic GOD, prays and say grace b4 every meal. But he is not a muslim/jew/christian. Mr Tan attended church as a child but stopped in his late teens.<br><br>The group where Mr Tan belonged surveyed 7 in 10 who believe in the existence of a supreme being. A third say they will consider converting to a religion in the future.<br><br>But if they believe in GOD, why do they not rely on religion? Dr Tan Kim Huat, dean of studies at TTC says it is becoz of their higher level of education. The better educated prefer to find meaning based on their own intellect and reasoning. They refuse to have religion rule over their lives.<br><br>According to the survey, almost six in ten of those with no religion have at least A levels. A quarter have degrees.<br><br>My take: it is ok to find meaning based on own intellect and reasoning, but once u believe in GOD, at least have the faith to continue becoz after all, it is abt faith and so much on logic/reasoning. Logic/reasoning may fail, but GOD's love for us will never fail. By humbling ourselves b4 GOD, we can live better lives according to his will and not ours.<br></div>
