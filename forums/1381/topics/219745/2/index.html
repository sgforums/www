            <div class='col-md body'>It's a Catch-22 situation mah.<br><br>You can "invest" in the adults, but not everyone will accept all the teachings regarding disciplining children. And if ill-disciplined children are not put in Sunday school, they tend to distract the sermons. Then Sunday service loses it's effectiveness.<br><br>I think every level must share the same vision and hunger for God. The parents must know their importance in raising up Godly children. The church leadership must recongnise the importance of Sunday school and train up teachers. These teachers must see the importance of their work in raising Godly children. The parents teach and guide their children at home, the Sunday school teachers reinforce the same values.<br><br>We must set these children apart, so that they may grow up in God's holiness.<br><br>Hence we must work as a Body. We cannot rely on just one part to work and expect things to work.</div>

They can also digest some teachings from the Bible and share with the congregation on how these teachings could apply in today's context. We learn in both ways, there is no high or low view.</div>

Baptist churches are independent of each other, there is no central authority.<br><br>Many Baptist churches, especially those Chinese churches, follow the structures of baptist churches in HK, and the Southern Baptist Churches in america. There are generally 4 ministries in a Baptist Church, Worship, Education (Sunday Schoold, some include management of the church library), Fellowships, and Evangelism (mainly foreign mission). BS is normally part of the Fellowships activities which consist of junior fellowship, teenagers fellowships, youth groups, young adult ministry, adult ministry and Senior Adult ministry, in the past there were also Women Fellowship for women only. These groups or fellowships meet once a month or every fortnight as a big group, and the other week they meet in smaller groups, call it BS group or cell groups. Essentially, they meet as small groups to study, to share, to fellowship.....<br><br>Usually the youth groups would meet on Saturday afternoon, then follow by Choir practice for those involved, some groups meet on Sunday afternoon, that would keep them the whole Sunday in church.</div>
