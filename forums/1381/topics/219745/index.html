Cut out some unecessary words. sorry.]<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Both [Holy and sanctified]  means to set apart in either OT or NT</strong></span>. It is a neutral word actually. Depending on its usage it could have shades of meaning.<br><br>Let me quote the verse:<br><br>1Co 7:14 For the unbelieving husband is <strong>HAGIAZO</strong>- SANCTIFIED by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is <strong>HAGIAZO</strong>-SANCTIFIED by the husband; otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are <strong>HAGIOS</strong>-holy.<br><br>HAGIAZO IS A VERB. HAGIOS IS AN ADJECTIVE.<br><br><strong>A piece of ground could be made  holy. </strong><br><br>Ex 3:5 Then He said, "Do not draw near this place. Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you stand is <strong>holy</strong> ground<br><br>Is the Lord then saying here that the ground is saved [from sin]? Certainly not.<br><br><strong>A day could be holy</strong><br><br>Ex 16:23 Then he said to them, "This is what the LORD has said: 'Tomorrow is a Sabbath rest, a <strong>holy</strong> Sabbath to the LORD. Bake what you will bake today, and boil what you will boil; and lay up for yourselves all that remains, to be kept until morning.'"<br><br>was the Sabbath  here  saved [from sin]? Certainly not.<br><br><strong>Garments could be made holy</strong><br><br>Ex 28:2 "And you shall make <strong>holy</strong> garments for Aaron your brother, for glory and for beauty.<br><br>Were the garments here then saved [from sin]? Certainly not<br><br><strong>Things could be holy</strong><br><br>Ex 28:38 "So it shall be on Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the <strong>holy</strong> things which the children of Israel hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall always be on his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.<br><br>Were the things here then saved [from sin]? Certainly not<br><br><strong>The third person of the Blessed Trinity is called Holy.</strong><br><br>Does that mean then the the Holy Spirit was saved [from sin]? Certainly not<br><br>You see the word "holy" could be used in a special sense as in being redeemed from sin or it could mean "to be separate from" without special reference to salvation from sin holiness.<br><br>Garments, things , a particular day could be separated unto God without being separated from sin. [These things have no sin in the first place. These things are amoral]<br><br>A particular person could be positioned in a special place of privilege that others may not be in. To be in contact with someone who can share the Word of God [the Gospel] to you is indeed a special place of privilege which others may not have the privilege of. If you are in a family of Christians, God has placed you my friend in a special privileged separated position that others may not be in.<br><br>Grab the oppurtunity!!! Trust in Christ that you may be separated from SIN ACTUALLY. FROM IT'S PENALTY. FROM IT'S POWER AND EVENTUALLY FROM ITS PRESENCE.<br><br>note: notice verse 14 an unbelieving spouse could be made HAGIAZO because of the influence of a believing spouse. But it does not mean that the husband or wife is saved. For Paul wrote in verse 16:<br><br>1Co 7:16 For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?<br><br>I thought they were made Hagiazo already in verse 14? Yes, the Hagiazo there does not mean being saved from sin. It  means being placed in a special separated privilege or position. And that goes for the hagios children too.<br><br><strong>The nation of Israel  was called a HOLY NATION. BUT NOT ALL OF THEM WERE SAVED. Only those who trusted in the coming Messiah were saved and therefore made holy from sin.</strong><br><br>[There are 4 aspects of Santification: 1) Pre-converstion sanctification 2) Positional sanctification 3) Progressive sanctification  and 4) Perfected sanctification].<br><br></div>

You know by now that I am not mister nice guy. I had a role to play then and that was to ensure that Sunday school survived when challenged by an intiative attempting to kill it. I almost have to build the SS from scratch because for a period of 2 to 3 years before I taught, SS virtually disappeared. After I took on the role, I had to ensure that I have enough publicity to ensure that the various congregation recognise SS as a viable ministry and that it is growing. Only then I can attract good teachers.  Only when I have teachers then will I have classes to run. When I left that role, I had about 60 to 70 students and 15 teachers.<br><br>I left because it was time to go. I finished the job that had to be done - that is to build the SS.<br><br>Once I left, I made sure that I would not interfere with the current leadership. I have no role in SS as of Jan 2006. I will not participate in an SS activity unless the new superintended explicitly invite me (even though some of my students have asked when I will come back to teach)<br><br>Recently I have been invited to sit in the Christian Education committee in a non-teaching capacity. </div></blockquote>youre good.<br><br></div>

Worship congregation executive committee decides to embark on a children's church concept.<br>2. SS, which normally operates during worship time, is seen to be a threat to the new concept.<br>3. Kills SS with preference shown to having the kids sit through the entire service, in a special alloted area of the sanctuary where the sermon is given the kiddie's treatment using OHP.<br><br>If it is not for the concern that some parents (me included) who sees this concept as being really idiotic, SS would have died totally.<br><br>Some of us still believe that there is a missing generation of about 4 yrs of children who did not go through the SS school route.<br><br>.... but I think this is OOT already.
