            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large">Hello everyone, i am back. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Went to bi guan xiu lian (meditate behind closed doors).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  I see a very interesting thread on homos but got no time to read them all just read first page. I agree Christians shouldnt force their beliefs on ppl but when someone speaks up from a Christian perspective from the bible w/c acc to us it's God's Word, can gays not be angry or anyone in fact who doesnt agree bible is God's Word? It seems like God "condemning" the gays &amp; everyone not Christian since it's God's Word? If God said so, then it must be so w/c they feel it's not so? So how? Anyway, not my pt to prove bible is really God's word.<br><br>My pt here is as the title above: was a gay always gay from birth or environment play a part? Genetic vs environment? I would like to hear or read scientific research articles from credible scientists in estab universities put here on this forum, maybe links or websites or research papers, both for or against gay as inherited or acquired. Then maybe we can debate factually &amp; intelligently instead of theologically or emotionally.<br><br>In my case, i know of research done w/c indicates the brain structure of gay males r diff from normal males even in animals, but i ask one thing: could this brain structure have come abt bcos of environmental pressure on weak genes of certain individuals? Was the brain of such person basically weak so that additional stress caused the brain to change or shrink etc?<br><br>We know schizophrenics r genetically linked but again i ask, could these mental patients have been subjected to extreme stress w/c normal ppl could bear but they couldnt so they broke down? Could potential schizos also be spared if they had easier stress free lives? So genetic a large part plus env? If these potential gays were given normal childhood or less stress could they have remained straight? Could this condition be reversed like for schizos or controlled using drugs, psychotherapy, prayer, counselling etc? Are they to blame if its genetics or even environmental or both? Are they held accountable to God if they believe in God at all? So many questions.<br><br>For eg, i saw on discovery channel that murderers on death row in US were scanned using MRI/CAT &amp; scientists discovered that when they become angry, their frontal cortex didnt light up, indicating they not thinking at all but hind brain lights up indicating emotions took control. Rational brain not working at all! A deficiency in brain structure or nerve cells? Normal ppl have both areas light up in anger so they can control emotion &amp; not hack someone. So can they be blamed for the murders they committed? Should they be hanged? Pls ponder. God bless u. </span></div>

He is against ALL KINDS OF SINS. Big sins, small sins, black lies, white lies, known sins, hidden sins, evil thots &amp; motives, hypocrisy, pharasaicism, holier than thou attitudes, adultery, fornication, p0rn, v0yeurism, mast**bation, idol worship or simply refusing to acknowledge Jesus Christ as God the Son, of which i was guilty also. Bcos all have sinned &amp; fallen short of the glory of God. There's none righteous, no not one. All have gone astray, each his own way. Our righteousness is but filthy rags in sight of God. We need forgiveness of God thru Christ blood. We need to repent daily &amp; carry cross daily. God bless u.</div></blockquote>i read it and actually i only condemn paul as bigot. because paul is only human. i dun see jesus saying anything that god thinks being gay is wrong. so paul must have been voicing his own humanistic biased views.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I fail to see why christians like to accept the bible as a whole....this is despite knowing very well that the original teachings of the bibles has been manipulated and changed throughout the century.  Worst...they accept human views on certain subjects as "Word of God".<br><br>They have the freedom to believe what is truth and what is fiction from the bible. Yet they decide to believe fiction as truth.

Later parts written after Jesus's death are like a newspaper columnist expressing his views on some things. Simple fact is, it is the Church who lump all these writings together n label them "Bible" and "New Testament" So I don't see why I must accept them all word for word as facts.</div>

Luke may have been written as late as AD 80.<br>The book of Romans was written in the early spring of AD 57.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Source: The NIV Study Bible</span><br><br>So chronologically speaking the gospels and the Romans were not far apart. In the first place, why believe the gospels anyway, seeing that the earliest one was a good 27 years from the resurrection of Christ? What determines this to be "factual"..... As far as I can see, where you are concern, it goes back to what you, as an individual, is willing to accept or not, isn't it.</div>

The same way I respect other religion's basis for their belief, and I do not question or comment on that at all. Respectfully, I ask you to do the same thing.</div>
