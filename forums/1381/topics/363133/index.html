              <p>Ok ok there's a lot of disinformation out there..should a religous person be money minded and if he's not how can he build churches without money?</p>
              <p>All churches require tithing for expenses but not all members are well to do..some don't even have enough for family expenses..so let's cut the chase..the bible and pastors told us the true christians don't go for worldly possesions but in reality we are told to contribute financially as  ch as possible so why the contradication:(</p>

              Pursuing financial success is not a sin as long as you do that through honest means.
                                <br><br>
              Being wealthy is not a sin but love of money is the source of many sins.
                                <br><br>
              Jesus teaches his disciples to accumulate spiritual treasures instead of worldly treasures. Frankly speaking only a few people heed this today. But accumulating wealth is not a sin, as long as it is done through honest means imo.
                                <br><br>
              Most people forget while living that they are merely passing by in this life. None of what they've accumulated in their life actually really belongs to them. All men have that is really his own is TIME. In the end it is how you are and not what you are that counts as a man died bringing his past deeds to be judged. But one can only know this if he knows what death is like! And sadly few people even think of his own death and think they are going to live forever.
                                <br><br>
              Jesus was actually saying instead of accumulating things that you won't actually have any use later when you leave this world, accumulate things that will count for eternity instead. But the problem is life in the next world is something that is hidden from men while life on this world is something that is already known. In order to follow Jesus teaching of living a simple life one must really trust in His promises that spiritual treasures count!
                                <br><br>
              Don't give me excuses that the church needs money. Yes it does needs money but that money must serve God's purpose. There's not much mean if a church is overflown with money yet they all go to deposit. Why accumulate it?

              <p>I'm an atheist, so I don't believe in a God, but I do believe in many of the points addressed in the various religions, "accumulating spiritual treasures" being one of them. In fact, I'm one of the few crazy people who is against the concept of money. Imagine this: all forms of currency (legal tender, bank deposits) in the world disappear right now. The world pretty much ends, even though <strong>every other aspect of life remains exactly the same</strong>. That's how much we rely on a false resource.</p>
              <p>I digress. <strong>Religion (Christianity in this case) is an abstract concept that means different things to different people.</strong> To me, it's philosophy. If I were a Christian, I wouldn't go to churches (mainly because of all the bullshit religion has picked up over the centuries). I imagine simply making positive impacts on the people around me would be enough to please Him. If you truly wanted to help people, why would you need to go through a church? It's a place for worship (which you can do anywhere) and communing (which you can also do anywhere nowadays). Sometimes I feel like I'm more religious than many religious people even though I'm an atheist. Different definitions I guess.</p>
              <p>Another question to ask is how one can earn their salary by being a religious leader. It seems very contradictory to me.</p>
              <p>To sum it all up, I guess the most important part of being religious is from within. Everything else is superficial.</p>

              <p>How much percentage of donations does your city harvest use to help to build school and reach out to ppl overseas?</p>
              <p>Now you compare it with the money used to build your church and the upcoming one and the money required for maintenance of the 'high-class' facilities.</p>
              <p>WHICH ONE IS MORE? SO WHERE DOES CITY HARVEST FOCUS LIE?</p>

              <p>I just want to add a comment about these "new age" religions.</p>

              <p>My observations about them lead me to conclude that they focus more about "living now" in this material world than what happens after death like the traditional religions.</p>

              <p>Unlike the more traditional religions like Bhuddism, Christianity, Hinduism which encourage its followers to lead a good life now in order to attain a better afterlife (or the next life), these new religions encourage its followers to do good BUT for the attainment of material wealth (usually)  NOW in the followers' lives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And much of the focus is primarily on attaining wealth or material possessions , having a good healthy family/kids, career, new car, money etc.  They may not explicitly say it, but if you observe their preaching and activities, you will see what I mean.</p>

              Christianity is not a religion but it's a way of life(and I know I leave a lot to be desired, really). When it's reduced to mere religion it becomes Catholic and Protestant and others. In fact I do believe religion will not save anyone. The Pharisees of Jesus time were the most religious people in the Jewish community and Jesus spoke sternly against them. Because though they are religious their only partake in the physical aspect of what supposed to be a spiritual journey. So they may memorize the Torah, they may wash themselves for religious obligations, they may respect the sabbath and they may fast periodically but they are not spiritual people, they DON'T KNOW GOD. They are religious for the sake of being religious hence missing the point of loving God which is the first and actually the only commandment in the whole torah and bible. even loving one another must not go against loving God and instead must come from loving God.
                                                  <br><br>
              You're right we do not need to go to churches to worship and pray and glorifying God. In fact
              if we do our job well for God(meant it for God not to seek self glory) we are already glorifying His name in our work. But in order to grow spiritually one needs one another to support each other. The church is not one man it's the congragation of the people who put their faith in God. So it doesn't point to a building or attached to a religion though practically speaking the church is now has been reduced in meaning to a worship building while I believe the church is actually the people who put their faith in God.
                                                  <br><br>
              Some of the priest and pastors in Christianity(religion) swear an oath of chastity that means living simple and not accumulating wealth. While other priests and pastors are allowed to form family. When swearing to a life of celibacy and chastity one may not have the need to accumulate wealth but when a pastor has a family to feed and nurture he needs to be responsible to his family and thus he needs money more than those who swore a life of celibacy and chastity.<br><br>
              
              If you think Christianity as a religion has been contaminated by false doctrines you could always try to fight for it to return to the truth that you sincerely believe. 
              Anyway one is already a Christian if one admits that Jesus is the son of God and his savior. So if you admit that already in your heart you are a Christian even when you don't belong to any church denomination.

              <p>bible quoted</p>
              <p>"One must give with a cheerful heart"</p>
              <p>No one will force one to give</p>
              <p>I used to be in chc for 5 years</p>
              <p>I never felt that i am forced to give at all</p>
              <p>So I wonder why ppl keep on saying i am force.. to give..</p>
              <p>or worse those who never give at all also not very happy.</p>
              <p>It sounds not logical at all</p>
              <p>God bless</p>
