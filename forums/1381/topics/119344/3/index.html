It is an extremely grave sin!<br><br>Masturbation is to be understood the deliberate stimulation of the genital organs in order to derive sexual pleasure. Both the Magisterium of the Church, in the course of a constant tradition, and the moral sense of the faithful have been in no doubt and have firmly maintained that masturbation is an intrinsically and gravely disordered action.<br><br>The deliberate use of the sexual faculty, for whatever reason, outside of marriage is essentially contrary to its purpose.  For here sexual pleasure is sought outside of the sexual relationship which is demanded by the moral order and in which the total meaning of mutual self-giving and human procreation in the context of true love is achieved.<br><br>- Catechism of the Catholic Church (2351-54)<br><br>Sexuality, by means of which man and woman give themselves to one another through the acts which are proper and exclusive to spouses, is not something simply biological, but concerns the innermost being of the human person as such.  It is realized in a truly human way only if it is an integral part of the love by which a man and woman commit themselves totally to one another until death."<br><br>- Catechism of the Catholic Church (2360-61)<br><br>Sexuality is ordered to the conjugal love of man and woman.<br>In marriage the physical intimacy of the spouses becomes a sign and pledge of spiritual communion.</div>

U can say jaywalking is against the law yet even police jaywalk themselves.

Withdrawal and other form of birth control has NOTHING to do with masturbation. Masturbation DOES not involve another partner and just themselves. Saying masturbation is the same as withdrawal is the same as taking drug is the same as taking chewing gums. Was Onan interested in pleasing himself only ? He seems to be punshed just because he do not want his offspring to be his dead brother ones and thus disobeying god thus was punished.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so whenever he lay with his brother's wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from producing offspring for his brother.</span><br><br><blockquote>Let me tell you, masturbation is contrary to the natural law, because it is selfish. You care only for your own pleasure when you do it</blockquote>And wat harm does it done ? Can u say when u play video games, u r selfish and do it for your own pleasure and therefore a sin ?  Why deprive yourself from pleasure when it does no harm ? Is animal natural ? Animals do masturbate themselves as well. If it is sinful, than god will never have build them as such so they can masturbate.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Animals too masturbate by forelimbs or by rubbing their penis against the trees or such objects.</span><br><br><a href="http://www.sexualcounselling.com/masturbation.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexualcounselling.com/masturbation.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>masturbation is just "commiting spiritual adultery "</blockquote>Frankly speaking masturbaion is not equivalent to "spiritual aultery". (If I am not wrong u must be talking about jesus words on committing adultery just by looking or thinking) However there r people who can commit the act on fiction character from <span style="font-style: italic;">certain stories or "anime"</span> etc. Can u commit adultery to a fiction character ? Can u "murder" a fiction character even if u try ?<br><br>Secondly, can u "commit adultery" to a willing party ? Frankly if u ask any good looking celebrity, all of them know it is inevitable some people will use them as object for "spiritual adultery". However do u think they care ? They don't as it will not do any harm to them anyway.<br><br><blockquote>Don't Christian churches teach about pro-life? </blockquote>Lets be practical. If the sole breadwinner of the family only earns $800 per month, u cannot expect him to raise 5-6 children. Giving birth to unwanted children, or unable to take care of them is a sin of its own. Is using contraceptive killing anything ? Hardly since sperm and egg are cells not living things. If u r talking about pure pro-life, then the priest or sister should try to conceive before their egg cycle ends or waste the sperm in wet dreams.<br><br>BTW which passage in the scripture suggest contraceptive is a sin ?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>We do not know how the future of those unwanted pregnancies or African children will turn out,therefore we cannot assume all of them will die in misery</blockquote>It is statistically true tat a large number of them will die in hunger or sickness at a very young age. If u cannot provide food and drink for your baby and u still give birth to them, it is second degree infanticide. Wat is the difference between giving birth to a baby and give him nothing to eat and thus die a slow agonising death or throwing them down a rubbish chute ? The one tat die in the rubbish chute dies a quicker death. When u use contraceptive, no harm has been doen to anyone or any being. The sperms and eggs r nothing more than cells, much like the skin or hair on your body. Why decide to kill off living beings just because u want some cells to be more useful ? They will die anyway after a period of time and they r reproduced everyday as well.<br><br><blockquote>The Catholic church counsels couples before marrige on family planning without the use of contraceptives. </blockquote>It is scientifically proven tat it is not effective. The most useful way to prevent unnecessary birth is the use of contraceptives<br><br><blockquote>But, if you do not give a chance to the some who might have a great future is it fair to them? </blockquote>If u give birth to them, and no miracles occured and they die a slow and agonising death. Is it fair for them ?<br><br><blockquote>This is where education comes into play, obviously our education system has failed in this aspect</blockquote>Tis is a worldwide phenomenon. If our education system fails, then it meant the whole world education system fails as well. I want to hear the solution, not hear blames.<br><br><blockquote>First off all sex is meant to create new life. When a husband and wife get married they indicate that they want to create a new family, therefore children would be a sign of this new family. </blockquote>If enough new lives were created, does tat means the end of all sexual activities ? God made sexual activity to be enjoyable, yet u all stop it from proceeding ? Furthermore there is nothing in the bible tat says masturbation or contraceptives cannot be used. U want to follow the church orders blindly ? Who knows maybe u will follow crusades or burn your next door neighbour when u believe she is a witch if u obey church orders during the past.<br><br><blockquote>Its all right for husband and wife to enjoy sex but they must be fully aware that sex is meant to procreate</blockquote>U admit it is enjoyable. In today society sexual activity between spouses is an important consideration in maintaining a happy marriage. Contraceptive is a good solution to have a cake and eat it. Why stop it ?<br><br><blockquote>Why do children starve in Africa? Is it because there are too many people? Or is it because that the world cannot produce enough food?<br><br>No!<br><br>The world has more than enough food! The problem is the severely uneven distribution of food.

Or food is withheld from starving populations as a tool of political warfare and discrimatory policies?<br><br>But no, instead of giving these nations food and medicine, we teach them contraception and birth control. They will not solve the problem of starvation? </blockquote>Tat is beside the point. SO wat if the world has an uneven distribution of food ? It is a fact some african nation cannot get enough food ! It is a fact tat babies do starve to death there ! There is no way u can change tat fact ! There is no way u can make the rich nations give out food to them regularly ! If u live there, would u use contraceptive to prevent birth or give birth to babies and let them die miserably ? Which is better ?<br><br><blockquote>Does that have to do with the Catholic Church</blockquote>Does catholic churches banned the use of contraceptives ? If yes, then it do affect the populaton control for philipines since it is their main religion.<br><br></div>
