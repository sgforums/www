No offence to Muslims and Buddhists friends here. I'm only speaking in Christian context here. </blockquote>Phillipines is a catholic nation. Catholic ban contraceptives. Catholic ban abortion. These 2 policies will make population control difficult. Isn't the best way to curb over population is to prevent unwanted or unplanned birth ? Some people mention china before and statistically speaking, they have performed a miracle in their population control. They have to use contraceptives to prevent overpopulation. If u can't use them, there is no way chinese is going to succeed in controling population. If u talk about whether should muslim or buddhist go into phillipines, frankly it is out of point and nothing to do with the population control there.<br><br><blockquote>And what do you know about what the Catholic Church do about the overpopulation?

These people will take these words as law and obey them. They do make an impact to the population control. Natural famly planning dosn't work effectively. Tis is proven by science. If phillipines is a country with lesser catholic impact, I expect them not to have any problems using contraceptive and people will use them happily to prevent unwanted birth.<br><br><blockquote>To all anti-Catholics, contraceptives help to control population.

Do u think without contraceptive a modern day youngster will live a "christian" life ? Tis is a world wide trend tat even america and british, the country tat have the most number of christian faces. CAtholic have banned it all these years, but the problems only get worse isn't it ?<br><br>Banning contraceptives in order to stop pre-marital sex is like cutting the use of medicated chewing gums in order to stop smoking. Medicated chewing gums is meant to lower the problem of smoking. Contraceptives is meant to cushion the blows of pre-marital sex. Banning contraceptives just make the problem of pre-marital sex worse.<br><br>If u want to blame, blame the people and not the tool. The one who commit murder is the person, not the gun. Don't u think tat u r giving them a killing blow by preventing the use of contraceptive ? They probably live a less christian life if they got pregnant because they can't use contraceptive, and may end up doing irrational things such as kiling the baby or themselves.<br></div>

Lack of contraceptives will not totally eliminate such behaviours, but it does help to reduce.  Birth control will make it easy for anyone to engage in such act, in fact too easy.  A secondary school boy can easily walk to a 7-11 shop to buy a pack of condom and do what he wants to do with his girlfriend.  But if there is no such thing available, do you think they will dare to do foolish things together?  Most of the time, one of them will raise the question "What if something goes wrong?"<br><br>If we want to reduce/discourage promiscuity, we have to start from somewhere.

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting topic that turned into a discussion on birth control. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by plo30360:</div><div class="quote_body">When people are allowed to use contraceptives, they tend to think only about the enjoyment factor of sex(SIS's remark about having your cake),therefore it degrades the  party you are having sex with because that person then becomes merely a pleasure toy.<br></div></blockquote>By your own reasoning, to you sex is juz for "making babies"?<br><br>So u treat ur partner as a baby making machine? And only have sex when u want to have babies huh?<br><br>To u, the topic is about "having sex"... some people call it "making love", do u know why? It is one of the many ways people express their love for each other, to feel close to each other, and it is a very natural thing to do. "Intercourse" is also a very good word = meaning communication and connection between people. So u see, "SEX" is not all about getting or giving pleasure, there are alot of emotional, etc reasons to "MAKE LOVE".<br><br>"The Catholic church also teaches abstainance and when are the certain periods to have sex without getting a baby. "<br><br>This is interesting. And u said its not about the menstral cycle? Please let us know more?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Juz a real life story to share wif u guys.<br><br>I had a Catholic friend who had heart problems and was advised by doctors not to get pregnant. However, becoz of her religious background, she (and hubby) did not use contraceptives and very soon after her marriage, she got pregnant. Doctors tell her that it is extremely dangerous for her if she were to give birth becoz of her weak heart, and advised her many times to abort the baby. She wouldn't, becoz its against her beliefs.<br><br>Guess what?<br><br>She died.<br><br>Baby too.<br><br></div>
