            <div class='col-md body'>There is one thing I am not clear about and I hope to be enlightened.<br><br>Many have been said about Jesus being sinless, that's why he could carry all our sins on the cross .. blah blah<br><br>But just what do we mean when we say He is sinless? Is he sinless by virtue of being the Son? Or is his mortal life really sinless and blameless?<br><br>If he is really sinless, then there is absolutely no "thoughts" of those kind when he sees ladies like Mary and Maria, or the prostitute.

            <div class='col-md body'>Another question is what actions are considered sinful? Meaning you sin when you commit those acts (think stealing things) or thoughts ( think spiritual adultery).<br><br>Other than the Decalogue, I suppose disobeying the commands in Leviticus and Deuteronomy also put a person into a sinful state? So Jesus never went against those commands?<br><br></div>

It could be that he just couldn't  fathom how Jesus is Human yet He didn't sin. Maybe he's not questioning Jesus integrity but unable to understand that though Jesus is born in flesh yet He is totally God too, therefore,  He is sinless. As Jesus took on the human flesh, He's being tempted just like any human yet not sin. With is why the Bible said: "  <strong>THEREFORE, SINCE WE HAVE A GREAT HIGH PRIEST WHO HAS GONE THROUGH THE HEAVENS, JESUS THE SON OF GOD, LET US HOLD FIRMLY TO THE FAITH WE PROFESS. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">FOR WE DO NOT HAVE A HIGH PRIEST WHO IS UNABLE TO SYMPATHIZE WITH OUR WEAKNESSES, BUT WE HAVE ONE WHO HAS BEEN TEMPTED IN EVERY WAY, JUST AS WE ARE - YET WAS WITHOUT SIN.</span> (Hebrew 4:14-15)<br></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by burntan:</div><div class="quote_body">BTW, why a thought of "sex" is a sin?</div></blockquote>Sex is something beautiful. It somehow became 'sinful', because of what Man has done.<br><br>It depends on what you mean by thinking about sex. For example your research paper is about sex. If you don't think then how are you going to do your paper? But fantasising about it is a different story. That is sin.<br><br>You see, when we sin, it is not only an issue between us and God. It is also an issue with us and the people around us. We do not merely sin against God, but against others too. Perverse thoughts are sinful, because you are not respecting the dignity of the person. Each person is made in the image of God, and has dignity. We all have dignity.<br><br>Perverse thoughts may also lead you to commit other sins; masturbation, pornography,  and God forbid, rape.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First Commandment: I am the Lord your God, you shall not have other Gods beside me.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;1) Gods such as Money, Sex, Power, Fast Cars, the list goes on. Anti-Christian practices also included.<br><br>Second Commandment: You shall not use GodÂ’s name in vain.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;2)  Basically, donÂ’t say God d*mnit or f*&amp;^ God. DonÂ’t swear false oaths.<br>Also, keep your vulgarities to a minimum.<br><br>Third Commandment: Remember to keep holy the Sabbath day.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;3) Go to church on Sunday.<br><br>Fourth Commandment: Honour your Father and Mother<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;4) Also refers to your family members. And authority figures.<br><br>Fifth Commandment: You shall not kill.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;5) No abortion. No euthanasia. No suicide.<br><br>Sixth Commandment: You shall not steal.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;6) Intellectual Property also included.<br><br>Seventh Commandment: You shall not commit adultery.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;7) Also means no sex out of marriage, no lust, no porno.<br><br>Eighth Commandment: You shall not bear false witness against your neighbour.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;8 ) DonÂ’t tell lies that can get people in serious trouble.<br><br>Ninth Commandment: You shall not covet your neighbourÂ’s wife.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;9) Similar to Seventh Commandment. This commandment focuses on modesty. DonÂ’t dress indecently. And definitely donÂ’t have affairs with your friendÂ’s wife!<br><br>Tenth Commandment: You shall not covet your neighbourÂ’s goods.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;10) For example, if I covet my friendÂ’s car, IÂ’ll do all it takes to get a car like his, to a point where it becomes an obsession. It is perfectly all right to work hard at your job to get money to buy a car like that, but in the process if it affects your duty to your family and to God, then it is a sin.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If jesus was human, he had already sinned. Why ? First he was borned. If u r a normal human, u have already sinned. U got to carry the original sin your ancestor like adam have. Second, when he was a baby without thought, he had already sinned. Why ? Because he cannot think of god with all his heart and soul since he can't even think coherrently. Third, if wrath was a sin, it was a sin he committed often. He was found cursing some priest who do not believe he was the son of god when he prove it to them. He was also showing wrath to the pharisees as well as to peter when he cry out to be careful. Jesus also was found lying when he tell his disciples he will not be going for some event yet secretly go over without telling them. He also lie when he states tat some of the people who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom. In the end they all die. Jesus tell people not to do acts of righteous in front of men and seen by them, yet he was the one tat did the most. WHen his disciples eat grain from a field, he defended his action and say tat he is son of god so they can eat watever they want. Jesus is also found not loving his neighbour when some crows peck the eyes of one of the person who was crucifixed with him just because he say something bad to him. And finally, in his own inspired book he claims he was sinless. Accordingly to one of his story, tat is arrogance and it is a sin. He encourage people to hit their slaves if they r disobedient. Tat is a sin<br><br>If u read through the new testament, u can find sins he committed if u want. But yet he was declared sinless. U know why ? Because he set the system himself. He say u sin means u sin. He say he doesn't sin means he doesn't sin. Watever u do doesn't matter. The only thing tat matters is whether he like u or not.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, What stupidssmart just said is true to some extent, but not about Jesus.<br>Mary, his mother, was sinless (immaculate), at The Christ's conception. Which meant that neither the sin of adam (he only had God as a father) which is passed through the father wasn't there, nor just regular old sin of the person having the baby was there. This does not necissarily mean that Mary was sinless her whole life but she was sinless when Jesus was born. but anyway, he had no sin from the start. He then fufilled many prophicies that he was God the savior. The lamb of God. The sacrifice for the sins of the world. He also lived a perfect life, and he stood as sin for us. It was really impropable that he fufilled all the prophices and that he is God. He still is was and will be sinless.</div>
