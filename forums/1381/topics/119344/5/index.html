Doctors tell her that it is extremely dangerous for her if she were to give birth becoz of her weak heart, and advised her many times to abort the baby. She wouldn't, becoz its against her beliefs.<br><br>Guess what?<br><br>She died.<br><br>Baby too.<br><br></div></blockquote>Did the church stop her from abortion?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>U blame tis trend all on secular gov and health agencies ? And wat is your definition of natural family planning ? Isn't tat abstaining from sex ? Com'on, I believe your dad and mum probably taught u about using natural planning and abstaining from sex, like most of the parents do to their child. They probably do it for the whole of their life. How effective is it ? Even parents fail to convince their child from "natural family" planning. Why do u think gov can do any better ? If education is all tat good, then we wouldn't have smokers, drivers tat speed or criminals. We have been educating people not to smoke, speed or commit crimes for donkeys years ! How effective is it ?<br><br>BTW, the gov do tell peopel to abstain from sex AND at the same time promote the use of contraceptive if u really need to do it. Isn't it better to teach 2 important lessons than 1<br></blockquote>You miss my point, if everybody around you were to tell you about natural family <strong>not just parents</strong>, I doubt anyone can remain unconvinced and I also think the effectiveness of natural family planning would increase.<br><br><blockquote><br>Wat u want to say is probably tis: If u do not want to have unplanned birth, then don't have sex. It is linked to the fact tat u do nto want happily married couples to have sex since they probably will cause an "accident" and give birth too many<br></blockquote>No, that is not what I want to say. Please do not rephrase my quotes.<br><br><blockquote><br>Oh really ? I have a brother I like and occasionally he drive me around singapore when it is convenient for him. So am I treating him like a driver ? I have a friend who help me when I was in need. So I treat him nothing more than a helper ? Lets say I have a girlfriend which I love a lot and we both enjoy sex together, so I am treating her nothing but a pleasure toy ? The u r probably treating your mum as a washer when she wash clothes for u when u r young and your dad as poopie cleaner since he help u clean your diapers. U r making it sound more serious than it actually is<br></blockquote><blockquote><br>But the logic is the same isn't it ? U r depriving the lives of potential people by wasting these "seeds" in wet dreams. They could have a chance to be successful and happy men but u choose to kill them by not putting it inside a woman body. Why is it wrong to kill these potential people when using contraceptives and right when u kill them in wet dreams ?<br></blockquote>I will answer these when I answer Poopie-head's post.<br><br><blockquote><br>In 99.99% of your previous examples, if the baby really did die of starvation, then haven't u already ruin a life ? Aren't u lowering the survival rate of your other relatives when u give food for tis baby who never did manage to live<br></blockquote>You often quote statistics, then you must know that even before egg is fertilized what are the chances it will be a successful fertilization and the embryo will begin to live. The fact that so many of us are born show already that some  humans regardless of thier circumstance will find a way to live.<br><br><blockquote><br>And about poor people, u get the whole picture wrong. I did not say people shouldn't have babies, I am saying they don't deserve unplanned birth because of some impractical rules. Even if u r rich, they couldn't afford to give birth to unplanned births since they can't afford the emotion attention.<br></blockquote>The birth would not be unplanned if in the first place they were to have sex responsibily and use natural family planning.<br><br><blockquote><br>The point is regardless of contraceptives, people will make love. In fact they find using contraceptives a hassle and prefer to do without. Your point tat contraceptive promote more sex is wrong. "shortest and cheapest way" ? Isn't tat also named as "effective" way ? So u promote ineffectiveness ? So christians prefer life to go through life the hard way ?<br></blockquote>I don't understand this point, could you reword it for me? Thanks<br><br><blockquote><br>Please suggest something practical, not idealistic<br></blockquote>How did democracy come about? It was the lofty dreams of idealistic humans. Till today a perfect form of democracy does not exist. But does that mean people who have experinced the impure forms of democracy abandon it?<br><br>In, the same way the education of people in this aspect may be a lofty or considered idealistic but does that mean we don't even borther to try?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When have I ever said sex is only meant for making babies.<br><br>Once let me borrow some material from JWorld to show you the catholic perspective:<br><br><blockquote><br>Why is the Catholic Church opposed to birth control? Where in the Bible is birth control condemned as being contrary to the Will of God?<br>The Catholic Church is not oppose to birth control when it is accomplished by natural means, by self control. She is opposed only to birth control by artificial means, by the employment of pills, condoms, IUD's, foams, jellies, sterilization, non-completion of the act of sexual unionÂ—or any other means used to prevent conception from resulting from this act, because such means profane the marital embrace and dishonour the marriage contract. God slew Onan for practising contraception (Gen. 38:9-10); the word "onanism" derives from Onan's deed. In fact, up until the Church of England's Lambeth Conference of 1930, which accepted contraception and thus broke with the Christian tradition, contraception had been considered wrong by all Christian churches. The Catholic Church does not feel free to change the law of God, as do Protestants.<br><br>In the New Testament, there is only one instance where sin is punished by God with immediate death; this was the fate of Ananias and Saphira, a husband and wife who went through the motions of giving a gift to God but fraudulently kept back part of it. The Bible says they lied to the Holy Spirit. (Acts 5:1-11). In contraception, two people go through the motion of an act of self-giving, but obstruct the natural fruition of their act, i.e., the conception of children, which is the ultimate purpose for which God created sexuality. Sexual union is a gift from God to the married, but by practising contraception, married couples are accepting the pleasure God built into the act and yet denying Him its purpose, new people. They are in effect mocking God. But "Be not deceive, God is not mocked." (Gal. 6:7). Christ cursed the fig tree which, despite a fine external appearance, bore no fruit. (Matt. 21:19; Mark 11;14). Marriage is God's plan for populating Heaven, yet contracepting couples refuse Him the specific fruit of their marriage, which is children, when they engage in the act which should produce children yet frustrate the natural, God-intended result.<br><br>Further, the sin of "sorceries" or "witchcrafts" ("pharmakeia" in the GreekÂ—Gal. 5:20; Apoc. 9:21; 21:Â—which the Bible condemns along with fornicating, murder, idolatry, and other serious sinsÂ—very possibly includes secret portions mixed to prevent pregnancy or cause abortion. Such potions were known and used even in the first century.<br><br>Common sense and conscience both dictate that artificial birth control is not only a violation of the Natural Law but is a perfidious insult to the dignity of man himself. For it implies free reign to physical impulses; it implies total disregard for the fate of the human seed; it implies utter contempt for the honorable birth of fellow humans, those fellow humans who are born as the result of a contraceptive having failed and whose very existence is therefore considered to be an unfortunate "accident," rather than a gift of God; it implies the most extreme selfishness, for no advocate or practitioner of artificial birth control would have wanted it for his or her own parents. Further, contraception undermines the respect of husband and wife for each other and thereby loosens the marriage body. Worst of all, many "contraceptives," such as the IUD and most if not all birth control pills, work by actually causing an abortion early in the pregnancy; thus, this so-called "contraception" is in reality abortionÂ—the killing of a human beingÂ—rather than the preventing of conception.<br><br>In every age there is some favourite sin which is accepted by "respectable" worldly Christians; in our times the "acceptable" sin is contraceptionÂ—a sin which fits in perfectly with the view that the purpose of human life is to attain earthly happiness. The true Christian couple, on the other hand, will realize that God desires them to have children so that these children can come to know Him and love Him and be happy with Him eternally in Heaven. Marriage is God's plan for populating Heaven. How wise it is to let God plan one's family, since He loves children much more than do their earthly parents, and His plans for them go far beyond any plans of these parents. Innumerable stories are told of God's Providence to CHRISTIAN parents who trusted in Him and obeyed His law. For those who have a true and serious need to space or limit the number of their children, the new methods of natural family planning based on periodic abstinence have proved to be extremely reliable (unlike the earlier "rhythm" methods).<br><br>Finally, the Christian will realize that the self denial involved in bearing and raising Christian children is a school of Christ-likeness. Our Lord said: "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me." (Matt. 16:24). But He also said: "My yoke is sweet and my burden light." (Matt. 11:30). God promises sufficient grace to those who seek to obey Him. And the resulting peace of soul which the obedient married couple enjoys is beyond all price.<br></blockquote></div>

U mean he do not like men to have a pleasurable life ? WHy don't u think it is tis way, since god love men, he will want to make life of men more happy. He designed sex to be pleasurable as a gift to men and therefore we should accept this gift and have sex as frequent as we can.

How EXACTLY do they work to PREVENT any pregnancy?<br><br>Periodic abstinence = no sex at all for a period of time? Well, it makes sense, since no sex = no pregnancy.

However, i still wonder - are these PSC's own guidelines, or are they accepted by all Catholics and their Churches? Are these guidelines conveyed to every Catholic so that all of them are aware?<br><br></div></blockquote>No, PSC or any Catholic group doesn't set its own guideline for people.  It reports to the church.  So it will only apply whatever the church teaches.<br><br>They are made known to the Catholics thru talks, classes and sometimes even during sermons (depending on the priest and the gospel reading for that Mass).  But then, some of the Catholics may not remember everything.  So it is best for the individual to consult the Priests directly.  The Priests are always there and their doors are always open for people.<br><br>As for the lady friend that you mentioned, I believe it's her own decision, not the church.  Many women, due their maternal instinct, choose to take that kind of risks to have children of their own.  If the church stops her from the abortion, which could have saved her life, I'm sure her husband who has loved her so much would have taken some legal actions against the church by now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>The church does allow abortion if the pregnancy is harmful to both the mother and the child </blockquote>can they use contraceptive then ? Or r they forced to use "natural family planning" forever ? If they r allowed to use contraceptive, does the wife start to distrust his husband or think she will be treated as a mere "pleasure tool" ?<br><br><blockquote>As for the lady friend that you mentioned, I believe it's her own decision, not the church</blockquote>I don't think it is fair to push all the blame on the lady herself. He religion must have some effect on her final decision. Imagine a person who is very devout to her religion and she keeps hearing from the priest the problems of abortion, or contaceptive and labeling abortion/contraceptive as murder, parents should take chances, even if it is only 0.001 percent he baby will live and let god who is merciful to decide their fate etc etc etc, it is going to affect her judgement. She will try to push for it despite facing a high risk because she thought it was the right thing to do according to her religion.</div>
