            <div class='col-md body'>All churches have stewards and auditors to count their offering each week. There is always a procedure in which moneys are handled. This really isn't very controversial or difficult to understand.<br><br>The difficulty, which is what I think this thread is all about, is the spending of this money.<br><br>Church money goes towards the following categories (non-exhaustive list.)<br><br>Salaries and wages - for pastors and church admin staff. Depending on church organisations, some has a wage structure because such churches are part of a larger organisation, ie Methodist and Anglican. Others are mega churches that may not need to answer to any higher bodies. This will probably rely on the board of governors to determine.<br><br>Administration - the regular bills, electricity, water cleaning etc. Usually taken care by the church building committee.<br><br>Missionary - contribution to missionaries and various ministry.<br><br>The red-tape in churches can be as bad as any other organisations.<br><br>The point is, at the background, there is no greedy individual with a evil laughter in a locked room somewhere in a church glaring a the offering bag each week. Most churches are not run by an individual.<br><br>When I said that those who want to find dirt will always find it, I do not mean that Christians are not vigilant when handling our own folks, we are extemely vigilant and I have been in committees that scrutinise an individual's expense voucher.<br><br>I meant that for anyone looking for negative aspect on anything that they do not agree on will always find it. So let's all be objective.</div>

Pastors making scandals have been so disgraced that they lost their church or ministry or integrity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I never meant ppl can not make mistakes and can not be forgiven. However, these ppl are not ordinary ppl  like you or me. They are ppl shouldering great responsibilities and have the trust of a lot of ppl.<br><br>Here's an example: If an ordinary citizen like you go Gelyang to spend a night with the china girl, it's no big deal or no one will ever bother. However, if our PM been caught sleeping with a prostitute, it will be a national scandal for sure. The difference is their social status and their responsibility to the number of ppl.<br><br>Pastors who commits crimes just misplace the trust their followers place in them and this is no matter that we can just close 1 eye. Remember, they are ppl we look up to, ppl who we supposed them to be morally upright.</div>

A post like yours might be directed at the wrong people. However, I can see the good intentions you have in this post. Which is pretty different from many of your other posts about Christians.<br><br>You should post like this more often.</div>
