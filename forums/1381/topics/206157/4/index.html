The plaintiff will have to prove damage to his reputation and more importantly, demonstrate that the damage is due to his ex-communication. I do not think many businessmen would care about your doctrinal views when deciding who to do business with, anymore than which football team you support.</blockquote>The damage was already done before the ex-communication.<br><br><blockquote>A DIFFERENCE in opinion over theology has escalated into a church-goer suing his pastors for defaming him in church.<br><br>Mr Lim Seng Hoo, a member of the Calvary Pandan Bible-Presbyterian Church since 1996, claims its leaders - senior pastor Tow Siang Hwa and pastor Quek Suan Yew - have tarnished his reputation.<br><br><strong>In March, the church's Board of Elders barred the 50-year-old businessman from all church services for six months, when the threat of a lawsuit against them looked imminent. </strong><br><br>The dispute arose from a translation of the Bible, the King James version, which the Pandan Gardens church has used for 27 years.<br><br>Over 20 English versions of the Bible exist. Some of the more widely used ones here are the New International and New Jerusalem versions.<br><br>Mr Lim, who read theology in a local bible college, believes the King James Bible - widely thought by theologians as the most accurate - is not as perfect as his pastors claim.<br><br><strong>He made his view known to 60 church members following church service in July last year</strong>, by handing out copies of a petition for a public debate on the issue; he also e-mailed other church members.<br><br>Stinging responses came from the pastors via e-mail, church bulletins and sermons, which he felt hurt his standing as a businessman and a devout Christian.<br><br><strong>In his statement of claim against the pastors, he said they had repeatedly run him down in church in front of people with whom his firm may have business dealings. </strong>His company distributes metrological instruments to the region.<br><br>In their written defence, the pastors, who have hired Harry Elias Partnership to represent them, said any damage to Mr Lim's reputation had been brought about by himself and that their actions had 'no consequence on his trade reputation'.<br><br>Mr Lim, who will be represented by Mr Chia Boon Teck and Ms Jamie Seah of Khattar Wong Partnership, claims his church friends have shunned him and discriminated against his four children.<br><br>He told The Straits Times that taking up a civil suit was a 'last resort', especially since he regarded senior pastor Tow as a father figure.<br><br>In the course of the dispute, he said, the insults had grown sharper. He listed some made by the pastors, which he felt caused him 'serious injury'. In particular, he was upset at being likened to Satan and referred to as an 'evil and sinister enemy'.<br><br>Senior pastor Tow said in his written defence: 'It is the teaching of the Bible that any attack on the members of the church and the pastors would be seen as a satanic attack, as Satan is the mastermind behind all disturbances within the church.'<br><br>He added that as senior pastor and church founder, he had to shield his flock from incorrect, divisive doctrines.<br><br><strong>Mr Lim is also asking the court to quash his suspension from church, which he alleges was aimed at stopping him from presenting the church's accounts, which he audited.<br><br>He also claims to have found 'questionable' flows of about $450,000 from the church funds to the pastors. </strong><br><br>Pastor Quek said Mr Lim had broken his vows to the church to submit to its leaders and not raise divisive issues.<br><br>In a statement to this newspaper, church elders said he failed to attend six counselling sessions following his suspension.<br><br><span style="color: red;">The statement also said it was a 'very sad day' when a church member took to suing his own pastors: 'Such an action is against the clear teaching of Jesus Christ in God's Holy and perfect Word.' </span></blockquote>Read the parts in bold.<br><br>I think the church leadership already tried to run him down between july last year and his ex-communication this march. Furthermore I think we missed the part about the church account also. Notice he was the auditor.<br><br><blockquote>That is hard enough but on top of that, it is difficult to refute the defence argument that the BP church was only exercising its right to discipline a member who by his continued membership submits to the teaching of the church.</blockquote>I think this is missing the point. The whole thing is about defamation isn't it?<br><br>The part in red is a joke. Do they mean to tell me their action of gunning him down is very Christ-like?<br><br>Notice the church leadership never deny the allegation, in their written defence - "any damage to Mr Lim's reputation had been brought about by himself and that their actions had 'no consequence on his trade reputation'"<br><br>They never categorically deny those actions.</div>

It is true that later translations had access to older manuscripts but as I said, the BP church objects to the participation of scholars who take a more liberal doctrinal view. Rightly or wrongly, they feel that they cannot accept other translations where a 'liberal' scholar has participated as the translation would have been tainted by liberal doctrines.<br><br><blockquote><strong>I think this is missing the point.

The defence has not refuted the allegation. Their defence is likely on the grounds of fair comment on a doctrinal matter that has been the position of the BP church for years.
