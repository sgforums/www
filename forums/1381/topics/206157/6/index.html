As a doctor, I suggest you calm down...you are at risk of hypertension and heart disease.<br><br>Clearly the plaintiff has deviated from the orthodox teaching of the BP church on this issue and the defence will probably argue that it is their duty to fight heresies within the church. Therefore the BP church will probably rely on the defence of justification, that it is substantially true that the plaintiff had committed heresy against a long-established doctrine of the church he has chosen to associate with.<br><br>Secondly, the BP church could also argue that it was fair comment on a matter of 'public' interest within the BP church. If the pastors' criticisms of the plaintiff, however harsh or cruel, were disseminated only within the confines of the church or its internal publication, then they could rely on the defence of fair comment. That it was a matter of interest within the church can hardly be disputed, since it touched on a core doctrine of the BP church. As long as the pastors limited their criticisms within the church member population, they can rely on this second defence.<br><br>Much depends on what was said. It would be factual for the church to say that the plaintiff was a heretic for the reasons above. It would not be factual and definitely not a valid defence if the BP church had alleged that he was a wife-beater, adulterer or a cheat. The court will have to examine the facts of the case to give a just verdict.<br><br>Do you know the facts of the case? Do you know exactly what the BP church leaders said? Are you pre-judging the BP church by yourself alleging that the defendant had attacked the plaintiff's integrity? That's the plaintiff's allegation but the court has yet to come to a verdict. Until then, such matters are subjudice and I suggest we should leave that to the proper authorities.<br><br>My comment in this matter only went as far as the actions of the plaintiff when the conflict began.

I do believe that those remarks to "gun him down" were hurting to the platintiff, but like you said, it is up to the court to decide whether there is defamation.<br><br>But I was ranting on was the hypocrisy by the church leaders.<br><br>Note that the Holy and Perfect Word of Christ is, at times, at variance with our law. Christ says you commit adultery when no judge in the world will convict you of adultery.<br><br>So the law says 'fair comment' .. but I say those 'fair comments' are not Christ-like behaviour.<br><br>That the KJV is the uncorrupted word of God is not a matter of faith in the biblical sense. It is an intellectual issue which can be discussed and debated on the round table.<br><br>If one maintain that the KJV is uncorrupted and other translations are corrupted, then he or she has to prove it. Prove it to the plaintiff. Prove it to the congregation. I suspect many BPs just take it at face value; they never question this doctrine, or should I say dogma.<br><br>The plaintiff was only asking for a public debate .. of which the outcome is still unclear.</div>
