It is true that later translations had access to older manuscripts but as I said, the BP church objects to the participation of scholars who take a more liberal doctrinal view. Rightly or wrongly, they feel that they cannot accept other translations where a 'liberal' scholar has participated as the translation would have been tainted by liberal doctrines.</div></blockquote>But this has nothing to do with whoever translated the other versions. Even if KJV is the only version today, it is not as perfect anymore, due to progress in biblical scholarship.<br><br>I never tell them to accept other translations. I tell them to acknowlege their most cherished translation is not perfect anymore. Is this so hard?<br><br><blockquote>An allegation is not the same as defamation. The defence has not refuted the allegation. Their defence is likely on the grounds of fair comment on a doctrinal matter that has been the position of the BP church for years. They will also show that there was no damage and if there had been any damage, it was not caused by the doctrinal dispute with the church.<br><br>Whether their actions were Christ-like or not has nothing to do with a legal dispute.</blockquote>Fair comments? Doctrinal matter?<br><br><blockquote>In his statement of claim against the pastors, he said they had repeatedly run him down in church in front of people with whom his firm may have business dealings.</blockquote>I didn't know running people down is fair comment and a doctrinal matter.<br><br>True, their actions has nothing to do with a legal dispute, but it just shows how hypocritical some church leaders can be.</div>

Is this so hard to understand? </div></blockquote>I never say my translation is not corrupted. By definition, as long as your are not reading the original manuscript in the original language, your bible is corrupted.<br><br>I can give you one example since I was discussing Genesis one on EH:<br><br>The Hebrew for Genesis 1:5 goes something like this - Vayikra Elohim la-or yom velachoshech kara laylah vayehi-erev vayehi-voker yom echad.<br><br>KJV claims to be a literal translation - And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.<br><br>Exactly how "yom echad" can become "first day" is beyond my understanding. The literal translation of "echad" is one, as evident in the Shema - Sh'ma Yisrael Adonai Elohaynu Adonai Echad.<br><br>The KJV is uncorrupted? PUI ..<br><br>I don't think it is opinion anymore. We are not arguing whether signing hillsongs is biblical. I am arguing for the KJV to be placed on equal standing with other translations since all words are filtered through the pens of the translators. And none of the translators is god-inspired, this idea is unbiblical.<br><br>Once again, no-one is asking them to renounce Christ. Is this so hard to understand?<br><br><blockquote><strong>Dude, this is a legal dispute before the law courts...the question is defamation, not a doctrinal dispute before an ecclesiastical court.</strong></blockquote>exactly. the question is defamation. The court is probably not interested in doctrinal sparring between the lawyers and expert witnesses. but this was what you wrote - <span style="font-style: italic;">Their defence is likely on the grounds of fair comment on a doctrinal matter that has been the position of the BP church for years.</span><br><br><blockquote><strong>Hypocritical? The BP church would probably say that on the contrary, they have remained faithful to their doctrines. Those who hold heretical views ought to be ex-communicated if they would not repent. </strong></blockquote>Let me show you the fallacious logic:<br><br><blockquote>The statement also said it was a 'very sad day' when a church member took to suing his own pastors: 'Such an action is against the clear teaching of Jesus Christ in God's Holy and perfect Word.' </blockquote>Questions:<br><br>1. Where is the basis that the KJV is the only and uncorrupted Word found in God's Holy and perfect Word?<br><br>2. When did arguing otherwise (that the KJV is corrupted just like any translation) become a heresy according to clear teaching of Jesus Christ in God's Holy and perfect Word?<br><br>If they endorse your suggested reply, then they really are hypocrites beyond any hypocrisy.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Again, I am not a BP and I do not share their doctrinal views. But I will defend their right to hold those views within the boundaries of the law. But maybe that is also too hard for you to understand? </strong></blockquote>Please enlighen me how come BP can endorse something unbiblical as their doctrine?<br><br>IMHO .. they have shot themselves on the foot.<br><br>If there is ever a verbal sparring on doctrine in court, I see how they are going to get out of this mess.<br><br>It will be the Scopes Trial in reverse.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

There is no issue that the grounds of ex-communication is due to doctrinal difference. The court will not have to decide which doctrine is right and is not competent to judge that issue anyway. All that the court has to decide is whether it is fair comment for the pastor to point out the plaintiff's deviation from the church's doctrines. That the plaintiff deviated from the church's doctrine is clear from the newspaper report and is also not in dispute. So all the court has to decide is whether it is fair comment for church leaders to point out and warn its members against a deviant teaching among its own members. The question may arise as to whether the church can ex-communicate its own members. I dare say that courts will rule that ex-communication is a religious issue and does not contravene any existing secular laws.<br><br></div>
