            <div class='col-md body'>An interesting website that i came across while searching for information on the catholic church a couple of days ago...<br><br><a href="http://www.remnantofgod.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.remnantofgod.org/</a><br><br>The testimony of one of the nuns that escaped(Sister Charlotte)  provides some insight for us.<br><br>Some excerpts for those lazy to mosey over:<br><br>"<br>And you know the priest's body is sanctified.  And therefore it is not a sin for us to give the priests our bodies.  In other words, they teach every little Nun this:  As the Holy Ghost placed a germ in Mary's womb, and Jesus Christ was born, so the Priest is the Holy  Ghost, and therefore it isn't a sin for us to bare his children.   And let me tell you, that's what they come into the convent for.  No other purpose in all of this world do priests come into the convent but to rob those precious little girls of their virtue.  And I'll assure you, we'll be telling you a little later in the testimony just what they really do after they come in under those particular deals.<br>"<br><br>"And so, now, they can do things like this.  Now, if a Roman Catholic Priest comes into the Convent he may go to the Mother Superior and ask her to permit him to go into the cell where one of the Nuns are.  And,  you know, that Mother with her carnal mind and her carnal heart - and she's very hard and very carnal - and she is the mother, many times, of many illegitimate children - they belong to the priest... and, you know, she'll take that priest.  And he's drinking - she knows it.  They bring liquor in with them.  Sometimes some of the Nuns will drink with him, and the Mother usually drinks with him.  And it's really a terrible place, it is, not a religious order.  It does not live up to that name whatsoever.<br><br>But here she brings that priest into one of our cells.  Now, I wonder if you realize how serious it is.  That Roman Catholic priest, he has liquor under his belt, we know that.  But he has a big, strong body.  He's had three square meals of food every day of his life.  He can eat all the food that he wants.<br><br>But, you know, there's a little Nun that may have a broken body.  And she may not have very much strength.  And what did he come into that cell for?  For nothing other than to destroy that little Nun.<br><br>I often say I wish the government could walk into a Convent just about the time one of those priests are let in the cell.  The Mother will turn a key in the lock, and you're locked in there with that priest.<br><br>Now, we have no way to defend ourselves.  And I often say - I've had to nurse those little girls - I'm an  R.N..  I've got my nurse's training by going through the tunnel over to the hospital as I lived in an Open Order Convent.  But, may I say, after that priest is taken out of there, if you could look upon the body of that little Nun, she looks like something you've thrown out in a hog pen.  And a half a dozen old sows have just mauled that child's body.<br>"</div>
