Take congenital heart disease as example, because Down syndrome is the most common cause of syndromic congenital cardiac disease.<br><br>About 40% of patients with Down's syndrome have congenital heart disease of some sort. One study showed that the birth prevalence of congenital heart disease was 8.8/1000 live births (n = 231). Of these, 9% had recognised chromosomal anomalies 0.80/1000 live births, mainly due to Down's syndrome.

If the need for treatment and needles is the criterion for deciding whether or not to abort a baby, then those with thalassaemia (a common blood disease requiring monthly transfusions) should be aborted.</div>
