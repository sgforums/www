One either:<br><br>1- enters into the blessedness of heaven through a purification process called Purgatory, or<br><br>2- enters Heaven immediately, or<br><br>3- receives immediate and everlasting damnation in Hell.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(Explanation removed, pending peer review)</span><br><br>2) When you say devout, I assume that person has the intention to be baptized, but couldnÂ’t make it in time? In this case, he/she is saved. We call this Baptism by desire.<br><br>3) Well, the middle place between Heaven and Hell is Earth. If one goes to Purgatory he can be considered to be saved already. It is just a matter of when he/she goes to heaven.<br><br>4) We do not know. We leave him/her to the mercy of God. God is not so callous as to damn those who have had no chance to hear the Gospel or receive Baptism.<br><br>5) Fr Joachim Kang is currently placed under administrative leave. At the moment, I believe his priestly duties have been suspended. However, he can still exercise his powers in an event of an emergency.<br><br>6) The Holy Trinity is one, but three.<br><br>- God the Father<br>- God the Son (Jesus Christ)<br>- God the Holy Spirit (The sum of the love of the Father and the Son)<br><br>Jesus Christ is both God, and the Son of God.<br></div>

GOd doesnt care whether you are a christian/catholic/bhuddhist or whatever. He is only interested in the actions which you have performed and carried out during the course of your human life. And Nobody would know what form of judgement they would receive after death. It depends on their actions and God.<br><br>3)What do you mean by middle place? Please be more specific.<br><br>4)No one is guaranteed a place in heaven. It depends on the individual's Karma and God's decision. When a soul departs from the body, the soul would be sent to heaven for judgement.<br><br>5) Father Kang? Last I heard was that he is still there. But you have to ask others...Im not that sure.<br><br>6)Jesus is the son of god. He is a Celestial Being. The Bible speaks of the trinity. The father the Son and The Holy Spirit. The Father refers to the Supreme God who created the world. Jesus was the son of God sent to earth on a mission to teach mankind to be good.</div>
