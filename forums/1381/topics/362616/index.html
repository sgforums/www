              <p>By "giving up institutional church", i supposed you meant you don't go for service and/or cell group meetings?</p>
              <p>Are you still being "fed"? Do you stilll consider yourself a Christian? If so, how?</p>
              <p>I think many people are tired of going to church and being involved in the Christian community due to various reasons. If so, how are they growing in the faith?</p>

              <p>Good question.</p>
              <p>I had this question also after being a member , if we are all part of the body of christ , it does'nt matter where we go as long as we believe and pray ,yes and seak him, continueing the relationship with Jesus Christ, wich is very good.</p>
              <p>            Then I would go visit church sometimes, since It is part of seaking him . I missed it and was glad to be back and had many wonderful memories of my childhood and it was the treasured place full of memories of when I first asked him in my heart and everything, from when I was 4 to when I was 6, 7, 8, 9 all the way up past   14. I was in my 20's and my cousin and I laughed at our funny memories and walked thru the church past every corner, was a memory and I could remember how I felt the loving touch of God reach me all those years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>           Then I saw all the people who are still there and was so happy to see them, 20 years later and they are still here, I wached them work  hard with the sunday school kids and reach down to hug the!, remembering when they reached out to me and all my school friends growing up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>                    Then I came to realise why church is so important,</p>
              <p>If it were'nt for the ones who stayed and teach Sunday school all the way down to the ones who just add a sound of praise, just by being there, we would'nt have church.The doors would be closed.I would'nt have had those memories and I would'nt have maybe learned about Jesus.</p>

              <p>how are you to hear about the word of christ without going to church?</p>
              <p>or purchasing sermon?</p>

              <p>the importance of congregating is so that brothers and sisters can continue to support one another especially in the spiritual sense..hence it was so important to be included as a strong recommendation in the bible..</p>
              <p>you have a good strong r/s with God..but there are times when you feel lost or down..especially when demons attack you or lure you away from God without you knowing..its times like this that having a congregation of brothers and sisters that will strenghten your bond with God again and repent on errant ways..maybe even serves as a alert to you that you might need to be on guard on certain things..</p>
              <p>besides all these, it is only left between yourself and God to build that r/s..of course jesus must be there to intercede for you and pass your prayers to God..</p>
