            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Deuteronomy 13:<br><br>Idolatry and False Prophets<br><br>12:32 (13:1)1 You2 must be careful to do everything I am commanding you. Do not add to it or subtract from it!3 13:1 Suppose a prophet or one who foretells by dreams4 should appear among you and show you a sign or wonder,5 13:2 and the sign or wonder should come to pass concerning what he said to you, namely, Â“Let us follow other godsÂ” Â– gods whom you have not previously known Â– Â“and let us serve them.Â” 13:3 You must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer,6 for the Lord your God will be testing you to see if you love him7 with all your mind and being.8 13:4 You must follow the Lord your God and revere only him; and you must observe his commandments, obey him, serve him, and remain loyal to him. 13:5 As for that prophet or dreamer,9 he must be executed because he encouraged rebellion against the Lord your God who brought you from the land of Egypt, redeeming you from that place of slavery, and because he has tried to entice you from the way the Lord your God has commanded you to go. In this way you must purge out evil from within.10<br><br>False Prophets in the Family<br><br>13:6 Suppose your own full brother,11 your son, your daughter, your beloved wife, or your closest friend should seduce you secretly and encourage you to go and serve other gods12 that neither you nor your ancestors13 have previously known,14 13:7 the gods of the surrounding people (whether near you or far from you, from one end of the earth15 to the other). 13:8 You must not give in to him or even listen to him; do not feel sympathy for him or spare him or cover up for him. 13:9 Instead, you must kill him without fail!16 Your own hand must be the first to strike him,17 and then the hands of the whole community. 13:10 You must stone him to death18 because he tried to entice you away from the Lord your God, who delivered you from the land of Egypt, that place of slavery. 13:11 Thus all Israel will hear and be afraid; no longer will they continue to do evil like this among you.19<br></blockquote>Taken from the book of Deuteronomy, which is a cannoned text from the Old Testament. Argued by Sam Harris in his book, End of Faith. Apparently, not many Christians have read all of the texts. I wonder why no Christians here follow what God says?</div>

It is part of Judaism's Torah - the first segment of the Tanakh. It later became part of Christianity's Old Testament. Its Hebrew name is Devarim Ã£Ã¡Ã¸Ã©Ã­ ("words"), which comes from the opening phrase "Eleh ha-devarim" ("These are the words..."). </blockquote></div>

When reading scripture, one must need to understand the context of what was happening, plus who were the passages talking to..... the passages were decidedly addressed to the Hebrew people who was with Moses.
