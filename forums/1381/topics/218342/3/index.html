We can learn from their mistakes, their exemplary life and etc. Certainly the command to build an ark was not given to you. it was for Noah. But can we glean principles from it? Certainly.<br><br>For example: The position of the majority is not always right. Noah heeded God's voice than heeding the voice of the unbelieving world. May we follow Noah's example. No, not the building of the ark [LOL]......i mean the principle.<br><br>In the NT we can glean direct commands for a Christian.<br><br>pray always. stand fast in the faith. Grow in the grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ and etc.<br><br>2) It was not all written to you. Scripture divides the world into three major peoples [though there maybe other divisions but these are the major distinct divisions that leap out of the pages of the Bible]<br><br>a)Gentiles b) Israel and c) the Church of God.<br><br>You can see that in Romans. First he addresses the case of the Gentiles mostly chapter one starting from verse 18. Then he addresses the Jews or Israelites from chapter 2:17. Then the book as a whole was intended for the Church of God in Rome and to all the churches  throughout all the Churh Age till the Lord Raptures His Church.<br><br>These three sets of people God has a special plan. There were directives given to Israel like there were directives given to the Church. Some directives of Israel were given to the Church as well. But this doesn't mean that the Church is Isreal.<br><br>It was not all written about you. This is self explanatory. There are things there written about you as a sinner, about you as a redeemed sinner [if you have trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ alone for salvation], about you as a member of the Church of God and etc. But there are also things written there not about you.<br><br>P.s. do not confuse Israel with the Church or mix the two. you will be hopelessly confused. Skeptics who often find "contradictions" in the Bible often fail to distinguish the two.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Ironside:<br><strong><br><br>Dave, can i give you the standard dispensational principle when studying or reading the Bible?<br><br>This is really an elementary principle to others [especially thoroughgoing dispensational students of the Bible] but here it is anyway:<br><br>While all the Bible was written [b]FOR</strong> you, it was not all written <strong>TO</strong> you, nor was it all written <strong>ABOUT</strong> you.<br><br>1) It was all written for you. From the Bible we glean principles, instuctions, correction, training for righteousness and etc.<br><br>From the OT we can glean principles and examples of others. We can learn from their mistakes, their exemplary life and etc. Certainly the command to build an ark was not given to you. it was for Noah. But can we glean principles from it? Certainly.<br><br>For example: The position of the majority is not always right. Noah heeded God's voice than heeding the voice of the unbelieving world. May we follow Noah's example. No, not the building of the ark [LOL]......i mean the principle.<br><br>In the NT we can glean direct commands for a Christian.<br><br>pray always. stand fast in the faith. Grow in the grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ and etc.<br><br>2) It was not all written to you. Scripture divides the world into three major peoples [though there maybe other divisions but these are the major distinct divisions that leap out of the pages of the Bible]<br><br>a)Gentiles b) Israel and c) the Church of God.<br><br>You can see that in Romans. First he addresses the case of the Gentiles mostly chapter one starting from verse 18. Then he addresses the Jews or Israelites from chapter 2:17. Then the book as a whole was intended for the Church of God in Rome and to all the churches  throughout all the Churh Age till the Lord Raptures His Church.<br><br>These three sets of people God has a special plan. There were directives given to Israel like there were directives given to the Church. Some directives of Israel were given to the Church as well. But this doesn't mean that the Church is Isreal.<br><br>It was not all written about you. This is self explanatory. There are things there written about you as a sinner, about you as a redeemed sinner [if you have trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ alone for salvation], about you as a member of the Church of God and etc. But there are also things written there not about you.<br><br>P.s. do not confuse Israel with the Church or mix the two. you will be hopelessly confused. Skeptics who often find "contradictions" in the Bible often fail to distinguish the two.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>WOW!! thx for your explaination.<br><br>You have interested me to start my daily bible reading now.<br>Ill start on romans<br><br>thanks again!</div>

So priests like Aquinas was the exception; I think the average priest cannot expound on the bible at all.<br><br>I think it was at Trent? or around then that the Church started to place emphasis on true biblical literacy for her priests.</div>
