            <div class='col-md body'>One can never fully understand the existence of God.  For me, it's a matter of faith.<br><br>I, too, was from a missionary school.  Thus, I had the opportunity to discover what Christianity about.  At the time I took a step to accept Christ in my life, I really didn't think too much about the 'facts' or proof of His existence.  I just the step of faith that He does (what can one stand to lose, if it was true?)<br><br>Over the years, I have experienced changes in my life and things that happened which affirmed my faith.  There were times that situations tested this faith, but I've never regret putting my trust in Him.  When my first relationship failed, I was very down; to the point that I gave up hope on life.  But I was reminded how He continued to pour out his blessings on me even though when I stopped obeying Him.<br><br>God can only show Himself if you start to look for Him.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think my problem is that I just can't understand how you take that leap of faith. How to transform from not-believing to believing?<br><br>In my view, asking me to have faith that God exists is no different from asking me to have faith that Unicorns exist or that the Tooth Fairy exists. I just can't summon up that faith and I'm curious as to how christians are able to do so.<br><br>I don't mean to offend anybody with the above statements, it's just my personal opinion ok?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey pal, nice to meet u.<br><br>just to share a verse with you and hope to hear more from you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>"And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to Him must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who earnestly seek Him." (Hebrew 11:6)<br><br>Just like sillyme, i cannot show you a litmus-test for the existence of God but look around you...look at your reflection in the mirror...at all creations...these are silent witnesses of a God who is also the Creator of all things.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes faith is the key.  It is difficult to define faith except that it is intangible.  How do i know when to put faith in someone? I do not know. When you trust someone, do you know whether you made the right decision until you really do?<br><br>If your friend goes to disneyland and tells you how fun it is, how exciting it is but you have never gone there before, would you really know how FUN and EXCITING it is?<br><br>So now, christians can tell you how real Jesus is. We can tell you all the bible verses we know. But, if you do really put your faith in Jesus, how can you then say it is not real?<br><br>Lets be fair, Jesus can be real or Jesus can be fake.  I believe Jesus is real. Why? I cant give you concrete proof.  But can you give concrete proof that Jesus do not?  We all know its logical that it is not necessary that just because something cannot be seen, cannot be heard or cannot be felt physically, it is not real.<br><br>Let me lastly ask you a question, do you believe we humans were created? If yes, which theory do you support about creation i.e. the biblical, evolution etc....</div>

God made everyone differently but ultimately God has a plan for everyone whether to know Him or not.<br><br>Point 2. Evolution has always been a theory, it has never been scientifically proven officially (thats a mouthful or words.). My personal belief is that, yes there is mutation. Like many many breeds of dogs and wolves and foxes mutated from 1 a single species of dog over the years. (Interestingly, Christians will hold to the belief that Earth is only 4000 years old, not 10 or 100 million or billion years.)<br><br>When i watch those apes and primates documentaries on discovery channel, i do wonder, if man had evloved from apes and primates over the years, why do we still have apes and primates today? Should all of them became intelligent and became human?<br><br>If you study a little more about the beginning of this theory of Evolution, Charles Darwin actually based it on a rasict stands. From historical books that i read, non-christian by the way, in the first edition of Theory of Evolution by Darwin, he did highlight that Europeans, or humans with fair complexions (white) or more evloved that the people found in Africa or the East. This was vastly popular with a lot of slave traders during the late 20th century. Hitler was a firm believer of Evolution and lead to his hate for the Jews as he regarded them as less evloved than the Germans.<br><br>So i would say that Evolution can be classified as a Religion because one would believe in no God, or men are their own gods. And that puts you as an Evolutionist, not an atheist.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fandango:</div><div class="quote_body">Point 2. Evolution has always been a theory, it has never been scientifically proven officially (thats a mouthful or words.). My personal belief is that, yes there is mutation. Like many many breeds of dogs and wolves and foxes mutated from 1 a single species of dog over the years. (Interestingly, Christians will hold to the belief that Earth is only 4000 years old, not 10 or 100 million or billion years.)<br><br>When i watch those apes and primates documentaries on discovery channel, i do wonder, if man had evloved from apes and primates over the years, why do we still have apes and primates today? Should all of them became intelligent and became human?<br><br></div></blockquote>That's a common misconception of evolution. Evolution is not about becoming more and more advanced or superior. It's simply changing to best adapt to your environment. Once an animal is suitably adapted, it doesn't need to evolve drastically anymore.<br><br>Another misconception is that we evolved from apes. We didn't. We come from the same ancestor as apes, we just evolved along different paths. In our case, intelligence was a byproduct of evolution, while in the case of apes it was of a lesser degree. Intelligence obviously was a very successful byproduct of evolution, and made us the masters of the planet today. Apes didn't evolve to our level of intelligence probably because it wasn't needed for their environment.<br><br>Evolution is a theory, but much evidence has accumulated in support of evolution since Darwin's time. I don't remember offhand right now, but any biology textbook would probably have a few. Evolution remains a theory because unlike the Law of Gravity it cannot be "tested" in a laboratory, but the evidence is there all the same.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fandango:</div><div class="quote_body">If you study a little more about the beginning of this theory of Evolution, Charles Darwin actually based it on a rasict stands. From historical books that i read, non-christian by the way, in the first edition of Theory of Evolution by Darwin, he did highlight that Europeans, or humans with fair complexions (white) or more evloved that the people found in Africa or the East. This was vastly popular with a lot of slave traders during the late 20th century. Hitler was a firm believer of Evolution and lead to his hate for the Jews as he regarded them as less evloved than the Germans.<br><br>So i would say that Evolution can be classified as a Religion because one would believe in no God, or men are their own gods. And that puts you as an Evolutionist, not an atheist.<br></div></blockquote>Oh well, just because people have twisted evolution into racism and hatred doesn't make it untrue. Atrocities have also been conducted in the name of religion right?<br><br>I am an atheist simply because I don't believe in the existence of gods or higher beings. Evolution cannot be classified into a religion, I don't pray or worship evolution. It's just a scientific theory, not a belief system or a way of life.<br>[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't see how evolution, if it works or not (and I believe it does... woah hold your horses and let me explain), should impact your belief in the concept of a God.<br><br>After all, what are we in the physical but a particulate organization of energy in the end, abbet terms such as biological or inorganic are simply concepts for man to classify matter, which I believe has little bearing on the fact that the entire universe is basically made of one stuff... matter, the particulate nature of energy.<br><br>Hence lift up your myopic sights from how life arose to how existence itself came into existence. What was the first cause? What made all this? We know for one thing that this universe is a finite, inperfect system that will wind down in the end, like a fire running out of fuel. It cannot fuel itself, it cannot make itself go on, as we all have known that this is impossible for all finite systems.<br><br>Basically every concept in science is a study of finite methods, and I'm not surprise things get terribly messed when we try to grasp infinite things with our finite minds and methods. It's no wonder many find the idea of rationalizing and reasoning God into being basically a hopeless task. We can do it to some extent, but to try to define what he's ALL about is prehaps a fool errand. And so many of us give up.<br><br>The truth is, we cannot know it all. Christians don't dare claim they know even much about God besides what we believe has been revealed to us. My opinion? Evolution had little bearing on weather God exists or not, the question of God is ultimately a question of faith unfortunately. But I know that despite my overwhelming rational mind and heavy handed knowledge of supposed athiestic disciplines of science (which no doubt raised many eyebrows admist my kin) I can say that God worked for me, and I believe in Him.<br><br>Why? Can I put it down to a rational, idealized choice?<br><br>In a way I can, I couldn't rationalize God, but I knew that I had nothing to lose by trying Him out for once. I mean, if He didn't exist, He would't work out. What did I have to lose anyway? Was I going to keep rationalizing and trying to comprehend life, let alone this universe with my finite mind and die never actually giving it a shot? Again, what did I have to lose?<br><br>So I "gambled". And hey presto... it worked.<br><br>As I said, we can only explain and tell you so much... most of the rest I'm afraid, is up to you to try it out for yourself and see if it works. 23 million chinese christians facing intense presceution from the chinese govt. obviously had everything to gain had they just bought the atheistic party line, but why do they persist? Why? chinese christians? Why? Why do they do it?<br><br>Unfortunately nobody can be told who or what God is, you will just have to experience Him for yourself.</div>

God can appear right in front of you, and you may still not believe He exists.<br><br>I would say God's existence is shown in His creations.  This earth and the life that populates it.<br><br>And it's not enough to just believe of His existence.  Christianity is a two-way relationship with God.
