Do not demand an advance or charge interest on the money you lend them. Instead, show your fear of God by letting them live with you as your relatives.<br><br>Remember, do not charge your relatives interest on anything you lend them, whether money or food.<br><br>Deuteronomy 23:19 Do not charge interest on the loans you make to a fellow Israelite, whether it is money, food, or anything else that may be loaned with interest.<br><br>Deuteronomy 23:20 You may charge interest to foreigners, but not to Israelites, so the LORD your God may bless you in everything you do in the land you are about to enter and occupy.<br><br>Nehemiah 5:7 After thinking about the situation, I spoke out against these nobles and officials. I told them, "You are oppressing your own relatives by charging them interest when they borrow money!" Then I called a public meeting to deal with the problem.<br><br>Nehemiah 5:10 I myself, as well as my brothers and my workers, have been lending the people money and grain, but now let us stop this business of loans.<br><br>Psalm 15:5 Those who do not charge interest on the money they lend, and who refuse to accept bribes to testify against the innocent. Such people will stand firm forever.<br><br>Proverbs 28:8 A person who makes money by charging interest will lose it. It will end up in the hands of someone who is kind to the poor.<br><br>Jeremiah 15:10 Then I said, "What sadness is mine, my mother. Oh, that I had died at birth! I am hated everywhere I go. I am neither a lender who has threatened to foreclose nor a borrower who refuses to pay--yet they all curse me."<br><br>Ezekiel 18:8 And suppose he grants loans without interest, stays away from injustice, is honest and fair when judging others,<br><br>Ezekiel 18:13 ...and lends money at interest. Should such a sinful person live? No! He must die and must take full blame.<br><br>Ezekiel 18:17 ...helps the poor, does not lend money at interest, and obeys all my regulations and laws. Such a person will not die because of his father's sins; he will surely live.<br><br>Ezekiel 22:12 There are hired murderers, loan racketeers, and extortioners everywhere! They never even think of me and my commands, says the Sovereign LORD.<br><br>what is all that then?</div>

Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him 'unclean.' "[f]<br><br>17After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable. 18"Are you so dull?" he asked. "Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him 'unclean'? 19For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body." (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods "clean.")<br><br>20He went on: "What comes out of a man is what makes him 'unclean.' 21For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, 22greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly. 23All these evils come from inside and make a man 'unclean.'
