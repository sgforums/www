Before Jesus came, during the Old Testament period, God's agreement was that if you did good deeds and obeyed his law, you would prosper. So the Old Testament can be considered a record of that old contract. But the Israelites/Man, could not keep up to their end of that agreement. So God instituted a new agreement via Jesus Christ. The agreement was that Jesus Christ had already done everything perfect in God's sight and taken the sins of the world, the only part man had to do was to believe and repent.

Other parts of the NT would be the epistles. The epistles were basically letters written to people or churches in different places. Certain churches had problems, for example, the church in Galatia had the problem of legalism. So the Apostle Paul wrote a letter to them addressing that problem and that letter eventually made its way into the NT. Regarding your 2nd question, I have no answer.</div>
