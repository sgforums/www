              <p>hi all. i was skimming through the book of exodus and found some points i dont really understand.</p>
              <p>Ex 1:15-20</p>
              <p><span id="en-NIV-1548" class="sup">15</span> The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah, <span id="en-NIV-1549" class="sup">16</span> "When you help the Hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the
              delivery stool, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her
              live." <span id="en-NIV-1550" class="sup">17</span> The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live. <span id="en-NIV-1551" class="sup">18</span> Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, "Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?"</p>
              <p> <span id="en-NIV-1552" class="sup">19</span> The midwives answered Pharaoh, "Hebrew women are not like Egyptian
              women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive."</p>
              <p> <span id="en-NIV-1553" class="sup">20</span> So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous. <span id="en-NIV-1554" class="sup">21</span> And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.</p>
              <p>no doubt, these are God fearing women. and are being rewarded. but the fact reminds they have not told the truth to the pharaoh right?</p>

              <p><br>Yes you need to choose between men or God. Many times they are in conflict.</p>
              <p>Most people would choose to obey men(people in power) instead of God and broke God's law and commandments.</p>
              <p>In my opinion and my experience you cannot say you believe in God when in fact you are more willing to follow sinful men instead of obeying God. Then you would become hypocrites by choice and would never see God work His ways in your life. Sad but most people I know prefer this since they really believe in men in power. They put their faith unto mere men for the sake of perceived safety and prosperity.</p>
              <p>Be mindful that following men or God is a choice. We always have a choice but we seldom want to see the options that are not comfortable for us.</p>
              <p>Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to God what belongs to God.</p>
              <p>Often Caesar demands what belongs to God. If it's jeopardizing your salvation stop obeying men.</p>

              <p>Exodus 7:17-19 comes under Parshah: Va'eira Exodus 6:2 to 9:35.  Here is an explanation by the sages for verses 17-19:</p>
              <p>vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone (7:19)</p>
              <p>If an Egyptian and an <span class="glossary_item">Israelite</span> were in one house where there was a barrel full of water, and the Egyptian went to fill a pitcher, he would discover that it contained blood; but the Israelite would drink water from the same barrel. If the Egyptian said to him: "Draw me some water with your own hand," and the Israelite gave it to him, it became blood. Even if he said to him, "Let us both drink from one vessel," the Israelite would drink water but the Egyptian would drink blood. Only when he had bought the water from the Israelite for money was the Egyptian able to drink water, and in this way the <span class="glossary_item">Israelites</span> became rich.</p>
