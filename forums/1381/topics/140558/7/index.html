This I have to agree. Not just the jews, but look at the muslims, these people of the abrahamic faith are rich in oil and natural resources. I think GOD's intention for his people are always good. The things he gave are always good things. It is just men who misused these priviledges.<br><br>Let us not concentrate on getting blessings from GOD though. We should seek his righteousness first, and all these things will be added to us.

Even the Pharisees believed in resurrection. Pagans do believed in resurrection too. But it is only Christ who was resurrected and seen by many.

If Jesus had not died and risen, the seeds of faith would not have been spreaded. Only the jews would be saved then.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>In a way I differ from u as I choose to depend on GOD, as I feel there are many things in life that is beyond our reasoning and control. What I am more interested is how Christ can change lives and help people for the better, not why/how men do negative things in the name of GOD. For a lot of desperate and sick people, Christ gives hope when there is none. Not all people in this world knew how to deal with problems as good as you. By bringing down the faith of these people, u are not giving them any help at all. </blockquote>Actually fromt he start till now, I never really talked about the problems caused by christians. Therer lots of things to talk about it but I chose to just concentrate on the problems of god alone. If u ask how christ change life for the better, the things is, life could not physically change for the better if there is no real god. Do u think the people praying for 4D numbers from idols really get divine blessing ? It si true tat no many peopel can deal with their problems. But by escaping from it the problems never get better.  Bringing down their faith is simply waking people up and deal with real life situation, not trying to find comfort in hoping to gain unfair advantages in life. How different r u to people praying 4D numbers ?<br><br><blockquote>When I have problems, I also shared it with my frens, my partner and whoever wants to listen. When my frens are not there, I also prayed to GOD.Your frens may not be there for u but GOD is always there for u. </blockquote>well, if u meditate, u get the same effect as well.<br><br><blockquote>Probably for u, you still have not met any problems which require u to humble urself before GOD. Think when one is not spirtually/physically sick, he believed he doesn't need external help. Men are generally too proud to admit they need GOD. Same when only we are sick, we go to the doctor. I believe the good news appeal to those who are really thirsty for his word, not those who are not. You probably dun need him now as you are currently happy with your life. But dun close your door to Christ yet.  </blockquote>U r right in the sense tat religion make people succumb when they r at the weakest. But those people really believe in it for the really wrong reason. They do not care if the events stated inthe past were real or not. They only cares if they get anything to give them an advantage. My point to u is, all the "advantages" can turn out to be big lies. Your idea of god may just be your "imaginary" friend. They doesn't exists. If after workign so hard to gain "spiritually" and u eventually find yourself being lied upon (judgement day come but it is really the jewish god who says christian r being led by devils and go to hell), aren't u becoming the biggest fool around for losing in real life and losing in life after ? SO my point to u is, do your studies first and fidn out for sure tat tis religion is right before believing in it, not sweeping under carpet and think u r special where your religion must be right and all the others r wrong.<br><br><blockquote>Actually one thing good he had done for u is he had prompted u to scrutinize his word closely. The seed of faith mebbe planted but u dunno yet.</blockquote>do u know why does the bible get sealed off from public viewing until much later in 1800/1900 ? The catholic church even blames the bible society for printing out copies of the bible for normal people. They felt tat the bible should only be interpreted by priest and if read by some normal people, it is easy to conclude it is really just wrong. If u read the bible with an unbiased heart, it is not difficult to know tat the seed of faith will never took root<br><br><blockquote>Hope one day u can see that he loves u as his child, not as his eternal slave which u have assumed. If Christ can humble himself to wash his followers' feet, do u still think he want to enslave u? </blockquote>Christ himself describe god as a harsh master in his own parable. Frankly do u really think god is humble ? He test peopel by killign his families, he cursed men for building a tower, he never forgiove people for simply eating a fruit, he wipe up the whole race of people just because he think they r evil to his eyes, he set laws tat r unrealistic and punihs peopel for disobeying them. R they humble ?<br><br><blockquote>I believed GOD ultimately is just and loving/forgiving. </blockquote>Give me an example. Fairness. WHen is god ever fair ? U can't believe a person is fair if he makes many unfair decisions<br><br></div>

I really hope these discussions can be of benefit to those who are interested to know abt his word. Discussions should be productive. i would think of one who know abt GOD's words as someone who knows how to play a musical instrument. If one plays well, it would be music to people's ears and people would be encouraged to take up and learn more abt the instrument. If one doesn't, it will put people off obviously and people will never listen again.<br><br>We really have to be honest with ourselves, what we really want for ourselves, what we want to let people know, how we want to help people when we proved a point.

Your reasons for spreading the god news is the same reason for me to share the real news. U think proving someone is wrong is noty productive but u yourself r trying to prove other people wrong as well and should believe in christ. If I should go and get myself a hobby, maybe u should consider taking a hobby too rather than telling the good news and yet seems to me u need to really know wat is the good news first.<br><br><blockquote>I believed GOD has special provisions for the Jews.

Forgiveness and love were given to men in xchange of their sins. Where to find such a good deal? GOD repaying evil with his kindness? </blockquote>Lets put it tis way, god in a way had let jews get killed in crusaders, inquisition and by hitler by doing nothing to help them. God himself is really a jealous god by killing all the people who do not believe in him (egytians, midianites etc) and comdemning them to hell. He really do send fires from the sky to kill the city of sodom to punish men. He did all these and u tell me he didn't ? Forgiveness and love is never seen from god. Punishment for breaking his set laws can be seen easily though.  He is really a harsh master punishng people who he thought r his slaves.<br><br><blockquote>I soon realised I was putting GOD in a box and deciding in my mind already what he must do and when must he do. These are all petty and immatured questions which a spoil brat (child) would ask from his father. </blockquote>Wel, lets put it this way. We can reason and I felt tat the actions done by god r really wrong and not wat a perfect being should do. (cursing men for simply building a tower of babel)If we fail to even reason out, then we r really heeps living under napoleon in animal farm by george owell, taking everything at face value without reasoning if it is good or wrong.<br><br><blockquote>Grace comes entirely from GOD. Now I believed that GOD has his plans, and it is really for our own good. It is just a matter of time everything will turn out well. What we should do now is to keep our relationship close to GOD, trust him, have faith in him that he will put things right, becoz he is Just and mighty.</blockquote>like the sheep who believes napoleon will lead them to good life without seeing and reasoning, like the people who used to be under old communist rule tat tell them they r having better lives than the world outside, like osama tat tells people to start jihabs and become suicide bombers. In wat ways r u different from these people by putting your fate to something u don't understand and hoping things get better by a being with a very bad track record.<br><br>Enough said, tis is my last post in tis thread</div>
