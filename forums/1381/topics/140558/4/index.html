Even John the Baptist said, "Repent, for the kingdom of God is at hand". The ironical thing is, while John is believed to be the forerunner of Jesus, this guy himself doesn't have enough faith in Jesus (read what was said to John in jail).<br><br>It is doubtful whether there was really a voice from heaven when Jesus was baptised by .. John the man! Come on, if the one who heard first hand doesn't have enough faith, I dunno what was the voice for. Made God's word look so stupid!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br><blockquote>What is GOD's relationship with u? For me, he is someone who has shown me love by giving me Christ, which is why I am a Christian, and I am proud to say I am thus able to share with u GOD's love in Christ.</blockquote>Ask you. Without God's love in Christ .. God does not love us?<br><br><blockquote>Why not read it with love? If you think you can pray direct to GOD, u shld know that GOD loves u too.</blockquote>This is the funny part. Why does Christians need to pray in the name of Jesus when they can pray direct to God?<br><br><blockquote>Knowledge does not complete ur faith. Faith does.</blockquote>You know, there is one explanation I don't like from Christians. They explain the 10 commandments and the Jewish laws are given to the Jews to show their inadequacy, that the laws cannot save them. From hindsight and from the fact you are now under grace, not law, it is easy to agree. But if you assume an impersonal view, this explanation just show God is a frivolous God who toyed with His chosen people for 1200+ years then tata introduces Christ Jesus.<br><br>As if this is not enough, the fact most Jews do not believe in Jesus either mean that:<br><br>1) God has failed in His plan (using the Law to introduce Grace, as you need to contrast the Law to see the beauty of Grace). He has failed quite miserably as those who were under Law still failed to see His point.<br><br>2) God sacrificed His chosen people so the rest of the world can receive "salvation".

Are u a Christian?<br><br>Think u have the same doubts abt Christ's divinity as I had last time. I took quite a while to sort things out and still getting confused even after baptism. But I believed if one already decided to be a Christian, he should at least have a stand that Christ is the Son. There are so many quotes in the NT which u can quote that support this.<br><br>I believe u should make a choice on what you believe in the end. It is for your own well-being and for others who are interested in Christianity who are viewing this post. They mebbe getting more and more confused by u also.<br><br>For myself, I believed I am also responsible and guilty in turning a lot of people away from the faith by dwelling on theology/conspiracy issues and making them as confused as me. One of my frens were outraged when I told her Christians killed each other, so there must be something wrong with the faith. My fren remained a non-believer till this day.<br><br>It is very sad (I was in the same predicament too, nearly suffer from a split personality or a mental breakdown as i cannot find harmony in what i believe. I always thought I was forced to believe, not becoz I love GOD or he loves me) when one is not here, not there. U cannot believe in GOD and say that u dun believe in Christ. It is simply a big irony if u are a Christian. Similarly, u dun find a muslim who denied muhammad as allah's messenger right?<br><br>God/Jesus wants us to spread the good news to the world. It will be ironic if we turn people away instead with all this confusion. If u are a christian, we are in the unified body of Christ and should concentrate in telling people abt Christ, not debating abt his divinity that has already taken place hundreds of years ago.<br><br>To end it here, I would say: If u Love GOD, u love Christ. Christ is our Lord and our God. Christ definitely loves u even though u may have rejected him. But his door is always there for u.<br></div>

Just finish reading the threads.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> I agree with what you said.<br><br>My personal thinking is, there are always people who like to quote the bible and falsely interpret the message in the way that they feel like it. Not saying that these people are doing something wrong. We all want to seek the truth of something when we're in the mist.<br><br>However, I would suggest these kind of gentlemen/lady to take some courses on theology. THat may clear some doubts.  Also, someone mentioned earlier I think. THe english bible was a translated one - the original was written in different languages that most of us do not understand. Sometimes the translation really sound weird to me also.<br><br>All in all, the faith of christianity has always been questioned and doubted. I think we shouldn't be questioning people's faith in a very unfriendly way. Just believe in what you believe, and let others embrace their own beliefs too. People can't stop you from believing what you want, and it's vice versa.<br><br>May peace be with everyone  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </span></strong></div>

You can sought advice from your bible class also.<br><br>Just have faith ok? Faith is fundamental, let theology takes it own course. As I have said earier, having lots of knowledge does not complete the faith. Having faith in Christ does. If you have a lot of knowledge but not the love that Christ has, there is nothing for u to gain except temporary pride that u can out-talk somebody.</div>

It was esp enriching for me as I learnt abt the duties of being a christian.<br><br>You may be glad to know that while our faith fluctuates, GOD has faith in us at all times.

The fact is He forgives thru his grace becoz he loves us, not becoz we deserved or earned it.<br><br>When u read the NT, arent u glad that now u have Christ instead of the law?
