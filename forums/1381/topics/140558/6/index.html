I am running out of time :'(<br><br>I am pretty surprise at laoda. u just believe because u just believe. The golden question has always been how do u know christiinity is the truth ? Surely u should believe in the truth and not a lie isn't it ? How to tell if a thing is true is by exaimning and asking critical questions about its accuracy. U agree tat there r a lot of contradictions and errors inside the bible, but u still think it is correct ? Why still believe tat it is accurate then ? Isn't tat clearly a sign it is wrong and not wat it claims ? Why do u think their promises be held if all the others chapter contradict each other and r lies ? Does't tat link u to believe in a lie ? If u ask me, chances r u may become a muslim or buddhist etc if they had approach u first. It seems to me u had joined tis religion in your moment of weakness, which is perhaps the worst reason to believe in a religion<br><br>Anyway just a question. Do u believe Moses is lying, god is lying, jesus is lying or bible is compiling lies ? If u don't believe in either, then why don't u practise the old laws ? Nobody <span style="font-style: italic;">divine</span> ever say tat they r abolished u know. Last thing I see it is instead affirmed by jesus to be relevant forever.  In fact Moses himself say it is for [b]eternal</strong> as well. If now for some reasons said by some human telling they r abolished, then doesn't tat make moses a lier, or god who commands him a lier, or jesus a lier ? Who knows he may lie about salvation itself and everyone goes to limbo<br><br>Lets just say u r a jew in the old days beliving in the OT and god. U believe u can go to salvation by following the laws, <span style="font-style: italic;">just like now u believe just faith in jesus alone can get u to salvation</span>. Suddenly pop comes jesus then everything has become fundamentally changed. Do u think tat is fair ? Who knows sudenly just a day before judgement day everything becomes fundamentally changed again and god says everyone goes to hell. Do u think tat is fair ? He done it once he may do it again u know. Just believing he is a fair god when his actions prove otherwise is puzzling u know<br><br>I am not gonna post anything again for perhaps a very long time (at least a month). If laoda u just post I have faith yah, just believe for the sake of believing etc. Fine. Because u r already deeply entrench in tis thinking and if it breaks, u break. Hopefully u should think deeper in line and perhaps read more about the bible itself <span style="font-style: italic;">in time</span>.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I do not believe anyone can come up with all the answers. No one can do that.

If a muslim starts to question his faith but then brainwash himself to ignore it, is it progressive, cosidering u r a christian and u should believe the muslim to be wrong ?<br><br><blockquote>The bible is our basis for understanding of GOD's word.

People believe becoz they do not have the answers, not because they already have the answers. For Icemoon's case, I believed he is a Christian. I am worried for him as he seemed to be tearing his faith apart, this is my concern for him as a Christian brother. For you, I do not know what faith do u believe in? Care to share what you believe in? At least we can find something common to talk about...<br><br>Christians make mistakes too. Everyone makes mistakes. Crusades, inquisitions, killings...which faith has no bloodshed in its history? What I as a Christian is trying to clarify is: the message of Christ is one based on love. If everyone can be more christ-like in his ways, there would be no more bloodshed. One may have lots of knowledge, but if he does not have love, he can accomplish nothing. Sometimes many of us behaved like Pharisees. We may know the law but if we do not know abt GOD's love for us, everything is in vain.<br><br>As u believed i have overestimated what faith can do, I believed u have underestimated what faith can play in your life. If we only dabble in theology and keep coming with things to refute, we can never grow spiritually. Rather, one would be more and more confused and in the end become an Atheist. This would be the saddest situation as u would only believe that there is no hope and aim for u in life.<br><br>What does one aim to achieve by arguing? Proving others wrong while u are right? Are we really honest with ourselves that by arguing we can better our spiritual growth? Or can we do that by having more faith and thru prayers? I think there is really no point in arguing over scriptures. Many people have done that. Let the scriptures speak for itself. Like what icemoon has said: you only have yourself to answer to GOD when u see him. So instead of  spending time dabbling in theology, why not share the good news with everyone? Let them see what is positive aspect of it, not negative. Help bring people up, not bring them down.<br><br>For myself, I have been thru quite a number of troubles. I also cant seem to find harmony with many verses in the bible. But at least now I tried to have a little faith. Having a little faith really helps. At least now I feel I am loved and there is hope for me at the end. What about you? What do u believe in? What do u hope to accomplish in life? For me, I just wanna share the good news with everyone now, not arguing over theology. That's what i wanna do now.</div>

Though the message of Christ is based on love, the scary part comes when those who reject the message for pretty good reasons are "condemned" by none other than God's judgement. Does God require us to believe anything other than righteousness and kindness, the very attributes in the image of God which we are created? (  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> asking those who read bible extensively, were there any instances where we find righteous pagans whom God approves of? I really dunno, but I think God seems to value righteousness and kindness over belief in God, and most of the idolators were coincidentally unrighteous)<br><br>The Christians place <strong>God as first priority</strong>, over human beings. Hence even laoda99 said the first step is to believe in Christ. And this is why the Crusaders and Inquisitors can get overly zealous and even ignore Jesus' summary of the commandment (love your God AND your neighbours).<br><br>It is the Jewish idea, summarised by Rabbi Hillel in his famous reply on the Torah on one foot (read my reply earlier  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) that human beings are above God in priority, if you have to make a choice. Why? The reason is simple - God can manage by himself (you don't attend Sabbath He also bo dai ji), but a human being in need cannot. You don't attend to him and he may just die. Of course, let's not forget that God is happy if you are kind to a fellow human being.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote>One may have lots of knowledge, but if he does not have love, he can accomplish nothing.

In fact they agree that it was due to people like the Pharisees, those very pious but lacks the heart, that's why the Second Temple was destroyed!<br><br>Here is a bit of <strong>Jewish wisdom</strong> for those interested. The First Temple was destroyed 'cos the Jews then were very unpious and worshipped idols. The destruction lasted 70 years, ie. one generation. The Second Temple was destroyed 'cos this time, even though the Jews were super pious (like the Pharisees), they lack the heart and conflicted among themselves (well, they kill Jesus didn't they?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> )<br><br>The sin of idolatory v.s the sin of cruelty.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Lets put it plain and simple, if faith can be so easily reason out like wat u have said, it wont be faith and would be something else. People believe becoz they do not have the answers, not because they already have the answers. For Icemoon's case, I believed he is a Christian. I am worried for him as he seemed to be tearing his faith apart, this is my concern for him as a Christian brother. For you, I do not know what faith do u believe in? Care to share what you believe in? At least we can find something common to talk about... </blockquote>The thing I am trying to get across is, faith may leads to wrong decisions. Tat is why I see it is a bit... well... unbelievable why does people take pride in having faith over something rather than having done a critical exaimination of the situation before putting heart and soul into it. My faith, I have no religion. I believe in science though<br><br><blockquote>Christians make mistakes too. Everyone makes mistakes. Crusades, inquisitions, killings...which faith has no bloodshed in its history? What I as a Christian is trying to clarify is: the message of Christ is one based on love. If everyone can be more christ-like in his ways, there would be no more bloodshed. One may have lots of knowledge, but if he does not have love, he can accomplish nothing. Sometimes many of us behaved like Pharisees. We may know the law but if we do not know abt GOD's love for us, everything is in vain. </blockquote>If u say tat jesus is god, than the most frequent action god do other than bra... I mean talking is really just killing. Talking about love, can u name an example of things tat god had done to show his love ? I bet u r gonna talk about killing christ to offer to himself but physically there is really no change in human after his death<br><br><blockquote>As u believed i have overestimated what faith can do, I believed u have underestimated what faith can play in your life. If we only dabble in theology and keep coming with things to refute, we can never grow spiritually. Rather, one would be more and more confused and in the end become an Atheist. This would be the saddest situation as u would only believe that there is no hope and aim for u in life. </blockquote>grow spiritually ? U need to know there is such a thing as spirit first before u develop in tis arena isn't it ? And wat is wrong with atheist ? I can classify myself as an atheist and I find much REAL hope and joy in my life. Believe in something so that they can have unfair chances over others seems to be... well... immature...<br><br><blockquote>What does one aim to achieve by arguing? Proving others wrong while u are right? Are we really honest with ourselves that by arguing we can better our spiritual growth? Or can we do that by having more faith and thru prayers? I think there is really no point in arguing over scriptures. Many people have done that. Let the scriptures speak for itself. Like what icemoon has said: you only have yourself to answer to GOD when u see him. So instead of spending time dabbling in theology, why not share the good news with everyone? Let them see what is positive aspect of it, not negative. Help bring people up, not bring them down. </blockquote>To me, there is no such thing as spiritual growth. Proving wrong means u r on the wrong track from the start. If u don't argue about scripture even though it is wrong, then doesn't tat make u believe in it for the wrong reason ? U believe not because u think these events happen but because u can't face reality<br><br><blockquote>For myself, I have been thru quite a number of troubles. I also cant seem to find harmony with many verses in the bible. But at least now I tried to have a little faith. Having a little faith really helps. At least now I feel I am loved and there is hope for me at the end. What about you? What do u believe in? What do u hope to accomplish in life? For me, I just wanna share the good news with everyone now, not arguing over theology. That's what i wanna do now.</blockquote>Lots of troubles ? Grow over it, face it, deal with it, lower your expectation of life if need to. Believe in religion really do nothing to help your current situation. In fact it may worsen by deleting more of your resources such as funds, time, effort and make u more passive as u expect something to do the work for u. U felt love but physically it is only the love of people, not god. Find friends, build up your social circle. Find your lifetime partner. In a way u become mroe free to make friends with more people. The only problem is a lot of people just wanna find shortcut and want to have friends instantly. Wat do u wish to accomplish in life ? If possible, be successful lah. Be happy be rich, be famous, anything a normal person wishes for. Then wat do u wish to be ? Snatching a position as a slave for some harsh, unfair and cruel master for eternity ? I'd rather be dead... Really. If u wanna share the good news, to be fair for your audience, make sure it is a real news, not an old lie first.</div>

If the bible is so flawless, then science and probably me will be staunch believers of it. Problem is it is not. Tat is why it becomes obvious to me tat the situation where I will be question by god will never come.<br><br><blockquote>Suffice to say, I speak from experience, God has brought me through a lot and continues to do so. I believe because if you stop to consider how else could the galaxy be created? How else could the world be created? Your uniqueness, they differences in the various climates in the world, it all points to a supreme being... GOD. </blockquote>Well, a muslim, taoist or even idol worshippers says the same thing about being guided by their god. If u stop and consider how else could the galaxy be created, then u should ask a deeper question, how can the god be created ? If u talk about us being unique, then god is surely a few billion times more difficult to appeared and tat makes it less posibility of being created<br><br><blockquote>God loves you that is why He gave men choice, He does not force you to believe, He let men chose and we are the ones that are responsible for the way things have turned out in the world, why is it that so many cannot see and take responsibility and that they blame God? God gave men a way out... JESUS. </blockquote>if god loves me, he should have just show himself and not let us bicker or confuse over religion. Wat is the objective of giving u freedom only to give him a chance to punish u for it ? Might as well give us restricted freedom isn't it ? Rather lose an eye than suffer eternal damnation, rather lose some freedom than suffer damnation too isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>Did you know that if the Jews believed, then it would have been game over for the world? That would have been the end there... it says in the bible that for our sakes, the Jews were blinded so that we could be grafted into the true vine... so that we could be saved. That is God's plan for all to be saved, but He will not force you. </blockquote>Game over ? Game of confusing people or game of playing with the lives of jews ? If he is almighty, then don't sacrifice any people for his game isn't it, unless tat is wat he intend for to his promised people.<br><br><blockquote>God has taken all the steps to bridge the gap between you and Him, you have to take the last one. YOUR CHOICE. You hold the key to whether you are saved or not. That is why Jesus died, to give you the choice to decide whether you want to be saved or not, He did it for your salvation, to atone for your sin... even before you were born, He saw you. He died for you. How much more love do you want God to show you? How much more grace? The end of the world is coming soon... so are you going to take your chances? Can any other religion guarantee you salvation and a do not go to jail? </blockquote>tat is very interesting. Bridge a gap over empty space. Wat objective could he reached by hiding away from human ? Wat is the point of forcing men to make decision when there is no reasons for so ? Why does jesus die ? Tat is a very interesting question. Why not just let him live and preach more ? To atone for men sin by committing suicide to offer for himself is not only senseless but logically ridiculous. How do u know he wash your sin ? Everything remains the same isn't it ? Men still die, women get pregnent, men have to work even when they r all punishment for our sin. If he forgives us of our sins, then forget about giving us punishment. Isn't he still holding a grudge by letting men die ?</div>

The First Temple was destroyed 'cos the Jews then were very unpious and worshipped idols. The destruction lasted 70 years, ie. one generation. The Second Temple was destroyed 'cos this time, even though the Jews were super pious (like the Pharisees), they lack the heart and conflicted among themselves (well, they kill Jesus didn't they?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> )<br><br>The sin of idolatory v.s the sin of cruelty.

Know you are concerned abt people who misuse the name of GOD for their own means, but ultimately these people are responsible for their own actions. You said it and u know it. We may not be able to stop people from committing atrocities in GOD's name for their own benefit, but we are certainly able to share GOD's love with everyone <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Grow over it, face it, deal with it, lower your expectation of life if need to. Believe in religion really do nothing to help your current situation. In fact it may worsen by deleting more of your resources such as funds, time, effort and make u more passive as u expect something to do the work for u. U felt love but physically it is only the love of people, not god. Find friends, build up your social circle. Find your lifetime partner. In a way u become mroe free to make friends with more people. The only problem is a lot of people just wanna find shortcut and want to have friends instantly. Wat do u wish to accomplish in life ? If possible, be successful lah. Be happy be rich, be famous, anything a normal person wishes for. Then wat do u wish to be ? Snatching a position as a slave for some harsh, unfair and cruel master for eternity ? I'd rather be dead... Really. If u wanna share the good news, to be fair for your audience, make sure it is a real news, not an old lie first. </div></blockquote>For an Atheist, you give good sound advice. U do have ur point and know what you want in life.<br><br>In a way I differ from u as I choose to depend on GOD, as I feel there are many things in life that is beyond our reasoning and control. What I am more interested is how Christ can change lives and help people for the better, not why/how men do negative things in the name of GOD. For a lot of desperate and sick people, Christ gives hope when there is none. Not all people in this world knew how to deal with problems as good as you. By bringing down the faith of these people, u are not giving them any help at all.<br><br>When I have problems, I also shared it with my frens, my partner and whoever wants to listen. When my frens are not there, I also prayed to GOD.Your frens may not be there for u but GOD is always there for u.<br><br>Probably for u, you still have not met any problems which require u to humble urself before GOD. Think when one is not spirtually/physically sick, he believed he doesn't need external help. Men are generally too proud to admit they need GOD. Same when only we are sick, we go to the doctor. I believe the good news appeal to those who are really thirsty for his word, not those who are not. You probably dun need him now as you are currently happy with your life. But dun close your door to Christ yet. Actually one thing good he had done for u is he had prompted u to scrutinize his word closely. The seed of faith mebbe planted but u dunno yet.<br><br>Hope one day u can see that he loves u as his child, not as his eternal slave which u have assumed. If Christ can humble himself to wash his followers' feet, do u still think he want to enslave u?<br><br>I believed GOD ultimately is just and loving/forgiving.<br><br>I think it is inevitable for some of us to be interested in theology rather than the faith itself. I really hope these discussions can be of benefit to those who are interested to know abt his word. Discussions should be productive. i would think of one who know abt GOD's words as someone who knows how to play a musical instrument. If one plays well, it would be music to people's ears and people would be encouraged to take up and learn more abt the instrument. If one doesn't, it will put people off obviously and people will never listen again.<br><br>We really have to be honest with ourselves, what we really want for ourselves, what we want to let people know, how we want to help people when we proved a point. If it is just for the sake of proving somebody's wrong, it really is not productive. The time spend here can be used elsewhere, such as taking up a more meaningful hobby.<br><br></div>
