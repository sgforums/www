            <div class='col-md body'>I was a skeptic of Christianity myself, questioning any part in the bible which seemed to have ironies and contradictions. Until many things happened in my life and I decided to just have a little faith and believed that He can change things. I believed you must experience for yourself GOD's love; no matter how people tell him how good he is one is still bound to be skeptical: Is HIS love so free and good? The answer is a definite YES. He has faith in us and never abandon us, even though we may be faithless and even hate him for the unhappy things that happened to us.<br><br>I believed most people who have not believed have found no need to believe in him as so far nothing dramatic had happened in their lives. I believed it is true that when one is condemned, desperate and sick then they will turn to him. Only those who are really thirsty will humble themselves and seek him. Why not just take a leap of faith, put aside the nitty gritty stuff/quarrels in theology/dispute abt the laws and believe in him for once? Your life may change for the better.<br><br>Jesus came to us with a message of love. The people whom he met and saved are shoddy tax collectors, adulterous women and sick people. Unlike the self-righteous pharisees who enforced laws to show off their knowledge of the law, Jesus has love and compassion. It doesn't make u a more righteous person by having a lot of general knowledge abt thelogy and the bible. It takes love to understand what he did on the cross for u which has a permanent and lasting redemption for every one of us.<br><br>Jesus had showed us it is possible to approach people with love and just at the same time. Remember GOD IS LOVE and just and he wants to love u, not to burden u or strike u down with thunder when u make small mistakes. When u feel down and unhappy, remember he is always there to cushion u from the storm. At the end of the days, a beautiful place will be waiting for u.<br><br></div>

If u do not know Jesus, you do not know the Father, vice versa. Think there are many quotes in the bible which u are familiar about that talked abt Christ's relationship with GOD and why we say he is god. If we do not acknowledge the Son, we won't be called Christians anyway. There is no need to separate the son from the father and the father from the son. I think there is no point arguing over the concept of trinity or the divinity of our lord Jesus anymore.<br><br>Undoubtedly, we are all sinners. In the OT, God does forgive when the high priest interceded for the people. However, men are still fallible. But in the NT, thru Christ who is perfect a permanent priesthood was formed. We no longer need any human high priest to intercede for us anymore. We can just pray direct to GOD. By addressing GOD as Abba, Christ is teaching us to pray to GOD as someone who is close to us, like a child calling his father 'Papa'. This is the kind of close relationship which GOD desires us to have with him, not one which is distanced and fearful/uneasy.<br><br>Will God refuse u if u knock at his door? Definitely not....Will he say only Jesus can open the door for us? Do you believe the bible is the true word of GOD? If you do, then u should believe that only Jesus can open the door for u.<br><br>When I first became a Christian, I was perturbed by the 'weird' concept of the trinity until i finally decided to put theology aside and pray. I once thought GOD and Jesus was different too, when I thought only Jesus was approachable and GOD was not (as I read about him bringing wrath to the sinful people). What I can suggest to u: just pray for his will and understanding to be revealed to u, instead of relying on our own human understanding. When I read the OT now, it make me appreciate GOD has given us Christ in the NT. Christ is certainly a messenger of hope and love.<br><br></div>

You are looking thru tainted glasses, my friend.<br><br>I told you liao .. nobody in the OT needs Jesus. All the prophets never spoke of Jesus. I don't think you can rely on a few vague verses like those from Isaiah to show conclusively the man who was crucified is God.<br><br>Why must it be conclusive? Well .. when God revealed Himself to the Jewish people, the <strong>whole nation</strong> was there, in the desert. That is why it was a <strong>revelation</strong>. When Jesus revealed himself, well, how many % of Jews saw it? Was there an impact?<br><br>Hence, to this day, most Jews do not believe in Jesus as God, save for messianic Jews. Unless you want to argue Jews have special passport (don't think so, since that will void John 14:6), it is quite unbelievable God's chosen people turn out to be this way. I mean, wah leow, the number of Jews going to hell 'cos they refuse to believe in Jesus (Crusades, Inquisition etc.) is a super holocaust.<br><br>If Jews are to be the light of all nation, then please let me see it. But I don't see it . cos they don't believe in Christ Jesus. Or do you mean God chosen the wrong people?<br><br>Christians explain they are Abraham's children, seeds of Abraham in faith, but this is funny if you realize Moslems and Jews are also Abraham's children and seeds ..<br><br><blockquote>Undoubtedly, we are all sinners.

Do you see human high priest in Judaism today?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>In the OT, the High Priest may intercede for the people, but this is still incomplete and is by no means exclusive too. Forgiveness is obtained through repentance and prayer. Do you think God forgive people who are unrepentant even with the High Priest's intercession? If intercession is enough, then their Temple would not be destroyed and they taken captive by foreign pagans.<br><br>The Jews have always prayed direct to God. Moses did, David did .. anyone who didn't?<br><br>Distanced and uneasy? Why would anyone who know God feel uneasy? From the Torah, "I am the LORD <strong>your God</strong>, who <strong>brought you</strong> out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery". Do you feel distanced reading this verse? Uneasy? I think only those without a clear conscience will feel uneasy.</div>

Do you see human high priest in Judaism today?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>In the OT, the High Priest may intercede for the people, but this is still incomplete and is by no means exclusive too. Forgiveness is obtained through repentance and prayer. Do you think God forgive people who are unrepentant even with the High Priest's intercession? If intercession is enough, then their Temple would not be destroyed and they taken captive by foreign pagans.<br><br>The Jews have always prayed direct to God. Moses did, David did .. anyone who didn't?<br><br>Distanced and uneasy? Why would anyone who know God feel uneasy? From the Torah, "I am the LORD [b]your God</strong>, who <strong>brought you</strong> out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery". Do you feel distanced reading this verse? Uneasy? I think only those without a clear conscience will feel uneasy.[/b]</blockquote>First of all, I am impressed with ur knowledge abt the Abrahamic religions which I think you have researched extensively. But I am curious to know what is your own view then, since u have mentioned Islam and Judaism practises? Are u a jew or a muslim, or just someone who is interested to compare between the three faiths? You also talked about repentance and prayers, are u talking from ur research or becoz u have repented and prayed also? What is GOD's relationship with u? For me, he is someone who has shown me love by giving me Christ, which is why I am a Christian, and I am proud to say I am thus able to share with u GOD's love in Christ. And...sorry to ask...but can it be you are a confused and disgruntled christian like I was in the past? Reading the bible can be very happy or frustrating, happy becoz u learn abt the good news, or frustrating when u find yourself very miserable as u can see no harmony in the bible.<br><br>If you are just interested in debating about theology, probably what I have said here won't be able to interest u becoz u will just simply concentrated in pointing out others' wrongs and prove ur point with ur knowledge from the bible. It is easy to quote from the bible to prove ur point, coz anyone can quote from it, including non christians. I personally find it harder to see the love and deeper meanings in it. When I am replying to you, I was able to see why christians are frustrated with me last time as I rebuked them and scorned at their faith which seems so easy/simple/shallow compared to religions like buddhism.<br><br>Why not read it with love? If you think you can pray direct to GOD, u shld know that GOD loves u too. I was the same as u, reading it so that I can debate better with christians whom i hate. I think it will be more productive finding a new hobby then to quarrel with others, dun u think? If you already are a christian, i wish that u can pray more and i will pray for u. Hope you can clear up your doubts soon. Knowledge does not complete ur faith. Faith does.</div>
