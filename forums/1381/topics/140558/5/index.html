Different languages have different depths, the most common is the word "love" which has at least 4 different Greek words. Without knowing the original word used, a reading can only interpret, basing on what is the context of the passage. However knowing the original language (through research) the reader, in this case, do not need to infer the meaning anymore.<br><br>Still any dictionary will define both fields as markedly different.

This should never be the issue if u realy believed in Christ. I do not think u should read the OT/NT and believed only in the LAW and not Christ. I believed GOD has his own reasons for giving the LAW before he gives Christ. In no way I am escaping ur questions; I do hope you can sort out your differences soon like I did. I am very impressed with your knowledge but wished that u can just have a little faith. When u become a Christian, u professed your faith. What is your faith now? Do u still believe in Christ? Or have u backslided? If u have backslided, it is ok, becoz he will never forsake u. Just have a little faith. That's all I think what GOD would ever want from us.

But if u have already decided to be a Christian, believing in Christ is fundamental. You believed the old laws are essential. I agree with u in some ways. But answer is not in the LAW but in Christ. Law is a creation and a creation can never be greater than the creator. Christ is lord even on the sabbath.<br><br>If you really believed that only thru law you are saved, it is very unfortunate. But to each his own. These are your views. Just remember that GOD never forsake u. If you choose to believe in Christ again, he would be glad to accept u in his family. As a brother in Christianity, I do hope that one day u can see that Christ is Lord.<br><br>Like u, I also believed that there is more than just believing in Christ u will be saved. As Christians, we should emulate Christ's love for everybody including the sick and desperate. But believing in Christ is firmly the first step. Knowing the truth really makes one free from the bondage of the laws (this is not to say laws arent important anymore). Christ is abt compassion, not punishment.<br><br>GOD bless.

What did God do to make a "major announcement"? He spoke to the whole nation in the desert. How did God show He still care about His chosen people? By creating the state of Israel lor!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But how did God introduce Jesus?

By letting humans argue for hundred of years, with the ending that the losers were branded heretics?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>How did God show that faith reigns supreme to works? By creating a loophole such that people who butchered innocents were granted salvation and people like Hitler may go heaven?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br><blockquote>The nice folks of Nineveh repented and were forgiven, but upon death, they are not going to heaven.... yet</blockquote>Yah, God still has to weigh their life and determines their destination. Haha .. but at least this tears down the argument that your prayer is unheard to God if you never went through Jesus or some High Priest and that forgiveness cannot be obtained as a result.<br><br>Anyway going by your argument .. I shrudder to think actually Moses and folks may not be in heaven .. cos they were forgiven but no guarantee they are in heaven .. omg</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just a one 10 mins reply... I am running out of time :'(<br><br>I am pretty surprise at laoda. u just believe because u just believe. The golden question has always been how do u know christiinity is the truth ? Surely u should believe in the truth and not a lie isn't it ? How to tell if a thing is true is by exaimning and asking critical questions about its accuracy. U agree tat there r a lot of contradictions and errors inside the bible, but u still think it is correct ? Why still believe tat it is accurate then ? Isn't tat clearly a sign it is wrong and not wat it claims ? Why do u think their promises be held if all the others chapter contradict each other and r lies ? Does't tat link u to believe in a lie ? If u ask me, chances r u may become a muslim or buddhist etc if they had approach u first. It seems to me u had joined tis religion in your moment of weakness, which is perhaps the worst reason to believe in a religion<br><br>Anyway just a question. Do u believe Moses is lying, god is lying, jesus is lying or bible is compiling lies ? If u don't believe in either, then why don't u practise the old laws ? Nobody <span style="font-style: italic;">divine</span> ever say tat they r abolished u know. Last thing I see it is instead affirmed by jesus to be relevant forever.  In fact Moses himself say it is for <strong>eternal</strong> as well. If now for some reasons said by some human telling they r abolished, then doesn't tat make moses a lier, or god who commands him a lier, or jesus a lier ? Who knows he may lie about salvation itself and everyone goes to limbo<br><br>Lets just say u r a jew in the old days beliving in the OT and god. U believe u can go to salvation by following the laws, <span style="font-style: italic;">just like now u believe just faith in jesus alone can get u to salvation</span>. Suddenly pop comes jesus then everything has become fundamentally changed. Do u think tat is fair ? Who knows sudenly just a day before judgement day everything becomes fundamentally changed again and god says everyone goes to hell. Do u think tat is fair ? He done it once he may do it again u know. Just believing he is a fair god when his actions prove otherwise is puzzling u know<br><br>I am not gonna post anything again for perhaps a very long time (at least a month). If laoda u just post I have faith yah, just believe for the sake of believing etc. Fine. Because u r already deeply entrench in tis thinking and if it breaks, u break. Hopefully u should think deeper in line and perhaps read more about the bible itself <span style="font-style: italic;">in time</span>. There is really no hard evidence saying tat christainity is surely the truth u know.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Last remark. I see a lot of people just pushing people to go for "theological studies" when they do not have a good answers for some questions. Frankly, my personal opinion is, even if u go for such studies, the results is pretty much the same because some of the questions had been posted worldwide and nobody, even scholars seems to be able to answer them sufficiently (like evolution and the problems to genesis) And if u come about a question tat stumps u, isn't it a good opportunity to read it up yourself and come out with answers for it ? Doesn't tat help in re-affirming your faith ? Otherwise it seems nothign more than " I don't know, I don't care and the bible must be right because I <span style="font-style: italic;">just think </span>it is right"<br><br>U think I thought who confirms right ?</div>
