            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Understand your point. U desire justice and fairness. In what way has GOD made any unfair decision for u, may i ask?</blockquote>Actually, I do not have a problem on anything so if there is such a thign as god, then he had treated me very "fairly". In case u thought I was a victim of situation etc, then u r wrong. I am asking u wat actions does the bible depict god tat shows his fairness. It is about the bible, his own words really.<br><br><blockquote>When u make a decision in your life, do u always have the opportunity to understand and check everything? Or do u sometimes do it out of your conviction also? </blockquote>If it is a thing that doesn't allow any time for me to think, I will make a hasty decision. But for a decision tat is lifelong and may have drastic outcomes, I will take my time and perform some research and do some comparison. In the case of religion, it belongs to the second kind. If u believe it out of impulse, u may r doing the wrong thing to yourself and even to the religion itself, and may make u fail more.<br><br><blockquote>For u, u already convinced yourself that there is no GOD. It is a faith in itself. What I hope is u can be more receptive, never closing door to HIM. </blockquote>To me the definition of faith from the dictionary is<br><br>Belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence<br><br>SO theorretically, I have no faith in watsoever divine. And not me <span style="font-style: italic;">having faith</span> in no god. It is actually different because faith is, to me, a dirty word as it meant irrationality in making decision which can very well be totally wrong. Talking about being receptive, r u being receptive ? R u closing your doors to reason and logics ?<br><br><blockquote>I understand u worry for the majority of Christians and dun want us to be 'cheated'. But wat if u were wrong? Would u have missed the opportunity to get urself saved?</blockquote>Lets put it tis way. I can be 99% sure tat there is no god based on logically deductions and reasoning. The chances of it being wrong is very slim and therefore I have done a rational and good deed by asking christian to be rational. Same as asking a gambler not to gamble. Perhaps he may become a millionaire if he continues, though in normal reasoning and deduction, he is more likely ruined instead. Then now it comes to u, Wat percentage do u have in saying tat christainity is real ? Wat is the physical things tat lead to tis conclusion ? If u were wrong, doesn't u make others lose the opportunity to perhaps become a buddhist etc (which for example turn out to be the right course) ?</div>

If he really want to condemn non-believers, I would have given no opportunity to hear his word, becoz in his eyes I am already condemned. </blockquote>Trust me, according to the bible, they treat non-believers as equal to murder or gay and out to condem them. It is not wat I say. It is said by the bible itself.<br><br><blockquote>If Christians are making assumptions, I think u are also making assumptions too. It is our conviction that Jesus would come again, even the muslims believed he would. We are all accountable to GOD and ourselves in the end. So dun need to worry whether we will be deceived or not.

Perhaps u should leave your door open as well, and rightly so since all along I am asking u to use reasoning, logic and discretion which is the sensible thing to do rather than using faith, which is illogical and wrong.<br><br><blockquote>We are really the same...haha...i used to be like u....only think of all the destruction, deaths and punishments until I decided that enuff was enuff, I need to concentrate on the positive. It will not bring ur spirits up if u insist that this world is full of lies and that there is no truth in it. What do u live for then? As an atheist, do u not believe that there is social justice and fairness too, even though u dun believe in GOD? </blockquote>Not only to think of only destruction death etc but tis really make the bulk of the bible. It is not I don't believe in anything, it is tat it is not convincing. If it is convincing, such as science, then u will find me embracing it fully. Wat do i live for ? I thought I say before. To be successful. Social justice and fairness etc, i really see tat this world is striving to be as fair as possible. However for faith, it is a totally different as it strives of divine unfairness by segregating different group of people and giving unfair rules<br><br><blockquote>For myself, I lived to understand GOD's will for me.

Only by having hope the faithful can live a happy life, be strong and lasting, knowing that at the end of the road there is still light in the tunnel. For u, what are u looking for there? </blockquote>Well, lets put it tis way. I am the one digging out of a tunnel if I am trapped inside rather than praying and waiting, hoping for a light which it all could be a lie. Only then can u really live a meaningful and happy life isn't it ? For u, u should only be happy if u r right about christ etc. But the fact is, it may all be wrong and throughout I can see u can't really offer evidences of why christainity is true.<br><br><blockquote>You are wrong. Everything has not been smooth. I am still taking my weekly injections for my Hepatitis treatment. It is very costly and I have to endure with the side effects, which GOD has minimised so far. I counted myself very fortunate already. </blockquote>How do u know god minimised the side effects for u  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Why don't u go for CHC healing session ? Maybe u become "miracally healed" and yet still find u r stuck with weekly injections. U may think i am cruel but I tell u straight. Whether u believe in christ or not, u have to continue with the weekly injections. U have to carry the burden of your diesease. Believing in christ helps nothing, nothing at all to your current situation. In fact it may worsen the situation by asking for tilthing and taking time from other areas.<br><br><blockquote>Since ur life is 'good', have u ever wonder why it is and why other aren't? Do u believe in justice and fairness? Have u ever been thankful that ur life is good till now? </blockquote>Why is it ? Why do u think there should be a reason for everything ? Couldn't it be all just coincidence and perhaps, reaping wat u sowed for the action u have done throughout your life. Thankful ? Thankful to wat ? Wat makes u think just because someone is better off is due to some reason someone planned and not simply because it is natural things happen tis way. ISn't it more realistic and fair to think that everything u have now is based on your decisions u made in the past and the environment. If god is around, then it may just means he is all out to make people suffer and if he plan for u to be a drunken or loser all your life, u can not resist it. IS tat worth more value ?<br><br><blockquote>When one have a good life, one dun praise GOD, thinking that u r lucky/there is no need for a GOD.<br><br>But when one is down and out, one curse and swear everything and everyone, including GOD. Is it fairness for GOD then? When is the last time we are ever thankful that we have full meals to eat and clothes to wear? When is the last time we were thankful that we are still alive and breathing everyday when we wake up? </blockquote>well, the opposite is said to christian. When bad things happen they blamed themselves and when good things happened they praised god. IMO, everything is done by u yourself. When bad things happen u should blamed yourself and when good things happen, u should praised yourself. Why do u prefer to think tat your life is controlled by some being tat need constant "thank you" and rememberance, and planned to send u to hell if u don't ? If i really love someone, I just wish him good without any praises or thank you or favour or worshipping. DO u think your parents want all these thank you etc when they took care of u or just simply they want u to be better off ?<br><br><blockquote>Like I said earlier, it is a faith.

I believe now becoz I think GOD is a loving and forgiving GOD who is receptive to all, not one which condemned non-believers at the very beginning. If GOD is not forgiving, we will never have the opportunity to hear his word. </blockquote>And as said before, a faith can lead a person to christainity as well as a person to be a muslim. It is simply error prone. U show them your faith without considering whether it is true or not. Tis is similar to guiding people on the road when u r lost yourself. And about non-belieevrs, no matter wat u say it still boils down to the fact tat they go to hell. U still can't say anythign concrete about why non-believers go to hell. On forgiveness u still can't give an example of forgiveness. Why will he want u to hear the words ? To be his slave lah ! If he kept hush hush all along then u will see all people r non-believers and they all be treated fairly. But he want unfairness, praise and playing/testing with the slaves tat is why he spread the words. Otherwise why he hides ? Why don't he just made men the way he like instead of punishing them for just being human ? Why make errors in the bible ? Is tat wat perfect being should do ?</div>

These words came out of men, not GOD. </blockquote>Wat makes u think his intentions r always good ? Wat is the things tat he done which really show his good intentions ? U just show yourself to think everythign good comes from god while everything bad comes from men.<br><br><blockquote>Why make errors in the bible? Are there really errors, or it is a matter of perspective? U mean science has no errors at all? Does science has answers to everything? I dun think so too. If Science has flaws and u still believe, wouldn't it says that u are not opening ur eyes also? </blockquote>Yes there r errors in the bible and it is not something with perspective. Science doesn't have an answer to evreything (if he had an answer to everythign then u can be god yourself) but at least it showed and prove itself to be right most of the time. The reason why u got a computer in front of u is a good explanation of science being reliable.<br><br><blockquote>For myself, I believed (if) there are any errors, it maybe due to the way pple translate the scriptures. I believed the scriptures served as a guide to our beliefs, same as other faith they have their own scriptures. But ultimately, GOD is in control and he will decide what is wrong/right</blockquote>Trust me, the bible is perhaps the book tat used up the most effort in translation cmpared to others and unless u have no confidence in the language mastery of these translators, it is accurate to 99.999% with respect to the original text. ANyway if u think there is some serious translation issues in the bible, then wat r u believing in ? Anything can be wrong in the bible, and maybe the whole thing about jesus is just bad translation.<br><br><blockquote>Think sometimes we put GOD in a box trying to see what our creator really is. It really is an impossible task. It really is an impossible task as we being created, will never have the same wisdom as our creator.</blockquote>Perhaps tat is why the sheeps believe in the pigs and the old people from communist countries believe in their leaders. Do u really think by just saying men r too dumb to know anythign then we all should just blindly believe it is right eevrytime and ignore all the wrong things he had done ? [/quote]</div>

Through Moses? Nay, not enough .. it was a national revelation, beyond a shadow of a doubt.<br><br><blockquote>Evidence of Jesus claiming to be GOD is not restricted to the Gospel of John. Think u can try reading the other gospels too, haha....very lazy to quote...</blockquote>Got meh? You heard of any verse similar to John 14:6 in flavor?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
