The problem with people is that they thought the idea that Jesus forgave all sins is too good to be true. But the fact is: if u truely receive Jesus with all your heart, your sins are forgiven. What God has given u are by his grace, not because we deserve it.<br><br>Jesus' yoke is light and never a burden to man. When Jesus died for our sins on the cross, it has a continuous and permanent effect whereby our past, present and future sins are being forgiven. Even though man are sinners, God no longer held these sins against us. You are no longer condemned by sin thru the law but instead share in his light and righteousness with the new covenant made in his flesh and blood. Blessed are the desperate, sick, poor and whoever in need who readily received Jesus. For those who continue to dwell in old demons and sins, why not receive Jesus and be saved?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, for starters, it is a known historical fact that "Crucifixion" is one of the more commonly used methods for punishments.

            <div class='col-md body'>Christ died of crucifixion, a method of execution invented by the Persians. It was adopted by the Roman army.  The cross of crucifixion exists in several shapes.  One in the form of the low tau (commonly known as the latin cross), the high tau. Sometimes a natural tree is used.<br><br>Recorded in the bible, Christ carried the horizontal beam, or known as the patibulum, on His way to Golgotha.  It has not established, not that I know of at least, which form of crucifixion (high or low tau) He was nailed to.</div>

Herein, it is must be said that a good understanding <span style="font-style: italic;">(or at least the desire for a good research)</span> is necessary when reading the English Bible, which we all know was translated from Hebrew, Aramic and Greek.<br><br>While the crucifixion is a cruel and unusual punishment in the Roman world, death by hanging on a tree is considered a taboo in the Jewish world. It is very likely that the reason for the word "tree" being used five times (one more in Galatians) is either a translation issue, or even possibly that Paul and Peter had wanted to elaborate the psychological state of Jesus' death in its humiliation and embarrasement to the Jewish culture.<br><br>Of course we can choose to continue to read only in English and nitpick at all issues we don't understand and refusing to take in contextual, translational and cultural factors. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Dying on the tree" is a metaphor.  To the Jews, it is akin to being cursed (Deut. 21:23) and shamed.  Christ was made a curse for the salvation of mankind.</div>
