            <div class='col-md body'><br>The Great Exchange<br><br>(Imputed Righteousness)<br><br>The word Â‘imputedÂ’ means to place into oneÂ’s account, credit, attribute a trait or value to someone from another. A banking term used by Paul in Romans 4:3.In fact the New International Version of the Bible used the word Â“creditedÂ” for imputed in the book of Romans. Let me illustrate this: David Rich is a very poor man. An accident took away his arms and legs not to mention his love ones. Naturally he canÂ’t work due to his being handicapped (no arms, no legs), he gets his food from a foundation dishing out free meals every morning. Here comes John M. Poverty, a very rich man. A self-made man as some would call him, being very hard working he became very wealthy. Every single cent is earned.<br><br>But hereÂ’s the twist, he is dying. One eventful day John and David bumped into each other and from then on          they became good friends, best friends in fact. John decided to give all his money he earned through the years to David. He opened David a bank account and named all his money under DavidÂ’s name. In short, John placed all his money into DavidÂ’s account which happens to be zero and the bank legally considered and reckoned it as DavidÂ’s money from then on.  That is imputation.<br><br>Actually if you will look at it at the vantage points of David and John, they made a grand exchange. John exchanged his wealth to DavidÂ’s poverty. David became rich, John became poor. It is imputation both ways. ItÂ’s just like that in 2 Corinthians 5:21<br><br>Â“For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in HimÂ”<br><br>Â“For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor , that you through His poverty might become richÂ” 2 Corinthians 8:9<br><br>We are bankrupt with regards to righteousness. God gave the Law and the 10 Commandments to show us this (Gal.3:19). It was given to show us that we are sinners, that we are spiritually handicapped. To show us that we are sick and that we need a doctor. Show me a man who has tried to obey the 10 Commandments and I will show you a man who knows that he is a sinner if he is honest to himself. How will I know that I have made a wrong left turn? Only when I know that there is a sign that says: Â‘No left turnÂ’ and I still made it. No man can perfectly obey the 10 Commandments and God knew it beforehand. So why did He gave it in the first place? To show us that we are sinners and we need righteousness. (Galatians 3:19, Romans 3:19-20, Romans 7:7-25)<br><br>So where can we find righteousness?  Galatians 3:24: Â“Therefore the law [referring to the Law and the 10 commandments] was our tutor <strong>to bring us to CHRIST</strong>, that we might be justified [that means declared righteous] by faithÂ”[that is faith in the work of Christ on the cross].<br><br>Â“Â…Â…Â…Â….Abraham believed/trusted God and it was accounted [imputed or credited] to him [Abraham] as for righteousnessÂ” Romans 4:3<br><br>God in Christ Jesus is somewhat saying: Â“I will take all your sins and put it into my account and I will put into your account my righteousness, will you accept it?Â”  Are you willing to make the grand exchange? He has it ready already:<br><br>Â“who was delivered up because of our offenses and was raise for our justificationÂ” [justification meaning being declared righteous by God]  Romans 4:25<br><br>all you have to do is accept it by trusting in it just like what Abraham didÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â….you have nothing to lose but everything to gain.<br><br>Â“But as many as received Him [Jesus], He gave to them authority to become the children of God, to those who believe on His  name,Â…..Â” John 1:12.<br><br>Sound Easy?  Of course because it is a gift, you did nothing, you did not die on the cross of Calvary, Jesus absorbed all of the agony. Because of Him righteousness is a gift from God.<br><br>Â“For if by one man's [Adam] offense death reigned by one, much more they who receive abundance of grace and the <strong>GIFT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS </strong>shall reign in life by One, Jesus Christ.) Romans 5:17<br><br></div>
