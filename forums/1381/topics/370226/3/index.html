              <p>You are not in messianic Judaism?</p>
              <p>For your information, messianic judaism is a sect in Judaism which believes in Yeshua as the messiah. They practise both the old and new testaments. They are basically believers who believe that believers should keeps all the old testament festivals like passovers, etc.</p>
              <p>Back when I was a christian, I love to listen to messianic worship songs. They always portrayed God as majestic and powerful. But that was back then.</p>

              <p>no need. I know whats the religion is about. the world and universe and everything is created by god. salvation is accepting Jesus for your ticket to heaven. Satan was formerly an angel called lucifer and resides in hell. all evil in this world was the act of satan and his devils. </p>
              <p>btw how can earth be created in 6 days? u tell me?</p>
              <p>2000 years ago people accepted this, but in this day and age, how can earth be created in 6 days. I am glad that science has revealed far more things that those people 2000 years ago can ever imagine.</p>

              <p>By God, I am refering to the being who makes this world.</p>
              <p>He has some power-- the abilities to make worlds etc.</p>
              <p>I believe there is a God, as in, there is a being who makes this world.</p>

              <p>S.Gal83, do you believe that humans no need to go to heaven and hell to experience them? we can experience them here and now. when we are happy, we are experiencing heavenly bliss isnt it. when we are depressed or frustrated, we are experience hell? yes, no?</p>
