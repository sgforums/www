              <p>why would a God that doesnt like to confuse people would say something like im too difficult to comprehend with your primitive brain kind of words??he explicitly stated who he is..and Jesus also explicitly stated who is he himself subjected to..God cannot be subjected to another..the concept of triune godhead is also prevalent in paganism..</p>

              <p>Hi All:</p>
              <p>in my opinion, there are a few aspects to it. in the
                  text book sense, the Attributes of God includes His Holiness and
                  Righteousness as well as His Goodness, Love and Mercy. I suppose we
                  cannot fully understand the full extent of His Love and Mercy without
                  first understanding His Holiness and Righteousness.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless,
                  the understanding and accepting of biblical truth would still need it
                  to be quickened in our hearts by the Holy Spirit. I believe that the
                  unsaved will go to hell, a place of suffering, and am extremely
                  saddened and grieved tremendously that that's where my unsaved passed
                  away loved ones might have headed to.</p>
              <p>But by faith, i cling on
                  to God. While i know when the time comes for the final Judgement, no
                  one would be able to say that God is wrong, but at the mean time, i
                  cling on to the fact that Jesus understands me, and has gone through
                  grieving Himself.</p>
              <p>I believe the Bible and have faith that it is the
                  Word of God. While some of us in the forum belief/have faith in Bible
                  not being the Word of God. But if the Truth is absolute, it does not
                  need our opinions, and doesn't change by our opinions.</p>
              <p>I do have
                  questions just like every one else regarding what is said in the Bible.
                  Sometimes, probably doubt is the skeleton of faith. But by God's grace,
                  i choose to believe, just like Edison believes in the possibility of a
                  light bulb when he was still trying and trying. And it is also the fact
                  that by our fallen and limited nature, we might not understand or
                  comprehend completely, we may even have wrong understanding, but
                  instead of being skeptic, let us all strive in openess and reason as
                  well.</p>

              <p>dear don..no doubt you have love for God and truth..and it saddens me with regards to your uncle..and how the unrighteous doctrine of man will twists God's love..</p>
              <p>if i may..God most important quality isnt righteousness,nor might,nor wisdom..but love..i still dont see why a loving God will create a place of eternal torment for people who dont place faith if him..would you torture someone who dont trust you forever??you wont..what more will God not do..for people who dont trust him..the logical thing to do is to cut them off before they can spoil the rest of the apples..there is no need to place them under eternal torture..as for your beloved uncle..i say to you now with scriptural truth..he isnt in hell suffering..he is akin to sleeping till his day of judgement comes..he will be brought back to life and surely God will see the beautiful things in him to grant him a perfect life in paradise as promised..God does not take away people we love to be with him..especially not sometimes the violent ways( think accidents and riots)..think of how hurt Jesus was when lazarus died..he brought him back to life..if the son is willing to do that out of his love..would the father not do something greater??</p>
              <p>keep striving to place trust in the biblical truth..but not the lies of men..</p>

              <p>I'm an ex-Christian myself, I no longer believe in God and I'm glad that he doesn't exist because he is an ego-centric, violent, malevolent, jealous and proud of it, misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, masochistic, megalomaniacal dick. I've read the Bible and God's an arsehole.</p>

              <p>Yup, in the Bible God kills countless innocents, babies, women and children. In one of the chapters a prophet was heading up a mountain to pray when a group of youths made fun of his baldness, he then summoned two bears to maul FORTY TWO of them. What kind of God does that? Not only that, this God who is supposed to love us willingly sends us to an eternity of torture just for not believing in him.</p>
              <p>Those are just two of many, many examples of how much of a fucking douche God is. Good thing he doesn't exist.</p>
