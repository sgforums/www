              <p>It does not keep Shabbat, it does not keep biblically kosher, it does
              not celebrate the feast of Yahweh, it does not observe the 10 mitzvot
              that Yahweh has given us to keep, it has introduced pagan festivals
              into the church and turned man away from Yahweh. Just to name a few.</p>

              <p>Not quite, the Lord made it clear in the Bible to worship Him and Him alone as the Israelites tended to stray by making idols of imaginary gods (eg golden calf). He knows we human beings can be so easily distracted, and having an image to focus on can improve our prayer life with Him. In fact, the Lord Himself asked for images to be made in His honour so that His will can be done:</p>
              <li>"Make [a statue of] a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole; and every one who is bitten, when he sees it shall live. So Moses made a bronze serpent, and set it on a pole; and if a serpent bit any man, he would look at the bronze serpent and live" (Num 21: 4-9) </li>
              <li>"In the sanctuary were two cherubim, each ten cubits high, [15 feet high!] made of olive wood..." (1 Kgs 6:23-28, 7:23-26) </li>
              <li>"Make two cherubim of beaten gold at the two ends of mercy seat, fastening them so that one cherub springs direct from each end" (Ex 25:18) </li>

              <p>You seem quite blinded to the fact that the two verses that I picked
              up on did not in ANY WAY mention or even hint in the slightest that
              there is such a thing as purgatory. The verses DO NOT support the basis
              for the doctrine of purgatory espoused by the rc churchand yet the rc church "conveniently" uses them to say that purgatory exists. Now this I find odd.</p>
              <p>Purgatory is the rc church's version of cheap grace. If there is
              purgatory, then why is there a need for Mashiach? Why did Yeshua have
              to die for our sins if we could work it out in purgatory? You might as
              well not even accept Maschiach because you have a chance in purgatory
              to work out your salvation. But Yeshua Himself says that salvation is
              through faith not works. But once you have accepted the faith, the
              works are expected to follow ie following HIS COMMANDMENTS and HIS
              WORD.</p>
              <p>Do you even know what Yahweh considers unclean?</p>
              <p>Perhaps if
              you are willing to be not so blinded and open your eyes a little more
              to the true teachings of the bible, you may find that the rc church is
              teaching just that "complete nonsense"</p>
              <p>What Yeshua established so long ago in no way resembles the rc church at all.
              If you look back into history, all the disciples went to synagogue and
              not the cc and they all followed the ways of Torah including Kefa
              (Peter) who did not set up the first cc. Infact Yakov(James) was the
              leader of all of them not Kefa(Peter).</p>

              <p>You seem quite blinded to the fact that the two verses that I picked up on did not in ANY WAY mention or even hint in the slightest that there is such a thing as purgatory. The verses DO NOT support the basis for the doctrine of purgatory espoused by the rc churchand yet the rc church "conveniently" uses them to say that purgatory exists. Now this I find odd.</p>
              <p>Purgatory is the rc church's version of cheap grace. If there is purgatory, then why is there a need for Mashiach? Why did Yeshua have to die for our sins if we could work it out in purgatory? You might as well not even accept Maschiach because you have a chance in purgatory to work out your salvation. But Yeshua Himself says that salvation is through faith not works. But once you have accepted the faith, the works are expected to follow ie following HIS COMMANDMENTS and HIS WORD.</p>
              <p>Do you even know what Yahweh considers unclean?</p>
              <p>Perhaps if you are willing to be not so blinded and open your eyes a little more to the true teachings of the bible, you may find that the rc church is teaching just that "complete nonsense"</p>
              <p>What Yeshua established so long ago in no way resembles the rc church at all. If you look back into history, all the disciples went to synagogue and not the cc and they all followed the ways of Torah including Kefa (Peter) who did not set up the first cc. Infact Yakov(James) was the leader of all of them not Kefa(Peter).</p>

              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">I think the readers of this thread need some clarification here - are you a Messianic Jew or a Christian, and are you following the Torah or the Bible? It would really be good if you had been more upfront with this right from the start as I am sure I am not the only one who is confused by your postings. And the 2 quotes that you mentioned indirectly rather than explicitly imply the existence of purgatory, as with many other Christian doctrines. So it's your interpretation vs that of the 2000 year old Catholic Church, same old problem isn't it?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Purgatory does not remove sin itself. Jesus did that on the cross. Purgatory removes the <em>effects</em> of sin. An imperfect way to look at it is to think of a nail hammered into a piece of wood. Even if you pulled the nail (sin) out, there would still be a dent in the wood (the person). Purgatory is the process of straightening out the wood (the effect of sin). Certainly Jesus can and does the clean up. He is a merciful God but he is also a <strong>just </strong>God. The Catholic Church believes, just as you do, that people who rebelliously and persistently refuse to believe that Jesus is Lord and who do not yield to Him don't go to purgatory, but to hell.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">On your distinction between faith and works, I think it misses the key message of the Bible. One doesn't override the other as both are equally important. The parables Jesus told in the Bible highlights the importance of extending a helping hand to others as love for all, not just the chosen race. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">I have come to realise that your postings conveniently ignore everything that has been mentioned affirming the faith of the Catholic Church, much less consider the truths in other beliefs. I would like to remind you that this discussion sprang from your initial attacks on the Catholic Church which I found offensive, and that my attempts to explain and show the other side of it have been dismissed as 'complete nonsense', 'twisting of the Bible', 'man-made lies' etc. It seems that you do not have a real desire to engage in open discussion and dialogue, but your objective is simply to impose your views on everyone who has taken the time to contribute to this forum. I will continue to pray for the unity of all people - not just Christians - as children of God.</span></p>

              <p>I am a believer.</p>
              <p>The two quotes I mention do not in any way no matter how tenuous even remotely suggest that purgatory exists. It is not a matter of interpretation, it is a matter of what it says exactly in the bible. The bible says that we are not to add to the word of G_d, but based on that site you sent me to... it seems that the rc church just did. So you go figure.</p>
              <p>Is there such a thing as hell? Is there such a thing as going to heaven? Does the bible say we are going to heaven? I do not believe as the rc church does.</p>
              <p>Again with my point on faith and works, you miss it entirely. But then, since you seem to know better, pray tell what is the message of the bible?</p>
              <p>You still have not given me your definition, which by extrapolation would be the rc's definition of what being unclean means.</p>
              <p>Why would I want to delve again into the things that affirm the faith of the rc church?They are not truths as shown in the bible.Your attempts to show these things as truth have been rebutted with my own points that I bring up. I have engaged you in debate, I have engaged you in open discussion, how can this be imposing my views? If like you say this is a discussion, why are you so sensitive? I have just put forward a differing view point to yours. People here can then decide for themselves.</p>
