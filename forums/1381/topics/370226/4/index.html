              <p>I think you have to work out these issues with God slowly, especially the things you are troubled with are the grey areas which you feel nobody can provide u with a satisfactory answer. Stopping to pray will not help things, and in fact, make u more frustrated.</p>
              <p>In this fallen world, it is easier to lose than gaining faith. We often forget about his goodness when we become complacent. But what we can be assured is, if we keep ourselves in Jesus and he in us, we can never be snatched out of his hand.</p>
              <p>So....do pray......even though I find myself not praying also in times of adversity.   </p>

              is righteous, never us. The relationship between Yahweh and us is
