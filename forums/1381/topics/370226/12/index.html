              <p>depends on whether you believe in the right Son or not... like I said jc is an idol and not the Yeshua in the bible. So you go figure and where is there ever mention of the concept of going to hell in the bible? hell is translated from the word Gehenna which is a place in Yerusalem where they burn all the rubbish. It is not the greek concept of hades ie like in dante's inferno.</p>

              <p>finally someone else who support my views of hell being a pagan idea taken and taught in christianity..i finally get what you trying to say about the difference of JC and Yeshua...if im not mistaken..</p>
              <p>JC being an idol as RCC after the early pure christians used him to propagate pagan ideas so as to unify both jews and romans and thus quell racial, religious conflicts..pretty much what sg govt is doing..racial harmony thingy..as romans are paganistic in general..it will be difficult to accept the true christianity in its purest form.hence lies had to be told..eg..xmas,easter,JC is God..mary must be honoured and sinless, saints..rosaries,idolatry,anal sex so as to keep their virginity..boys for priests..so all are acceptable for the general paganistic romans under the name of christ..</p>
              <p>Yeshua as in the bible--good old "son" of carpenter joseph..in fact the only begotten son of God Yahweh/Jehovah..Yeshua who being the first creature exsisted for so long that none other was made except through him and for him..hence he can say he was before abraham..."i am this and that" which became "proofs" that Jesus/Yeshua claimed he is Jehovah..as Jehovah told moses his name as i am....</p>
              <p>so as the pre human Yeshua is transfered into the womb of virgin mary, his "destiny" and mission was to firstly stand witness for Jehovah against the lies of satan..secondly, let people know how Jehovah would behave in situations that we faced..i.e. teaching us correct attitudes and values..and lastly..to save our asses so we might have the link and privillage to pray to God again..all the while undergoing persecution and never claming himself equal or that he is the almighty Jehovah of armies..and always subjecting himself to the rule of Jehovah..</p>

              <p>Yeshua is accepted by me as Maschiach (Messiah) but jesus is not. They are very different people. The jesus that the church preaches is not the Yeshua in the bible no matter how they try and twist and turn it. Also, Yeshua means G_d is salvation but jesus does not mean anything. It is more than a translational difference. When jesus is used, I see an idol that the church has created who gives false teaching. One who they claim abolishes the commandments, and does not keep Torah, one who changes the word of G_d and is inconsistent with the word of G_d.</p>
