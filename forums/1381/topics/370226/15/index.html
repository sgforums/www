              <p>Hi Domon, the only reason why many did not accept Maschiach
              then, was for our sakes... so that the goyim have a chance to be
              saved. But I do also know Messianic Jews who have accepted
              Maschiach. Let me just say that the Yeshua they know will
              definitely not fit the image of jc that the churches preach...</p>
              <p>Me still learning... my wife is more fluent. She speaks hebrew

              <p>YES!! HAHA!!   One of the reasons I love the Bible is
              that its full of wonderful little nuggets..</p>
              <p>For example, i dunno if you heard of this b4, but the hebrew
              meanings of the Genealogy of Noah holds a secret.</p>
              <p>Adam, Seth, Enosh, Kenan, Mahalalel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah,
              Lamech, Noah..</p>
              <p>Man , Appointed One , Mortal , Suffering, The blessed God,
              come down,  teaching, His Death Shall Bring, Powerful
              ,Rest  </p>
              <p>Put together, it says : Man is appointed mortal suffering, the
              Blessed God shall come down teaching that His death shall bring
              Powerful rest </p>
              <p>Of course, if you read it according to jewish literary custom,
              it will look something totally different... but then, the bible was
              written for the whole world as well isnt it?  I believe that
              there is so much more than the surface.. truly God is awesome..</p>

              <p>my Jesus/Yeshua..simple..the only begotten son of God..who is a god but not the alimighty God..the only one who can imitate God so well that by imitating Jesus..we imitate God and live a godly life as approved By God..</p>
              <p>my version of him is exactly like what the bible teaches..the greatest teacher..a master craftsman..the first born(alpha) the last perfect man  to die(omega)</p>
              <p>i suspect...the arch angel Michael may be the prehuman Jesus..Michael meaning who is like God..who else but the son is like God??so to know the bible version is to know my version lor..hehe</p>

              <p>trust me..its totally unscriptural...based on your terms..</p>
              <p>1) same family..Father and son is definitely same family..since God the father cant die..and he wants to give humans the best gift..the best choice is Jesus..</p>
              <p>2) must be able..since jesus is a god (not the God)..definitely</p>
              <p>3) must be willing...to many times in the new testament..jesus had always submitted to his God Yahweh/Jehovah..and he was willing to die for humans not only because the father willed so..but also because he wanna please the father and he also love humans..</p>
              <p>hence..Jesus can and will die for us.. ^^ so thats why Jesus can die..but God cannot die..</p>
