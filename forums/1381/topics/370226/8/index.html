              <p>I am a believer.</p>
              <p>The two quotes I mention do not in any way no matter how tenuous even remotely suggest that purgatory exists. It is not a matter of interpretation, it is a matter of what it says exactly in the bible. The bible says that we are not to add to the word of G_d, but based on that site you sent me to... it seems that the rc church just did. So you go figure.</p>
              <p>Is there such a thing as hell? Is there such a thing as going to heaven? Does the bible say we are going to heaven? I do not believe as the rc church does.</p>
              <p>Again with my point on faith and works, you miss it entirely. But then, since you seem to know better, pray tell what is the message of the bible?</p>
              <p>You still have not given me your definition, which by extrapolation would be the rc's definition of what being unclean means.</p>
              <p>Why would I want to delve again into the things that affirm the faith of the rc church?They are not truths as shown in the bible.Your attempts to show these things as truth have been rebutted with my own points that I bring up. I have engaged you in debate, I have engaged you in open discussion, how can this be imposing my views? If like you say this is a discussion, why are you so sensitive? I have just put forward a differing view point to yours. People here can then decide for themselves.</p>

              <p>Servant, I have gone through the system and I reject it for it does not give me the TRUTH of the word of Yahweh. This is not personal interpretation, there are just as many around the world who also believe in what I believe in. Having a billion members worldwide does not mean anything, they could be a billion people all being led astray. Following your argument, there are more muslims around the world than your so called cc, <strong>will you ever say that they are right</strong>? I will reiterate again, YESHUA, did not start the rc church, He went to SYNAGOGUE. If Yeshua would have wanted to start a different system, He would have done so in HIS lifetime.</p>

              <p>that is where you are wrong, its not about church doctrine, its about BIBLICAL doctrine, according to G_d. Not man's interpretation.

              <p>the system does not teach the truth of Yahweh because it does not teach according to the bible. Ultimately, you decide the walk you want to take, whether it be to find His truth or to believe in man made lies and deception.</p>

              <p>yes the fishing club was to be the foundation of the temple of Yahweh/Jehovah..early christians...early christians as in the 1st century pure christians putting mary in such exalted position..i cant say for sure..so i cant say much rgd that..infant baptisim is defintitely wrong..as baptism was meant to die away from the old self and live and dedicate a new life to Jehovah through Jesus..after knowing and acknowledging him as sovereign ruler...</p>
              <p>constantine wasnt so noble as just to allow and recognize the church of christians..he just wanted to have a better control on jews,greeks and romans...thats why so many paganistic beliefs of the romans were infused into christianity to make it more acceptable to the romans..and have the rabbis change the core doctrine so jews can accept it as it was from the rabbis..</p>
              <p>and the verse you so graciously quoted..temple, church doesnt really matter as we knw it simply is a place of worship to the true living God..the father of Jesus..Jehovah/Yahweh..and there we see Jesus saying explicitly...verse 15-17..the relationship of christ and God as seperate entities..i dont expect anyone to agree with me as it has been an age long tradition to fuse them both for almost 2000 years..but the bible doesnt lie..and people have eyes to see for their own..</p>

              <p><strong>Deuteronomy 14:6-10</strong></p>
              <p>You may eat any animal that has a divided &amp; cloven hoof and
              that is a ruminant. Of those however you may not eat the following:
              the camel, the hare and the hyrax, which are ruminant but have no
              cloven hoof; you must hold them unclean. So also are the
              <strong>pig</strong>, which though has a cloven hoof is not
              ruminant; <strong>you must hold it unclean</strong>.</p>
              <p>Of all that lives in water you may eat the following: whatever
              has fins and scales may be eaten. <strong>But you must not eat
              anything that has not fins and scales; you must hold it
              unclean.</strong></p>

              <p>what is the fourth commandment?Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour,
              and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy
              God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy
              daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy
              stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the LORD made heaven
              and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh
              day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p>
              <p>We are commanded to KEEP it, so do you? When is the seventh day? ON which day is it?</p>
