              <p>Hi Domon, the only reason why many did not accept Maschiach then, was for our sakes... so that the goyim have a chance to be saved. But I do also know Messianic Jews who have accepted Maschiach. Let me just say that the Yeshua they know will definitely not fit the image of jc that the churches preach...</p>

              <p>no not Jewish, but one that sees, interprets and understand the bible from a hebraic viewpoint. The reason for learning hebrew is that when you are able to understand it, there are so many mysteries and naunces that you cannot get from the bible in english.</p>
              <p>one who keeps the feasts of Yahweh as commanded in the Tenakh and one who does not celebrate christmas or easter...</p>
