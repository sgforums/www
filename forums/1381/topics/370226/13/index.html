              <p>depends on whether you believe in the right Son or not... like I said jc is an idol and not the Yeshua in the bible. So you go figure and where is there ever mention of the concept of going to hell in the bible? hell is translated from the word Gehenna which is a place in Yerusalem where they burn all the rubbish. It is not the greek concept of hades ie like in dante's inferno.</p>

              <p>finally someone else who support my views of hell being a pagan idea taken and taught in christianity..i finally get what you trying to say about the difference of JC and Yeshua...if im not mistaken..</p>
              <p>JC being an idol as RCC after the early pure christians used him to propagate pagan ideas so as to unify both jews and romans and thus quell racial, religious conflicts..pretty much what sg govt is doing..racial harmony thingy..as romans are paganistic in general..it will be difficult to accept the true christianity in its purest form.hence lies had to be told..eg..xmas,easter,JC is God..mary must be honoured and sinless, saints..rosaries,idolatry,anal sex so as to keep their virginity..boys for priests..so all are acceptable for the general paganistic romans under the name of christ..</p>
              <p>Yeshua as in the bible--good old "son" of carpenter joseph..in fact the only begotten son of God Yahweh/Jehovah..Yeshua who being the first creature exsisted for so long that none other was made except through him and for him..hence he can say he was before abraham..."i am this and that" which became "proofs" that Jesus/Yeshua claimed he is Jehovah..as Jehovah told moses his name as i am....</p>
              <p>so as the pre human Yeshua is transfered into the womb of virgin mary, his "destiny" and mission was to firstly stand witness for Jehovah against the lies of satan..secondly, let people know how Jehovah would behave in situations that we faced..i.e. teaching us correct attitudes and values..and lastly..to save our asses so we might have the link and privillage to pray to God again..all the while undergoing persecution and never claming himself equal or that he is the almighty Jehovah of armies..and always subjecting himself to the rule of Jehovah..</p>

              <p><strong>Nothing that goes into a man from outside</strong> can make him unclean; it is the things that come out from a man that make him unclean. If anyone has ears to hear, let him listen to this. <strong>Can you not see that whatever goes into a man from outside cannot make him unclean,</strong> because it does not go into his heart but through his stomach and passes out into the sewer. <strong>Thus He pronounced all foods clean.</strong></p>
              <p>Have u really been reading bro? and do u read comprehensively? :)</p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>Numbers 21:8-9</strong></em></p>
              <p>Yahweh answered: "Make a fiery serpent and put it on a standard. If anyone is bitten and looks at it, he shall live." So Moses fashioned a bronze serpent which he put it on a standard, and if anyone was bitten by a serpent, he looked at the bronze serpent &amp; lived.</p>
              <p>So God did allow a statue to be made in His glory :)</p>
              <p>However in the early parts of the Old Testament, it is forbidden to make images of the true God. In Deuteronomy 4:15-18 it reads, "<em>Since you saw no form on the day that the Lord spoke to you at Horeb out of the midst of the fire, beware lest you act corruptly by making a graven image for yourselves, in any form of any figure.</em>"</p>
              <p>The important word here is "<strong>Since</strong>," which is a provisional word. <strong>God had not yet visually revealed himself to mankind</strong>. However God did finally reveal himself visually to mankind in the person of Yeshua.</p>
              <p><strong>Colossians 1:15</strong> - <em>He is the image of the unseen God</em>.</p>
              <p><strong>John 14:9</strong> - <em>He who has seen me has seen the Father</em>.</p>
              <p>It's all about true understanding my fren, and if one can't comprehend, seek enlightenment from a wiser person for there's always someone wiser out there than u. But if u choose to believe in urself solely &amp; think dat everyone else is wrong, aren't u jus purely worshipping urself &amp; also breaking the 1st commandment?</p>
              <p>i pray u read this post wif an open heart :)</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Protestant/Orthodox Churches:</span></strong></p>

              <p><strong>2nd</strong> - Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image.</p>
              <p><strong>3rd</strong> - Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.</p>
              <p><strong>4th</strong> - Remember the Sabbath Day.</p>
              <p>...the rest as follows wif the catholics version.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Catholic/Lutheran Churches:</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>1st </strong>- I am the Lord your God: you shall not have strange Gods before me.</p>
              <p><strong>2nd</strong> - You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in Vain.</p>
              <p><strong>3rd</strong> - Remember to keep holy the Sabbath Day.</p>
              <p>...the rest same wif the above.</p>
              <p>This is the Catholic first Commandment long version as stated in the <a href="http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2c1a1.htm#2084"><span style="color: #0066cc;"><strong>Catechism of the Catholic Church #2084</strong></span></a> - "I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. You shall have no other gods before me. <strong>You shall not make for yourself a graven image</strong>, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them or serve them."</p>
              <p>Catholics include the <strong>graven image commandment</strong> together wif the 1st commandment...so we are <strong>not</strong> breaking any commandment of God.</p>
              <p>Pls do not let ur personal feelings cloud ur opinions which is already so often in the case...and yes catholics see sunday as the sabbath day :)</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The first
                      thing we see in chapter 7 of Mark is this, </span></p>
              <h4><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Mark 7</span></h4>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> <sup id="en-KJV-24465">1</sup>Then
                      came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came
                      from </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Jerusalem</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> <sup id="en-KJV-24466">2</sup>And when they saw some of
                      his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands,
                      they found fault. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> <sup id="en-KJV-24467">3</sup>For
                      the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not,
                      holding the tradition of the elders. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> <sup id="en-KJV-24469">5</sup>Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him,<strong> Why walk not thy disciples according to
                      the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">So from the
                      beginning we see the context of this chapter, the Pharisees were asking why
                      Yeshua’s disciples ate with unclean hands. It was not a question about what
                      foods were clean or unclean, but about being ritualistically clean.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The very section of the verse which
                      you rely on, is often quoted in the NIV and other versions in parenthesis,
                      which means this that the translators have included this to explain what they
                      think Mark intended, thereby placing their own preconceived and mistaken
                      interpretations on Yeshua's words.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The words “thus He pronounces all
                      foods clean” are not found in the KJV version of the bible. The original
                      translation, showing that these ideas came only afterwards. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Putting together all the scriptures
                      on the subject helps us properly understand the biblical perspective. When we
                      see from passages such as Acts 10, discussed earlier, that Kefa (Peter) states
                      he had eaten no unclean meat about a decade after Yeshua’s death, it becomes
                      obvious that the apostles did not believe He had abolished the commands against
                      eating unclean meats. Such a view simply cannot be sustained in the light of
                      plain scriptures to the contrary.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">No New Testament passages describe
                      believers eating meats that had been considered unclean; such a view is
                      glaringly absent in the Bible. On the contrary, we find many scriptures in
                      which the apostle Paul vigorously and repeatedly upholds adherence to G_d’s
                      laws (Acts 24:14; 25:8; Romans </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">3:31</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">; </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">7:12</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">, 22), as did James, the half
                      brother of Christ (James 2:8-12; </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">4:11</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">), and John (1 John 3:4).Violating
                      God’s laws regarding clean and unclean meat would have been unthinkable to
                      them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">You forget that Yeshua was a Jew
                      addressing the Jewish people, this idea of eating unclean meat would never
                      occur to them. What Yeshua was saying to the Pharisees is that eating with
                      unwashed hands does not defile a person, and not that all meats are ok to be
                      eaten. The food in question in this very passage is not dealing with meat, it
                      was saying that the disciples of Yeshua were eating bread. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Rev 18:2 </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> <sup id="en-KJV-30996">2</sup>And
                      he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Babylon</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> the great is fallen, is fallen, and
                      is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and <strong>a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">If this idea of clean and unclean
                      was abolished by Yeshua as you claim, then why does Rev 2 make reference again
                      to unclean birds? such a metaphor would not make sense if there were not still
                      a distinction between actual clean and unclean birds.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Consider Yeshayahu (Isaiah) 66:17 </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><sup><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">17</span></sup><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">They that sanctify themselves, and
                      purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's
                      flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith
                      the LORD.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">If the prohibition of meats was
                      indeed changed, then why have Rev 18:2 making a distinction of clean and
                      unclean, why then does Yahweh declare in Yeshayahu 66 that eating swine’s flesh
                      is an abomination? </span></p>

              <p><em><strong>Numbers 21:8-9</strong></em></p>
              <p>Yahweh answered: "Make a fiery serpent and put it on a standard.
                      If anyone is bitten and looks at it, he shall live." So Moses
                      fashioned a bronze serpent which he put it on a standard, and if
                      anyone was bitten by a serpent, he looked at the bronze serpent
                      &amp; lived.</p>
              <p>So God did allow a statue to be made in His glory :)</p>
              <p>However in the early parts of the Old Testament, it
                      is forbidden to make images of the true God. In Deuteronomy
                      4:15-18 it reads, "<em>Since you saw no form on the day that
                      the Lord spoke to you at Horeb out of the midst of the fire, beware
                      lest you act corruptly by making a graven image for yourselves, in
                      any form of any figure.</em>"</p>
              <p>The important word here is "<strong>Since</strong>," which is a
                      provisional word. <strong>God had not yet visually revealed himself
                      to mankind</strong>. However God did finally reveal himself
                      visually to mankind in the person of Yeshua.</p>
              <p><strong>Colossians 1:15</strong> - <em>He is the image of the
                      unseen God</em>.</p>
              <p><strong>John 14:9</strong> - <em>He who has seen me has seen the
                      Father</em>.</p>
              <p>It's all about true understanding my fren, and if one can't
                      comprehend, seek enlightenment from a wiser person for there's
                      always someone wiser out there than u. But if u choose to believe
                      in urself solely &amp; think dat everyone else is
                      wrong, aren't u jus purely worshipping urself &amp; also
                      breaking the 1st commandment?</p>

              <p>So you are saying that Yahweh changed the commandments when Yeshua came? How does Colossians 1:15 and John 14:9 prove that the commandments were changed? Even Yeshua said I have come to fulfill, not change, nor abolish.  Do you not read with understanding? The reason why the bronze serpent was made was so that the Israelites would be healed when they were bitten because they had sinned against Yahweh. This in no way gives the ok to make idols or graven images. Did Yeshua say it was ok to make idols or graven images? So then what is a commandment? It was important enough to Yahweh to list it down. And if Yahweh changes not, how then will He change this commandment?  All John 14:9 and Col1:15 say are that He is the image of Yahweh, there is nothing said about the commandment against making graven images being abolished. Unless you have some magical bible that I don't have.</p>
              <p>What makes you think that I am the only one in the whole wide world that is thinking this. Domon already thinks similar to myself. Just do a search on the internet... there are so many people who think this way and are on this journey of discovering the real G_d of Avraham, Yitzak and Yakov.</p>
              <p>So then I ask you another question, how do you know what Yeshua looks like? Certainly not how your rc idols potray Him.</p>
              <p>Did the apostles make any images? No.</p>

              <p><em><strong>Mark 7:15-20</strong></em></p>
              <p><strong>Nothing that goes into a man from outside</strong> can
              make him unclean; it is the things that come out from a man that
              make him unclean. If anyone has ears to hear, let him listen
              to this. <strong>Can you not see that whatever goes into a man from
              outside cannot make him unclean,</strong> because it does not go
              into his heart but through his stomach and passes out into the
              sewer. <strong>Thus He pronounced all foods clean.</strong></p>

              <p><em><strong>Numbers 21:8-9</strong></em></p>
              <p>Yahweh answered: "Make a fiery serpent and put it on a standard.
              If anyone is bitten and looks at it, he shall live." So Moses
              fashioned a bronze serpent which he put it on a standard, and if
              anyone was bitten by a serpent, he looked at the bronze serpent
              &amp; lived.</p>
              <p>So God did allow a statue to be made in His glory :)</p>
              <p>However in the early parts of the Old Testament, it
              is forbidden to make images of the true God. In Deuteronomy
              4:15-18 it reads, "<em>Since you saw no form on the day that
              the Lord spoke to you at Horeb out of the midst of the fire, beware
              lest you act corruptly by making a graven image for yourselves, in
              any form of any figure.</em>"</p>
              <p>The important word here is "<strong>Since</strong>," which is a
              provisional word. <strong>God had not yet visually revealed himself
              to mankind</strong>. However God did finally reveal himself
              visually to mankind in the person of Yeshua.</p>
              <p><strong>Colossians 1:15</strong> - <em>He is the image of the
              unseen God</em>.</p>
              <p><strong>John 14:9</strong> - <em>He who has seen me has seen the
              Father</em>.</p>
              <p>It's all about true understanding my fren, and if one can't
              comprehend, seek enlightenment from a wiser person for there's
              always someone wiser out there than u. But if u choose to believe
              in urself solely &amp; think dat everyone else is
              wrong, aren't u jus purely worshipping urself &amp; also
              breaking the 1st commandment?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;">numbers</span></em></strong> <strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;">23:19</span></em></strong> <strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;">For I am the

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">If
              Yahweh changes not, then obviously the dietary laws have not
              changed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The
              first thing we see in chapter 7 of Mark is this,</span></p>
              <h4><span style="font-family: Arial;">Mark
              7</span></h4>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"> <sup>1</sup>Then came
              together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which
              came from</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Jerusalem</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;"> <sup>2</sup>And when
              they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to
              say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"> <sup>3</sup>For the
              Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat
              not, holding the tradition of the elders.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"> <sup>5</sup>Then the
              Pharisees and scribes asked him, <strong>Why walk not thy disciples
              according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with
              unwashen hands?</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">So
              from the beginning we see the context of this chapter, the
              Pharisees were asking why Yeshua’s disciples ate with unclean
              hands. It was not a question about what foods were clean or
              unclean, but about being ritualistically clean.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The
              very section of the verse which you rely on, is often quoted in the
              NIV and other versions in parenthesis, which means this that the
              translators have included this to explain what they think Mark
              intended, thereby placing their own preconceived and mistaken
              interpretations on Jesus’ words.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The
              words “thus He pronounces all foods clean” are not found in the KJV
              version of the bible. The original translation, showing that these
              ideas came only afterwards.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Putting together all the
              scriptures on the subject helps us properly understand the biblical
              perspective. When we see from passages such as Acts 10, discussed
              earlier, that Kefa (Peter) states he had eaten no unclean meat
              about a decade after Yeshua’s death, it becomes obvious that the
              apostles did not believe He had abolished the commands against
              eating unclean meats. Such a view simply cannot be sustained in the
              light of plain scriptures to the contrary.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">No
              New Testament passages describe believers eating meats that had
              been considered unclean; such a view is glaringly absent in the
              Bible. On the contrary, we find many scriptures in which the
              apostle Paul vigorously and repeatedly upholds adherence to G_d’s
              laws (Acts 24:14; 25:8; Romans</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">3:31</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">;</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">7:12</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">, 22), as did James, the
              half brother of Christ (James 2:8-12;</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">4:11</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">), and John (1 John
              3:4).Violating God’s laws regarding clean and unclean meat would
              have been unthinkable to them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">You
              forget that Yeshua was a Jew addressing the Jewish people, this
              idea of eating unclean meat would never occur to them. What Yeshua
              was saying to the Pharisees is that eating with unwashed hands does
              not defile a person, and not that all meats are ok to be eaten. The
              food in question in this very passage is not dealing with meat, it
              was saying that the disciples of Yeshua were eating
              bread.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Rev
              18:2</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"> <sup>2</sup>And he
              cried mightily with a strong voice, saying,</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Babylon</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">the great is fallen, is
              fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of
              every foul spirit, and <strong>a cage of every unclean and hateful
              bird.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">If
              this idea of clean and unclean was abolished by Yeshua as you
              claim, then why does Rev 2 make reference again to unclean birds?
              such a metaphor would not make sense if there were not still a
              distinction between actual clean and unclean birds.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Consider Yeshayahu (Isaiah)
              66:17</span></p>
              <p><sup><span style="font-family: Arial;">17</span></sup><span style="font-family: Arial;">They that sanctify
              themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in
              the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the
              mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the LORD.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">If
              the prohibition of meats was indeed changed, then why have Rev 18:2
              making a distinction of clean and unclean, why then does Yahweh
              declare in Yeshayahu 66 that eating swine’s flesh is an
              abomination?</span></p>

              <p>and pharisees love traditions made up by them..makes them feel intelligent.. =)</p>

              <p>So you are saying that Yahweh changed the commandments when
              Yeshua came? How does Colossians 1:15 and John 14:9 prove that the
              commandments were changed? Even Yeshua said I have come to fulfill,
              not change, nor abolish.  Do you not read with understanding?
              The reason why the bronze serpent was made was so that the
              Israelites would be healed when they were bitten because they had
              sinned against Yahweh. This in no way gives the ok to make idols or
              graven images. Did Yeshua say it was ok to make idols or graven
              images? So then what is a commandment? It was important enough to
              Yahweh to list it down. And if Yahweh changes not, how then will He
              change this commandment?  All John 14:9 and Col1:15 say are
              that He is the image of Yahweh, there is nothing said about the
              commandment against making graven images being abolished. Unless
              you have some magical bible that I don't have.</p>
              <p>What makes you think that I am the only one in the whole wide
              world that is thinking this. Domon already thinks similar to
              myself. Just do a search on the internet... there are so many
              people who think this way and are on this journey of discovering
              the real G_d of Avraham, Yitzak and Yakov.</p>
              <p>So then I ask you another question, how do you know what Yeshua
              looks like? Certainly not how your rc idols potray Him.</p>

              <p>bro brey...God does not change..but..he knows the limittations

              does not change however..1 example will be monogamy and
              polygamy..God's standard is mono..yet he had allowed David to take
              many wives..abraham to screw the maidservant of sarah...etc..thus
              when God pronounced all food being clean..he is being
              practical..the days of exodus is over...and the people are more
              stablize..hygeine and medical access improved..back in exodus when
              you are moving around..its hard to stay healthy and sane..rules
              must be set up to assist in upkeeping such standards so people can
              travel much more easily..</p>
              <p>and pharisees love traditions made up by them..makes them feel

              <p>domon will probably disagree with you here because when the commandment came down in Vayikra (Leviticus)11, the post note from Yahweh after all of that was this in verse 44. For I am Adonai your G_d; therefore, consecrate yourselves and be holy, for I am holy; do not defile yourself...</p>
              <p>The commandment was not given for hygeines sake, but rather so that the nation of Yisrael is holy. We then move on to the book of Bmidbar (Numbers) 15:15The foreigner living with the people of Yisrael are to be treated the same way before Adonai as the people of Yisrael, and this is a permanent regulation through all the generations. It says the same Torah and standard of judgement will apply to both the Jew and the foreigner living with the Jews.</p>
              <p>So then unless all our generations has ended, this prohibition on what is clean to eat is still in force and we are to obey, not because we want salvation but because we have already accepted Maschiach. What many christians forget is that unless you are part of the nation of Yisrael, ie the house of Yisrael or the house of Yehuda, we have no covenant with Yahweh. By believing in Yeshua, we all come under the house of Yehuda. So we become goyim (foreginers) living with the people of Yisrael, the same law of Yahweh applies to us as to the Jews. This law has never been changed, that is why Kefa (Peter) said surely not ADONAI when asked to eat unclean foods. There is no where recorded in the Brit Chadashah that this prohibition was ever lifted. The same applies for all of Yahweh's commandments, they are our rules to live by as long as we say we believe in Maschiach, and confess that Yahweh is our G_d.
