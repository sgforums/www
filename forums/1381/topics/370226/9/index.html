              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">By the same token, this applies to keeping of Shabbat as
                      well. We clearly know that it is stated in Exodus 20:8</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><sup>8</sup> “ Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. <sup id="en-NKJV-2061">9</sup> Six days you shall labor and do all your work, <sup id="en-NKJV-2062">10</sup> but the seventh day <em>is</em> the Sabbath of the LORD
                      your God. <em>In it</em> you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your
                      daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor
                      your stranger who <em>is</em> within your gates. <sup id="en-NKJV-2063">11</sup> For <em>in</em> six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and
                      all that <em>is</em> in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the LORD
                      blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">So likewise, we are to keep the commandments of Yahweh. Yeshua
                      said that till heaven and earth pass away, no one jot or tittle will by no
                      means pass from the law till all is fulfilled. So all is not fulfilled and the
                      law is still with us. We are to observe Torah as our instructions for living
                      the life that we are called, this is our guideline, this is our standard.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">When Yeshua was speaking about Shabbat to the Pharisees, He
                      was correcting them in their application of Torah, on Shabbat one should not do
                      work, as evidenced by the Tenakh, which gives countless examples of people to
                      be put to death if they profane Shabbat. But on Shabbat is it ok to do good, it
                      is ok to help, it is ok to heal… It has never been done away with.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Yeshua is the fulfillment of the Torah, not the abolishment
                      of Torah. So Torah still stands today.</p>
              <p> Hope this clarifies some things for you...  domon... : )</p>

              unclean for us to eat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This commandment is given so that we are to be Holy as
              Yahweh is Holy. We are to do this to set ourselves apart.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yeshua Himself said:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=47&amp;amp;chapter=5&amp;amp;verse=18&amp;amp;version=50&amp;amp;context=verse">Matthew 5:18</a></strong><br> For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one
              <strong>jot</strong> or one <strong>tittle</strong> will by no
              means pass from the law till all is fulfilled.</p>

              love, just as I have kept My Father’s <strong>commandment</strong>s

              <strong>commandment</strong>s, is a liar, and the truth is not in
              him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=73&amp;amp;chapter=22&amp;amp;verse=14&amp;amp;version=50&amp;amp;context=verse">Revelation 22:14</a></strong><br> Blessed are those who do His <strong>commandment</strong>s, that
              they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter through
              the gates into the city.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the same token, this applies to keeping of Shabbat
              as well. We clearly know that it is stated in Exodus 20:8</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><sup>8</sup> “ Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it
              holy. <sup>9</sup> Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
              <sup>10</sup> but the seventh day <em>is</em> the Sabbath of the
              LORD your God. <em>In it</em> you shall do no work: you, nor your
              son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female
              servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who <em>is</em> within
              your gates. <sup>11</sup> For <em>in</em> six days the LORD made
              the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that <em>is</em> in
              them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the
              Sabbath day and hallowed it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So likewise, we are to keep the commandments of Yahweh.
              Yeshua said that till heaven and earth pass away, no one jot or
              tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled. So
              all is not fulfilled and the law is still with us. We are to
              observe Torah as our instructions for living the life that we are
              called, this is our guideline, this is our standard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Yeshua was speaking about Shabbat to the
              Pharisees, He was correcting them in their application of Torah, on
              Shabbat one should not do work, as evidenced by the Tenakh, which
              gives countless examples of people to be put to death if they
              profane Shabbat. But on Shabbat is it ok to do good, it is ok to
              help, it is ok to heal… It has never been done away with.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yeshua is the fulfillment of the Torah, not the
              abolishment of Torah. So Torah still stands today.</p>
              <p> Hope this clarifies some things for you...  domon...

              <p>thanks alot bro brey..as for the food part..i remember reading a part where this dude was hungry and Jehovah/Yahweh had said to him to kill and eat..and he said no..even to the seafood..as like God said..its unclean..but God told him its ok due to some other reasons..cant really remember it..but i cant remember where it is..</p>
              <p>as for JC saying till heavn and earth pass away..not a single bit will pass frm the law..in revelation, we see that there will be new heavens and new earth..meaning new form of government instead of this current wicked system of things..</p>
              <p>i wont say he abolish the torah..he does fufils it..torah was originally made so if any imperfect man can keep all of it..he shall prove to be sinless...but no man can do it due to inherited sin..only when JC came..did this change...</p>
