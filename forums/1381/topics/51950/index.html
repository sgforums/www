            <div class='col-md body'>Spiritual Eavesdroppers [1 Thessalonians 1:2-10]<br><br>A 17th-century man found himself eavesdropping on several women who were having a spiritual conversation. Later he wrote:<br><br>Their talk was about a new birth, the work of God on their hearts . . . ; they talked how God had visited their souls with His love in the Lord Jesus, . . . they [spoke] . . . as if they found a new world.<br><br>Eventually the man came to know Jesus as Savior and his life was transformed. Later he was imprisoned for his faith and wrote the enduring classic PilgrimÂ’s Progress. This Â“spiritualÂ” eavesdropper was John Bunyan, the great Puritan writer.<br><br>Some of the most effective evangelism comes when curious seekers overhear our spiritual conversations. In those quiet moments of observation and listening, these people see in action what we sometimes do not see in ourselvesÂ—the life-changing reality of Jesus.<br><br>From the beginning, spiritual eavesdropping has played a vital role in the spread of the gospel. Initially, the apostles took the lead in preaching the gospel of grace in a pagan world. But their efforts were only the first step. As communities of faith were established throughout the Roman Empire, Christians won entire regions to Jesus. So much so that Paul would say to the church at Thessalonica, Â“The LordÂ’s message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and AchaiaÂ—your faith in God has become known everywhere. Therefore we do not need to say anything about itÂ” (1 Thessalonians 1:8 ).<br><br>Why were believers so effective in sharing their faith? Undoubtedly part of their success was that they stayed close to people who had Â“ears to hear.Â” Through daily conversations, spiritual seekers and eavesdroppers had their curiosity piqued, and they were eventually brought to faith in Jesus. You never know who may be listening.<br><br><a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/rbc/sj/today.php" rel="nofollow">Our Daily Journey Homepage</a></div>
