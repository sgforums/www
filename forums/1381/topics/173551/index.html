It could be that you are not ready to believe in him yet. But your last statement is a bit contradictory. If you do not believe in God, why are you asking for his help in the form of a miracle?<br><br>Believing in God is not about asking for miracles. Its about taking control of your life and learning how to deal with the problems you face.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with most of the replies here.... too many contradictions.<br><br>Don't believe in God and curse God when things go wrong just cannot be in the same statement.<br><br>We all have problems. What makes us what we are is how we deal with them. You already have a wonderful resource by your side - your dad. I have come across too many young chaps having issues with their parents and my heart is warmed by your statement that your dad is an understanding person. You need to confide with him more.<br><br>Beyond that, I don't think anyone here in EH can help, especially when we do not know the nature of your problems.<br><br>If you cannot share openly, may I suggest you PM some of us, I am sure sillyme, brey, mc, laoda or myself are willing to lend a listening year.</div>
