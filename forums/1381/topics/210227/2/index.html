If i put down my point, thats it, you dun agree, then its fine, i have no wish to take the discussion any further. Ginger is always old one spicy haha...so Uncle Chin Eng is still wiser....<br><br>anyway, those who wanna discuss, i would to open invitations to discuss face to face, not just in forums. Face to face does not mean all questions can be answered but i feel more sincerity in discussing it in person. Maybe I am not qualified but any of you sincere to meet up, I can arrange pastors, bible school students or teachers for discussion.</div>
