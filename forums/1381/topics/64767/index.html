He is not just going to provide us the need to eat, the need to breath but also the need for love, need for relationships, need for peace, need for happiness.<br><br>Whatever your needs are, the next time a desire pops up into your mind, tell the desire "I got a GOD who can give you to me if its according to His will, so I shall not worry."<br><br>"The next time you think of saying ," God I got a big problem.", why not try saying ," Problem, I got a BIGGER GOD."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nothing against what has been said above. But in recent years, I come to the understanding of the good old gospel of knowing that we have been saved from sins, will bear good fruits in the lives of many who believed. Many Christians nowadays are born again under the preaching of "need" gospel instead of gospel that preaches that we have sinned and require forgiveness from God through Jesus.<br><br>No doubt Jesus can meet all our needs but more importantly, we must recognise that He is the one that saved us from the certain death from hell's flames. So what if all your needs are met? God caused the sun to shine on the wicked and righteous anyway because he is good God. What's more important is that I am grateful to him having saved me more than he had met many of my needs. When I faced difficulties, it is a test of my faith and mature fruits develops from patience and longsuffering. If we've been persecuted, rejoice because we've been counted as worthy to partake of the Lord's suffering as the disciples have experienced.<br><br>I hope these old teachings and preachings will take root in all your hearts. The true gospels needs to be taught once again rather than the sweet sweet messages that pastors delivers from the pulpit to receive a better response from today's passive social settings.<br><br>God bless.</div>

The NEED to know that we've been saved from sin and death has been so neglected.<br><br>Please don't misunderstand I didn't set out to argue and I have no intention of discrediting anyone. What you've written and I totally agree with you. Its just that what I've written has been neglected from alot of preaching I hear nowadays. Hope you're not offended.</div>
