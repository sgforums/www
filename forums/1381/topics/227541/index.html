God gave us an image of himself to worship by becoming Jesus Christ. Is that idolatry?<br><br>God's commandment  is entirely connected to the worship of false gods. God does not prohibit images to be used in worship, but He prohibits the images themselves to be worshiped.<br><br>In the ark you are to put the commandments which I will give you. "You shall then make a propitiatory of pure gold, two cubits and a half long, and one and a half cubits wide. <strong>Make two cherubim </strong>of beaten gold for the two ends of the propitiatory, fastening them so that one cherub springs direct from each end. <strong>The cherubim shall have their wings spread out above</strong>, covering the propitiatory with them; they shall be turned toward each other, but with their faces looking toward the propitiatory. This propitiatory you shall then place on top of the ark. In the ark itself you are to put the commandments which I will give you. There I will meet you and there, from above the propitiatory, between the<strong> two cherubim on the ark </strong>of the commandments, I will tell you all the commands that I wish you to give the Israelites. "You shall also make a table of acacia wood, two cubits long, a cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high. Plate it with pure gold and make a molding of gold around it. Surround it with a frame, a handbreadth high, with a molding of gold around the frame. You shall also make four rings of gold for it and fasten them at the four corners, one at each leg, on two opposite sides of the frame as holders for the poles to carry the table. These poles for carrying the table you shall make of acacia wood and plate with gold. Of pure gold you shall make its plates and cups, as well as its pitchers and bowls for pouring libations. On the table you shall always keep showbread set before me. "You shall make a lampstand of pure beaten gold-its shaft and branches-with its cups and knobs and petals springing directly from it.Six branches are to extend from the sides of the lampstand, three branches on one side, and three on the other<br>Exodus 25 17:26<br><br>God allows the building of angels and cherubims.....as long as the Israeilites do not worship it, there is no problem. Also note how God wants his temple to be filled with Gold and riches. Our churches too are the same. Before u criticse a Catholic church for having too many paintings etc, remember we are doing as God desired.<br><br>You do salute your flag; you do build in bronze and stone the figures of those who had prominence in your world, so why cannot you build in bronze and stone the images of the personages of Heaven? If images of Rock Stars are good but those of the Holiest of Saints are flawed....how Satan has succeeded....<br></div>
