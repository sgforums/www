There will always be people like raptured who take things too seriously, and this will apply no matter who he listens to or which church he attends, he cannot discern what is joke and what is fact and he will keep making this mistake until he decides to take stock of his own attitude and his own thought processes. I do not think what ps prince said during that particular sermon was OTT. Most natural NORMAL people would have understood it as a joke. I do no think that ps prince is in any way irresponsible when he preaches. He does consider what he says. Sometimes he can tell really corny jokes, but hey, we all do that too....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Same here. God did not intend to create people who look bad. God definitely does not take pleasure in painful diseases inflicted on his creation. These things happen bcos we live in a sinful world. &amp; the curse of Adam brought abt all these things not God. So yes, God created men for his pleasure but no God doesn't create men to be born ugly or be sick. It wasnt his original intent.<br><br>Similarly God did not create people to smoke.</div>

Will they also laugh? Will they feel stupid or mocked? Ps Prince even talked abt putting the cancer stick into one's mouth, implying smokers are foolish. He even said the devil uses smokers who have smoked a lot but is still living healthily to a ripe old age but aren't Christians to tempt Christian smokers to smoke since nothing happened to these people. &amp; once these Christians smoke, the devil will take away their lives or give them disease. You can verify on the audio CD for yourself.</div>

There will always be people like raptured who take things too seriously, and this will apply no matter who he listens to or which church he attends, he cannot discern what is joke and what is fact and he will keep making this mistake until he decides to take stock of his own attitude and his own thought processes. I do not think what ps prince said during that particular sermon was OTT. Most natural NORMAL people would have understood it as a joke. I do no think that ps prince is in any way irresponsible when he preaches. He does consider what he says. Sometimes he can tell really corny jokes, but hey, we all do that too....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>Why was he telling that joke in the first place? To tell the smokers what they were doing is wrong. This is is basic premise or why would he tell this joke? Sometimes people use jokes to defuse the tension instead of barking at the smoker to change. His style is not to use angry language like: SMOKING IS A SIN! IF YOU SMOKE YOU SIN! This is the blunt fiery style of certain preachers. If Ps Prince start barking &amp; shouting, i think a lot of people will leave his church.<br><br>He uses the joke to make the smoker feel stupid but not offended with him which will then make the smoker want to change on his own. This is a good tactic without offending the smokers too much.</div>
