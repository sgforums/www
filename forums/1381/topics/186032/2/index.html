            <div class='col-md body'>Smoking, like some other practices such as masturbation are not mentioned in the Bible. But their absence from the Scripture doesnt warrant them non-sins.<br><br>The Christian life is a personal relationship between God and Man bridged together throught the reconciling sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross. Does smoking, an act that harms the body God created and given us glorifies God? If it does, by all means do it.<br><br>We are all given a conscience and by nature we all know what is pleasing to God and what is not. need i say more?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

But of cos, there are many camps in this issue. Feel free to differ.<br><br></div></blockquote>Thank you MC for the well raised references. Yes, it would seem right that the best wine - is the best wine. Nothing diluted should come from the heart of Christ.<br><br>"Onios" suggested full bodied, old wine - and it appears to me that the men of those times are "good" drinkers (180 gallons) perhaps because wine is one of their staple diet (as wine was much easier to come by than drinking water).<br><br>The Bible didnt stipulate that the wedding guests finished up all 180 gallons - and perhaps it just signified that Jesus blessed overflowingly.<br><br>But the alcohlic content of even the best wine then, might not be as high as those of ours today - due to global warming - as some scientist believed.<br><br></div>

THEY clearly stated BGR is not the calling of God, study hard and honor your parents is the Calling. The youth pastor did not state it is a sin. Fair Enough.<br><br>But the implications of the teaching made youths believe that going into BGR before they're 'of age' is WRONG. This is WRONG.<br>So whoever in the youth ministry engages into BGR, the leaders will zealously seperate the couple, or counsel them(to breakup) or to monitor the couple closely. Youth who have relationship were finger pointed and given 'one kind of look.'<br>Instead of tackling this man-made standard in a positive note, which the Youths could appreciate and have a objective view about BGRs. They were misled to think BGR are evil and harmful.<br>This man-made standard that could have prevented youthful lust and many heartaches, to a misguided context of a Godly Issue.<br><br>When these issues have no clear instructions. It is all up to the wisdom and knowledge of THE believer to safe guard himself, live life according to the word and be accountable to the holy spirit.<br><br>My point being, anything and everything could be harmful. eg. Partake too much oily food, delibrate bad sleeping habits, careless habit of managing our health.<br><br>Smoking is not a sin. Yes, i agree with you vince.<br>Once again, my view is:-<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If the believer thinks he could live with smoking and truthfully worship God at the same. So be it.<br>Is it sin then? I don't know, however, i'm sure that it displeases God. And God desire him to be perfect; recieve full blessings of health.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If he feels the need to change, then let him be dealt by God in the closet.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If he knows God is dealing with him about the habits which displeases Him(God), YET he delibrately continue in his ways.
