So the devil has every power in this case to hurt Christians who turned away. Even more so on non believers.<br><br>Salvation is not the issue here. Yes, we can still be saved despite turning away into sins. But there is a powerful enemy around who can attack the believer &amp; give disease &amp; death.</div>

Even so, who caused that person to commit suicide? Will any sane, happy man commit suicide? Who gives madness or depression? Not God but the devil right? So the devil indirectly caused the person's death. Don't u think that is some form of power? As i said, unless u say God takes lives or who takes it then, if not the devil?<br><br>I agree that God can take lives. Look at the Flood! But those were non believers. Noah was saved, so were Enoch etc. God killed many many evil people like King Ahab, his wife etc. But this was done thru a demon, for eg. the angel of death in the last plague of Egypt. The Jews were protected from this demon by the blood of the passover lamb or they would have died also.<br><br>I am not saying it's wrong to pray against the devil or disease, but why? If the devil didnt give the disease but God did, so there is really no point praying about it or against it bcos who can fight against the will of God?</div>

So how to turn his eyes upon Jesus? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> He can only see the devil since he is a child of the devil. So he is partially correct when he says the devil made him do it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Jesus spoke of the priests &amp; pharisees as children of the devil not Abraham. So they are just like the devil who opposes God &amp; Christ. They lie, they spit, they hit, they crucify etc. They also don't repent. So in a sense, the devil made them do it. You know what Jesus said before He died, He said, "Forgive them for they do not know what they are doing." So how come they don't know, bcos they really didnt know!

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Raptured,<br><br>Let me just summarise my response in this post to your comments in 2 postings.<br><br>i raised a suicide subject to make a point, didnt say u said it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>There is no deny from me, that the devil can do something to make men fall.  What i am basically saying, is that men has also a part to play.  My worry, is that if we always push all the blame to the devil, we are in danger of denying the purpose of our will and the ability to flee from sin.  We are also in the danger of not realising our own mistakes - like pride, selfishness - these are intrinsic in men, which the devil can use to trick and tempt.<br><br>Let us talk about this "power" that you mentioned. What kind of power ? Yes, the power is great in terms of influences - because relatively, men are weak. The devil's "power" however, cannot control men and is nothing comparable to God's. Refer to 1 Tim 4:1<br><br>Whether we are believers or not, we all are vulnerable to the lies and attacks of the devil.  What we are saying here is that the devil cannot own the power of God - unless God allow it to be so - as in Job.  But we are also created in God's image and with the power to resist.<br><br>Are you really sure, that the man who committed adultery is not a believer ? i didnt say so. Do you know how many believers commited adultery? Plenty ! And it is just not realistic to play ostrich to this fact.  Look at ourselves - are you a believer ? Are you vulnerable to sin ?  I would very much believe that the answer is yes.  That is why, God cautioned us to flee in 2 Timothy 22.  If God didnt know that we have the means to do so, he would not have asked Timothy to do so.<br><br>For a pre-believer, i am not so quick to jump into a conclusion, that the devil has great power over them.  There are laws and ethics instituted through the hearts of men, to provide directions.  Good men dont always come through the believers pool - look at the Samaritans in the Bible.  That is why for believers, discipleship is important. It is ultimately, the choice of men to do what is right and in our case, as believers to follow God's righteousness.<br><br></div>

I understand.<br><br>Well, i agree that we have a part to play. But i was talking abt Job who didnt sin or was considered righteous by God Himself. How come satan can still hurt him? If satan could hurt Job already, how much more the non believer or sinning Christian? I wasnt talking abt the responsibility of our sins but the power of the devil. Sin or no sin, he can still attack &amp; hurt.<br><br>I only agree to your second pt partially. Bcos the devil really has some power in controlling men, more so the non believer.

It is stated very clearly, that the devil is able to hurt Job because God ALLOW the devil to do so.  And what do you mean "could hurt Job already....how much more non believer or sinning Christian?"  Please elaborate further.<br><br>For your reference, the responsibility of our sin - AND that being our relationship with our Lord is directly connected to the influence that the devil has as stronghold in your life.  I dont agree that you can talk about the power of the devil without a direct link to who we are and our God given responsibilities.  Yes, you raised a great point ! - Without God we are nothing !  But that realisation, my friend is not "inherited" - but often through a journey with Christ.

So he doesnt need God's permission to hurt them or kill them. So the devil can play havoc with them. U see what i mean?<br><br>Yes i agree to your 2nd para but can what we do really affect our standing with God or help to protect us from the devil? Can our works help in our fight against the devil? Cannot right? Only Jesus' work on the cross right? Arent our sins forgiven also when we confess? Thanks for your comment that i am right that w/o God we are nothing, w/c serves to emphasize that we can do nothing to help in the spiritual battle except to pray etc.<br><br>So the devil has some power right over unbelievers' lives? Even if it's to cause madness or possession etc. We need Christ to deliver us. Only Jesus can set us free. We cant set ourselves free.<br><br>Yes, i agree we r all created in the image of God but don't forget man has fallen from this image. He has fallen from his place since Adam's time until Christ Jesus came to die for us &amp; heal us by His blood &amp; wash us clean. Sinful man is covered with sin. They cannot be like God anymore.<br><br>Good or bad makes no diff bcos we are all under the devil once. Once one becomes a Christian, he has a new identity &amp; no longer under the devil but in Christ Jesus. So no matter how good one is, he cannot be saved.<br><br>I think Jesus told the parable of the Good Samaritan to tell the people who our neighbours are in response to a self righteous pharisee's question. Arh, don't need PM lah.
