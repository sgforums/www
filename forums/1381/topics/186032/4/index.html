I wasn't criticising Ps Prince in the first place! I agree with what he was saying that MEN WERE NOT CREATED TO SMOKE, even if it's just a joke. Ppl were criticising me for what Ps Prince said instead. I agree with Ps Prince that smoking is harmful altho he didnt say it's a sin. I agree it's a CANCER STICK. I agree that the devil uses hard core smokers to tempt Christian smokers &amp; then giving them disease &amp; death. SO DID I CRITICISE PS PRINCE? I SUPPORT HIM FULLY IN THIS AREA OF SMOKING.<br><br>Yes, i have already moved on. But who knows God can always call me to go back there as i did.</div>

He can take away everything but not his life. God still protected Job's life altho his health suffered greatly.<br><br>Job chap 2:<br><br>1 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord. 2 And the Lord said to Satan, "From where do you come?" So Satan answered the Lord and said, "From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it." 3 Then the Lord said to Satan, "Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil? And still he holds fast to his integrity, although you incited Me against him, to destroy him without cause." <strong>4 So Satan answered the Lord and said, "Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life. 5 But stretch out Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will surely curse You to Your face!" 6 And the Lord said to Satan, "Behold, he is in your hand, but <span style="font-style: italic;">spare his life</span>." </strong><br><br>7 So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord, and struck Job with painful boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. 8 And he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape himself while he sat in the midst of the ashes. 9 Then his wife said to him, "Do you still hold fast to your integrity? Curse God and die!" 10 But he said to her, "You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Shall we indeed accept good from God, and shall we not accept adversity?" In all this Job did not sin with his lips.<br><br>11 Now when Job's three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him, each one came from his own place--Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment together to come and mourn with him, and to comfort him. 12 And when they raised their eyes from afar, and did not recognize him, they lifted their voices and wept; and each one tore his robe and sprinkled dust on his head toward heaven. 13 So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Rap....<br>I don't know where you're getting your facts from.<br><br>You need to go back one chapter<br>Job 1<br>6 One day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them. 7 The LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?"  Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."<br>8 Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil."<br>9 "Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied. 10 "Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land. 11 But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face."<br>12 The LORD said to Satan, "<strong>Very well, then, everything he has is in your hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger." </strong>  Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.<br><br>The only reason why Satan has no power to take life unless God specifically <strong>allowed</strong> him to do it. Therefore Satan has no power to take or preserve life.</div>

Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."<br>8 Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil."<br>9 "Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied. 10 "Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land. 11 But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face."<br>12 The LORD said to Satan, "[b]Very well, then, everything he has is in your hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger." </strong>  Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.<br><br>The only reason why Satan has no power to take life unless God specifically <strong>allowed</strong> him to do it. Therefore Satan has no power to take or preserve life.[/b]</blockquote>So you mean it's God who takes lives &amp; gives disease? Then why pray against the disease? Then why are the charismatics &amp; other Christians praying against the devil when they get serious diseases? Can i say satan has no power over the lives of Christians but has some power over the lives of non believers instead?</div>
