              <p>By choosing Christianity, you already disregard the thousands of

              <p>The idea that the bible is god's voice does seem like a good

              and set in stone. Yet for the millions upon billions that have
              examined it, thousands have gone to war over what it says, putting
              so much faith into it that they sacrifice their lives for it. For
              it to be truly a work of God, the message has to be an unequivocal
              one and not one that changes every few centuries or so.</p>

              <p>Perhaps your arguement is about religion being good or not. Well actually quite true, perhaps the meaning has already changed or affected in a way since the passing of time. Humans abuse it to furfil their own needs. Its human nature anyway.</p>

              <p>the ''gamble'' wif marriage has high stakes too...divorce is usually not juz simply signing the papers and going separate ways...wad abt the kids? tink of the emotional trauma they have to go through and more often than not, they are innocent. moreover, the couple who were divorced. can they still go thru life as if nth has happened? the divorce can scar both of them for life.</p>
              <p>if the reason for not ''gambling'' when it comes to religion is because its sth serious/solemn, then isnt marriage suppose to be solemn as well? its ironic that despite overwhelming evidence of increasing divorcè rates, ppl still ''gamble'' in a lifelong blissful marriage without the need for evidence? however, when it comes to religion, no ''gamble'' is to be taken??? hmmm....</p>

              <p>so the problem lies in the belief that there is only 1 God? To satisfy you, maybe one should embrace multiple faith in order not to "disregard the
                                      thousands of other religions that might exist"??</p>
              <p>otherwise adhering to any faith alone automatically "disregard the
                                      thousands of other religions that might exist"....why not the other faith?</p>
              <p>it would be contradictory to says we need evidence to believe
                                      and yet don't need evidence not to believe......</p>
              <p>for believing in God, of course we have evidence and are convinced. what convinced us may not convince you.....that's all.</p>
              <p>if i am convinced that "idea of invisible and intangible aliens walking among us on earth" is real, why should i not believe in them?</p>
              <p>my believe is true to me but may not be for you....and likewise, what you disbelieve does not mean it is false.....and vice-versa.</p>
              <p>believing in God is not a gamble but we know and are convinced that He exist. even if i cannot convince you, at least you can say that this is a calculated gamble.....</p>
              <p>just like your reason for taking a gamble on marriage.....you will not marry anyone who cannot convince you that he/she is the right partner for you.... it may fail but at the point of agreeing to marry, you are convinced it is the right choice.</p>
              <p>so, it not a wager on God....it is faith in Him and faith in our choice.</p>
              <p>as for the Bible, it is not a science or geography book whatsoever....it is a theological book that teaches faith. the teachings according to the church has not changed and certainly is not proven "to be
              treading on thin ice".... as i said before, many people have made use of the Bible to create
                                      trouble including false preacher and 
              anti-christians.... but they
                                      do not represent the truth of the Bible. the Bible teaches love your neighbour.....</p>
              <p>for me personally, the authority on the teaching of the Bible rest on the Church. it is God that we worship and not the Bible.</p>

              <p>I really appreciate your reply....Yes its that the God we worship....Bible is his words...If you truly rely on God..You will not be<span lang="EN-US"> Trembled by the false preachers or Anti christians... It is the spirit of God who teaches the "God's word". </span></p>
              <p>It is the real love letter from God to his children.... All the words are true....</p>
              <p>Even I got into the trap of false preachers...They have given false connectors and introduce a new thing in Bible....Some Anti christians offered me another book which helps us to understand the Bible clearly..But I rejected them saying that Bible is more than enough and it has the answers for all my questions....</p>
              <p>There is no preacher is required more than the "Holy Spirit".. He will make you understand everything God said in "Bible"....</p>
