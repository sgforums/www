They cannot say for sure that wat they believe is the absolute truth and as such, discussion can test their theories and gain better understanding. Even Einstein and probably the whole world do discuss/debate in order to get better understanding. Even the highest church council also do debate and discuss  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If one felt tat wat his belief is true and all the other must be false, then tis guy is blind, arrogant and thought he neve made a mistake in his life.</div>

But what if the relative truth is absolute? </blockquote>Tat is the thing. They believe tat their truth is absolute, but wat if it is relative ? R they god ? They never made mistake ? As human, even stated in the bible, r prone to err. In such a complicated issue, no one can surely say they have the absolute truth. Isn't it a good means to test it out ? If it is the truth, it can stand the test. Why so afraid of discussing ?<br><br><blockquote>The strong point is your einstien and church thingy, but i need you to include more stuffs(like discuss about wad) b4 i can argue. Thanks </blockquote>They discuss about policy and science. So wat r u gonna argue about ?<br><br><blockquote>Your first para, they believe that the truth is absolute, therefore, they are not sure wad they believe is absolute</blockquote>Everybody believe tat their truth is absolute. Who will wanna believe in the wrong thing ? However everybody have to realise the important point tat the truth they believe in is relative. Muslim believe their religion is correct and it is the absolute truth. Christians, buddhists, cultists, Jews etc as followed. But the absolute truth can be only 1 or none of them. Doesn't tat show either most of them, or all of them have relative truth and r really far off from absolute truth. As said again. Unless u r blind, conceited, arrogant or thought u never made a mistake in your life, u cannot say u have the absolute truth absolutely.</div>
