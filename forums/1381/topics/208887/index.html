            <div class='col-md body'>I have read of an analogy where good and evil is compared to heat and cold. Cold is the default. Things get warmer only when heat is transferred upon it. So as mentioned by someone else earlier, the argument is that evil, like cold, is the default. It is not a thing and therefore not created. Creations are argued by some to be things to change this default, like bringing warm to something cold.<br>My personal thought on this argument is that if good is to be compared to the warmth of the sun, then should it be taken in moderation as in its analogy? Too much heat is certainly not an ideal situation. Should "good" and god's love be therefore taken with moderations too? For example, life is normally associated with good. God created life to fill a world that was by default without it. But without the end of life, ie. death, the world would be an overpopulated place. Certainly the argument goes that since we cannot die if the world is without death, we can forget about starvation, which is generally associated with overpopulation. But one day, the population of Earth would grow till the extend where we would have no space to move isn't it?</div>

A baby when born is born good according even to Confucius. Like a fresh bun from hot oven it is hot in the beginning but leave it in the polluted cold air it becomes cold &amp; dirty.<br><br>Why should there be moderation of something good? Do u know lukewarm coffee tastes horrible? Jesus also says He would rather some Christian be hot or cold but not lukewarm or He will spit him out of his mouth. Wont u rather drink hot coffee or cold coffee but not lukewarm coffee?<br><br>As even others here say, God can create more planets for us if overpopulated. God can even create an infinite universe for all of us to stay in with unlimited food, water, resources etc. Bcos He is God!</div>
