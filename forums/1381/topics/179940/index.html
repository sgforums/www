Hahah.</div></blockquote>Let's look at an instance of this problem. In II Sam 21:8, the NIV says that David took the five sons of Saul's daughter Merab. Many translations translate it as the five sons of Michal. Why the difference? The NIV has a footnote. It tells us that two Hebrew manuscripts say "Merab," but that most Hebrew manuscripts say "Michal." That explains why it is usually translated "Michal." The difference is important. Why? Because II Samuel 6:23 tells us that "Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death." That contradicts the verse that says she had 5 children as recorded in most of the manuscripts. So, in most translations, there is a clear contradiction here. One verse says Michal never had any chidden. The other verse says she had five. The NIV came along and said there was a reason for this error. It says the other translations selected the wrong manuscripts. (I disagree. I think the majority of the translators and the majority of the manuscripts are correct.) You see the point. The translators of the NIV recognized the error of II Sam 21:8, and blamed it on the manuscript source that was selected by other translators. [2] So a possible source of error is that translators selected the wrong manuscripts. Your Bible may be using the wrong source.</div>
