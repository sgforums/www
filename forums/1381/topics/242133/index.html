Not true on the first statement. He was considered a BISHOP and not really an overseer. Ignatius wrote much on the role of bishops. I do concede that he did not hold the title of Pope but rather the Bishop of Rome (which is where papal power derives from). Naturally thats another issue.<br><br>Ignatius and Clement made it clear that Catholics alone recieve salvation and condemned other forms of christianity (heresy) to damnation. They did not consider Marcionites or the Gnostics as being saved. This clearly disproves your arguments on them refering to a Universal Church. Instead they refered to orthodox christianity, namely Catholicism. Naturally the CC does not hold such an extreme view haha or else Trent would have condemned every protestant to hell haha.<br><br><blockquote>Ignatius of Antioch -<br><br>Be not deceived, my brethren: <strong>If anyone follows a maker of schism [i.e., is a schismatic], he does not inherit the kingdom of God; if anyone walks in strange doctrine [i.e., is a heretic], he has no part in the Passion </strong>[of Christ]. Take care, then, to use one Eucharist, so that whatever you do, you do according to God: For there is one flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ, and one cup in the union of his blood; one altar, as there is one bishop, with the presbytery and my fellow servants, the deacons (Letter to the Philadelphians 3:3-4:1 [A.D. 110]).</blockquote>Which brings me back to my question, is there any verses to support this doctrine?</div>

On the contrary Irenaus and Ignatius continue to poin to one visible structure with authority and ONE set of doctrines.
