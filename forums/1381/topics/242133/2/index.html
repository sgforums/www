Ignatius of Antioch (martyred c.107) was also bishop of the city, and a prominent apostolic father. By the 4th century, the bishop of Antioch had become the most senior bishop in a region covering modern-day eastern Turkey, Lebanon, Israel and Palestine, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Iran. His hierarchy served the largest number of Christians in the known world at that time. In consideration of this and its ancient origins, <strong>the Patriarchs of Antioch were considered the most senior of the various Patriarchs of Christendom</strong>, which included those of the Patriarch of Jerusalem, the Patriarch of Constantinople, the Patriarch of Alexandria, and the Patriarch of Rome.</blockquote></div>

Rev 14:8<br><br>The great city 9 was split into three parts, and the gentile cities fell. But God remembered great Babylon, giving it the cup filled with the wine of his fury and wrath. Rev 16:19<br><br>On her forehead was written a name, which is a mystery, "Babylon the great, the mother of harlots and of the abominations of the earth." Rev 17:5<br><br>Chap 18<br>He cried out in a mighty voice: "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great. She has become a haunt for demons. She is a cage for every unclean spirit, a cage for every unclean bird, (a cage for every unclean) and disgusting (beast).<br><br>They will keep their distance for fear of the torment inflicted on her, and they will say: "Alas, alas, great city, Babylon, mighty city. In one hour your judgment has come<br><br>A mighty angel picked up a stone like a huge millstone and threw it into the sea and said: "With such force will Babylon the great city be thrown down, and will never be found again</blockquote>This show that "Babylon" meant Rome. Rome was the "great city" of the New Testament period. Because Rome during this age was considered the center of the world, the Lord wanted His Church to be established in Rome.<br><br>But Vince, the reason why Rome was powerful was solely because Peter and his successors ruled there. For example, after the 4th century, Constantipole became so powerful that it was included in the Patriach system but even then it could not displace Rome as she had Peter.<br></div>
