              <p>Hi Totti, the part about going to hell if you don't believe, is part of our belief system. To tell you otherwise would be a lie on our part. However, if you do not believe in our heaven or our hell, it doesn't matter in that sense.</p>
              <p>To emphasize as well, it is not that we wish or curse you to go to hell, which has a very different meaning. Rather, it is something we do not want to see.</p>
              <p>There is also more to Christianity than just the concept of heaven and hell.</p>
              <p>I do hope you will meet more Christians that do not conform to the stereotypes that is mentioned by some people here.</p>

              <p>For example, things like how to live your daily life, how to treat your family. It is also about community and fellowship (something not unique to Christians or church-goers). Like I said, if I told you Christianity did not state non-believers go to hell, it would be a lie. I do though feel the need to be careful if ever to tell people this.</p>
              <p>To view all other religions as satanic is not something all Christians do either. Something i hope you can understand.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, there are Christians who even though the belief system may differ, respect your respective beliefs or choice not to believe at all. I myself respect your right not to believe in any God or any divine being.</p>
              <p>The part about being scared of hell in order to believe, well that is not what happens for all Christians either. It can also be about embracing God and what he has done for us. As an analogy, sometimes it is not the punishment you fear when you do something wrong, but the fear of hurting or upsetting someone you say you love.</p>

              <p>Actually, there are those who are non-Christians who would care. Although the reasons and intent is different even among themselves.</p>

              <p>For example, things like how to live your daily life, how to treat your family. It is also about community and fellowship (something not unique to Christians or church-goers). Like I said, if I told you Christianity did not state non-believers go to hell, it would be a lie. I do though feel the need to be careful if ever to tell people this.</p>
              <p>To view all other religions as satanic is not something all Christians do either. Something i hope you can understand.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, there are Christians who even though the belief system may differ, respect your respective beliefs or choice not to believe at all. I myself respect your right not to believe in any God or any divine being.</p>
              <p>The part about being scared of hell in order to believe, well that is not what happens for all Christians either. It can also be about embracing God and what he has done for us. As an analogy, sometimes it is not the punishment you fear when you do something wrong, but the fear of hurting or upsetting someone you say you love.</p>

              <p>Finally...someone who actually makes sense...</p>
              <p>Personally, I don't give a damn about who believes in what....but one thing the Christians have to note is....sometimes they are over-zealous in promoting their religion.</p>
              <p>This is also the reason why most people are pissed, because in the process of promoting Christianity, Christians tend to disregard other religions and the listener's beliefs/feelings.</p>

              <p>Just to add, Ghandi himself drew inspiration and teachings from the bible among drawing from other faiths as well. He ultimately never converted to any other and remained a Hindu.</p>
