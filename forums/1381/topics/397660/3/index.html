              <p>Chilli ? Sure we dont hate chilli, but there comes a promoter keep pestering you about chilli, all those actions made us have some untasty impression of chilli. It just made us wonder, why dint other brands of chilli have promoters promoting but only this specific brand ? Not talking about their methods used to promote their chilli.</p>
              <p>So in the end is the chilli bad ? I dono. Is the promoter wrong ? Maybe. Is the tatics used annoying and unpleasing ? Hell yes.</p>

              <p> those christians are being brain washed to an extent that they believed that they are trying to save you from going to eternall hell. at least this intention is good, but whether this is the truth is another matter altogether. perception is reality to them, but is this reality? hell no to non believers and other faith mind you.</p>
