                                      believe in hell or not. Which makes those "Christians" hypocrites,

              <p>Just as Christ did, he didn't go about telling people they are
                                      going to hell. He didn't spread the word of God through fear as
                                      many "Christians" do today, he did it through love. He ate with
                                      thieves and whores, showing them love. Which Christians need to
                                      start doing or they will be hated/rejected. </p>

                                      by the way they act. God hates the world? What Bible are they
                                      reading ... ? In the Bible I read it says "For God so

              <p>do u think u're ignoring the forest for the tree? there're Christian groups / individuals who are doing what Jesus did, just as there are irritating Christians who try to "force their beliefs" upon you or fleece you of your money. </p>
              <p>and anyway, it's fallacious ad hominem argument again when you focus on their behaviour and ignore the content of their "preaching". There're always over zealous militants in every system of beliefs (e.g. fundamentalist atheists, Christians). But dont you think you should respond to what (who) they believe rather than how they behave? </p>
              <p>On your last point, I do think God hates the world. If one loves children, one has to hate those who abuse them. If one loves life, one has to hate the act of removal of it. To qualify my point, God hates evil and those who perpetrate such deeds. I dont think this sounds politically correct and pleasing to the ears, but if it's the truth that one has hear, to not say it would make me a hypocrite. </p>

              <p>do u think u're ignoring the forest for the tree? there're
              Christian groups / individuals who are doing what Jesus did, just
              as there are irritating Christians who try to "force their beliefs"
              upon you or fleece you of your money. </p>
              <p>and anyway, it's fallacious ad hominem argument again when you
              focus on their behaviour and ignore the content of their
              "preaching". There're always over zealous militants in every system
              of beliefs (e.g. fundamentalist atheists, Christians). But dont you
              think you should respond to what (who) they believe rather than how
              they behave? </p>
              <p>On your last point, I do think God hates the world. If one loves
              children, one has to hate those who abuse them. If one loves life,
              one has to hate the act of removal of it. To qualify my point, God
              hates evil and those who perpetrate such deeds. I dont think this
              sounds politically correct and pleasing to the ears, but if it's
              the truth that one has hear, to not say it would make me a
              hypocrite. </p>

              <p>I am pretty sure it's because a lot of Christian force their
              beliefs on other people and tell them they are going to hell if
              they do this or that. No one wants to hear that, whether you
              believe in hell or not. Which makes those "Christians" hypocrites,
              another reason they are hated.</p>
              <p>Just as Christ did, he didn't go about telling people they are
              going to hell. He didn't spread the word of God through fear as
              many "Christians" do today, he did it through love. He ate with
              thieves and whores, showing them love. Which Christians need to
              start doing or they will be hated/rejected. </p>
              <p>If I thought that's how Christians acted I would hate them to.
              But people need to realize not all Christians are like that. In
              fact I don't think many Christians deserve to be called Christians
              by the way they act. God hates the world? What Bible are they
              reading ... ? In the Bible I read it says "For God so
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">loved</span></strong> the world" I
              can't recall it saying God hated the world anywhere. Those people
              make real Christians look so bad...</p>

              <p>Yes, in John 3:16 "For god so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son Jesus Christ, that whosoever believeth shall not perish but have everlasting life", but please look in the context, in here it is written that he loved us, but unless we truly repent, we cannot receive thy love for us, and also what leads us to repent is by his grace.

              <p>you're right. I dislike the followers too. But i also dislike those who preach against such people in the name of religious tolerance when they themselves are demonstrating the very same inconsistency and intolerance that they preach against (e.g. the New Atheists). So I guess it's not a "religious-folk" problem but a problem inherent to human nature. </p>
              <p>To say they're following Jesus is also not wrong because that what Jesus Himself did - went around criticizing the religious order of the day (the pious and the self-righteous) and to tell people that they needed to repent. </p>

              <p>who says that the bible never documented about going to hell</p>
              <p>Romans 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death", this death refers
              to hell and eternal death.</p>
              <p>Yes, in John 3:16 "For god so loved the world, that he gave his
              only begotten son Jesus Christ, that whosoever believeth shall not
              perish but have everlasting life", but please look in the context,
              in here it is written that he loved us, but unless we truly repent,
              we cannot receive thy love for us, and also what leads us to repent
              is by his grace. I want to emphasize this point: The central idea
              of Christianity is love. This is why we love our neighbours as
              thyself, we forgive our debtors (Exodus 20). </p>
              <p>But caution is also needed to look closely at bible, at various
              junctions it advocated for us to preach to others.</p>
              <p>I will like to point out that while jesus ate with thieves and
              etc , it is all out of his love for them, but if we have sinned
              against him and refused to repent, we will suffer hell also.</p>
              <p>I knew exactly who are you. You are a atheist whom wanted to
              refute the true words of god by using his words by a different
              meaning, Just like Satan tempted Jesus thrice, all of you atheists
              want to tempt us to waver, but it is
              a pathetically and futile attempt, as in the end ,
              Jesus prevail, so as us</p>
              <p>May the spirit of God help me in my ministry and be my comforter
              in my crusade against atheists.  </p>
