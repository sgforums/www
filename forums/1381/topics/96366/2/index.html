On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. 13There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south and three on the west. 14The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.<br>15The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city, its gates and its walls. 16The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia[1] in length, and as wide and high as it is long. 17He measured its wall and it was 144 cubits[2] thick,[3] by man's measurement, which the angel was using. 18The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass. 19The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, 20the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.[4] 21The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of pure gold, like transparent glass.<br>22I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. 23The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp. 24The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it. 25On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there. 26The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it. 27Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life.<br>1Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb 2down the middle of the great street of the city. On each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations. 3No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his servants will serve him. 4They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. 5There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign for ever and ever. 6The angel said to me, "These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent his angel to show his servants the things that must soon take place." </span><br><br>From the description, it appears tat heaven is just all decorative... they have a gem here and there, streets make of glass or gold etc.. tat is it... All the names tat appear in the book still manage to go there and they go there to be god's slave. There is no other desciption on it anymore. Doesn't tat sounds like "america" to the chinese in the past ?</div>

They r committing evil when they r naked isn't it ? Tat is why they cover themselves up with when they ate the fruit. I was wondering why does god want them to create evil by making them naked... If they do not know wat is good and evil, they would not have realise tat the snake is making them commit evil when it asked them to eat the fruit. The snake do not know tat he has committed an evil deed by asking eve to eat either. He is probably driven by an inate drive to eat only. They would not have realise tat eating the fruit is an evil deed. They would not have know tat being disobedient to god is a wrong act to do. SO can we blame them for eating the fruit ?

Adam only do not know wat is good or bad, tat doesn't mean he cannot control his hands or legs to commit evil like killing eve. One day if he is curious and want to try out wat happened to eve when he strangle her, he will do it as there is nothing holding him back</div></blockquote>The point is, everyone of us including baby are carrying the original sin from the "apple", that's why the evil part already with us since we are born. Before that, Adam and Eve didn't carry any sin any evil, and they are knowing what is good (not like you said, they don't know both good and evil).<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">There is no assumption here. Adam and eve know of the warning. I never say they don't. However the snake deceived them tat they will not get punish for it. So the warning has been waived. They thought they r free to eat the fruits. They don't know the snake could be lying. The snake can know about the punishment but he surely don't know it is wrong to deceive eve to eat the fruit. The fact remains tat they don't know it is wrong and they get punish for something god had intended all along</div></blockquote>You know the laws prevent you to steal, but the Ah Beng tell you it is ok to steal, will you listen to Ah Beng? If you listen to Ah Beng, then it is your choice that you make and you must face the consequences and be responsible for it.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>stupidissmart, sorry for the poor formatting n layout</strong><br><br>quote:<br>----<br><strong>Simple... the whole idea of a heaven and its expectations is flawed  I don't believe tat heaven will exists when people r its resident.<br>But however if u force me to say which group of people to go in, then I will suggest people who had done good deeds substantially more than bad ones regardless of religion should be in. But then heaven is still not going to be your idea of heaven even in tis case, but more close to it.  </strong><br>------<br>You are not obliged to use the word Â“forceÂ” if you <strong>dun believe in existence of Heaven</strong>. I have no right nor authority to force you to say things tt does nt reflect ur beliefsÂ…no gun pointing at u. If your belief is strong, neither words nor physical threat can deter it. <strong>So, letÂ’s take it you are not so sure whether Heaven existÂ…50/50</strong><br><br><strong>IF your type of heaven exists</strong>, in your Â‘proposalÂ’, <strong>you decide who to go since you suggest</strong>, to keep track the entire human raceÂ’s merit points and demerit points. Wait, do you know how much u have got in total now? Who told u? U know how many points for telling a seemingly harmless lie u make which might have devastating effect on someone in future and a seemingly small help from u, which u dun know tt will greatly benefit many people out there. A good guy does good deeds his whole life, but killed his love enemy becoz of love. Good, bad? 49.93% good? Sometimes, a guy who normally does good things can do something really really bad, and a guy who normally does bad things can do something really really good. Do u know a guy who does good things also can dun like someone who also normally does good things? Wun your heaven be chaotic as well?<br><br>You sat in a bus full of people, a feeble ah ma boards the bus, nobody including you offers the seat to her, bus jams brake suddenly. She falls down and sprains her back. Whose fault? Bus driver or/and every of you who never offers the seat to her? How are the demerit points going to be allocated? People sitting far away says Â“I shld take less fault man, people nearer her shld offer.Bus so crowded, very <strong>MAH FAN</strong>Â”Â….the person who forced the bus driver to brake? Does he know his mistake already caused harm to others? How how how how? For that case how? Total how?<br><br>To God, we are all sinners and fall short of His glory. He treats each and every one of us equal. How about those non-Christians? Jesus said "To him who has, shall more be given" (Mark 4:25). To non-Christian who response to the truth of Christ, but do not know about Christ, does not experience ChristÂ’s salvation and the forgiveness of sins.<br><br>Like I mentioned earlier on, you dun know the demerit points system, neither do I. WhoÂ’s good? WhoÂ’s bad? We are not in mediacorp drama series where u n me clearly know who are the bad guysÂ….commit crimes, wear black color clothes, sit in dark cornerÂ…n ho rang wear white clothes, at times kerna bulliedÂ…or become overnite hero. You dun like one of your friends. He Â“backstabbedÂ” u becoz he JUST doesnÂ’t like u either, but he always help his closest friends. To u, is he good or bad? Should he go to heaven? Does he know he will enter? He will be like a headless fly. Take for example you take part in a marathon, you ask the official where is the starting line, he says Â“I dun know, just start runningÂ”..then u ask Â“where is the ending lineÂ”, he replies Â“I dun know, just keep running running running running running running running running running.Â” Would you complain about the rules of the marathon like you would complain about your life?<br><br>quote:<br>-----<br><strong>No, I don't know if he is lying to u or not, tat is why I am asking u tis question. If u don't understand a fellow at all, how do u know he is being honest in his answer to u ? He appeared to have hid the fact of why he made dinosaurs extinct isn't it ? And don't go around telling me noah ark since it is proven tat dinosaurs and men never live side by side to each other at any time.  </strong><br>-----<br><br>*Yes, I canÂ’t agree more with you on the doubt you should have. ItÂ’s like having relationships with your girlfriend, siblings, friends. You have to know more about her/him in order to trust believe and have faith in parents or girlfriend rite. Likewise, you have to find out and understand more about God and you will be able to receive the Truth from Him.<br><br>I believe you would have studied quite a few and research a bit on the big bangs, extinction of dino, fossils. Yes, I agree science does unravel a lot of mysteries and facts but why does everyone has different scientific views on certain things like extinction of dino n tt human that itÂ’s as controversial as politics? We have too limited knowledge and things to use predict the past, let alone the future. For example, the fossils we have found so far are too inadequate to prove most of the claims. Dun you think so?<br>As for your question on the Noah Ark, there are few reasons to rebuke the statement that Noah Ark never exists due to the face that we still canÂ’t find or almost impossible to find any human fossil in situ during that eraÂ…one of them is that multiple-bones mammals fossil records we have till tis day is too rare to findÂ….probably a few casesÂ…The order of burial further increase the difficulties of finding human fossils as shallow marine organisms would be first destroyed by the Flood and then were buried by erosion of the land., thus explains why we have almost all of the fossils records we have today are on shallow marine organism fossils.<br><br><strong>These are nt the reasons to prove that man did live side by side with dinosaurs, but to show your prove is built on weak groundsÂ…thus shall nt be considered as a fact</strong><br><br>I will agree with you if you have all the evidences to justify your claimsÂ…I read with an open mind and heart guided by Lord. If I dun know, I will humbly tell you I dun know, for my knowledge is a small grain of sand as compared to GodÂ’s unlimited knowledge.<br>As stated in Prov 1:7 Â“Fearing of God is the beginning of knowledgeÂ” and Prov 9:10 Â“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.Â”<br><br>quote:<br>------<br>No, I am asking u how is it logically realised. Any tom, dick and harry can propose any ideas they want. It is up to us to make some questions about in detailed to see if they r telling the truth. If they fail to answer the detailed questions properly, then it is probably telling a lie<br>------<br>For IÂ’m sure, you would definitely doubt what God tells me implicitly or explicitly. Absolutely no intention of answer your question improperly.<br><strong>In John 3:12, Jesus said Â“If I have told you earthly things and you believe not, how shall you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?Â”</strong><br><br>quote:<br>------<br>Then wat is your purpose in stating the earlier statement ?<br><br>Right now, in changi prison, there are ppl who are sentenced to death, leaving their loved ones..the unbearable pain of separation is one of the punishments...what abt those with young kids who need support and the permanent treatment they wld get from other ppl? If you dun get it, ur loved ones will get it. Nt forgetting the ultimate punishment when the death sentence is fixed...knowing there's no second chance to change anymore. Yes, they confess their sins to God. God forgives them, but look what punishments they get?<br><br>Wat is it about ? U r telling me god forgives them, but appeared to be dissappointed tat they still get punishment too. Wat is the message u r trying to bring across ?<br>------<br><br>No. God forgives us but does nt mean He endorse nor condone sinsÂ… It actually grieves Him. Christians do get punishments as well, just like the rest of the non-Christians.<br><br>quote:<br>-------<br>Yah lor.. I also hear tis christian say tis, tat christian say tat too. If I believe them, then wat is the difference between believing some ppl run to outerspace ?<br>-------<br>You probably didnÂ’t get the underlying meaning of my statement. LetÂ’s take for an example; you have a friend called A, who went to take this Viking ride. He comes back to you and says its really thrilling n is the best ride in the world. Another friend of urs, called B, went to take another Viking ride somewhere and he comes back telling u, Â“Woww, thatÂ’s the best and most exciting ride in the world.Â” You never experience any Viking ride, so can you say Â“This ABC viking from this XYZ theme park is the best ride in the worldÂ” or Â“The Viking that A took is the best in the world.Â” Would ppl doubt what you say like what u doubt abt what God tells me?<br></div>
