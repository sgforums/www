It appears to be streets laden with gold and people who just believes in christ r the resident. However human remains as corrupted as before. So in the end, it will just become another earth.<br><br>Who is good, who is bad ? I thought those who do more good deeds than bad ones r people who r good. However taoist or buddhist who had done a lot of good deeds will not get there while people who r sinful before get to be in. They r not picking the better people to be in heaven. I do not believe in perfect human too. But then wat is the difference between mankind now and the future heaven ? They will marvel at the beautiful streets for, maybe 10 years then they will start to ease up and become human they were before. They will lie, they will cheat, they will do all the things they had done before when they r in mankind. Soon heaven is again another earth. Wat is my ideal heaven ?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">Ahh... why do u think heaven will be different in singapore. if someone cut the Q when u board the bus in heaven, will u be angry about it ? No one says tat people who cut Queues will not be allowed in heaven u know... people who spit out gum and anyhow throw rubbish r allowed in heaven too isn't it ? People in KL can go to heaven too isn't it ? In fact they could have come from the most ungracious, rudest country in the world too. In fact the people who go to heaven can be rude, and ingracious... as long as they believe in christ, they can reach heaven. Why do u think they will change when they reach heaven ? Even in your church, there r some people u do not like or some people perform action which piss u off too isn't it ? U may be living with them again in heaven too. In fact things could be worse... They don't have to be good anymore since they r already in heaven isn't it ? They can now do anything they like or want.<br><br>Do u gossip now ? DO u think in heaven u will not gossip about other people ? Do u argue with your family/spouse/children etc now ? Do u think u will not argue with them when u reach heaven ? Everything still remains the same isn't it ? </div></blockquote>There must be some different in Heaven compare to Singapore in order to be called Heaven, isn't it? All your points in based on there are no different in Heaven compare to where we are living here.  The example I used to compare KL and Singapore is showing you the different between 2 places will cause someone act differently.<br><br>Like I mention b4, you don't see the bad part of the people in Heaven, you only see the good part. That's mean even if someone cut your queue,  throw rubbish everywhere...etc, you won't angry or hate them, because you still see them as loving son of their parents, you still see them as loving parents of their children and you still see them as loving people of Heaven.<br><br>BTW, you can practice that in our living world here as well, then you can live in the Heaven on Earth in no time.<br></div>

It appears to be streets laden with gold and people who just believes in christ r the resident. However human remains as corrupted as before. So in the end, it will just become another earth.<br><br>Who is good, who is bad ? I thought those who do more good deeds than bad ones r people who r good. However taoist or buddhist who had done a lot of good deeds will not get there while people who r sinful before get to be in. They r not picking the better people to be in heaven. I do not believe in perfect human too. But then wat is the difference between mankind now and the future heaven ? They will marvel at the beautiful streets for, maybe 10 years then they will start to ease up and become human they were before. They will lie, they will cheat, they will do all the things they had done before when they r in mankind. Soon heaven is again another earth. Wat is my ideal heaven ? Now the earth I am living is is already heaven to me. </div></blockquote>It really good to see you wrote all this...means u question everything...nuthing under the carpet...but with a closed heart. Not here to convince u but let's stop and think carefully...<br>You thought? Are you defining according to your standard nt God's as stated in the Bible? Tell me, I may be a good person to some, but bad-mouthed by others. Am I bad or good? Someone cant get along with you, he says u r bad...You say he's bad. You like a person but he's hated by someone. A serial killer is bad coz he killed someone but he's filial to parents his whole life and kind to animals, is he good? I may nt killed anyone, but I'm cruel to my siblings or parents. Am I good? We are branding each other with different labels - good n bad or neutral. Bei gum mah. Who's good? How many demerit points for kicking a dog, telling a lie, injure someone? How many merit points to for helping an old lady across the road? Do u know your total demerit points and merit points before u die? which one is more? who keeps track of ur points? Does God say "stupidissmart, u miss by a point, u can't enter heaven"? You dun even know how many points u have chalked up. God never does tt...<br><br>You went for an interview and u asked for the job scope, the interviewer said"No job scope, dun know, just do watever u can", "How much will i get?"--&gt;"dun know we will grade u, u will know end of the every month"...wld u want this job?<br><br>God treats everyone equally and to Him, everyone is a sinner. He forgives us if u believe in Christ, for everyone of us sin here. But u will say, bei gum mah...so simple meh....he commited crime he gets forgiven coz he's a christian, he believes in Christ. U have underestimated God's perfect forgiving love again. That's how u think but not God (stated in bible again - His Way). You will be forgiven of coz but u will get ur punishment eventually. God has never made it so simple for us to see. Nt being arrogant but this is as simple as tt. I apologize...As to which non-christians will enter Heaven, God will decide, we can't judge.<br><br>Saying u are living in heaven now is self-deceiving...i may nt know u but i know u feel sad at times. e.g. when ur closed ones pass away. In heaven, nobody is sad cuz everyone has gone back to God's side and rejoice.</div>
