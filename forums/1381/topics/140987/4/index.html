At least look at more strawman definitons. I give you another one (<a href="http://www.skepticfiles.org/conspire/strawman.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.skepticfiles.org/conspire/strawman.htm</a>) -<br><br><blockquote>A "strawman argument" or simply a "strawman" is a flimsy argument which<br>is created only to be "knocked down".<br><br>The term is sometimes used to refer to simplified arguments which are<br>then demolished to understand exactly where they fall apart. What is<br>learned in the process may then be applied to a related, more<br>sophisticated argument, either to show how it may be similarly<br>demolished or to illustrate its relative strength.<br><br>More frequently the term comes up in relation to phony, easily<br>countered arguments which are attributed in debate to an opponent and<br>then demolished -- thereby "proving" that the opponent's claims are<br>empty.<br><br>Example: Creationists disprove evolution by attributing the claim to it<br>that monkeys will sometimes give birth to human babies, which is false,<br>and therefore evolution is false. Since nothing claimed by most<br>evolutionists implies such a thing, this is a counter-argument to a<br>strawman.</blockquote>You don't only ask a question. It is not that simple. If you read your replies, most of them carried some assumptions, which are not the xtian position. Then you challenged us based on those assumptions. This is very evident in our Trinity discussion.<br><br>In short, you miscontrue the xtian position and turned it into a strawman.</div>

Actually the question you asked cannot be determined unless you do an empirical study (but then I suppose xtians also paiseh to admit they believe 'cos they want eternal life?). But theology is quite clear on salvation, justification, imputation and regeneration - they are all due to the work of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>I dunno actually, maybe got some not very orthodox xtians stress eternal life over love of God.

Fancy quoting from a dubious website and impersonating as Christian website?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So is God loving the world or not? make up your mind leh .. haha<br><br><blockquote>U r really distracting people from the main point tat a portion, if not a majority portion of christians believe just to get salvation. </blockquote>Don't think you are suitable to comment the reason for people accepting Christ. First, obviously you not been to church often, not hearing many testimonies, and you don't share fundamental assumptions with the Christians.<br><br>You can keep that as a personal opinion - that's fine with us as everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But I think you're trying to elevate that into an argument.<br><br><blockquote>Then aren't these people the same as "my date with the vampire" and believing just to get eternal life ? If u ask my opinion, I really believe majority of the people believing and performing good deeds etc just to reach eternal life. </blockquote>Yah .. you can keep that as your own [misguided] opinion .. thank you.</div>
