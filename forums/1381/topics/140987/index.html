            <div class='col-md body'>Think some of the pple here  had asked whether we should follow the law since we have grace thru Christ. This is quite a touchy issue for a lot of people who like to question whether Christ had superceded and nullified all the laws in the OT.<br><br>My opinion is: When GOD has given us his grace thru Christ, Christ had fulfilled the law for us. The law is just a tool/benchmark for us, not a solution. Christ is the solution. We obey GOD's law not becoz we fear him, but out of love for him, becoz GOD so loved the world that he sent his only begotten son, that whoever believe in him should not perish but have ever lasting life.<br><br>I believe anyone who loves GOD would not find himself troubled by whether he should keep those laws, but how/what he can do to emulate Christ and to help others. Nobody can keep the laws completely, but we do it out of love and obedience to GOD, not out of fear.<br><br></div>

This is most unfortunate. I believe when one want to preach the word, his intentions are good.
