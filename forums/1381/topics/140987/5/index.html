            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>The questions you asked was not a logical question. God had a choice right? Moreover Scripture also never claim your body suddenly transformed when you receive salvation. So what you suggested are just your fantasy. </blockquote>Choice over whether should we be punished ? If we r forgiven and cleanse, the punishment should ceased. If the effect is not instantaneous, then it really meant the above 2 conclusions. Either god has not totally forgiven us or he is powerless to change the fact. Instead of telling me if these 2 conclusions r wrong or coming up with a third scenario, u really just beat around the bush and never really try answering the question<br><br><blockquote>You sounds quite contradictory with your words in bold - which strongly suggest people receive salvation (get bitten in your analogy) to live forever. Actually, when you receive Christ, you have your salvation. You don't go church and tithe your whole life to seek your salvation. You should already be a Christian before you do those things (tithe, Lord's Supper etc.). So your argument here is not correct. </blockquote>Tat depends on wat form of christainity u believe in. There r many people who believes tat just faith in christ is not important, but acts such as tilthing or refrain from sins etc is important in salvation too. Otherwise it really become a religion tat allows people to sin as much as they want and still get probably the best final outcome. Or u do not believe in me and want me to quote from many websites tat tells people not to sin to get eternal life ?<br><br><blockquote>Nope. The one that is emphasized is Jesus Christ. The sentence starts with "God so loved the world". Interestingly eternal life are the last two words - after the words God, loved, Son, believes </blockquote>Whoever says tat the first few words of a sentence meant it is more important  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> The sentence emphasis tat the whole idea of sending the son is for men <strong>to receive eternal life</strong>, and as such it really meant tat believing in christ is for eternal life. The objective of sending christ is mentioned and it is to give people eternal life.<br><br><blockquote>The origin of the website is dubious. Don't think is Christian website. 'cos the website actually wrote "In Search of Heaven, the Eternal Life" is a universal book for all people of all faiths around the world; whether you're Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim, Catholic, Mormon, Jew, Atheist, or alike, it does not matter for we all belong to the same family of man, and thus are all created equal." </blockquote>I had pasted 2 sites and u only answer one of them. So the other one u have nothing to say about it ? If tat is the case, here is more examples from, christian websites<br><br><a href="http://www.bibletexts.com/glossary/eternal-life.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bibletexts.com/glossary/eternal-life.htm</a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Afterlife and eternal life become an essential part of Christian preaching in virtue of JesusÂ’ resurrection from the dead</span><br><br><blockquote>So is God loving the world or not? make up your mind leh .. haha </blockquote>According to bible, it says it love the world. For men, whether he loves the world or not, IMO, is really not a significant moltivation for men to sacrifice so much time, money and effort to believe in christianity. He loves me, SO ? Love shouldn't expect things back in return. It is the idea of eternal life tat make people waste all these resources<br><br><blockquote>Don't think you are suitable to comment the reason for people accepting Christ. First, obviously you not been to church often, not hearing many testimonies, and you don't share fundamental assumptions with the Christians. </blockquote>U r still avoiding the question  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Instead of asking these irrelevant questions, why not u come out and tell me straight in the face tat I am wrong about the fact tat there r many christians tat believes to get eternal life. U r really distracting people from the main point tat a portion, if not a majority portion of christians believe just to get salvation. Since u r so qualified, then u swear upon your own integrity and honour tat there r really very insignificant people tat believes in christianity for eternal life. Otherwise everyone will know why u refuse to answer it.<br><br><blockquote>Yah .. you can keep that as your own [misguided] opinion .. thank you.</blockquote>Yah.. u can live in self denial if u want  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> I do't even know who u r trying to convince with such weak arguments</div>

Nice churches but christians take it for granted. If you could go and witness the worship service in China, you will know what I mean. (No. I din witness myself. I heard and read stories and stories ...... )<br><br>The light of Gospel gonna penetrate into and fill China and India soon. May God be with the missionaries.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by stupidissmart:<br>Choice over whether should we be punished ? If we r forgiven and cleanse, the punishment should ceased. If the effect is not instantaneous, then it really meant the above 2 conclusions. Either god has not totally forgiven us or he is powerless to change the fact. Instead of telling me if these 2 conclusions r wrong or coming up with a third scenario, u really just beat around the bush and never really try answering the question</blockquote>The penalty for sin is death. All of us have to die to pay for the sins in our lifetime. The imputation of Jesus' righteousness comes in handy when you stand before God during Judgement.<br><br><blockquote>Tat depends on wat form of christainity u believe in. There r many people who believes tat just faith in christ is not important, but acts such as tilthing or refrain from sins etc is important in salvation too. Otherwise it really become a religion tat allows people to sin as much as they want and still get probably the best final outcome. Or u do not believe in me and want me to quote from many websites tat tells people not to sin to get eternal life ? </blockquote>Faith in Christ is most important, but I never say other things are not important. Even Catholics stress on faith and work, but you seems to stress on work. So your description is not Christianity.<br><br><blockquote>Whoever says tat the first few words of a sentence meant it is more important  The sentence emphasis tat the whole idea of sending the son is for men to receive eternal life, and as such it really meant tat believing in christ is for eternal life. The objective of sending christ is mentioned and it is to give people eternal life.</blockquote>And why did God send Christ so that people can get eternal life? 'cos HE LOVE THE WORLD.<br><br>Also you contradict your earlier reply. You said faith in Christ not important. But this sentence says that faith is most important (whoever believes in him shall not die .. )<br><br><blockquote>I had pasted 2 sites and u only answer one of them. So the other one u have nothing to say about it ? If tat is the case, here is more examples from, christian websites </blockquote>I can't stand the fact you quoted from a dubious website. You always like to give examples. I never said eternal life is not important, but when xtians preach, there are some things more important. The potential xtian (still unbeliever) should be made to see certain things first, not the eternal life. So if a believer is too caught up with eternal life, then I say this is not good christian mentality.<br><br>Even John the Baptist proclaimed, "Repent, for the kingdom of God is at hand". This should be the way to preach. Make people see their sins, then tell them the love of God.<br><br><blockquote>According to bible, it says it love the world. For men, whether he loves the world or not, IMO, is really not a significant moltivation for men to sacrifice so much time, money and effort to believe in christianity. He loves me, SO ? Love shouldn't expect things back in return. It is the idea of eternal life tat make people waste all these resources </blockquote>Tell you also no use. How you respond depends largely on whether you love Him in the first place. For example, I am not your father's son, of course I don't love him as much as you do.<br><br><blockquote>U r still avoiding the question  Instead of asking these irrelevant questions, why not u come out and tell me straight in the face tat I am wrong about the fact tat there r many christians tat believes to get eternal life. U r really distracting people from the main point tat a portion, if not a majority portion of christians believe just to get salvation. Since u r so qualified, then u swear upon your own integrity and honour tat there r really very insignificant people tat believes in christianity for eternal life. Otherwise everyone will know why u refuse to answer it. </blockquote>You can't even show me empirical evidence of your claims. I've shown you what you claimed is not proper xtian belief. Also I can't help if some very insignificant people want to think it the way you said - believe eternal life and forgot about sins, love of Christ etc.</div>
