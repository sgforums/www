            <div class='col-md body'>don't flame me..just for your inform..<br><br>Cheap grace is to God's grace what cubic zirconia is to diamonds and plastic is to fine crystal. The thirsty soul drinking in cheap grace is like being in a desert, dying of thirst, and only having salt water to drink!<br><br>This is what Bonhoeffer says of "cheap grace": "It is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline, Communion without confession, absolution without personal confession. Cheap grace is ...<br><br>Â• grace without discipleship<br>Â• grace without the cross<br>Â• grace without Jesus Christ, living and incarnate."<br><br>Cheap grace arises when a sinner desires to be saved, but doesn't want to become a disciple. A true believer must resist cheap grace and enter the life of active discipleship. Faith can no longer mean passively sitting still and waiting. Christians must arise and follow Christ.<br><br>Bonhoeffer taught that cheap grace makes man soft and complacent, fearful of self-sacrifice and personal debasement. He believed that the teaching of cheap grace was the ruin of more Christians than any commandment of works. For Bonhoeffer, discipleship means strict adherence to Christ and God's moral commandments.<br></div>

We cannot accept option two either, for this would mean all New Testament books written after the year 56 would not qualify under the 1 Corinthians 4:6 guideline. Hence, John's Gospel, Acts, Romans, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Philemon, Titus, 1 &amp; 2 Timothy, Hebrews, James, 1 &amp; 2 Peter, 1, 2, &amp; 3 John, Jude, and Revelation would all have to be jettisoned as non-authoritative.<br><br>Option three fails because in order for sola scriptura to be a "biblical" doctrine there must be, by definition, at least one Bible verse which says Scripture is sufficient, or that oral Tradition is to be ignored once Scripture has supplanted it, or that Scripture is superior to oral Tradition. But there are no such verses; and as we'll see, 1 Corinthians 4:6 is no exception.<br><br>Option four is likewise untenable because it contradicts Paul's express command in to "Stand fast and hold firm to the traditions that you were taught, either by an oral statement or by a letter of ours" (2 Thess. 2:15). Thus, for 1 Corinthians 4:6 to support the theory of sola scriptura, Paul would be contradicting what he wrote in 2 Thess 2:15.<br><br>Furthermore, If Paul had been promulgating sola scriptura in 1 Corinthians 4 he would have been in conflict with the practice of the rest of the apostles. Most of the apostles never wrote a single line of Scripture; instead they transmitted the deposit of faith orally. Did their oral teachings carry any less weight of authority than the written teachings of Paul or Peter or John?<br><br>So the thing for you to consider is that if most of the apostles did not write any scriptures, how did they teach? Obviously by Oral Tradition!<br></div></blockquote>the teaching of Scripture alone is not contained in this one verse only. It is a systematic study of all pertinent verses spread in the Bible. If i would have to write all the verses and expound them exegetically one by one.....i would be writing a book.<br><br>[at this time i do not wish to engage myself in writing a theological dissertation about the doctrine of Scripture alone so clearly taught in the Bible just as the doctrine of the Trinity {of course you agree with the doctrine of the Trinity right?....... eventhough the word does not appear in the Bible right?}......my mind is weary and my body is convalescing]<br><br>"Do not go beyond what is written" is a principle that Paul wanted his readers to learn.<br><br></div>
