If he repents, he is putting Jesus on the cross again which is unnecessary; He need not repent.<br>God has forgiven you on the account of J.

He grace is ever for the people. But there have to be the act to recieve it don't you think so?<br><br>I see JP's point of view. And i understand his views.<br>Many people ask for forgiveness time and time again because they have no faith in themselves and in God.<br>They are stricken in guilt and not released.
