God sees the heart. Why do we as mere mortals debate this point over and over and over again? It seems silly to me.<br><br>Your version describes it rightly, if Jesus is our righteousness and He is the offering that was given for the remission of our sins, then our sins are forgiven, otherwise, why believe? Why the need for a saviour? Why then put Jesus on a cross and have Him die for us?<br><br>This is the main message of Christ, that He died for our sins. This is tied in very strongly with the OT requirement for an offering for the atonement of sins. It is because of Grace that we are saved. If we are saved, the bible says that God sees our sins no more, though are garments are scarlett, we are washed as white as snow. Or if you prefer, an older christian song said something along the lines of the blood of Jesus covering our sins. God will see the clothe of righteousness on us if we have Christ as our saviour. It is what the bible says.<br><br>Just help me to understand where you are coming from MC, what exactly is the problem?<br><br>That aside, how are you MC? Hope that you are well and have recovered fully! You take care of yourself.<br><br></div>

Jesus paid for your sins but you got to repent from your sins. The whole Bible talks abt sin, judgement and repentace....dun use one word Grace and then rule it all.<br><br>The God who ask the person to receive Holy Communion 3 times a day simply do not know what 'he' is saying. The Communion from the very mouths of Jesus is a memorial act.<br><br>With no apologies. taking communion 3 times to get healed in essense of making the things of God superstitious and is the mosty deceiving of all.<br><br>Bible, Sacraments and even names of God when used for the wrong reasons no matter how innocent it sounds is not treating God His due respect.<br><br>We saw in Old testament a king wanting to offer incense to God but was judged because he has no right to do that duty of a priest. The logic thinking is that he wanted to offer God incense..yes he is a devoted worshipper of God....but God never ordain you to do that..pls dun assume.</div>

God sees the heart. Why do we as mere mortals debate this point over and over and over again? It seems silly to me.<br><br>Your version describes it rightly, if Jesus is our righteousness and He is the offering that was given for the remission of our sins, then our sins are forgiven, otherwise, why believe? Why the need for a saviour? Why then put Jesus on a cross and have Him die for us?<br><br>This is the main message of Christ, that He died for our sins. This is tied in very strongly with the OT requirement for an offering for the atonement of sins. It is because of Grace that we are saved. If we are saved, the bible says that God sees our sins no more, though are garments are scarlett, we are washed as white as snow. Or if you prefer, an older christian song said something along the lines of the blood of Jesus covering our sins. God will see the clothe of righteousness on us if we have Christ as our saviour. It is what the bible says.<br><br>Just help me to understand where you are coming from MC, what exactly is the problem?<br><br>That aside, how are you MC? Hope that you are well and have recovered fully! You take care of yourself.<br><br></div></blockquote>JP put it across rightly, God sees the heart ultimately. Like what my signature below says.<br><br>This question was asked to further understand the stand of NCC worshippers.<br>If sin is commited, the believer should believe that he is covered in the blood of Jesus and Clothed in righteousness of Jesus. If he repents, he is putting Jesus on the cross again which is unnecessary; He need not repent.<br>God has forgiven you on the account of J.

He grace is ever for the people. But there have to be the act to recieve it don't you think so?<br><br>I see JP's point of view. And i understand his views.<br>Many people ask for forgiveness time and time again because they have no faith in themselves and in God.<br>They are stricken in guilt and not released.
