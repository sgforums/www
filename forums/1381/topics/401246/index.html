              <p>In anything, if you dig deeper you will find something that may not sit in well with Christian beliefs.  I suggest you relax and learn to enjoy the gift of Life that God has blessed us with and be less neurotic...otherwise it takes away the joy of being alive.  I believe you are refering to a particular genre as you cannot make a sweeping statement that all 70s music are paganistic.  I can name a few musical acts from the 80s and 90s that may be termed as
               not scripturally agreeable so would that makes you a pagan since you have no problems with them? </p>

              <p>Its not the thing but intentions to be held in question....and we shouldn't humiliate or "persecute" the whole lot because of few people msigivings  ...</p>
              <p>lets not take the whole of the Christian community as "involved"....</p>
              <p>i m not a Christian or Catholic .....but let me simplify it in human terms....the "first great communist" was Jesus....in the strict and passionate idealism, it means sharing and distribution of God's fruits for all....classless...that ideology is good and kind but isn't practical as ar as human nature is concerned.....</p>
              <p>but the paradox of this great ideology happens when just one member is taken in by greed..and with power....that greed gain like minded supporters....Jesus was betrayed by that "trust" of his closest aide or aides .....the people followed by their leaps of faiths amidst the betrayal of some at the top...these people can be the poorest among us with an unshakable beliefs in God...they know not what happen ...who could tell their sadness with their pure belief in a God that has given them the light all these lonely years? </p>
              <p>Neither should we misperceive any other religion because of these few people misgivings and who has betrayed the trust of the people who believe in their leadership? </p>

              <p>Christians must not listen to radio that have pop songs. That includes 90.5 FM. Pop songs are from a rebillious generations of the '60s, they are sensual in nature, and they typify rebellion, and it is beneficial if we dissociate from worldly music.</p>
              <p>You are however permitted to listen to Talk 93.8 FM. But if there are any music broadcast on 93.8, switch it off.</p>

Believing parents who desire their children to expand knowledge must watch these documentaries with their children and explain to them that true Christians are the minority and do not walk on the broad road. They must contrast scripture with what they see on TV. And they must explain that although they are in the minority, history has shown that in all ages, the majority is wrong and in every age a minority remnant is preserved by the true and living God, which the majority will despise.</p>
