              Many scriptures tell about many other buddhas before him and after him and Buddhas in far far far away places. So it's for u to figure out wat is means. And by the way it mentions about there is as many Buddha as the number of sand in the great river in India. So the Buddha in our history is onli one, so where's the rest. Figure out yourself too. So much so of commenting all the Buddhas in the whole of the universe and dimensions. When u really come to understand, u wouldn't say these anymore. 
              
              If u onli see wats in the box, basically u onli see everything inside the box. But u will not know wats outside of it. Keep an open mind to know wat is the universe is really all about and u will know wats is all these religion about, wats human about, wats god about, wats u about and many many more. And when u know everything u will realize tat  nothing is ever require. It is wat it is.

              <p>Excerpt from another article on Buddhism:</p>
              <p><strong>"Donald Lopez, a professor of Buddhist and Tibetan studies at the 
              University of Michigan, provides an illuminating account of this culture
               clash in his book <em>Buddhism and Science: A Guide for the Perplexed</em> (University of Chicago Press, 2008). Conservative Buddhists rejected 
              the round world theory. They believed the historical Buddha had perfect 
              knowledge, and if the historical Buddha believed in the Mount Meru 
              cosmos, then it must be true."</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"Professor Lopez writes that the Mount Meru <span style="color: #ff0000;">controversy</span> didn't reach 
              isolated Tibet until the 20th century. A Tibetan scholar named Gendun 
              Chopel spent the years 1936 to 1943 traveling in south Asia, soaking up 
              the modern view of the cosmos that by then was accepted even in 
              conservative monasteries. <span style="color: #ff0000;">In 1938</span> Gendun Chopel sent an article to the <em>Tibet Mirror</em> informing his country persons that the world is round.</strong></p>

              <p>Many scriptures tell about many other buddhas before him and

              as many Buddha as the number of sand in the great river in India.
              So the Buddha in our history is onli one, so where’s the rest.
              Figure out yourself too. So much so of commenting all the Buddhas
              in the whole of the universe and dimensions. When u really come to

              will know wats is all these religion about, wats human about, wats
