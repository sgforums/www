              <p><br>Erm sorry for the offense but if u converted to christianality, u cant keep ur previous religious books stuff right.</p>
              <p>And as christians we cant give those religious stuff away then no choice got to destroy it.</p>
              <p>It's not extreme, it's a change in belief system. In my church also gt ppl throw away their past religions stuff and religioious statues. Nothing wrong right.</p>
              <p>I think PEPPER did nothing wrong.</p>
              <p>All he did was to delete a favourite link(buddhism webpage) in his internet explorer.</p>

I have not read any scripture which mention about earth movement and have just confirmed with a Buddhist friend who had gone through Buddhist studies that there is no mention of earth movement in any scriptures.</p>
