              <p>i think given the number of fossils discovered and technological advancement in the field of archeology, there are less doubts about evolutionary events. it is common for christians to dismiss evolution due to the 'lack' of proof but the same christians never ask for the same proof about their god and would gladly accept the absurdity of old testament accounts as its unblemished history, science and politics...</p>

              <p>clearly there are plenty of differences given the evolutionary changes, the believe in the supernatural has always been around. i'm not sure what relationships you are trying to infer..if you are talking about the moses type of personal relationship with the old testament god then no. then again it's unproven...</p>
              <p>while you alluded that evolution is forced fitted, your insistence than man was created fully intelligent and upright is purely anecdotal. i have seen comical attempts by christians to explain how old testament accounts such as parting of the red sea, the crumbling wall of jericho &amp; etc as truly desperate, that my friend is forced fitting.</p>

              <p>Most of us  look for evidence before marry ? Don't most of us date our partners before we get married ? Dating is to know each other better. Aren't we looking for evidence to ensure that we find the right partner for marriage?I don't agree that you compare marriage with religion because marriage can end in divorce because of many factors eg. humans characters and environment can change after marriage.</p>

              <p>can i challenge u to do sth? start asking qns about getting married without ever divorcing. try to look for evidence to prove that marriages wun end in divorce...and also find out why ppl marry without looking for evidence yet they cannot do the same for religion...</p>

              <p>I don't think anybody will wish to marry someone whom you find their background suspicious or his promise is unrelistic and what he say  does not tally with what you see.</p>

              <p>exactly, marriage can end wif many factors so where is ur evidence for a blissful future? can the evidence of love and trust at the present moment be considered evidence for the future?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the reason why marriage is relevant to christianity(not religion across the board) is because of the love factor which is synonymous for both. the issue is not whether u agree wif christianity being abt love but does christianity teach abt love? is salvation by grace a result of love? wad is God to christians? Heavanly <strong>Father...<strong>the word in bold is significant...wad u have cited is evidence for the now...i agree wif u tat theres evidence up to the pt of marriage...but after tat? dun u have to rely on trust and faith to work out the marriage?</strong></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>put urself in this scenario...now u are planning to get married...so now i ask u...prove to me NOW tat 20yrs later, u will still be blissfully married...can u prove that? tats wad i am trying to bring across...its not abt the now only...same as prove to u NOW tat God exists then u will believe...u see the parallel?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>maybe i wasnt clear before lah...i nvr said religion is like marriage...i have always been trying to say tat CHRISTIANITY is like marriage...simply cos salvation by grace is based on love and mercy...sth u dun find in religions tat teach karma...in karmaic religions, theres no forgiveness of sins...</p></div>

              Hi, seems like u comment tat religion believe in karma don't belive in repenting. And yet u don't even know if u r correct or nor even find out more before u comment others religion. Since u commented 2billions christian, wats about others? U base on your believe of others belief onto others.
              Did god wants u to start commenting and condemning others? Will u gain access to heaven bcos of tat? Ask your heart, ask your soul.
              Getting and finding god have many ways. Christianity is one of the way. God is indeed onli one. Not my god is better then your god. The god tat u believe in is the same god others believe. It's just the word to describe is different. And god have many meaning or way to call. 
              God have no form or shape nor male or female. He is not some godly figure sitting on a throne to judge u when u die. He don't get jealous or judge u or wants u to fear him. He loves u for who u r. He talks us everyday if u listern through our heart. His is always with each and everyone of us and never leave us and he cannot leave us. Bcos we are part of him.
              The things I can write can goes on and on. But the main thing is the god tat u believe in is my god. There is no other god. Onli one. So wat is there to argue when all our bro and sis believe is all of the same one. Just onli the name differs. Such as I can call u by your surname or your nickname or your full name or your secret name given by your parthner. They are just names.

              <p>Is it as long as the Christian repents, God will forgive him and he is allowed to enter heaven. Nothing will happen to this guy no matter what bad deeds he had done in the past ?</p>
