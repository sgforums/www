              <p><strong>Question: "How were people saved before Jesus died for our sins?"<br><br>Answer: </strong>Since the fall of man, the basis of salvation has always been the death of Christ. No one, either prior to the cross or since the cross, would ever be saved without that one pivotal event in the history of the world. Christ's death paid the penalty for past sins of Old Testament saints and future sins of New Testament saints.<br><br>The requirement for salvation has always been faith. The object of one's faith for salvation has always been God. The psalmist wrote, “Blessed are all who take refuge in him” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Psalm%202.12"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Psalm 2:12</span></span></a>). <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Genesis%2015.6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Genesis 15:6</span></span></a> tells us that Abraham believed God and that was enough for God to credit it to him for righteousness (see also <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Romans%204.3-8"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Romans 4:3-8</span></span></a>). The Old Testament sacrificial system did not take away sin, as <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Hebrews%2010.1-10"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Hebrews 10:1-10</span></span></a> clearly teaches. It did, however, point to the day when the Son of God would shed His blood for the sinful human race.<br><br>What has changed through the ages is the content of a believer's faith. God's requirement of what must be believed is based on the amount of revelation He has given mankind up to that time. This is called progressive revelation. Adam believed the promise God gave in <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Genesis%203.15"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Genesis 3:15</span></span></a> that the Seed of the woman would conquer Satan. Adam believed Him, demonstrated by the name he gave Eve (v. 20) and the Lord indicated His acceptance immediately by covering them with coats of skin (v. 21). At that point that is all Adam knew, but he believed it.<br><br>Abraham believed God according to the promises and new revelation God gave him in Genesis 12 and 15. Prior to Moses, no Scripture was written, but mankind was responsible for what God had revealed. Throughout the Old Testament, believers came to salvation because they believed that God would someday take care of their sin problem. Today, we look back, believing that He has already taken care of our sins on the cross (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/John%203.16"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">John 3:16</span></span></a>; <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Hebrews%209.28"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Hebrews 9:28</span></span></a>).<br><br>What about believers in Christ's day, prior to the cross and resurrection? What did they believe? Did they understand the full picture of Christ dying on a cross for their sins? Late in His ministry, “Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Matthew%2016.21-22"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Matthew 16:21-22</span></span></a>). What was the reaction of His disciples to this message? “Then Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. ‘Never, Lord!’ he said. ‘This shall never happen to you!’” Peter and the other disciples did not know the full truth, yet they were saved because they believed that God would take care of their sin problem. They didn't exactly know how He would accomplish that, any more than Adam, Abraham, Moses, or David knew how, but they believed God.<br><br>Today, we have more revelation than the people living before the resurrection of Christ; we know the full picture. “In the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Hebrews%201.1-2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Hebrews 1:1-2</span></span></a>). Our salvation is still based on the death of Christ, our faith is still the requirement for salvation, and the object of our faith is still God. Today, for us, the content of our faith is that Jesus Christ died for our sins, He was buried, and He rose the third day (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/1%20Corinthians%2015.3-4"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</span></span></a>).</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Question: "Where did Old Testament believers go when they died?"<br><br>Answer: </strong>The Old Testament teaches life after death, and that all people went to a place of conscious existence called Sheol. The wicked were there (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Psalm%209.17"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Psalm 9:17</span></span></a>; <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Psalm%2031.17"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">31:17</span></span></a>; <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Psalm%2049.14"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">49:14</span></span></a>; <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Isaiah%205.14"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Isaiah 5:14</span></span></a>), and so were the righteous (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Genesis%2037.35"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Genesis 37:35</span></span></a>; <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Job%2014.13"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Job 14:13</span></span></a>; <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Psalm%206.5"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Psalm 6:5</span></span></a>; <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Psalm%2016.10"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">16:10</span></span></a>; <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Psalm%2088.3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">88:3</span></span></a>; <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Isaiah%2038.10"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Isaiah 38:10</span></span></a>).<br><br>The New Testament equivalent of Sheol is Hades. Prior to Christ’s resurrection, <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Luke%2016.19-31"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Luke 16:19-31</span></span></a> shows Hades to be divided into two realms: a place of comfort where Lazarus was and a place of torment where the rich man was. The word hell in verse 23 is not “Gehenna” (place of eternal torment) but “Hades” (place of the dead). Lazarus’s place of comfort is elsewhere called Paradise (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Luke%2023.43"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Luke 23:43</span></span></a>). Between these two districts of Hades is “a great gulf fixed” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Luke%2016.26"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Luke 16:26</span></span></a>).<br><br>Jesus is described as having descended into Hades after His death (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Acts%202.27"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Acts 2:27</span></span></a>, <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Acts%202.31"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">31</span></span></a>; cf. <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Ephesians%204.9"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Ephesians 4:9</span></span></a>). At the resurrection of Jesus Christ, it seems that the believers in Hades (i.e., the occupants of Paradise) were moved to another location. Now, Paradise is above rather than below (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/2%20Corinthians%2012.2-4"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">2 Corinthians 12:2-4</span></span></a>).<br><br>Today, when a believer dies, he is “present with the Lord” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/2%20Corinthians%205.6-9"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">2 Corinthians 5:6-9</span></span></a>). When an unbeliever dies, he follows the Old Testament unbelievers to Hades. At the final judgment, Hades will be emptied before the Great White Throne, where its occupants will be judged prior to entering the lake of fire (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Revelation%2020.13-15"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Revelation 20:13-15</span></span></a>).<br></p></div>

              <p><a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/cavemen.html">http://www.gotquestions.org/cavemen.html</a></p>
              <p><strong>Question: "What does the Bible say about cavemen, prehistoric men, neanderthals?"<br><br>Answer: </strong>The Bible does not use the term “caveman” or “Neanderthals,” and according to the Bible there is no such thing as “prehistoric” man. The term “prehistoric” means “belonging to the era before recorded history.” It presupposes that the biblical account is merely a fabrication, because the book of Genesis records events which precede the creation of man (namely, the first five days of creation—man was created on the sixth day). The Bible is clear that Adam and Eve were perfect humans from the time of their creation and did not evolve from lower life forms.<br><br>With that said, the Bible does describe a period of traumatic upheaval upon the earth—the flood (Genesis 6-9), during which time civilization was utterly destroyed except for eight people. Humanity was forced to start over. It is in this historical context that some scholars believe men lived in caves and made use of stone tools. These men were not primitive; they were simply destitute. And they certainly were not half ape. The fossil evidence is quite clear: cavemen were human—men who lived in caves.<br><br>There are some fossilized ape remains which Darwinian paleo-anthropologists interpret as being some sort of transition between ape and men. Most people seem to think of these interpretations when they imagine cavemen. They picture furry half-men, half-ape creatures crouched in a cave next to a fire, drawing on the walls with their newly developed stone tools. This is a common misconception. And as far as Darwinian paleo-anthropology goes, we should keep in mind that these interpretations reflect a peculiar worldview and are not the result of the evidence. In fact, not only is there major opposition to these interpretations within the academic community, the Darwinists themselves do not entirely agree with each other on the details.<br><br>Unfortunately, the popular mainstream view promotes this idea that man and ape both evolved from the same ancestor, but this is certainly not the only plausible interpretation of the available evidence. In fact, the evidence in favor of this particular interpretation is lacking.<br><br>When God created Adam and Eve, they were fully developed human beings, capable of communication, society, and development (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Genesis%202.19-25"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Genesis 2:19-25</span></span></a>; <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Genesis%203.1-20"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">3:1-20</span></span></a>; <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Genesis%204.1-12"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">4:1-12</span></span></a>). It is almost entertaining to consider the lengths evolutionary scientists go to prove the existence of prehistoric cavemen. They find a misshapen tooth in a cave and from that create a misshapen human being who lived in a cave, hunched over like an ape. There is no way that science can prove the existence of cavemen by a fossil. Evolutionary scientists simply have a theory, and then they force the evidence to fit the theory. Adam and Eve were the first human beings ever created and were fully-formed, intelligent, and upright.</p>

              <p><strong>Question: "What does the Bible say about cavemen,
              prehistoric men, neanderthals?"<br> <br> Answer:</strong> The Bible does not use the term “caveman” or
              “Neanderthals,” and according to the Bible there is no such thing
              as “prehistoric” man. The term “prehistoric” means “belonging to
              the era before recorded history.” It presupposes that the biblical
              account is merely a fabrication, because the book of Genesis
              records events which precede the creation of man (namely, the first
              five days of creation—man was created on the sixth day). The Bible
              is clear that Adam and Eve were perfect humans from the time of
              their creation and did not evolve from lower life forms.<br> <br> With that said, the Bible does describe a period of traumatic
              upheaval upon the earth—the flood (Genesis 6-9), during which time
              civilization was utterly destroyed except for eight people.
              Humanity was forced to start over. It is in this historical context
              that some scholars believe men lived in caves and made use of stone
              tools. These men were not primitive; they were simply destitute.
              And they certainly were not half ape. The fossil evidence is quite
              clear: cavemen were human—men who lived in caves.<br> <br> There are some fossilized ape remains which Darwinian
              paleo-anthropologists interpret as being some sort of transition
              between ape and men. Most people seem to think of these
              interpretations when they imagine cavemen. They picture furry
              half-men, half-ape creatures crouched in a cave next to a fire,
              drawing on the walls with their newly developed stone tools. This
              is a common misconception. And as far as Darwinian
              paleo-anthropology goes, we should keep in mind that these
              interpretations reflect a peculiar worldview and are not the result
              of the evidence. In fact, not only is there major opposition to
              these interpretations within the academic community, the Darwinists
              themselves do not entirely agree with each other on the
              details.<br> <br> Unfortunately, the popular mainstream view promotes this idea that
              man and ape both evolved from the same ancestor, but this is
              certainly not the only plausible interpretation of the available
              evidence. In fact, the evidence in favor of this particular
              interpretation is lacking.<br> <br> When God created Adam and Eve, they were fully developed human
              beings, capable of communication, society, and development
              (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Genesis%202.19-25"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Genesis

It is almost
              entertaining to consider the lengths evolutionary scientists go to
              prove the existence of prehistoric cavemen. They find a misshapen
              tooth in a cave and from that create a misshapen human being who
              lived in a cave, hunched over like an ape. There is no way that
              science can prove the existence of cavemen by a fossil.
              Evolutionary scientists simply have a theory, and then they force
              the evidence to fit the theory. Adam and Eve were the first human
              beings ever created and were fully-formed, intelligent, and
              upright.</p>

              <p>i think given the number of fossils discovered and technological advancement in the field of archeology, there are less doubts about evolutionary events. it is common for christians to dismiss evolution due to the 'lack' of proof but the same christians never ask for the same proof about their god and would gladly accept the absurdity of old testament accounts as its unblemished history, science and politics...</p>

              <p>One more scenerio, Judaism did not spread to China etc. during that time. So how on earth people in China got to know God? So, where did these people (for example) in China go to after death during Judaism era ?</p>
