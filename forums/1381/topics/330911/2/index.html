              <p><br>however, she is a woman of exceptional understanding, love, compassion, filial piety. a woman of all virtues and of a pure heart. who seeks no material gain, who speaks no gossips, who is as stainless as white. you are talking about the only woman God feels is good enough to be the mother of His Son. how many of girls in Singapore is as pure as her? you cannot even compare anything that is on this earth with her... she is "godly"...</p>
              <p>before you guys flame me, understand that i'm married and i have a younger sister... whom i dare to say is a b*tch. she acknowledges that and agreed upon that title... she felt "exalted"... my own mum always reminds my sister that when looking for a man, or a husband, find the rich one. another materialistic woman... *sad*</p>
              <p>one strategy is to ask where do they stay; if it starts with a "Blk ***", minus points. next, if it's those common names like "tampines ave ***, hougang st ***, ang mo kio blah blah, fail the guy but if it's a "Blk ***" eg. Oasis Garden or Versilla... (names of condos) still got chance... best if it's those eg."64 Evelyn Road" or "122 Yuk Tong Avenue"... this kind of man must grab...</p>
              <p>my very own mother teaching my sister these "VALUES"... so i asked if this son of her's is going to be a bachelor all my life if all the gals in Singapore follow this strategy, how? she gave me that, "that's your problem" look. Thank God i found a wife who isn't too particular with those housing status... but she is concerned with the renovations... and the brands... and the other stuffs... but better than what my mum is teaching...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore gals... well known to be materialistic...</p>

              <p>women, you can't live with them neither can you live without

              <p>Adam and Eve - if not under the persuasion of Eve to eat the
              forbidden fruit, Adam would not have broke God's rule and we won't
              have an adam apple between our throats.</p>
              <p>Samson - the seduction of a woman led to Samson
              disclosing the secret of his incredible strength and thus the
              road to his demise.</p>
              <p>David - his lust for his subordinate's wife led him to murder
              and took his subordinate's woman by force thus angering God.</p>
              <p>Solomon - under persusasion and influence, he started to
              worship other gods of his foreign wives thus the
