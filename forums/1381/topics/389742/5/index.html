              <p>Law and order are illusions. It is just a form of power placed

                                              you. There is no law except power. There is no criminal, just a

              <p>Tat is where u r wrong. Power is absolute, but morality had succeeded in curbing these unwanted force. Do u have people pointing guns on your head ? Wat is the chances of tat happening ? If everything goes as u said, then there is no such thing as peace or security in the world now.And I don't really see morality as a lie or unnecessary or a lie and slavery. It is enforced as laws and it ensures everyone live in a sociable manner. Since everybody is subjected to the same law, then basically everyone is still considered, free. And if u wanna break it, u will find yourself taking a risk from facing the wrath of the collective society.</p>
              <p>As said before, if u wanna truly break free from morality, live alone in the mountain and don;t disturb other people. Then u can be as anti social as u like. Then there is no such thing as good or bad anymore.</p>

              <p>If u gonna die or something, then maybe some form of illusion is good for u. Well if u look from peace time or times where things r normal, then religion could be an unstabilizing force. And if u go for lies, u make bad decisions to your life and u waste unnecessary resources to it</p>
              <p>It is like morphine. If u r terminally ill or u suffer great pain, then it is good for u. Normally u shouldn't take it though as it can make u addicted and could kill u suddenly</p>

              <p>the only time people had guns pointing at our heads was when the japanese invaded Singapore. Now no. Only unless you kill someone and run off into an MRT station on the North East Line :D (Or was it the North South or East West line the other time?)</p>
