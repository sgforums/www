              <p>All the central figures of the main religions in this world, like Jesus, Buddha, Prophet Muhammad were real people who came to Earth with missions to help people of the world understand the Truth of Earth, and live in ways that will enable 'Heaven on Earth'. Their intentions were all pure and meant for goodness of the world.</p>
              <p>However, the problems and separatism of our world today are the result of other Men who intentionally or un-intentionally misinterpreted their original intentions, and passed them on for countless generations, for their selfish gains. Hence, we need to use our heart to feel the Truth, and live accordingly, not simply do as we're told, without questioning any doubts one may have. There are far too many half-truths, half-lies and lies expertly mixed together in this world today.</p>

              <p><br>The main common factor is level of consciousness, which often manifests in the behaviour of people. Haiti's population has a very low level of consciousness for centuries, and they have already 'contracted' to leave Earth first, for 'what is coming ahead'. This requires much deeper explanation to fully understand why this is so.</p>

              <p>Funny thing is that why when people "bash" religions, it's frowned on but when religious "bash" non-religious, it's like as if it's "normal". Does organized religions have some sort of bubble protecting it? Or is society baised towards religious? Talk about equality in today's world...</p>

              <p><br>Like I said in my earlier reply, it requires much deeper explanation, which is not feasible here. And it'll involve things which may offend forumers, as it's too different from own beliefs. My intention is only to share and clarify, not cause more negative flamewars.</p>
              <p>To summarise as much as I can: it's time for Man's level of consciousness to be raised to a much higher level, if they choose to, as it's their freewill. Current levels of consciousness are the cause of many problems in the world, where people are intolerant of each other, and have problems co-existing.</p>
              <p>Those who perished in Haiti left Earth at this point of time, as their Higher Self were aware of their consciousness level, and had already agreed to life contracts prior to their birth, as part of their soul lessons: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/2010/01/kuan-yin-speaks-haiti-earthquake.html">http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/2010/01/kuan-yin-speaks-haiti-earthquake.html</a> . While it's normal to feel sad when people die, we need to understand that death is just a temporary end, which is continued by another start.</p>
              <p>In the coming years and probably decades, the level of consciousness one has, will make a great difference in one's life plan. It's still too soon to see this now, but all will be clear soon. We just need to observe life changing events that will unfold in these coming years. Not every event is accompanied by mass deaths though, but one common objective will be to help people understand that all are One.</p>

              <p>Funny thing is that why when people "bash" religions, it's frowned on but when religious "bash" non-religious, it's like as if it's "normal". Does organized religions have some sort of bubble protecting it? Or is society baised towards religious? Talk about equality in today's world...</p>

              <p>Speaking as a spiritual free-thinker:<br>To understand why our world is the way is it, as what you've described, you'll need to understand the real Truth of how organised religions came into power long time ago, and how they are still maintaining that power today. It's an extremely complicated matter, which has webs of complex links to many things in our world. Truth is not as simple as what Man wrote eons ago.</p>
              <p>Rather than focusing on the differences in beliefs, it'll be more enriching for one's life lessons and plan, if one focuses on one's own path and life learning. Let those who choose to fight and make trouble live their own lives, as they have their own paths to walk. Once you learn and truly understand the Truth of Earth, all that has been happening and still happening won't make a difference to you anymore, as the future is far more important than the past and present.</p>
              <p>Everyone's given almost equal opportunities to progress to a higher level of consciousness, if they wish to. It's not possible to be totally equal, due to differences in karmic lessons.</p>

              <p><br>Perhaps, you feel it's confusing because you think that "karma" is owned by a certain organisation, like a trademark? :) I believe in things which are part of the Truth, not because I've been taught to believe. Karma is an integral part of the Truth, which explains people's life plans.</p>

If you every single thing also deeper explanation here and there, end up we also don't know what you trying to say. So just type out your explanation here and post it.

              <p><br>Indeed, you're right about earthquakes caused by Earth movements. To fully understand what I've said, needs one to understand how Earth truly came about, and what truly caused the various tectonic movements from time of Pangea to the continents of today, as well as the changes to the planetary and star systems in our Universe.</p>
              <p>If I were to say:</p>
              <p>The vibrational energy of Earth is in the process of rising and re-balancing itself to fit into the energy frequency of our solar system (which has already changed), and hence the occurrence of more tectonic movements and major climate changes. More powerful waves of solar energy and universal energy are reaching Earth to help in the rising of Earth's vibration. How many people will understand or will give themselves a chance to learn more?</p>
              <p>So I shall not explain further, as there are many on the sidelines waiting to start yet another flamewar in this forum. There's far more positive uses of energy than generating more words of anger. :)</p>
              <p>It's human nature to react immediately to 'fight or flight' situations. But it'll be far more enriching for one's learning journey if we can step back and hold, open our minds and hearts to learn and grow, before firing that first shot.</p>

              <p><br>The global efforts to help the surviving population is the good that came from those who died. Those who died helped the surviving population. How many people in the world are truly aware of how life was like in Haiti prior to this recent disaster? Those who died, however tragic it may be now, will have grown in their soul journey, and have a better life next time, with greater experience.</p>
              <p>While grief is currently felt, we need to understand the Cycle of Life, to understand where we came from, and where we're going. Else we'll just be running on the spot, with the scenery changing only.</p>

              <p><br>It's heartening to know you truly feel for the people of Haiti. While you can choose to help them, there are people right here in Singapore who also need help, but are often not visible in our affluent society. It'll be more uplifting if you could garner enough support for such cases. True actions don't need to be visible. It's often the most visible actions that need greater scrutiny of their true motives. :)</p>

              <p>Nope, i didnt specifically mention Haitians, i also mention others, even the rich has their suffering</p>
              <p>And none of this got to with whatever consciousness, experience or beliefs that you are trying to propagate to justify for people's suffering</p>
              <p>If you go along this line, i can only say you are the worst monster Mother Earth could afford</p>
