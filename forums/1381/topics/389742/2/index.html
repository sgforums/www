              <p><br> Indeed, you're right about earthquakes caused by Earth movements.
              To fully understand what I've said, needs one to understand how
              Earth truly came about, and what truly caused the various tectonic
              movements from time of Pangea to the continents of today, as well
              as the changes to the planetary and star systems in our
              Universe.</p>
              <p>If I were to say:</p>
              <p>The vibrational energy of Earth is in the process of rising
              and re-balancing itself to fit into the energy frequency of our
              solar system (which has already changed), and hence the occurrence
              of more tectonic movements and major climate changes. More powerful
              waves of solar energy and universal energy are reaching Earth to
              help in the rising of Earth's vibration. How many people will
              understand or will give themselves a chance to learn more?</p>
              <p>So I shall not explain further, as there are many on the
              sidelines waiting to start yet another flamewar in this
              forum. There's far more positive uses of energy than
              generating more words of anger. :)</p>
              <p>It's human nature to react immediately to 'fight or flight'
              situations. But it'll be far more enriching for one's learning
              journey if we can step back and hold, open our minds and hearts to
              learn and grow, before firing that first shot.</p>

              <p>Whether the HAARP triggered the floods, droughts, hurricanes, thunderstorms, and devastating earthquakes in Afghanistan and the Philippines aimed to "shake up" Muslim terrorists or the major power outages, the downing of <span class="mw-redirect">TWA flight 800</span>, <span class="mw-redirect">Gulf War Syndrome</span>, <span class="mw-redirect">Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</span> or the <span class="mw-redirect">Columbine High School shootings</span> or not, we wouldn't know cause I don't think we will know anyway.</p>
              <p>US troops deployments might be suspicious considering the numbers of troops and personnel in Haiti but they helped to keep the capital's airport accessible although there were a few incidents...</p>
              <p>But if you look at Haiti:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>In 1925, Haiti was lush, with 60% of its original forest
              covering the lands and mountainous regions. Since then, the population
              has cut down an estimated 98% of its original forest cover for use as
              fuel for cookstoves, and in the process has destroyed fertile farmland
              soils, contributing to desertification.</p>
              <p>In addition to soil erosion, deforestation
              has caused periodic flooding, as seen on 17 September 2004. Earlier
              that year in May, floods had killed over 3,000 people on Haiti's
              southern border with the Dominican Republic.</p>

              <p>It's not hard to see why Haiti is hit by natural disasters, Haitians destroyed their environment but I believe it's due to poverty. We can only hope that the Haitians will be able to get back and rebuild their homeland.</p>

              <p>Ain't that the truth!</p>
              <p>But beliefs that natural disasters are "acts of God" or direct products
              of human misbehavior are still alive in various forms and in various
              religions. For example, after the Asian tsunami there was a news story
              about a man whose family had survived and who commented that they did
              so because they had good karma while those who died or were injured had
              bad karma!</p>

And of course I do see the problem due to intolerances and belive, but not the same way as you have done. Anyway, your RainBow Jigsaw, I seen one of the few post. I seen that your blog. And I seen that you have posted about Goddness of Mercy speaking. Is there any prove that Goddness of Mecry exsist and have spoken to us? Such as channeled message? To be frank, I think you have ideas from many religion, and facts, and you have make up your truth from these. And you even have a Channeled message in your blog. Is it even scienfically proven? Is it part of your truth? I not looking for a fight. I just want to know about the world more. Unless you have some twisted logic and ideas, why not shared it with us?

              <p>People who are meant to be awakened at this crucial period of evolution will be. They will receive the necessary help, from Higher Beings and spiritual guides, that they need, at the right time, as it's their life plan. Their accumulated experience from all their previous lives will help determine their readiness to be awakened. But eventually, it's their freewill that determines whether their life plan proceeds successfully.</p>
              <p>Your experience in Life (not just current life) so far has been too deeply entrenched in physical experiences, hence you have not had true spiritual experiences. What Man has written in books are just words. You need to use your heart and intuition to feel and distinguish what's Truth from incomplete knowledge due to limited experiences, and what's Truth from manipulated lies, half-truths or half-lies.</p>
              <p>Though it's not time yet for you, patience and openess of heart/mind will help you gain the necessary skills and knowledge in your learning journey ahead. When that day comes, you'll be very amazed at the linkage between modern Science and ancient spiritual knowledge. :)</p>
              <p>For a start, you may want to read my post on Law of Attraction: <a href="/forums/1381/topics/390177">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1381/topics/390177</a> .  Higher Beings are attracted to higher positive vibrational frequencies. Negativity will keep one deeply entrenched in the physical plane.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Ok. Rainbow Jigsaw. I think you should just post at <a title="~ Buddhism: Wisdom Bliss ~" href="/forums/1728">~ Buddhism: Wisdom Bliss ~</a>. Since you already talked about Goddness of Mercy, which I belive she is a deity to most Buddhism, I think you should go there. Here is Eternal Truth, meaning people who come here (not to flame people, bashed people but to learn), are usually people interested to learn more about Christianity. Therefore, if you haved talk about Goddness of Mercy and related stuff, it is natural that we will not have the same ideas as you, as I belive she is mention in Buddhism, not Christianity. Unless you posted here thinking she is mention in the Bible, then I no comment, but to tell you is your mistake that you posted in wrong section of the forum</p></div>

              <p><em>Goddess of Mercy, Kuan Yin, has responded to our question below on the recent Haiti earthquake disaster, with the following channeled message for all. She is also giving you a loving gift of energy (Light of love) in her message:</em></p>
              <p>I really don't know wat religion do u really believe in.U believe Kuan Yin can be interviewed and talked like a politician... Why don't u tell us wat actually do u believe in first ? Taoism tat speaks in tongue ? Or u believed in all major religions simultaneously because u r scared of offending any particular group ?</p>

              <p>Wonder how many people who are currently fighting so hard in Sgforums for his/her religion/beliefs against other religions/beliefs can say what good has it done for his/her life? A neutral visitor of Sgforums' religious forums can only see daily flamewars and acts of negativity, in the name of religion, belief system and Science, instead of genuine sharing and growing. What's the point then of talking about Consciousness, Hope and Wisdom?</p>
              <p>I consider myself a spiritual free-thinker, and my beliefs, experiences and lifeplan doesn't have to be of importance to forumers, as it's my lifepath, just as each of you have your own lifeplan and lifepath, whether you know it or not. I'm here only because my lifepath is meant to cross (for good reason) with certain individuals amongst the readers, who will intuitively know. They are definitely not among the active posters. I've no interest or intention to disrupt anyone's belief system.</p>
              <p>To me, how a person treats others is more important that what belief/organisation he/she has or belongs to. But seems that people are more interested in comparing what handphones, cars/bikes, houses, jobs and beliefs/organisations they have or belong to, in the same breath. :)  If people can live more genuine lives, regardless of their beliefs, there'll not be so much fear and apprehension of death and afterlife.</p>
