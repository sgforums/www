After glancing through it, I felt motivated to write a response.<br><br>(Preliminary note on the term Â“health and wealth gospelÂ”: By that term is designated a brand of teaching within the professing Christian church that espouses and emphasizes the idea of temporal benefits (mainly, health and wealth) as being of great importance in GodÂ’s will for all Christians. According to this teaching, Christians can and should access such divine benefits by claiming in faith GodÂ’s supposed promises in these regard. Associated ideas and terminology include Â“faith healingÂ”, Â“positive confessionÂ”, and Â“name-it-and-claim-itÂ”. The intuition or reasoning behind such teaching is the rather simplistic one that moves from certain obvious scriptural truths, e.g., GodÂ’s love for us and His omnipotence, to the false conclusion that He must therefore want and would bless His own with what seems obviously desirable to humansÂ—health and wealth. This teaching, however, ultimately fails to do justice to the whole counsel of Scripture, and fails to glorify God in all His revealed wisdom, love, majesty and sovereignty. I believe that Â“health and wealth gospelÂ” describes PrinceÂ’s teachings; but whether or not it accurately describes the said teaching is not the main point of this critique.)<br><br>I shall first briefly lay out the main propositions of PrinceÂ’s teaching on the Holy Communion (HC), and then proceed to examine each of them in further detail. His teaching can be summed up thusly:<br><br>Optimal health is GodÂ’s will for all Christians. Therefore, something is very wrong when Christians suffer weakness, sickness, or premature death (WSPD). To be precise, there is Â“one and only one reasonÂ” (10) for WSPD and that is the Â“failure to discern the LordÂ’s bodyÂ” (11) in the partaking of the Holy Communion. Now, if it is true that there is only one reason for WSPD, and that it is the unworthy partaking of the HCÂ—understood as the failure to discern and claim by faith the healing power of the communion breadÂ—then Prince is justified in concluding that Christians should be in good health if they do what he proposes as they approach the LordÂ’s Table. It is my contention that this claim on which his entire teaching on the HC depends is false.<br><br>Prince then goes on to interpret a few relevant verses in 1 Cor 11, attempting to clarify what a few of the key expressions mean. First, it is to the Â“principalities and powersÂ” (that is, the devils) that we Â“proclaim the LordÂ’s deathÂ” (v. 26) and His victory over them. Second, partaking Â“in an unworthy mannerÂ” (v. 29) refers to the partaking of the HC without a recognition and claiming by faith of its healing powers. Third, the command to Â“examine yourselvesÂ” before one partakes (v. 2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> refers, once again, to reflection to see if one is approaching the Table in faith that consuming the bread will make one healthy and whole. Fourth, the warning of drinking Â“judgementÂ” to oneself (v. 29) refers to missing out on the blessing of healing, and continuing to suffer the divine sentence of physical susceptibility to WSPD that befell all humankind when Adam and Eve fell into sin. All these notions, however, seem to be neither taught in 1 Cor 11 nor in the handful of other verses he cites in support of them. I will consider, for instance, his use of Col 2:15 in his teaching of the proclamation made to devils (v. 26); and Acts 2:42 which he cites to persuade that his view of the HC is not a novel one but indeed one that was accepted and practiced by the early church.<br><br>In conclusion, since the effects of the HC are so wonderful, guaranteeing health and wholenessÂ—even a sort of perennial youthfulness (Â“And even your friends will see the results. They will begin to ask you, Â“Hey, why do you seem to look younger and younger? You never seem to age!Â” p. 47)Â—Prince encourages his readers to partake of the HC as often as possible, as often as you need it, as the more you partake, the better you will get.<br><br>Now I shall move on to a more detailed examination and critique of PrinceÂ’s teachings listed above. If you are interested in critiquing Prince's or like teachings; if you agree with Prince and would like to respond; or if you're simply interested for other reasons, read on!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><a href="http://wooq.blogspot.com/2005/08/doctrinal-heresy-of-healing-through.html" rel="nofollow">http://wooq.blogspot.com/2005/08/doctrinal-heresy-of-healing-through.html</a><br><br>This is a theological rebuttal to the article "Health And Wholeness Through The Holy Communion" by Joseph Prince, pastor of New Creation Church, Singapore. The article can be found in the August 2004 issue of Solid Rock, a publication of New Creation Church, or viewed at the website www.newcreation.org.sg. Another blogger, Elaine Loh, has provided a more detailed theological rebuttal that can be found over here.<br><br>In this article, Joseph Prince tries to show his readers that the Holy Communion has the ability to grant divine health to its partakers. Prince wrote in the article:<br><br>As long as we are here on earth, our bodies are subject to the ageing process, which is part of the divine sentence. All our bodies are decaying every day. Our brain cells are dying daily.<br><br>The Holy Communion is GodÂ’s solution for us to stop the decay. And even your friends will see the results. They will begin to ask you, Â“Hey, why do you seem to look younger and younger? You never seem to age!Â”<br><br>One day, when we get to heaven, we will have brand new bodies that never grow old, never tire and never look bad. Meanwhile, the LordÂ’s Supper is how God helps us offset this process of ageing and walk in divine health. Every time you partake, you are reversing the effects of the curse or divine judgement in your bodyÂ…<br>Throughout the entire article, Prince mainly used 1 Corinthians 11:20-22,27-30 as his main Biblical reference. As I read and reread through the entire article a couple of times, I have discovered to my astonishment that Prince absolutely failed to highlight 1 Corinthians 11:23-26, which explains the real purpose of the Holy Communion:<br><br>For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me." In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me." For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.<br>When the Apostle Paul wrote this Scriptural passage, he was making reference to the event at Luke 22:19, where it states: Â“And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me."<br><br>The big question to Prince is, if the Holy Communion is intended to provide divine healing, Jesus would have said, Â“do this to heal your bodiesÂ” or Â“do this in remembrance and it will heal your bodies also.Â” These alternative phrasings would definitely prove that there is healing in the Holy Communion. Though at the beginning of the article, Prince made clear that he would refer to 1 Corinthians 11, he probably knew that the verses 23-26 will not cast his unscriptural doctrine in a favorable light. Thus he chose to skip these verses entirely altogether.<br><br>Even without verses 23-26, Prince has failed to establish a direct relation between healing and the Holy Communion. Prince wrote,<br><br>What is it to partake unworthily? Read the rest of verse 29 and you will conclude that if you fail to discern or understand the significance of the LordÂ’s body, you are eating and drinking in an unworthy manner.<br><br>The Corinthians partook unworthily because they did not recognise that the broken body of the Lord was meant to bring them health and wholeness.<br><br>And by treating the Holy Communion as a ritual, they missed out on the blessings. They did not understand the significance of the bread. They did not know why they were partaking. This is what it means to partake unworthily.<br><br>The manner in which we partake will determine whether we experience the benefits of the LordÂ’s body. If our attitude is Â“itÂ’s just a piece of breadÂ”, then that is what it will be. And we will have robbed ourselves of the life-giving effects of the bread at His Table.<br>The full text of verse 29 is Â“For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself.Â” Prince is implying that the Corinthians failed to recognize the Â“life-giving effects,Â” which he took to be Â“healing, health and wholeness.Â” However, there is a difference between the phrase Â“recognizing the bodyÂ” and Â“recognizing the benefits of the body.Â” The former is trying to caution the Christians not to treat the Holy Communion like an ordinary meal by looking towards the atonement of Jesus Christ, while the latter is stressing on the blessings of the atonement.<br><br>Was the Apostle Paul concerned that the Corinthians were not recognizing the blessings? It seems not. At verses 20-22, the Apostle Paul stated the problem the Corinthians had with the Holy Communion; that they were treating it like an ordinary meal.<br><br>When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat, for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk. Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not!<br>The Corinthians were partaking the Holy Communion in a disorderly manner, with some getting drunk while others getting hungry. It is clear that the problem was behavioral. It has nothing to do with recognizing the blessings of the atonement. If the Corinthians had been partaking in an orderly manner, then perhaps PrinceÂ’s interpretation might have made more sense.<br></div>
