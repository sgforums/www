            <div class='col-md body'>I came to know Christ only when I joined Boys' Brigade when I was P4. I didn't believe anything at all in the first place. However, on 1 day, when a schoolmate have an accident in school, I prayed at one corner. My life begin to change, during PSLE, I prayed and God revealed to me to read a composition and that came out for my papers. Slowly, my faith grows and I got baptised last year Aug. I've been rather active in Church, seeing His work in my daily life. Though going through a trial now, I believe that everything that God allow it to happen to me is in His perfect plan. Alot of my friends come to know Christ through my Christian Friends and our Faith. Praise God for His Marvellous work ! AMEN</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>posted my testimonial here b4:<br><br>hmm, from young, my sis was born 1/2 deaf, so my parents would always shower their attention on her, so usually i as the older sibling would feel very neglected. i would always quarrel with my sister, sorta as pay back for taking away my parents from me. it would be very bad, always quarreling, whacking each other. even simple stuff like TV we will always fight.<br><br>my parents would also put alot of pressure on me, always comparing me with other people, why i cannot do as well as other ppl, from young, i would always be distant from my family. always shutting myself from family life, leaving the house early in the day till late at night, once i reach home i would shut the door of my room till the next day.<br><br>when i first received Jesus and became a christian, family life grew worse, they didn't really understand, so there were even more quarrels, esp when i decided to be baptised. but it was when i became a christian, i learnt to forgive, not forgetting totally, but forgiving was a first step. i would pray for them to understand, and to know what joy i had found thru my faith. it was like finding a cave full of gold and i want to share it with my family. there was enough, certainly for everyone.<br><br>God works funny. my dad fell sick, his face was totally swollen, until now we dunno wat is the cause, he went to see the doctor and skin specialists who didn't know what was the problem so they just gave him skin ointments and stuff, but for over 3 months, the condition grew worse and worse.<br><br>one day, one of my dad friend, who is also a christian, we all call her aunty cindy. she was training to be a pastor in australia or was it her husband. i forgot, she came back to visit us. my dad was very concerned over my new faith in christ. so she came over to talk to me and share with me a few stuff. and to share with my family as well. then she asked if she could pray for my family. somehow while she was praying, we could, not just me, feel a presence in the room, there was a peace, unable to describe, and a burden lifted. my dad just broke down and cried and we all cried. and reconciled. aunty cindy then invited us, as a family to her church to take a look. so we went the following week.<br><br>at the end of the sermon, aunty cindy encouraged my dad to try prayer, since medication didnt work, after prayer, he said he saw hands of light, touching his face and he felt a heat on his face. then he woke up already lying down on the floor. for me. it was like 20 mins seeing my dad on the floor. and the great thing was, my dad condition got better, the sore and pus got lesser and lesser.<br><br>and over the week, he was totally back to his old self.<br><br>after 2 visits to the church, after the sermon my dad pulled my sleeve and said he wanted to be a christian and receive salvation as a family. so he went up there to be prayed for.<br><br>now my family is very close, of course there would be occational quarrel, but none would hv a lasting impact. my sis and i grew closer together, from hatred to indifference, and from indifference to small chats, now we would still chat and talk, small topics of course, but we could stand being in the same room together, and i believe God will still work through in me, and my family, to become closer together..<br><br>now not only that, my dad is now more "on fire" than me, he's brought an old family friend to Christ, uncle joe and his whole family. and aunty janet's sister also came to know the Lord not long ago.<br><br>2 lessons learnt here, firstly most people ignore God, until God gets tired and give that fellow a good kick in the ass, then they turn to God to seek Him.<br><br>secondly, the harder the person's heart is before he receive Christ, the tougher his skin is, after he receive Christ. Shamelessly happily sharing with everyone he knows. and by shamelessly, i of course mean, proudly, not shameful mah, cuz he is so proud of the gospel!</div>
