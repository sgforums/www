If not, we will just be like any pharisee who think they have great faith and refuse to help people even when they are in distress. Christ has great faith but if he had not helped the woman whom people tried to stone she would have died. This shows actions comes together with faith and not just mere faith.<br><br>I was on my way to work two days ago with my friend and he couldn't help notice a woman reading the bible and not giving seat to an elderly lady standing infront of her. This friend is a non-believer. How to convince non-believers like my friend that we are going to heaven just becoz of our faith?<br><br></div>
