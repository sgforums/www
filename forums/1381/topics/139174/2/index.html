            <div class='col-md body'>My mum and friends whom are non-believers have always asked me:<br>"So anyone can go heaven just by believing in Christ?"<br>"Is God selfish by having a chosen people like the Israelites?"<br><br>They do not believe that a man who do many good deeds would go hell while big baddie "Christians"/butchers are going heaven just by 'having faith' in Christ. Think they have the notion that Christianity is a selfish faith which is more of saving oneself by believing in Christ.<br><br>Think the only way to win people to the gospel is to tell them that GOD loves all and he wants everyone to listen to the good news. He wants everyone to be saved, even criminals/big baddies.<br><br>Wish i myself can have enuff faith and do emulate Christ's gentleness and works.

For myself i believe 'save' means being not excluded from God's kingdom. It is true that evryone will be judged accordingly by GOD's standards. Think he is the only one who can say we have enuff faith and did enuff to be included in his kingdom.<br><br>Faith is essential as we acknowledge the Son who is the only one able to save us from sins and death.

Believing in the Son is just the first basic step in getting yourself saved. Think there are many things to be developed from there once u believed, not just believe for once and later forgot everything one should do to honour GOD.<br><br>Think as Christians we are subjected to even close scrutiny when some 'claimed to have exclusive rights to go heaven'. When pastors/priests did something wrong or break the law people will lose confidence in the faith.<br>Non believers are also put off by insensitive behaviours of fellow christians.<br>Think Christians should be mindful of their roles as ambassadors to GOD, rather than fiery evangelists who claimed "u will go hell u idolator".</div>

I did not develop my faith as my family was against and I gradually drifted away from GOD.<br><br>But GOD did not forsake me as when many years later, I met my gf who is also a christian. At that time I also discovered I have Hep C. Believing in Christ had helped me battle my disease. I discovered I did not have many of the drastic side effects from my high doses of toxic medication. I am still undergoing treatment now (half way) and so far it has been surprisingly tolerable (read many bad experiences from overseas people who is also undergoing the same treatment). At the same time, I also managed to got into university now at my late twenties, after some years as a regular officer, which is unbelieving even for me.<br><br>Just want to say it is my own experience, I am also very skeptical like many others who would say "ah...this is luck.....you believe what u wanna believe..."...but it is my own experience tat God loves me.<br><br></div>
