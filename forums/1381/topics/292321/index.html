            <div class='col-md body'>Hello all,<br><br>There will be a new children's movie out in December called "The Golden Compass".  The movie has been described as "atheism for kids" and is based on the first book of a trilogy entitled "His Dark Materials" that was written by Phillip Pullman.  Pullman is a militant atheist and secular humanist who despises C. S. Lewis and the "Chronicles of Narnia".  His motivation for writing this trilogy was specifically to counteract Lewis' symbolisms of Christ that are portrayed in the Narnia series.<br><br>Clearly, Pullman's main objective is to bash Christianity and promote atheism.  Pullman left little doubt about his intentions when he said in a 2003 interview that "my books are about killing God."  He has even stated that he wants to "kill God in the minds of children ".  It has been said of Pullman that he is "the writer the atheists would be praying for, if atheists prayed."<br><br>While "The Golden Compass" movie itself may seem mild and innocent, the books are a much different story.  In the trilogy, a young streetwise girl becomes enmeshed in an epic struggle to ultimately defeat the oppressive forces of a senile God.  Another character, an ex-nun, describes Christianity as "a very powerful and convincing mistake."  In the final book, characters representing Adam and Eve eventually kill God, who at times is called YAHWEH.  Each book in the trilogy gets progressively worse regarding Pullman's hatred of Jesus Christ.<br><br>"The Golden Compass" is set to premier on December 7, during the Christmas season (and staring Nicole Kidman), and will probably be heavily advertised.  Promoters hope that unsuspecting parents will take their children to see the movie, that they will enjoy the movie, and that the children will want the books for Christmas.<br><br>Please consider a boycott of the movie and the books. Also, pass this information along to everyone you know (including church leaders).  This will help to educate parents, so that they will know the agenda of the movie.<br><br>God Bless <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by alvinlam_07:</div><div class="quote_body">Hello all,<br><br>There will be a new children's movie out in December called "The Golden Compass".  The movie has been described as "atheism for kids" and is based on the first book of a trilogy entitled "His Dark Materials" that was written by Phillip Pullman.  Pullman is a militant atheist and secular humanist who despises C. S. Lewis and the "Chronicles of Narnia".  His motivation for writing this trilogy was specifically to counteract Lewis' symbolisms of Christ that are portrayed in the Narnia series.<br><br>Clearly, Pullman's main objective is to bash Christianity and promote atheism.  Pullman left little doubt about his intentions when he said in a 2003 interview that "my books are about killing God."  He has even stated that he wants to "kill God in the minds of children ".  It has been said of Pullman that he is "the writer the atheists would be praying for, if atheists prayed."<br><br>While "The Golden Compass" movie itself may seem mild and innocent, the books are a much different story.  In the trilogy, a young streetwise girl becomes enmeshed in an epic struggle to ultimately defeat the oppressive forces of a senile God.  Another character, an ex-nun, describes Christianity as "a very powerful and convincing mistake."  In the final book, characters representing Adam and Eve eventually kill God, who at times is called YAHWEH.  Each book in the trilogy gets progressively worse regarding Pullman's hatred of Jesus Christ.<br><br>"The Golden Compass" is set to premier on December 7, during the Christmas season (and staring Nicole Kidman), and will probably be heavily advertised.  Promoters hope that unsuspecting parents will take their children to see the movie, that they will enjoy the movie, and that the children will want the books for Christmas.<br><br>Please consider a boycott of the movie and the books. Also, pass this information along to everyone you know (including church leaders).  This will help to educate parents, so that they will know the agenda of the movie.<br><br>God Bless <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div></blockquote>Actually whilst the book is about atheism, I don't see the big fuss about showing it at christmas time... after all christmas is pagan in origin... so nothing unusual there. The christmas tree is pagan etc... and Yeshua was not even born on that day...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
