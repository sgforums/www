Christians seem to go around with the ideal that we all have the right to tell the world about God and Christ through shows like Passion of Christ or subtlely through Narnia... but why is it that Atheists do not have the right to tell the world their POV??? I don't have to necessarily share the same POV, but to allow someone else the right to do so is really not wrong....<br><br>also, is God so small and powerless that He has no way of dealing with it?</div>
