              <p>i personally feel that both of you have more or less, nothing
                  else to say alr.</p>
              <p>chin eng and i believe that faith alone saves, because God has
                  the power to die for the entire sins of the entire world. As the
                  alpha and omega, the begining and the end, he could see the first
                  sin till the last sin, and he died the perfect death for all those
                  sins, swallowing up death in victory.</p>
              <p>and based on scripture, lots of scripture asserted that we are
                  saved on faith, not on works (since works are basically obedience
                  to the law - loving God and loving men).</p>
              <p>the old covenent - do good, get good, do bad, get beat.</p>
              <p>the new covenent - a new righteousness apart from the law has
                  been found in Christ Jesus. (can something which is righteousness
                  be incomplete, needing men to complete what God has done?)</p>
              <p>personally, nothing wrong with good works, so long you don't
                  start thinking that you're better than anyone else (because to be
                  truthful, i've seen alot of catholics who are assholes - from
                  catholic high, to various churches - which makes you a bigger
                  hypocrite because you include good works as part of your salvation
                  - though i feel is incorrect anyway), and that you give glory to
                  God alone, for your salvation, knowing that you yourself are a
                  sinner, saved by God's grace. it's not your knowledge about God
                  (i've seen athiests knowing more about God than a christian), or
                  your tons of good deeds (since compared to God's standard, they are
                  nothing but filthy rags)</p>
              <p>Personally, I think, struggling with sin alone - shows your
                  salvation, because a person who is saved, is now conscious of his
                  sins, sure he slips alot, but he knows it's wrong, and he keeps
                  periodically throwing out cigarettes, deleting porn, trying to find
                  self help for his addiction etc. As quoted in james - you claim to
                  have faith, but I have deeds which shows my faith.</p>
              <p>i think (recent revelation), i rather elevate someone, encourage
                  someone to fight the good fight, to praise someone in their small
                  efforts to keep the faith, than to nit pick and tear someone down.
                  Since i am just a sinner saved by grace, with no significant good
                  works to talk about, i think i'll choose to view everyone who
                  believes in Jesus the same way. the ark of the covenant is made of
                  wood, covered in gold. we're all imperfect, covered in the blood of
                  Jesus, the perfect high priest. so whatever that is good, and
                  worthy, I'll think of those things.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">so in the end, based on our
                  differing doctrines, the question you should ask yourself is - when
                  did you last do your good deed, and what's so good about it? And
                  when is the last time you did something sinful, in thought or in
                  action, and resulting from this questions, ask yourself, are you
                  worthy before God on your works?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">and the question, chin eng and
                  i ask ourselves is - what's the last good thing God did for us,
                  that we can be really thankful for and give God the glory
                  for?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>tts all i have to say. because so far, the past few posts have
                  been anything but constructive.</p>
              <p>what do you think, chin eng?</p>

              <p>Actually, all of us believes that it is faith that saves….and even agrees that true faith will bear fruits / works. There was never dispute on that.<br><br>The only difference is I  believed salvation as a process and not simply when professing faith. Thus, my view that salvation is by faith and works when God make His judgement on our last day. Even protestant churches believes that it is a process too.<br><br>Works is not to replace the grace of God or add on to the finish work of Christ.<br><br><strong>The only contention left is the application of the salvation theory which to me seems to have some logic failure. Perhaps, there is something that I missed and I appreciate vince69 trying to explain.</strong><br><br>Assholes are plenty and everywhere – even here. Catholic High not an accurate reference to use as only about 10% of the students are Catholics. <br><br>And you are right that there are hypocrite whose actions do not match what they preach. Not just Christians but people in general….like one who claimed to be pro-Catholic and yet is truly more anti-Catholic than you.<br><br>Anyone can claimed to be Christians but their life will reflect if they are truly Christians and if they are witness to Christ. <br><br>Jesus taught the truth and reinforced his teachings by using his miraculous power to heal and do good.  Throughout His life, he lived an exemplary life responding to lepers, tax collectors, prostitutes, and his dearest friends with the same consistent love, compassion, charity and righteousness.<br><br>As Jesus said, not all who call me Lord Lord will enter into kingdom of heaven but those who hear the words and act on it.<br><br>You are right that we should reflect on our own lives often and ask ourselves – are we witness to Christ and how do we glorify Him….or do we merely call Him “Lord….Lord…”<br><br>At least the last few posts did reveal the old fox's tail .......</p>
