              <p>No where do I see anything that explains why faith (unproven yet with works) can saves.</p>
              <p>In fact, it echoes my feelings that if there is no love (shown by works), one can claim anything they want.....that they are saved whatever....it means nothing. As I mentioned earlier, to do good work is to love God - not hair splitting moments.</p>
              <p>Anyway, that's your contention which is fine with me. I am just wondering and still wondering why faith (unproven yet) can saves when we all agreed before that only true faith in Christ (that is proven by works) can saves....Perhaps, I'll never get any answer...</p>
              <p>For me, I believed that I am saved in hope (by the grace of God) and have started the process of salvation by God when I profess my faith. In the end on judgement day, I will be judged based on my works as Jesus spelt out in the last judgement and complete my salvation.</p>
              <p>I strive to live my Christian life loving God and in the end, I hoped to be able to say : "I have fought the good fight to the end; I have run the race to the finish; I have kept the faith;" as Paul said in 2Timothy 4:7. Kept my faith with my love for God (good works) to show and proved. It's not lips service or unproven faith ....... that saves me but my true faith in Christ.</p>

              <p>Let me try to explain how 'faith' can save without works, yet 'works' is generally present when real 'faith' is present, with a simple story found in the good book:From many other stories, it is recorded that Jesus heals the faithful.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>After these things, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. And at Jerusalem is a pool at the Sheep Gate which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches.</p>
              <p>In these was a great multitude of the infirm lying, blind ones, lame ones, withered ones, awaiting the stirring of the water.</p>
              <p>For an angel at a certain time descended in the pool and agitated the water. Then the one first entering after the agitation of the water became well, whatever disease he was held by.</p>
              <p>But a certain man was there, being in infirmity thirty eight years. Seeing him lying, and knowing that he had already spent much time, Jesus said to him,</p>
              <p>"Do you desire to become well?"</p>
              <p>The infirm one answered Him,</p>
              <p>"Lord, I do not have a man, that when the water is agitated he may throw me into the pool; but while I am coming, another goes down before me."</p>
              <p>Jesus said to him,</p>
              <p>"Rise up, Take up your cot and walk!"</p>
              <p>And instantly the man became well, and took up his cot and walked. And it was a sabbath that day.</p>
              <p>(John 5:1-9)<br></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>In the above example, the Jews were expected to "show their faith" by being the first the reach the pool after it was stirred by the angel.</p>
              <p>For years, the sick man was crippled, bedridden, and unable to do the very works that would be able to cure him (i.e. going down into the water when it is stirred).</p>
              <p>On that fateful day, Christ himself asked if he had the <strong>desire</strong> to be healed, all he wanted to hear (and knowing God is all-knowing, he probably asked aloud so that <strong>others around</strong> might hear of the man's profession of faith in becoming healed of his infirmities, a method that was again exemplified in Mark 2:5-12)</p>
              <p>When the man, who was physically unable to perform the works required of him had shown faith, Christ healed him just the same.</p>
              <p>The God we worship listen not to mere words or looks merely at actions, He searches the hearts of men to seperate the truly faithful and those who only proclaims, either through words or actions, to be so.</p>
              <p>This is similar to how faithful prayer is described in the following, when words and action fail us, but we are in one mind with God:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>In certain ways we are weak, but the Spirit is here to help us. For example, when we don't know what to pray for, the Spirit prays for us in ways that cannot be put into words.</p>
              <p>(Romans 8:26)</p>
              </blockquote>

              <p>true faith saves, whether proven by works or not.</p>
              <p>if a person dies immediately after he believed, does it makes his faith untrue because he has no works to show?</p>
              <p>in the end, works are really for show to men, works benefit the people around us, that's why we should do them.</p>
              <p>it has nothing to do with salvation. true faith, brings forth love, which brings forth desire to do good, and in doing good works, people around us benefit, and God uses us to bless others through good works.</p>

              <p>Yes,  my example was mainly brought up to illustrate that it is faith which saves, not the work itself.</p>
              <p>However, as James has written, with real faith, so long the person is physically capable of it, will always bring about works. If a person says he believes, but deliberately refrains from taking good actions that he is well capable of doing, then his faith is not real. As James have written in Chapter 2 Verse 19,</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>You surely believe there is only one God. That's fine. Even demons believe this, and it makes them shake with fear.</p>

              <p>The faith expected of Christians is not merely the belief that God exist, or that Christ saves. It has to also come with true obedience to His Word. The difference between demons and Christians is just that; one merely knows God, the other actually follows him.</p>
              <p>dumbdumb! further emphasizes with his example: where a person is not capable of action, it is not held against him. What God hold against Man is when they do not have the right heart - for whilst one may be incapable of actions due to disability or other reasons, no one can claim to be incapable of making the decision to love God and our fellowmen. The choice is always theirs to make.</p>

              <p>The second guy profess the faith for the sake of getting married.....</p>
              <p>Both are saved in hope......and whoever goes on and live their lifes as true Christians (one that has faith and good works) will be in the group of the sheep on last judgement day.

              <p>So the whole process is avaible to them (FREE) and it is up to them to co-operate with Christ so that they can be saved.</p>
              <p>If one has the intention of really trusting in Christ, saving today will make no difference in their lifes.....and they really need to be saved on their last day.....so that they can "fight the good fight to the end; run the race to the finish; and says I have kept the faith"</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Universality of the Catholic Church</span></p>
              <p>Interesting comment you made about the lack of universality in the Catholic Church. It is certainly true that worship practices, disciplines etc would differ within the Catholic Church. There would certainly be different segments of the Church having different focus and views about how the Church should conduct its activities etc. I would be concerned if every Catholic held exactly the same views; it wouldn't be human <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png">.</p>
              <p><em><strong>However</strong></em>, when it comes to official dogma and doctrines, there is unity and universality in the Catholic Church. Regardless of which country or city the Catholic Church is in, they all believe in and profess the same dogma and doctrines handed down from the apostles. The only way this can happen is because they all submit to the teaching authority of the magisterium (pope + bishops in communion with him). It is no surprise that the word 'Catholic' is derived from the greek word meaning 'Universal'.</p>
              <p>Of course this does not necessarily mean that every Catholic is well versed in his faith so there is no need to start pointing out why different Catholics may have different ideas about doctrines and dogma. Some folks might also call themselves Catholic Christians but reject half of what the Catholic Church teaches because the teachings are not 'convenient' to their lifestyles. </p>
              <p>As I understand it, the protestant world is <em>very</em> different. To varying degrees, every local church has its own doctrines based on the beliefs and 'revelations' of its local pastor. In my view, this lack of doctrinal universality is the result of the protestant doctrine of Sola Scriptura (bible alone) which allows every pastor (every protestant christian in fact) to interpret the bible all on his own without having to submit to any authority.</p>
