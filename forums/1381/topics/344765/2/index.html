              <p>It's ok if you want to back down and I respect that. This thread will explain why works is needed and I think most will agree on that. I guess vince69 and dumbdumb will.

              <div class="result-text-style-normal" style="font-family: 'Charis SIL', charis, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">a man CAN claim to have faith, even though in reality he doesn't. his faith will open his eyes to his consciousness of sins, he doesn't feel comfortable when he sins, he feels regret if he doesn't read the bible etc. he tries to do what is right because his faith leads him to do it.</div>

              <p> are these the action of someone who really has faith in Jesus?</p>
              <p>a person who places his faith in Jesus (at this point, receives salvation, tag free, work free), and that faith causes him to grow, to be hungry for God, to desire to know God more, to desire to love others more.. etc.</p>
