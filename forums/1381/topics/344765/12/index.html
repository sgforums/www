              <p>I have really don't care much about what Mr John Wesley thinks or define although it seems like he is saying that salvation has 5 phases and not a one-off event. It also seems like he agrees that salvation is a process.....something we are trying to explain here......</p>

              <p>Although true faith can only be proven in the face of God whom will decide, it does not means that we can ignore it....while roaming on earth. This is the time we should live out our faith and do what Jesus taught us to......otherwsie, being a Christian is meaningless.......</p>
              <p>Even though everything hinges on what happens in front of God, Jesus has painted a clear picture to us in the last judgement and His Gospel.

              <p>If you agree that God is the only judge and will decide, then how can one claimed to be saved?</p>
              <p>When judgement is done on the last day, how can we tell who has true faith? If I understand enough here, we agree is by his works / fruits.....</p>
              <p>So didn't salvation by faith and works (as fruits of our faith and not to add on to Christ finsih work or replace grace) now make some sense?</p>

              <p>Actually, we are talking about true faith which we already agreed is one that has works to show or fruits. This is what is being used to prove one's true faith in Christ. Unless you want to deviate and change the subject to what is proven faith......against what we are really trying to establish here - that only faith saves.....one that is true in Christ with works / fruits as proof.</p>

              <p>seems for the same reward, some don't need to work too hard. The focus are the<strong> pay (the reward) - which is the same</strong>, and the <strong>work to be done (which varies from worker to worker).... </strong></p>
              <p>.... but the crux of the matter is verse 15: God can do and whatever he wants, and if by that it means that just having faith is sufficient, who are you to argue with it? <em>And if you want an answer to the question of how faith without works can save.... the answer is: as long as God is happy about it, what are you going to do? To paraphrase: Not happy? Too bad!</em></p>
              <p>it has nothing to do with early Christians or later Christians, our lifespan is about the same. If it is, then i sure pity the catholics, the early Christians, because first will be last (verse 16)....</p>

              <p>Aiyah....you still trying to go back to "how to measure and quantify" thing.......The issue is your claimed that there is no works involved.....I am saying to say that is being JUDGEMENTAL.....<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>his last action is about not being silence and passive in the face of need, injustice and exploitation.....and thus <span style="color: #ff0000;">he did not deny Christ.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>As in your church doctrine:<br>"The Methodist Church must view the perplexing times and problems we face today in the light of the life and teaching of Jesus.  Jesus teaches us to love our neighbours and to seek justice for all.  <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Silence and passivity in the face of need, injustice and exploitation is to deny Christ.</strong></span><strong><span style="color: #000000;">"</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>It is not about good deal or bad deal lah!......But really, you think he only has 1 work to show (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">at least now better than none at the begining</span>)? But do you just want to continue to be judgemental? It's up to you.....You are arguging for the sake of arguing because this clearly should not be used to support faith alone.</p>
              <p>And yes, still the same reward even if he comes on the last day because God is generous and He is just. Do we need to be jealous about that or feel cheated (because we come earlier) because our rewards are the same?</p>

              <p>seems for the same reward, some don't need to work too hard. The
                      focus are the <strong>pay (the reward) - which is the

                      worker to worker)....</strong></p>
              <p>.... but the crux of the matter is verse 15: God can do and
                      whatever he wants, and if by that it means that just having faith
                      is sufficient, who are you to argue with it? <em>And if you want an
                      answer to the question of how faith without works can save.... the

                      do? To paraphrase: Not happy? Too bad!</em></p>
              <p>it has nothing to do with early Christians or later Christians,
                      our lifespan is about the same. If it is, then i sure pity the
                      catholics, the early Christians, because first will be last (verse

(still trying how to measure and quantify?)</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Faith without works cannot saves</strong></span></span> (we - maybe except you have agreed) and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>are you suggesting that God is not being fair to everyone and that God is not just? </strong></span></p>
              <p>Or are you suggesting that salvation is about claiming to have faith and leave it up to God's fancy (if He is happy or unhappy) if He wants to save you or not?</p>
              <p>Then what about the part of your salvation theory (since you claimed yours the same as dumbdumb and vince69) that it will lead to good works ? Or that faith that is true in Christ will bear fruits?</p>
              <p>Or perhaps you are saying that Paul is teaching just say it (or just claimed to have faith) and you are saved and then you don't even have to care if your faith is real or not.....?? Or do you think he preaches that we have true faith in God?</p>

              <p>but in case you wish for me to do likewise, repeat, i can: God
              can reward and give to anyone anything he pleases, if it pleases
              him that salvation is through faith, it's good enough for me.</p>
              <p>Matt 20: <span>9</span>"The workers who were hired about
              the eleventh hour came and each received a denarius.
              <span>10</span>So when those came who were hired first, they
              expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a
              denarius. <span>11</span>When they received it, they began to
              grumble against the landowner. <span>12</span>'These men who were
              hired last worked only one hour,' they said, 'and you have made
              them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat
              of the day.'</p>
              <p><span>13</span>"But he answered one of them, 'Friend, I am not
              being unfair to you. Didn't you agree to work for a denarius?
              <span>14</span>Take your pay and go. I want to give the man who was
              hired last the same as I gave you. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span>15</span>Don't I have the right to do what

              <p>on the same passage, it is obvious that those who got employed
              early thinks that they were doing more than those who were hired at
              the last hour.</p>
              <p>it is quite clear that those who were hired first feel that they
              had work harder than those hired at the last hour..... otherwise
              complain for what?</p>

              <p>Aiyah, people feel jealous and God tell us it is wrong.....No matter what, as long as you are given what you have been promised, it is fair. God is fair to all.....</p>
              <p>So if you want to be clever and thinking work more or less still same rewards, then work less is better deal....then it is your choice....</p>
              <p>To me that's one way to tell apart if one's heart is truely with Christ....why should you want to work less (and love Christ less) if you are a true believer? If one loves God, one wants to serve and do more...........not less.......(see can prove what....)</p>
              <p>And God is fair and He knows our hearts.......no need to prove to anyone but must be true to ourselves and God.</p>
              <p>I have said many times that I agreed that salvation is by faith but only true faith that has works to show.......Faith with works is dead!</p>

              <p>you assume that there is no works to show... how can you be sure that there is no works to show. as you'd said, quantity is not the issue, so even someone as vile as the thief (who's sentence to death) you deem that he has good works to show. reality is, is it possible for one to live his entire life without good works to show... Christ had already said to those who don't even know they had done good deeds that He knows who had done such good deeds...</p>
              <p>in the first place, who are you to determine what's "proven" and what's "unproven"? all we have is the our different stand as to whether we think works is part of salvation or not.... as i'd said, we all do good works regardless of where we stand....</p>
              <p>if you think that just because i don't see good works as part of salvation, i don't do good works, then you are really judgemental.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 2</span></p>
              <p>Then, you agreed that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>only God can judge and how can one then claimed to be saved? Who made that judgement ?</strong></span></p>
              <p>You keep talking abour proven faith and nothing about who made the judgement for those who claimed to have been saved.....(since you agree God will judge on our last day) and how can faith without works yet saves.....when we (maybe except you) agrees that only true faith in Christ proven by works saves......</p>

              <p>actually the proven faith thing was, i believe, raised by you. prior to you introducing this new concept, i have not heard of it before. it is something that i don't understand and i hope you can explain it.... but it seems you had just recently said: <span style="color: #ff0000;">And God is fair and He knows our hearts.......<strong>no need to prove to anyone</strong> but must be true to ourselves and God.</span></p>
              <p>yes only God can judge.... who does God judge? what is the criteria for God's judgement?</p>
              <p>some say it's between believers and unbelievers,</p>
              <p>others say it's believers on their deeds that will determine their rewards (not their salvation),</p>
              <p>there are probably other opinions too...</p>
              <p>my opinion? i believe God will judge between the believers and unbelievers, within the believers, God will judge the deeds I have done and determine my reward.</p>
              <p>there are various explanation in the "difference" between what Paul wrote in Ephesians and what James had written....  because neither side can prove that they are 100% correct, it is useless to counter each other.... you have your James and I have my Paul.... I can only share on the passage that is relevant to me, just like how you can share on the passage that is relevant to you....</p>

              <p><br>seeing that John Wesley is the founder of the Methodist movement.... you think that the Methodist discipline is based on him? but you seem to add the word "alone", which i had never claimed....</p>
              <p>i have found typing a little slower helped, plus try to remember to check before posting.... <em>dsicipline? </em></p>
              <p>what more did we know about the thief? he is a sentenced to death, he admitted that his crime deserved to be sentenced as such.... there were no records of him doing good works.... aside from voicing out against the other thief.... we know Christ promised him a place in heaven....</p>
              <p>we know nothing more....</p>
