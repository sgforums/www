              <p>everything starts of with lip service.</p>
              <p>i believe that receiving Christ is the first step, and that's "lip service" for everyone. everyone who puts their faith in Christ does so by professing that faith.</p>
              <p>unfortunately, with regards to work, it still boils down to what Christ is doing in their lives, God's purpose for them, and the time factor.</p>
              <p>someone who puts their faith in Christ and dies the next minute, is he not saved because he has no chance to prove his faith through work?</p>
              <p>is someone whose calling is to pray for others, less saved when compared to someone who led thousands to Christ in africa?</p>
              <p>is someone who is struggling with smoking less saved than someone who has never been tempted in that area?</p>
              <p>is the prostitute, saved the moment she believes in the love and salvation of Christ, or is she saved only after she wiped Jesus' feet with her tears and hair?</p>

              <p>No, even the Pope is not looking at faith based on his personal opinion and it is not his personal interpretation.....it is the official teaching of the Church. You don't have to agree but he is explaining what Paul said about faith and justifications.</p>
              <p>He further put forth the other biblical instances including James to show that it is not any faith that will save but true faith that has fruits. Like you, true faith must lead to fruits otherwise it is not true faith right?</p>
              <p>And he finally link it to the last judgement where Jesus tell us how He will be judging when the day comes.....</p>
              <p>In a short summary, it is faith that saves us but it must be true faith. One that has fruit. The fruit is good works and it is through good works that we proved our faith is true. And in the last judgement, Jesus ask questions that relates to our good works of love and charity to our neighbours. If we have shown loved our neighbours (as He commanded us) we have shown love to God.</p>
              <p>So, for me salvation is by faith and good works (for me that means true faith).</p>

              <p>shrugs. mine seems more detailed in the process. urs is ambigous.</p>
              <p>my equation is. salvation is by faith ALONE. that faith will produce good work in God's timing, since good works has nothing to do with us, according to branches and the vine parable.</p>
              <p>hey, what's your take on the prostitute?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>oh hey. u know smth? the bible nv said that there is.. true faith, or false faith actually. </p>
              <p>it only says that some CLAIM to have faith.</p>
              <p>i'm pretty sure you either have faith, or you don't. even if you don't have faith, you can claim that you do, but God knows your heart.</p>

              <p>everything starts of with lip service.</p>
              <p>i believe that receiving Christ is the first step, and that's
              "lip service" for everyone. everyone who puts their faith in Christ
              does so by professing that faith.</p>
              <p>unfortunately, with regards to work, it still boils down to what
              Christ is doing in their lives, God's purpose for them, and the
              time factor.</p>
              <p>someone who puts their faith in Christ and dies the next minute,
              is he not saved because he has no chance to prove his faith through
              work?</p>
              <p>is someone whose calling is to pray for others, less saved when
              compared to someone who led thousands to Christ in africa?</p>
              <p>is someone who is struggling with smoking less saved than
              someone who has never been tempted in that area?</p>
              <p>is the prostitute, saved the moment she believes in the love and
              salvation of Christ, or is she saved only after she wiped Jesus'
              feet with her tears and hair?</p>

              <p>Can a person be saved even when he has no chance to prove his faith by good works? If you listen hard during Mass, the answer is there but that will lead to a separate subject which I do not wish to go into at the moment. But the answer is yes and there is a passage when Paul talks about people trurning up with works etc....I can't remember exact quote.</p>

              <p>my equation is. salvation is by faith ALONE. that faith will
              produce good work in God's timing, since good works has nothing to

              <p>it only says that some CLAIM to have faith.</p>
              <p>i'm pretty sure you either have faith, or you don't. even if you
              don't have faith, you can claim that you do, but God knows your

              <p>Ok, so works is to prove one's faith in Christ and only faith in Christ saves.</p>
              <p>I think it is not an issue that we see good works or not because good works is not for others to see.</p>
              <p>I agree that good works must come from the heart and that if one has this commandment engraved in his heart, it becomes part of his life and what I have been saying earlier....</p>
              <p>So, good works done in co-operation with the Holy Spirit can be counted for merits and is an indicator that one has true faith in Christ. And only such faith can save as per James.</p>
              <p>Hope I am getting it right so far....</p>

              <p>Yes, nothing, cos the challenge to humankind is not faith, but our own evil inclination within every one of us.  Hey, our ancestors, Adam &amp; Eve, have eaten the fruit of knowledge of good and bad. Thus Hashem has given humankind his Laws i.e a moral code to live by, this is what made us human unlike animals.</p>

              <p>Ok, so works is to prove one's faith in Christ and only faith in Christ saves.</p>
              <p>I think it is not an issue that we see good works or not because good works is not for others to see.</p>
              <p>I agree that good works must come from the heart and that if one has this commandment engraved in his heart, it becomes part of his life and what I have been saying earlier....</p>
              <p>So, good works done in co-operation with the Holy Spirit can be counted for merits and is an indicator that one has true faith in Christ. And only such faith can save as per James.</p>
              <p>Hope I am getting it right so far....</p>
              <p>then, what happened to those who claimed they have faith and yet have some good works that are done but not from the heart.....not as a result of co-operation with the Holy Spirit?

              <p>Faith in Christ means by the finished and completed works of Christ I am saved.</p>
              <p>Faith in Man means by my own works, I am saved (ie. I don't need Jesus Christ).</p>

              <p>i can only give a hypothetical answer..... and continues to maintain the stand that perhaps we are splitting too many hairs....</p>
              <p>on your question.... the issue of what this "fruit" is, can be a contentious issue.....</p>
              <p>taking into the assumption that the "fruit" of the spirit (Gal 5:22,23) is "love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness and temperance"...  is it really conceivable that anyone, in any given amount of time, do not display any of these at all.... or do we mean that all the nine attributes need to be present at the same time? or does God accept "work-in-progress" Christians....</p>
              <p>what if, again hypothetically speaking, one of us in sgforums got so worked up and start to flame each other over our theological stand, therefore, perhaps, losing, the longsuffering and temperance aspect of this "fruit"..?</p>
              <p>to some, this fruit means bringing in new believers.... so what happens to Christians who had never, directly, bring others to Christ?</p>
              <p><strong>theoritically, it is all so simple - bear fruit and you are fine and dandy.... but practically speaking.... how does that all work out?</strong></p>
              <p>can you, omnia, for example, claim to have the fruit of the spirit? seriously, the only person i can think of having such attributes to almost a perfect level was mother teresa.</p>
              <p>also, is it conceivable that anyone goes through his entire sad life not doing at any one time, any of the attribute?</p>
              <p>.... if our conclusion now is...as vince said ....only God can judge.... that what the heck are we talking about???</p>

              <p>How all this works out is that after we become Christians, we have to <em>continually</em> strive to keep our faith, to do good works and to avoid sin (to repent when we do fall into sin), all through the grace of God, if we want to enter heaven one day. Justification and salvation is a <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">process</span></em></strong> that carries on until we stand before God at judgement. <br> <br>When we talk about bearing fruit, doing good works, avoiding sin; it is <em>not a one time thing</em>, eg: do one good work and you're set for heaven. There is no good works 'passing mark' because we need to keep at it till we leave this world. Does this mean that we have no <em>absolute</em> assurance of salvation ? Yup. We can all have confident <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">hope</span></em> (if we do as mentioned in the above para) but <em>not</em> certitude of salvation. We need to heed the words of St Paul to "work out your own salvation with fear and trembling" (Phil 2:12).</p>
