              <p>Aiyah....you still trying to go back to "how to measure and
                  quantify" thing.......The issue is your claimed that there is no
                  works involved.....I am saying to say that is being
                  JUDGEMENTAL.....<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>his last action is about not
                  being silence and passive in the face of need, injustice and

                  deny Christ.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>As in your church doctrine:<br> "The Methodist Church must view the perplexing times and problems
                  we face today in the light of the life and teaching of Jesus. 
                  Jesus teaches us to love our neighbours and to seek justice for
                  all.  <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Silence and passivity in the
                  face of need, injustice and exploitation is to deny
                  Christ.</strong></span><strong><span style="color: #000000;">"</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>It is not about good deal or bad deal lah!......But really, you
                  think he only has 1 work to show (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">at least now better than none at the
                  begining</span>)? But do you just want to continue to be
                  judgemental? It's up to you.....You are arguging for the sake of
                  arguing because this clearly should not be used to support faith
                  alone.</p>
              <p>And yes, still the same reward even if he comes on the last day
                  because God is generous and He is just. Do we need to be jealous
                  about that or feel cheated (because we come earlier) because our

              <p>you know, for someone who's going on about being quite sure i

              <p>you assume that there is no works to show... how can you be sure
              that there is no works to show. as you'd said, quantity is not the
              issue, so even someone as vile as the thief (who's sentence to
              death) you deem that he has good works to show. reality is, is it
              possible for one to live his entire life without good works to
              show... Christ had already said to those who don't even know they
              had done good deeds that He knows who had done such good
              deeds...</p>
              <p>in the first place, who are you to determine what's "proven" and
              what's "unproven"? all we have is the our different stand as to
              whether we think works is part of salvation or not.... as i'd said,
              we all do good works regardless of where we stand....</p>

              <p>To clarify, I quoted more of Paul and the other part of the Gospel than James and they all seems to agree.....and even your own church's doctrine says not doing good work is to deny Christ and you agreed that a person who deny Christ cannot claim to have faith in Christ.</p>

              <p>No where do I see anything that explains why faith (unproven yet with works) can saves.</p>
              <p>In fact, it echoes my feelings that if there is no love (shown by works), one can claim anything they want.....that they are saved whatever....it means nothing. As I mentioned earlier, to do good work is to love God - not hair splitting moments.</p>
              <p>Anyway, that's your contention which is fine with me. I am just wondering and still wondering why faith (unproven yet) can saves when we all agreed before that only true faith in Christ (that is proven by works) can saves....Perhaps, I'll never get any answer...</p>

              <p>So, who judge on the day faith is profess???</p>
              <p>And you saying faith without works (useless or dead in James's word) saves???</p>
              <p>I think both dumbdumb and vince69 agrees that true faith in Christ that bears fruits and works saves....and anyone who claimed their faith may not have true faith in Christ if there are no works to show. Faith without works is dead / useless ....and you think dead faith saves?</p>
              <p>Can you try to read the 2-3 situations that dumbdumd cited as examples??</p>
              <p>Actually, I am now asking how that works.....faith with works proved faith is true in Christ and yet a faith without works (i.e. unproven to be true in Christ yet) saves? Something I did not get answer to......ins't it?</p>
              <p>hmmmmm, so you don't insist that faith alone saves??</p>

              <p>The only contention for me now is :</p>
              <p>"For your side, professing of faith is enough to saves....and one
                                      is saved simply by doing that. <strong>I accept that as your
                                      view.....no problem.</strong></p>
              <p>What I am seeking to understand is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>how can faith that is
                                      unproven yet (i.e. with no works to show yet) saves when we (again
                                      maybe not you) agrees that only true faith in Christ
                                      saves?</strong></span> And we (again maybe not you) agrees that the
                                      way to tell them apart is from the fruits or works....</p>
              <p>Then, you agreed that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>only God can judge and how
                                      can one then claimed to be saved? Who made that judgement
                                      ?</strong></span></p>
              <p>Again, I am not making personal attack or the theory.......I am
                                      only trying to make sense and logic out of this....perhaps,
                                      something is missing that will piece them up.....and that is why I
                                      am asking."</p>

              <p>Wah....why so excited? I thought you agree that God judge us on our last day? Now, at professing also? If that's your asnwer, I accept (finally got answer) as you said, can be right or wrong or even I don't like.....but this is really the first time you answered.</p>
              <p>No need to prove faith to anyone but that's about being a Christian right? (To live our life to serve and love God) ....And we agreed (maybe except you again) that fruits / works is what tells them apart....and I also gave you a few other examples in earlier replies....and still wants to go round the bush?</p>
              <p>Who decides? I thought you agreed is God? And God will validate it on our last day....</p>
              <p>And yes, pathetic in trying to quote partial and out of context....and oxymoroic is when you quote something and it really means something else....like you always do.</p>
