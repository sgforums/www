              <p>How all this works out is that after we become Christians, we have to <em>continually</em> strive to keep our faith, to do good works and to avoid sin (to repent when we do fall into sin), all through the grace of God, if we want to enter heaven one day. Justification and salvation is a <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">process</span></em></strong> that carries on until we stand before God at judgement.<br> <br>When we talk about bearing fruit, doing good works, avoiding sin; it is <em>not a one time thing</em>, eg: do one good work and you're set for heaven. There is no good works 'passing mark' because we need to keep at it till we leave this world. Does this mean that we have no <em>absolute</em> assurance of salvation ? Yup. We can all have confident <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">hope</span></em> (if we do as mentioned in the above para) but <em>not</em> certitude of salvation. We need to heed the words of St Paul to "work out your own salvation with fear and trembling" (Phil 2:12).</p>

              <p><br>i really don't disagree with your points with the exception that for whatever "hope" you say... such a premise excludes the certainity of salvation - because it is a "process".... a process is deemed finished only if the owner of the process says so... that being God. So the new reality is our salvation seems less assured because of the "fine prints" that exists in the "contract"....</p>
              <p>we all can argue one way or another.... but to me it's just technicality because the need to know that "good works is part of salvation" is not factored in....</p>
              <p>and many of us do good works anyway.... and that there is no passing mark....</p>

              <p>Dumbdumb, I did not always refer to the Catholic encyclopedia hor....... don't drag me in.</p>
              <p>And I did not understand your statement of "pope inspired by the spirit, because some stuff are a little
                  off"....</p>
              <p>But I suggest that you get this off your mind - the Pope is not our Church and our Church is not about the Pope..... It's about God and the Pope is the leader of the Church. Just like some others with protestant churches with bishop etc.... It is not the same as mega churches where the pastor's word or interpretation is taken as truth.</p>
              <p>Ok....I just read your edited post after replying.....</p>
              <p>The sticker that cheese you off obviously is from Novena Church. The funcion of the Novena Church is perpetual Novena and the order of the priests there is to make Mother Mary known....Not because she is more important than Jesus but because she has helped and is still helping many people around the world. At Novena service, although it is a devotion to Mary, the focus is still on God. You just need to know what is said and done. Mary cannot do anything except pray with us and for us. Everything is granted by God.</p>
              <p>The job of making Jesus know is the responsility of all of us. We have only 1 Novena Church out of all the Churches we have......</p>
              <p>I can understand where you are coming from and why not promote Christ directly. They do and it's up to you to believe and understand what is being done.And understand what is Catholic Church and what the Creed says (which some other churches are using too).....</p>

              <p>Dumbdumb, I did not always refer to the Catholic encyclopedia
                  hor....... don't drag me in.</p>
              <p>And I did not understand your statement of "pope inspired by the
                  spirit, because some stuff are a little off"....</p>
              <p>But I suggest that you get this off your mind - the Pope is not
                  our Church and our Church is not about the Pope..... It's about God
                  and the Pope is the leader of the Church. Just like some others
                  with protestant churches with bishop etc.... It is not the same as
                  mega churches where the pastor's word or interpretation is taken as
                  truth.</p>

              <p>Like I said before, when you embrace a faith, embrace wholeheartedly.....The Pope is the leader of the Church and he is aided by many ministries in the Vatican. That's a different subject but what have you heard so far about the Pope that need rebuttal?</p>
              <p>And if there are things that I do not agree, I am free to leave the Church......no one is stopping me.....or you for that matter. And we all can refused to attend Mass....</p>
              <p>Or I can stay and "fight" to make changes....like St Francis of Assis did.</p>
              <p>I don't want to go and discuss history but like I said, the Pope do make mistakes in the past and no one can assure you that present and future Pope will not. You probaly know more about those stories than me......but do we want to live in the past?</p>
              <p>Just because we have lousy Popes before means we give up? Popes are just that... Popes. The Church is based on Christ and not the Pope.....and I will not let a Pope destroy my relationship with Christ.</p>
              <p>Just because there are lousy Christians does not make me want to leave my faith.....</p>
              <p>Bishop are ranked higher than priest isn't it? And did you not know that they have someone similar like a Pope called "Archbishop of Canterbury" I think....?</p>
              <p>Methodist also have pastor and bishops etc...</p>

              <p>Why would hope excludes certainty? Paul said in Roman 8</p>
              <p>24 In hope, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>we already have salvation; in hope, not visibly present</strong></span>, or we should not be hoping -- nobody goes on hoping for something which is already visible. 25 But <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>having this hope for what we cannot yet see, we are able to wait for it with persevering confidence.</strong></span><br><br>Why would one who have faith in God yet doubt His words?</p>
              <p>Using Abraham as an example in Roman 4, Paul said:<br><br>20 Counting on the promise of God, he did not doubt or disbelieve, but<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> drew strength from faith </strong></span>and gave glory to God, 21 <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>fully convinced that whatever God promised he has the power to perform.</strong></span> 22 This is the faith that was reckoned to him as uprightness.<br><br>Omnia said it is a process because we hope for salvation in faith and with full confidence of God that He will do what He promised. And the process officially starts from professing one's faith till the day we meet our Lord to face judgement.</p>
              <p>What do you think He will be asking us ?</p>
              <p>Eat already? Perhaps, but I found the answer in the last judgement in Gospel of Matthew.</p>
              <p>And I think most if not all of us with agree that we need to do good works. It is a commandment of Jesus and also that of proving that we have true faith in Christ.</p>
              <p>And good works in this case comes from the heart.....a heart that is changed by Christ and working with the Holy Spirits that it becomes part of our life as Christians. A heart that when doing good works is filled with joy and not grumbling, complaining .......not posting some hair splitting experience on the net etc...and trying to keep track on spread sheet etc......not sometime do so ok liao type. It must be engraved in our heart and God can see that.</p>
              <p>So, when we face our judgement, we are able to show our true faith in Christ by our works / fruits and earn what God has promised.</p>
              <p>By the way, did Omnia said anything about contract and fine prints?</p>

              <p>There is no contract and no fine print so don't make it sound that we come to Christ because we are being cheated. ("but after a while realised that he need to keep
                  doing good works to ensure that the promised eternal life").</p>
              <p>Technicality is not about works but what we understand by believing in Christ and being His follower.</p>

              <p>Catholics hold that the holy spirit does indeed guide and prevent the pope (the successor of St. Peter) from teaching error when the pope teaches on <em>faith and morals</em> to the <em>whole Church</em> in his <em>official capacity</em> (ie: teaching 'from the chair of Peter'; not private doctrinal musings or speculations, or his views about the stock market etc). But beyond this special gift of teaching authority bestowed by God on his Church through the pope and the bishops in communion with him, the pope is subject to sin and human failings (some might have been naive politicians, cowardly etc), not unlike St. Peter and the apostles.</p>
              <p>And if you think about it, you really <em>do</em> need an ultimate authority on this planet to teach and guide us to the truth in faith and morals. And that ultimate authority <em>cannot</em> be the bible <em>alone</em> because the bible is not written like a instruction manual. It needs interpretation and it doesn't cover everything. Without this ultimate living teaching authority (of the pope and bishops in communion with him), we are going to have lots of variations and contradictory versions of truth because everybody interprets the bible for himself (supposedly with the guidance of the holy spirit) and sees himself as the final authority. This is evident in the world of protestant christianity arising from the reformation.</p>
              <p>To avoid going too much out of topic, I'll just make one point regarding the crusades - that it is necessary to understand the politics and culture of that time before passing judgement. This article provides its own perspective on the crusades: <a href="http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2006/0603tbt.asp">http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2006/0603tbt.asp</a></p>
              <p>At the time of the reformation, there were indeed abuses and corruption in the Church but what the reformers apparently failed to understand was that those were of men, not of doctrine. ... hmmm, come to think of it (and this is just musings on my part), maybe some of them did understand the difference but their earthly political agendas won out :)</p>

              <p>In case anyone gets the wrong idea, a person who is 'excommunicated' by the Catholic Church is <em>not</em> 'eternally cursed'. He is 'excluded from the communion', meaning that his status before the Church is that of a stranger and he may not participate in public worship nor receive the Body of Christ or any sacraments.</p>
              <p>This is the most serious penalty that the Church can impose, and thus used only for <em>very grave offences</em>, with the objective that the person would repent and return to be in communion once again.</p>
              <p>We read about excommunication in Matthew 18:17, "And if he will not hear the church, let him be to thee as the heathen and publican".</p>

              <p>Hi, my limited understanding</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">God's standard of holiness</span> - perfection 24/7</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Law</span> - 10 commandments: to be obeyed 24/7 in order to be perfect, which reflects God's standard of perfection</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sin</span> - the state of imperfection that all human beings are at, through breaking of the Law, which seperates us from God</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The consequence of sin</span> - spiritual death and eternal seperation from God. There must be death to pay for the consequence of sin.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What did God provide for the israelites for the provision of sin</span> - God introduced the sin offering, and every year, the children of israel will gather, and the priest will lay his hand on the sin offering - a lamb/goat/sheep?, which is to be perfect and unblemished to symbolize the transference of their sins onto the sin offering, and the goodness and perfectness of the lamb will be transfered onto the children of israel. that will cover their sins for 1 year. The priest will then kill the lamb, and enter the Temple, and Holy of holies to worship i think. if the priest did not follow procedure to the letter, or is unclean in thought, he will be struck down by God, and israel will not be covered for a year. That is the old covenent - do good, get good, do bad, get beat.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What did God provide for the world for the provision of sin</span> - the old testaments, the laws, the provisions, the passover all foretold the coming of Christ and what God will do for the world through Jesus. Jesus is the high priest (who will always be perfect, unlike the human priest of old, who can be struck down), who stands on behalf of us who believe, to God, the righteous holy judge and intercedes for us. He is also the lamb, who takes all our sins, and transfer his holiness to us. His blood is spilled for our sins - paying the price of our sins and meeting God's standard of holiness whereby sin must be paid for by death.</p>
              <p>God is holy, He has to uphold the law which condemns sinners. The Law demands death of a sinner. But God is also love, and does not want to see us die and be eternally seperated from Him. So Jesus' death was the only way God's holiness and grace can meet without compromise. God's holiness is met because there is death to pay for the consequence of sin, and God's grace is met, because we are spared in the process as Jesus, though innocent, died a sinner's death. This is the new covenent - A righteousness apart from the law is found in Jesus, who came to take away the sins of the world</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is needed to receive this provision from God</span> - One have to believe and confess his belief and receive this gift of grace, through faith.</p>

Such a person has to repent and turn back to God (<em style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span></em> thereafter live a life of faith, good works and avoidance of sin) if he is to have hope of salvation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">tell smarty boy that. and.. i wish someone would tell my gf that.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">Mary too leads folks to Christ. Know her and you will very quickly come to know her son, Jesus Christ.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">That's a really bad excuse u know..</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">Catholics hold that the holy spirit does indeed guide and prevent the pope (the successor of St. Peter) from teaching error when the pope teaches on <em style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">faith and morals</em> to the <em style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">whole Church</em> in his <em style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">official capacity</em> (ie: teaching 'from the chair of Peter'; not private doctrinal musings or speculations, or his views about the stock market etc). But beyond this special gift of teaching authority bestowed by God on his Church through the pope and the bishops in communion with him, the pope is subject to sin and human failings (some might have been naive politicians, cowardly etc), not unlike St. Peter and the apostles</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unfortunately, all catholics hold what the pope says as unfallable. You do not question what the pope says, accepting in faith that what he says is what God wants him to say.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I wish that catholics will dare to question, when times of dubious teachings rises. Question is, would u dare to rise and question if this happened? and what can you do to question effectively?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">And if you think about it, you really <em style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">do</em> need an ultimate authority on this planet to teach and guide us to the truth in faith and morals. And that ultimate authority <em style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">cannot</em> be the bible <em style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">alone</em> because the bible is not written like a instruction manual. It needs interpretation and it doesn't cover everything. Without this ultimate living teaching authority (of the pope and bishops in communion with him), we are going to have lots of variations and contradictory versions of truth because everybody interprets the bible for himself (supposedly with the guidance of the holy spirit) and sees himself as the final authority. This is evident in the world of protestant christianity arising from the reformation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Word of God isn't enough as an ultimate authority? The reformation occurred because there were thinking people who compared the corrupted teachings of the catholic church with the words of the bible. It was the "ultimate living authority of the pope" which failed and corruption ran rampant, not the unchanging authority of the bible.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">To avoid going too much out of topic, I'll just make one point regarding the crusades - that it is necessary to understand the politics and culture of that time before passing judgement. This article provides its own perspective on the crusades:<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #5d5ebc;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2006/0603tbt.asp">http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2006/0603tbt.asp</a></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">At the time of the reformation, there were indeed abuses and corruption in the Church but what the reformers apparently failed to understand was that those were of men, not of doctrine. ... hmmm, come to think of it (and this is just musings on my part), maybe some of them did understand the difference but their earthly political agendas won out</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Again, what I meant by allowing the pope to be the final authority instead of the unchanging truth of the bible. When you believe that someone's words is infallable, you will not think to question it, unless you yourself know what Jesus said. If more people knew that Jesus taught to offer the other cheek, and realised that the pope at that time taught something which contradicted this unchanging truth, would there be a crusade then? That's why the pope cannot be the final authority. He can teach, and preach and share. but ultimately, everyone must compare whatever that is being taught by man, to what the bible teaches and see if it's contradicting. That's what martin luthur did. and was so nearly killed by the catholic church for it. That's the corruption which happened once, and can happen again, if there is no check on authority and power.</span></span></p>
