              <p>Yes, I can read the article and I agree with you that the teaching of the Pope is very insightful and beneficial.</p>
              <p>But you conclusion seems to be different from his.</p>
              <p>The Pope explained that St Paul tells us  not our deeds, but rather faith renders us "just" because "man is unable to "justify" himself with his own actions, but can only
              truly become "just" before God because God confers his "justice" upon
              him, uniting him to Christ his Son".</p>
              <p>"faith, if it is true, if it is real, becomes love, becomes charity, is
              expressed in charity. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A faith without charity, without this fruit,
              would not be true faith. It would be a dead faith</span>"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Faith alone without fruits (works) is dead.  Faith with works is true faith because it is by my works that I proved my faith.</p>
              <p>"Justified through the gift of faith in Christ, we are called <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to live in
              the love of Christ for neighbour</span>, because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it is on this criterion</span> that
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we shall be judged at the end of our lives.</span>"</p>

              <p>the whole premise of works and faith lies with what practical value does work have, if it cannot be measured and quantified. We cannot always be doing good work all the time, and we cannot always be doing evil all time. I may have a bad day and decided NOT to stand up for the pregnant lady.... so how? die lah!</p>

              <p>the statement that you quoted, to me, is a broadbase definition on the need to do good works.</p>
              <p>since your so cleverly quoted from the Methodist teachings, how about going to the basic....</p>

              <p><strong>Article IX - Of the Justification of Man<br></strong>We are accounted righteous before God <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>only</strong></span> for the merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, by faith, and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>not for our own works or deservings</strong></span>. Wherefore, that we are justified by faith, only, is a most wholesome doctrine, and very full of comfort.</p>
              <p><strong>Article X - Of Good Works<br></strong>Although <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>good works, which are the fruits of faith</strong></span>, and follow after justification, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>cannot put away our sins</strong></span>, and endure the severity of God's judgment; yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ, and spring out of a true and lively faith, insomuch that by them a lively faith may be as evidently known as a tree is discerned by its fruit.</p>
              <p>... at the end of the day... and as i'd before, it does not matter whether what you believe is right, or i am right.... good works still get done....</p>

              <p>But you conclusion seems to be different from his.</p>
              <p>The Pope explained that St Paul tells us not our deeds, but rather faith renders us "just" because "man is unable to "justify" himself with his own actions, but can only truly become "just" before God because God confers his "justice" upon him, uniting him to Christ his Son".</p>
              <p>"faith, if it is true, if it is real, becomes love, becomes charity, is expressed in charity. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A faith without charity, without this fruit, would not be true faith. It would be a dead faith</span>"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Faith alone without fruits (works) is dead.  Faith with works is true faith because it is by my works that I proved my faith.</p>

              <p>i can only give a hypothetical answer..... and continues to maintain the stand that perhaps we are splitting too many hairs....</p>
              <p>on your question.... the issue of what this "fruit" is, can be a contentious issue.....</p>
              <p>taking into the assumption that the "fruit" of the spirit (Gal 5:22,23) is "love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness and temperance"...  is it really conceivable that anyone, in any given amount of time, do not display any of these at all.... or do we mean that all the nine attributes need to be present at the same time? or does God accept "work-in-progress" Christians....</p>
              <p>what if, again hypothetically speaking, one of us in sgforums got so worked up and start to flame each other over our theological stand, therefore, perhaps, losing, the longsuffering and temperance aspect of this "fruit"..?</p>
              <p>to some, this fruit means bringing in new believers.... so what happens to Christians who had never, directly, bring others to Christ?</p>
              <p>theoritically, it is all so simple - bear fruit and you are fine and dandy.... but practically speaking.... how does that all work out?</p>
              <p>can you, omnia, for example, claim to have the fruit of the spirit? seriously, the only person i can think of having such attributes to almost a perfect level was mother teresa.</p>
              <p>also, is it conceivable that anyone goes through his entire sad life not doing at any one time, any of the attribute?</p>
              <p>.... if our conclusion now is...as vince said ....only God can judge.... that what the heck are we talking about???</p>

              <p>Yes, basically, I agree with you but only on understanding of what is true faith (not lip service). The Pope do state clearly that "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">A faith without charity, without this
                                      fruit, would not be true faith. It would be a dead

              <p>As you rightly pointed out, we know if the faith is true by the fruits it bears. In this case, the Pope did state that this fruit is about charity (which is of course love for your neighbour).</p>
              <p>And again as you rightly pointed out, how does God know? He sees our heart, one that is changed and doing charity (good works) from the heart....not one that goes to the net and post I did this....that.....and that today until hair splitting...........</p>
              <p>Also, towards the end, he pointed out the citeria which Jesus has told us in the Last Judgement in MT which again is about love your neighbour and charity.</p>

              <p>the whole premise of works and faith lies with what practical
                      value does work have, if it cannot be measured and quantified. We
                      cannot always be doing good work all the time, and we cannot always
                      be doing evil all time. I may have a bad day and decided NOT to
                      stand up for the pregnant lady.... so how? die lah!</p>

              <p>the statement that you quoted, to me, is a broadbase definition

                      faith, only, is a most wholesome doctrine, and very full of
                      comfort.</p>
              <p><strong>Article X - Of Good Works<br></strong>Although
                      <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>good works, which are the

              <p>If only true faith saves, then salvation must be either faith + good works <strong>OR</strong> faith leading to good works and <strong>NOT</strong> faith alone. And no one is saved until the faith has works to show (that it is true).</p>

              <p>i can only give a hypothetical answer..... and continues to
                  maintain the stand that perhaps we are splitting too many
                  hairs....</p>
              <p>on your question.... the issue of what this "fruit" is, can be a
                  contentious issue.....</p>
              <p>taking into the assumption that the "fruit" of the spirit (Gal
                  5:22,23) is "love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness,
                  faith, meekness and temperance"...  is it really conceivable
                  that anyone, in any given amount of time, do not display any of
                  these at all.... or do we mean that all the nine attributes need to
                  be present at the same time? or does God accept "work-in-progress"
                  Christians....</p>
              <p>what if, again hypothetically speaking, one of us in sgforums
                  got so worked up and start to flame each other over our theological
                  stand, therefore, perhaps, losing, the longsuffering and temperance
                  aspect of this "fruit"..?</p>
              <p>to some, this fruit means bringing in new believers.... so what
                  happens to Christians who had never, directly, bring others to
                  Christ?</p>
              <p>theoritically, it is all so simple - bear fruit and you are fine
                  and dandy.... but practically speaking.... how does that all work
                  out?</p>
              <p>can you, omnia, for example, claim to have the fruit of the
                  spirit? seriously, the only person i can think of having such
                  attributes to almost a perfect level was mother teresa.</p>
              <p>also, is it conceivable that anyone goes through his entire sad
                  life not doing at any one time, any of the attribute?</p>
              <p>.... if our conclusion now is...as vince said ....only God can
                  judge.... that what the heck are we talking about???</p>

              <p>Jesus did mentioned what we are judged on in last judgement in MT so no need to be contentious right? Ok, if you want to, it's ok.</p>
              <p>According to Paul, he said every commandment can be substitued with Love and that he is preaching about faith, hope and love and nothing is greater than love.</p>
              <p>No one need to claim he has fruit of the spirit or anything. Every one should just do his best to live out their Christian life.....that is to love your neighbour (doing good works).</p>
              <p>As we all agreed, God is the final judge and He will look at our hearts and He knows what is in there....</p>
              <p>We cannot be perfect but we should not use that as an excuse and stop trying....and praying to God to help us overcome our short-coming.</p>
