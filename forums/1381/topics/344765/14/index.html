              <p>simply illustrated. </p>
              <p>if a person goes to church, hears the message of the good news,
              realises how corrupted and sinful he is, he realises he is
              helpless, he ask God for mercy for he is a helpless sinner, he is
              justified.</p>
              <p>a person marries a christian, and for the partner's sake,
              becomes a christian. he doesn't feel he has any faults at all, he
              just simply become a christian to suit his partner. thus he doesn't
              feel the need to know God more, and doesn't receive God's love, and
              without God's love, he can't love God, and without love, he
              produces no fruits or good works.</p>
              <p>see? both professes, but at the moment of professing, true
              faith, or false faith is already established (kinda)</p>
              <p>it doesn't mean though, the person who professes falsely, is out
              of God's will though. who knows, maybe one day he will be touched
              by God, and that leads him to know God more, and it becomes true
              faith, and that gives him God's love, and with that love, he
              produces good works and fruits automatically.</p>

              <p>you guys are really serious on this....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>serious, have to read James in context please...</p>
              <p>1) God do not need to use our works to validate our faith.... he knows if its true or not from day 1 from the inside of our heart. so this concept of God using our works to jusdge our faith is incorrect. He don't need us to show Him, He already knows. He who numbered the hair on our head, knows about us, more than we know about ourselves.</p>
              <p>2) So what is this faith without works is dead all about? read the preceeding verses from James... What James started off is with this, If a brother is hungry or in cold, and he comes to you who have extras; much more than enough. And you reply him, God will provide for you and walk away without lifting a finger to help him. What good is your faith (that God will provide his needs) to him (the brother who is in need) not God. Your faith is therefore as good as being dead, as far as this brother is concern.</p>
              <p>3) what about true faith that will bear fruits? correct, if a person truely believe that God will provide, and truely believe, he will also show in his life, what he believe in. BUT, this is not about showing God our works, but showing the people around what we believed in, and in doing so, be a testamony to the world about who God is. We can tell people about God all we wants, but at the end, its our life that will show them who God is.</p>
              <p>I like the way Pope Benedict closes his lecure on 26Nov2008,</p>
              <p>"Therefore let us allow ourselves to be touched by reconciliation, which God has given us in Christ, by God's "foolish" love for us; nothing and no one can ever separate us from his love (cf. Rm 8: 39). We live in this certainty. It is this certainty that gives us the strength to live concretely the faith that works in love. "</p>
              <p>Do you have this certainity, that nothing and no one, not even the lack of good works or anything, can separate you from God's love? It is when we are certain, that we are forever loved, an nothing can separate us from God, that we can find the willingness and strength to live concretely the faith that works in love.</p>

              <p>Exactly, both professes faith and you can already see that the
                  second one is not saved ......thus professing faith does not
                  saved.</p>
              <p>Yet, he could be saved if there is a change of heart and that he
                  is truely touched by God and if he listen to His Words and act on
                  it later....</p>
              <p>For the first guy, we still cannot says that his faith is
                  true....his feelings may change down the line......and then he
                  become unsaved?</p>
              <p>But if he truely desires God, he will learn about Him, hear His
                  Words and act on it, then his faith will be proven to be not a spur
                  of moment kind of feeling but real and true faith in God. Then, we
                  can says that he will be saved....</p>
              <p>So to determine if one is saved or not at time of professing

              <p>God loves all His creation and that was never doubted and the Pope is right is saying that " It is this

              <p>If one claimed to have faith and yet has no work to show, then do you think that the person really have faith in the first place?? And in the last judgement, Jesus told us how He will judge us as the Pope explained in the original article you quoted earlier in this thread.</p>

              <p>a person marries a christian, and for the partner's sake, becomes a christian. he doesn't feel he has any faults at all, he just simply become a christian to suit his partner. thus he doesn't feel the need to know God more, and doesn't receive God's love, and without God's love, he can't love God, and without love, he produces no fruits or good works.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>however i do not agree with the last part.....</p>
              <p>... without God's love, he can't love God, and without love, he produces no fruits or good works.... can be equated to: people with God's love does not produce fruits or good works.....</p>
              <p>... i think you once said, that God can inspire non-believers to do good works... but if these people do not love God, they should not be able to produce good works.....</p>
              <p>... note that i am not disagreeing with the individual opinions.... but these two opinions are, imo, in conflict. interestingly, i am more incline to go with yours, because i believe everybody (including non-Christian) do good work, and if one need to put a reason to it, then one can say, that God inspires these people to do good work.</p>

              <p>God loves all His creation and that was never doubted and the Pope is right is saying that " It is this certainty that gives us the strength to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>live concretely the faith that works in love.</strong></span> " For God love us first and we are told to live and love each other......</p>
              <p>How else to be a witness of Christ or a testimony without works? I agree that "its our life that will show them who God is."</p>
              <p>If one claimed to have faith and yet has no work to show, then do you think that the person really have faith in the first place?? And in the last judgement, Jesus told us how He will judge us as the Pope explained in the original article you quoted earlier in this thread.</p>

              <p>Generally speaking, yes, if one's faith is true, it will santify him in a way that he will have good works in his life. Now, on the other hand, having works or lack of it is not a good guage.</p>

              <p>Let me explain... what I did not see, does not means its not there, it just means I did not see it....  I don't see good works in your life (heck, I have not even met you), does not means you have not done any good works, it simply means, I have not seen them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The good news is, how I view your faith, does not matter and should not matter to you at all, for you are not ask to please all men, you only need to please God. So, as long as God sees your faith as true, thats all that really matter. But does God need you to show him your work to convince Him? especially when He sees your heart.</p>

                                                      deep, if i want to learn, i can read up, or i can
                                                      google (which is cheaper). suggesting that we should google
                                                      first is nothing to be ashamed about.... otherwise how i know that
                                                      the catholic church also tithe, or that there are disgraced priests

I never quote any link that is anti-protestant or even from a catholic source...... and don't need to make partial quote to and reply out of context.</p>
              <p>You seems to be the only one who says you never insist and yet always the one who wants to "win" and the one who wants to show he is "right".... yet you keep saying others is guilty of doing it.........???</p>

              <p>Nobody says cannot google or that it is a shame to do so.....</p>
              <p>Nobody says that God never judge people of other faith on judgement day (in fact, He judge the all human beings) ..... etc...</p>
              <p>Since when did we say we care if you are right or wrong?</p>
              <p>And you don't have to tell us that you are not here to learn, discuss etc.....which you can google, go to bible school/class etc... We know you are here to argue and create bad feelings etc.....Your actions translate that clearly.....enough.</p>
              <p>Finally, salvation is by faith and works since not doing works is to deny Christ and to deny Christ cannot claim to have faith in Him and it is a process (maybe 5 steps - I think but I don't subscribe to having steps 1,2,3....) .....hee....hee....hee......<img src="/C:/Users/Rance/AppData/Local/Temp/moz-screenshot-1.jpg" alt=""><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"><img src="/C:/Users/Rance/AppData/Local/Temp/moz-screenshot.jpg" alt=""></p>

              <p>Actually, I re-read your earlier post and I do agree when you said that God already knows when we profess our faith if we have true faith or not.....</p>
              <p>and rightly so as we already agreed that true faith will lead to good works....</p>
              <p>We also agreed that it is such faith - true faith that will be proven by the works.....and will save.</p>
              <p>The only difference is, our views of the role of works....along the line, I think I have cleared up that works is not to add on to Christ finished work or replace the grace of God. Works really is just proof of our true faith in Christ....that we have lived our lifes as true faithful Christians according to God's Words (though we will fall short of His standard). Your belief is that one is "saved" at point of professing while we believe that it is a process (some protestant churches believed it is a process too) ending when we face the Lord in the last judgement.</p>
              <p>God can see our heart and if we have true faith, that is good enough. But as we also agreed, true faith will bear fruits.....Of course, I can see your point that when one profess their faith (and God see that He has true faith in his heart) is enough to save him....and that makes works not a necessary part (in order not to be misquoted later by some trouble maker, this is my understanding from what you write only).</p>
              <p>In fact, that could even mean that professing of faith is not a part because God can see our heart and we don't even need to say it - He knows......already.</p>
              <p>But as in dumbdumb's example, a person may profess his faith but really has no interest....so his faith is essentially "untrue" which will not save him......</p>
              <p>So what set me wondering - is his guy "saved" when he professed his faith since it was supposed to be so......yet he has really no interest. And if he continues to have no true faith in God, will he be "unsaved" ?</p>
              <p>and all I want was an opinion on how that is explained - I believed there will be explanations......</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, I may / may not be able to agree / accept the explanations but I know where it is coming from.....and hoping have a better understanding and piece up this salvation theory for my understanding.</p>
              <p>As I said way before, there are many versions and we chose and accept which ever is most convincing to us.....and be 100% committed to it. And it is always good to understand alternative views...</p>
              <p>Sad that some oxymoronic and unncessary arguments has happened due to some insecure people who is suspicious of others as a result of their own intentions.....</p>

              <p>sure.... it's okay, it's just an example....</p>
              <p>however i do not agree with the last part.....</p>
              <p>... without God's love, he can't love God, and without love, he
                  produces no fruits or good works.... can be equated to: people with
                  God's love does not produce fruits or good works.....</p>
              <p>... i think you once said, that God can inspire non-believers to
                  do good works... but if these people do not love God,
                  they should not be able to produce good works.....</p>
              <p>... note that i am not disagreeing with the individual
                  opinions.... but these two opinions are, imo, in conflict.
                  interestingly, i am more incline to go with yours, because i
                  believe everybody (including non-Christian) do good work, and if
                  one need to put a reason to it, then one can say, that God inspires
                  these people to do good work.</p>

              <p>Jesus said in the last the last judgement that do it to the least of one of my brothers and sisiters and you have done it on me....something like that (lazy to chekc and quote exact verse).</p>
              <p>So, if you agree that " everybody (including non-Christian) do good work, and if
                  one need to put a reason to it, then one can say, that God inspires
                  these people to do good work." then can we say that these people do love God (including non-Christian) and show it by their works even though they may not know God directly yet for some reasons.....</p>
              <p>and in the case dumbdumb described,  you said: "people with
                  God's love does not produce fruits or good works....." What are you really trying to say? dumbdumb is trying to say that such a person show no true faith when professing faith and thus cannot be "saved"..... your take?</p>

              <p>Finally, salvation is by faith and works since not doing works is to deny Christ and to deny Christ cannot claim to have faith in Him and it is a process (maybe 5 steps - I think but I don't subscribe to having steps 1,2,3....) .....hee....hee....hee......<img src="/C:/Users/Rance/AppData/Local/Temp/moz-screenshot-1.jpg" alt=""><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"><img src="/C:/Users/Rance/AppData/Local/Temp/moz-screenshot.jpg" alt=""></p>

              <p>actually it is not so much i agree or not... but if one goes on one particular trend of thought, the conclusion is such....</p>
              <p>the first hypothesis is: man can do good work, and if man can only do good work because God inspires them.... therefore God did inspire them. Loving God was not part of this equation, because these people may not know God.... and these are people who are prompted by God to help others, to do charity.</p>
              <p>the next hypothesis: if man can only do good work because the need to love God to do good work, then because they do not love God, all the works they do are not good works...</p>
              <p>actually, i would not attempt to paraphase dumb2's post.... i take them at face value.... of dumb2 can explain them further, if he has the time.</p>
              <p>i tend to go with the first hypothesis because there are non-believers who are capable of going to great length to do charity, yet they may either not know God or reject God, so if i have to put a reason to why they do good works, i'd say that's through the inspiration of God - however there is no way i can prove that either.</p>
