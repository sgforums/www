              <p>It did not become something else...it is still by faith. To me, faith that is proven by works to be true.</p>
              <p>Yes, you said I love someone and yet your actions is otherwsie, so do you really love the person in the first place? Do you know someone loves you by what they says or what they do (such as care and concern etc...) So, when one says he believes at the alter, what kind of faith is that?</p>
              <p>To me unproven but it's a start of a process....and if one really believes in Christ, he will learn and do what Christ commanded. And prove his love for Christ and his faith. How? To me, by doing good works. Like what you said, true faith leading to good works right?</p>
              <p>Yes, many bible verses especially those of Paul's letter state that salvation is by faith and we never dispute that. And the artcile vince69 quoted also support that. But we take other parts of the bible into consideration esepecially that of the Gospel when Jesus told us in the last judgement how He will judge the people.....which is why we believe that faith to be true has to be proven by works.</p>
              <p>It is works that prove true faith and it is true faith that saves. Like Jesus said <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>not all </strong></span>who call me Lord Lord will enter into Kingdom of Heaven.....</p>

              <p>no.. you look at faith the way the pope says it is.</p>
              <p>i read the bible and decide for myself logically with what is written. that's the difference in my conviction and yours.</p>
              <p>and understanding abit of the jewish customs, and how God arranges the priest to perform the sin offering etc. it all fits.</p>
              <p>yours don't.</p>
              <p>but hey, can't blame, when you all believe that only the church leader is the only person who is trusted to be able to interpret the bible correctly. </p>

              <p>what is God's standard of holiness?</p>
              <p>what is the law?</p>
              <p>what is sin?</p>
              <p>what is the consequence of sin?</p>
              <p>what is did God provide for the israelites for the consequences of sin?</p>
              <p>what did God provide for the world for the consequences of sin?</p>
