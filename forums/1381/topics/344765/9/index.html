              <p>going back to good works... smarty boy does not want me to dwell

              is no longer important as long as good works is being done...</p>

              <p>Your believe and intentions to tear down and disprove of others does not make it the overall intentions of everyone............some yes but NOT ALL. Then, we no longer need to prove to you that you have time and again try to paint a negative picture of the Catholic Church as your intention is clear (as you said yourself).</p>
              <p>I am really sincerely trying to understand how we can be saved by faith that is yet to be proven as true faith in Christ.</p>
              <p>When you die and the circumstances is of no interest to me. When you die, you face the Lord and He will be the one who judge you. If you want to go on saying that you are saved based on your works and on a per good works basis or per day basis, then go on and try your best to mis-lead others......I told you clearly (in case we did not in the past) that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we are not saying that we work to be saved but rather works is a proof of our true faith in Christ</span>. A proof that we are His true disciple that listen and act on His words. That doing good works is part of Christian life with Jesus commandment engraved in our hearts and perhaps, social responsibility as some protestant church doctrines says......and not doing so is to deny Christ! Which is why it is "by my works that I proved my faith".</p>
              <p>As I said before, what do you think He will be asking you?</p>
              <p>Eat already? How's business? Maybe and perhaps.....but He will surely asked you what He told us in the last judgement.</p>
              <p>It doesn't matter how many good works you did yesterday and today or none. But  overall in your life, have you done good works? How have you run your race? And more importantly for Christian, have we made doing good works part of our Christian life? Was the commandment of Jesus engraved in your heart that you are truely converted to be His true disciple?</p>
              <p>Or are you stuck in the mentality that I am saved liao and got do good works (is because the Holy Spirit is working) and did not do (Holy Spirit nor working yet) and as long as got do some can liao?? Anyway, as long as got do before already can go heaven liao since already saved mah....?? Or in yoyr own words, are you a casual Christian or a truely converted and committed Christian?</p>
              <p>And by the way, if one is already saved, then last judgment seems redundant right? Will Jesus be telling us redundant stuff?</p>

              <p>last judgement? introduce a new aspect into this thread.... ok...... seems you can...</p>
              <p>well seems that the last judgement is for all (believers and NON-believers alike) so how can it be redundant???</p>
              <p>catholic reference: <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08552a.htm">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08552a.htm</a></p>
              <p>you "paraphrasing" the quantity of good works thing.... damn confusing...</p>
              <p>so allow me to understand you.. and if i have erred here please forgive me.</p>
              <p>1. do we need to quantify our good works - <em>i believe you have said no</em>.</p>
              <p>2. do we need to do our good works without any ulterior motive - <em>i believe you said yes.</em></p>
              <p>3. is it possible for everyone to do good works ALL THE TIME - <em>don't think we discussed this, my opinion is, no. Somedays are bad days, and some times we are unaware.</em></p>
              <p>4. is salvation connected to doing to good works ALL THE TIME - <em>probably not.</em></p>
              <p>5. do we need to accept the clause that KNOWING THAT DOING GOOD WORKS is part of salvation - <em>this one you can share with me. My personal opinion is no, this knowledge is not necessary to salvation</em>.</p>
              <p>Conclusion:</p>
              <p>1. if the quantity and frequency is unimportant, it's the attitude of doing good works that is paramount....</p>
              <p>2. it is unlike that anyone goes through life without doing any good works at all....</p>
              <p>3. the individual does not need to KNOW that he has to do good works in order to achieve salvation....</p>
              <p>4. that each individual professing to be a Christian (protestant or catholic) does good work some time or other will receive salvation...</p>
              <p>5. than i think we are all save regardless whichever theology we accept... <em>or are you going to say that we all need to belong to the catholic church to be saved?</em></p>
              <p>so then, what are we arguing about? if not for our egos....</p>

              <p>well, you specifically said POLICE. I corrected you to say that
                      a POLICE report may not be necessary...</p>
              <p>sure it does not mean that i can go on without one, but if i get
                      killed on the road, the need for the IC is no longer necessary and
                      my status remain to be a singaporean.</p>
              <p>yes we learn something today.... you don't comprehend well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the identity card does not MAKE ME a singaporean.... it merely
                      defines to the others that need to know that i am a
                      singaporean...</p>
              <p>without the identity card does not mean that i am no longer a
                      singaporean... it merely causes a great difficulty in trying to
                      explain why i am a singaporean...</p>
              <p>do you believe that our garmen, who according to some, is
                      despotic, will revoke my citizenship if i lost my IC and refuse to
                      make a new one??? obviously not, but the garmen may fine the shit
                      out of me or throw me in jail, but it will not revoke my
                      citizenship....</p>
              <p>i may be a bad singaporean, but a singaporean nonetheless.</p>

              <p>Ha...ha..ha... an IC don't make you a Singaporean? How about those foreign talent that comes here and got citizenship? Isn't that pick IC that make them Singaporeans? Are they also having same rights and benefits as you?</p>
              <p>Ah, getting punsih for not having IC? I am not sure what the punsihment are and it dosen't matter to me..... If it is of no issue, why punish in the first place??</p>
              <p>Maybe it is true that comprehension is a problem.....</p>
              <p>If you read the link, it says you must either have a police report or need to fill a form. Yes, police report not necessary if you fill the form. If not, a police report will do too.</p>

              <p>you "paraphrasing" the quantity of good works thing.... damn
                      confusing...</p>
              <p>so allow me to understand you.. and if i have erred here please
                      forgive me.</p>
              <p>1. do we need to quantify our good works - <em>i believe you
                      have said no</em>.</p>
              <p>2. do we need to do our good works without any ulterior motive -
                      <em>i believe you said yes.</em></p>
              <p>3. is it possible for everyone to do good works ALL THE TIME -
                      <em>don't think we discussed this, my opinion is, no. Somedays are
                      bad days, and some times we are unaware.</em></p>
              <p>4. is salvation connected to doing to good works ALL THE TIME -
                      <em>probably not.</em></p>
              <p>5. do we need to accept the clause that KNOWING THAT DOING GOOD
                      WORKS is part of salvation - <em>this one you can share with me. My
                      personal opinion is no, this knowledge is not necessary to
                      salvation</em>.</p>
              <p>Conclusion:</p>
              <p>1. if the quantity and frequency is unimportant, it's the
                      attitude of doing good works that is paramount....</p>
              <p>2. it is unlike that anyone goes through life without doing any
                      good works at all....</p>
              <p>3. the individual does not need to KNOW that he has to do good
                      works in order to achieve salvation....</p>
              <p>4. that each individual professing to be a Christian (protestant
                      or catholic) does good work some time or other will receive
                      salvation...</p>
              <p>5. than i think we are all save regardless whichever theology we
                      accept... <em>or are you going to say that we all need to belong to
                      the catholic church to be saved?</em></p>
              <p>so then, what are we arguing about? if not for our egos....</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>We are arguing (for you) and discussion (for me) that works is needed and part of salvation. You said it is not part  and I said yes.</p>
              <p>Your conclusion point (3) means individual don't need to know he need to do good works in order to achieve salvation (even if works is needed) ? Why should he not be told?</p>
              <p>Point (4) claimed that Christians (protestant or  Catholic) will do good work some time or other....... means you still do not recognised that we are talking about total conversion of the heart and that doing good work is part of Christian life and not doing so is denying Christ! It is that important according to your Church's doctrine. Don't downplay it.</p>
              <p>It is not about doing it sometimes..............</p>
              <p>Confusing because you do not want to comprehen and keep repeating on how to measure and quantify good works etc.....</p>
              <p>For me, I hope everyone will be saved and no one is left behind......because God is GREAT! But it does not means that knowing salvation is by faith and works is not important.</p>
              <p>It may be ego for you but not for me. I am really interested to know how faith (that has not works to proved it is true to Christ yet) can saves and one can claimed to be saved by such faith.</p>

              <p>i asked as a hypothetical question.</p>
              <p>1. Faith saved because one believe in Jesus Christ and his work on the cross. The basis of my belief is this passage.</p>
              <p>Eph 2: <span id="en-TNIV-29222" class="sup">1</span> As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, <span id="en-TNIV-29223" class="sup">2</span> in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient. <span id="en-TNIV-29224" class="sup">3</span> All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath. <span id="en-TNIV-29225" class="sup">4</span> But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, <span id="en-TNIV-29226" class="sup">5</span> made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved. <span id="en-TNIV-29227" class="sup">6</span> And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, <span id="en-TNIV-29228" class="sup">7</span> in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. <span id="en-TNIV-29229" class="sup">8</span> For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— <span id="en-TNIV-29230" class="sup">9</span> not by works, so that no one can boast. <span id="en-TNIV-29231" class="sup">10</span> For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.</p>
              <p>To me verse 10 shows that once becoming a Christian, good works comes naturally, but in accordance to verse 9 good works does not save you because salvation comes through grace, verse 8.</p>
              <p><em>it need to be stated that I do not claim to be a bible scholar, and that quoting verses is not really my thing.</em></p>
              <p>2. A person who deny Christ cannot claim to have faith.... oxymoron statement... already denied Christ so how to have faith...</p>
              <p>as per my reference in Ephesians.... a person who is saved thru faith WILL do good works.... but good works itself is not instrumental in salvation, which is through grace alone.</p>
              <p>there, my answers. I am NOT asking you to agree with me.... and neither am I hoping that you agree with me. all i am asking is for you to accept this as my answer.</p>
              <p>I don't agree with your opinion, but I have accepted that as your opinion, period.</p>

              <p>I think it is an offence does not mean it is......or is it? Comprehension problem again? Or simply a case of trying to put words in other's mouth and trying to wriggle out?</p>

              <p><em>I think it is an offence</em> means in your brain, you come across a premise that it may be true. Under that assumption, everything else that follows should also be implied as your thought process....</p>
              <p>Having an IC shows that I am a singaporean.... not having an IC does not prove that I am not a Singaporean....</p>
              <p>now drag in Malaysian.... sigh!</p>
