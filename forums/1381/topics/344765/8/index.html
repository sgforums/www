              <p>I read through already....which is basically what we have been talking about. What is faith to you? Why would works be in your salvation theory (wherever you place them)?</p>
              <p>I am not picking but it does seems to be there is a logic failure (if I may use your words) since we are saved only by true faith in Christ (which is proved by our works). Yet, we are considered saved when profess our faith (which is not considered true faith to Christ yet)? The 2 links did not answer the questions I asked.</p>
              <p>Also, the link seems to address between are we saved <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>by faith or works? </strong></span></p>
              <p>But the real contention here is that we all agree that we are saved by faith but what kind of faith? Faith with no works needed or faith with works (that will proved that the faith is real/true in Christ)? It was not about saving by works alone....</p>
              <p>On loosing salvation, Paul said that we are saved in hope and at the end, have we ran the race of our life? To says some are not saved in the first place, how would they know? If they have not "believed" in the first place, why do they start calling Jesus Lord...Lord...?</p>
              <p>In the end, can one loose one's salvation? It seems unconclusive.....as the writer seems to say so and commented based on his own opinions.....and we are not suppose to follow 1 man's opinion?</p>

              <p>That's one way to look at it......but Jesus never fear from speaking the truth even when it cost Him His life.....</p>
              <p>If you love your Church, you stay ....and you speak the truth even if that may cost you. The only reason is because you believed in God and you love Him enough to want to stay and speak the truth.</p>
              <p>Like I said, in a marriage that turned challening, we don't just walk away.....if it was love that binds us in the first place, it will be love that will make us want to stay and make the marriage works.</p>
              <p>Don't get me wrong that I am saying that reformation is wrong but you seems to look it one sided. I said there is always 2 side to a coin. You choose which side you want and which is more appealing to you.</p>

              <p>hmm... when did i say "once saved always saved"? i think omnia had commented that we had at least the point that once saved is not always saved.... you know, you have a tendency to misread and insert words not previously present.</p>
              <p>i believe that a person who give up on Christ will NOT be saved.... someone who forsake Christ.... as in abandoning the faith and become someone of another religion, no different from one who returned the gift of salvation.... all these has nothing to do with works whatsoever.</p>
              <p>i say again, to me, works is NOT part of salvation, which is a gift of God through Jesus Christ. Because of the sacrifice of Christ, i am compelled to do good works, not because it will add to my salvation, but i love because Christ first loved me, and i do good works because of what Christ has done to me....</p>

              <p>hmm... when did i say "once saved always saved"? i think omnia
              had commented that we had at least the point that once saved is not
              always saved.... you know, you have a tendency to misread and
              insert words not previously present.</p>
              <p>i believe that a person who give up on Christ will NOT be
              saved.... someone who forsake Christ.... as in abandoning the faith
              and become someone of another religion, no different from one who
              returned the gift of salvation.... all these has nothing to do with
              works whatsoever.</p>
              <p>i say again, to me, works is NOT part of salvation, which is a
              gift of God through Jesus Christ. Because of the sacrifice of
              Christ, i am compelled to do good works, not because it will add to
              my salvation, but i love because Christ first loved me, and i do
              good works because of what Christ has done to me....</p>
              <p>.... but i don't understand why you keep questioning my stand if
              not to find fault at it... do i question your stand?</p>

              <p> You said salvation in hope is not certain and now after what I explained, is it still uncertain ? Just want to know...</p>
              <p>So you don't beleived in once saved always saved? Ok. Noted.</p>
              <p>I don't know why you keep telling me reasons you do good works.....because I know that from you church doctrine. If you don't do, you deny Christ.</p>
              <p>My question is can a person who deny Christ claimed to have faith in Christ? I don't need lengthy explainations....just yes or no.</p>
              <p>I also know that you said that works is not part of salvation. My question is why then is works in the salvation theory?</p>
              <p>And if it is agreed (with vince69 and dumbdumb) that it is true faith in Christ (one that is proved by works) that saves, why then is one saved when he profess his faith (that has no work to show yet)?</p>
              <p>Finding fault? No lar....trying to find answers....</p>

              <p>Why get so excited? Relax....I merely quote what you said right? Thanks for your explanation which now leads us to Vatican II (talking about going OT). And I thought you prefer the Catholic Encyclopedia which contains many interesting articles? I am sure there is one on Vatican II and it may not paint the same picture as the wiki did.</p>
              <p>And you missed out that the wiki also said:</p>
              <p>In a 22 December 2005 <a class="external text" title="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2005/december/documents/hf_ben_xvi_spe_20051222_roman-curia_en.html" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2005/december/documents/hf_ben_xvi_spe_20051222_roman-curia_en.html">speech</a> to the <a title="Roman Curia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Curia">Roman Curia</a>, <a title="Pope Benedict XVI" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> decried those who interpreted the documents of the Council in terms of
              "discontinuity and rupture". The proper interpretation, he said, is
              that proposed at the start and at the close of the Council by Popes <a title="Pope John XXIII" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_XXIII">John XXIII</a> and <a title="Pope Paul VI" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Paul_VI">Paul VI</a>. On opening the Council, Pope John XXIII stated that the Council intended <em>"to transmit the doctrine pure and entire, without diminution or distortion"</em>, adding: <em>"It
              is our duty not only to guard this precious treasure, as if interested
              only in antiquity, but also to devote ourselves readily and fearlessly
              to the work our age requires. ... This sure unchangeable doctrine,
              which must be faithfully respected, has to be studied in depth and
              presented in a way that fits the requirements of our time. For the
              deposit of the faith, that is, the truths contained in our venerable
              doctrine, is one thing, and the way in which they are enunciated, while
              still preserving the same meaning and fullness, is another."</em> After thus quoting his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI then declared: <em>"Wherever
              this interpretation has guided reception of the Council, new life has
              grown and new fruit has ripened. ... Today we see that the good seed,
              though slow in developing, is nonetheless growing, and our profound
              gratitude for the Council's work is growing likewise."</em></p>
              <p>But that (Vatican II) really has nothing to do with our discussion here on faith and works.</p>

              <p>i said that salvation in hope is not certain if you factor in

              <p>i believe that my salvation is complete in because of the works
                                      of Christ on the cross.</p>
              <p>So how much good works does one need to do to guarantee
                                      salvation?</p>
              <p>If I did one good deed yesterday and didn't do one today and

              <p>Actually, you did not say "salvation in hope is not certain if you factor in
                                      good works" but it's ok.</p>
              <p>And salvation in hope is certain because Paul has explained in clear terms unless of course if you disagree with Paul. It is a process that starts from profession of faith until we face our Lord.</p>
              <p>Salvation is possible by Christ dying on the Cross and is available to all human race for free. But to attain it, there are conditions and that does not changed the fact that salvation is still free. For us is by faith and works (that will prove our faith) and for you faith alone.</p>
              <p>By the way, it is not works alone that saves and we are not working to be saved.</p>
              <p>I don't know why you go back to quantify and measure of good works (again) which we have already explained many times.....that it is good works from the heart that counts.</p>
              <p>It is about a Christian life that we live that will proved that we are truely converted and our deeds proved our faith.</p>
              <p>Same question again, how do you measure and quantify faith? Cannot ?</p>
              <p>Perhaps, we can by the works we produced that comes from our heart. It is not about hair splitting moments if it becomes part of our life. To make it simple, every good work is done because we love Christ from our heart. Do we need to count how many times we love Christ?</p>
              <p>And everytime we decline to show love and charity is to deny Christ because we choose not to love Christ......</p>
              <p>The question you never answer was : If one deny Christ, can one claimed to have faith in Christ?</p>
              <p>And the question I am seeking answer to is how can faith (without fruits yet) saves when it is agreed by all (I hope) that it is true faith in Christ (that has works to proved) that saves?</p>
              <p>Or is that what you mean by problem in comprehension and wrap interpretations? If so, then of course this forum is not the place to seek answer but is that your personal opinion ??</p>

              <p>Let's take the official doctrine of the Catholic Church which teaches that Jesus Christ is God, the second person of the trinity. An errant priest might corrupt the teaching and preach that Jesus was say, an angel and that if the faithful were to donate 20% of their harvest to the priest, he will get the angel Jesus to bless them and make them angels too. The priest has certainly corrupted the Church's doctrine, but does that make the official doctrine of the Church (that Jesus is God) corrupt ? Most certainly not !

              <p>Many traditionalist Catholics hold that the Second Vatican Council, and subsequent interpretations of its documents, moved the Church away from important principles of the historic Catholic faith. These principles include the following:</p>
              <p>the belief that the Catholic Church is the one and only true Christian church founded by Jesus Christ; <br>the belief that the modern idea of religious liberty is to be condemned; <br>an appropriate emphasis on the "Four Last Things" (Death, Judgment, Heaven, and Hell); <br>the belief that the books of the Bible are historically inerrant; <br>a devotion to scholastic theology and <br>an organically grown apostolic Roman liturgy, as they define the Tridentine Mass. <br>They claim that these progressivist changes were made possible because of the ambiguity present in the official texts of the Council.</p>
              <p>here's not to say i think that the second vatican council is good or bad, i really personally don't care.</p>
              <p>this was simply to highly that doctrinal changes occured over the years, and i am sure at a smaller scale.... corrupt clergy will do strange things in their local context.</p>

              <p>The Catholic Church certainly preaches against replacing the one true God with other 'gods' (which might include money, power, vanity; and not just other deities). But as far as I know (I might be wrong), the Church does not forbid fu lu shou statues, paintings of buddha (which can be quite artistic <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> ) etc as long as the Catholic does not see them as anything more than works of art, souvenirs, decorations etc. </p>
