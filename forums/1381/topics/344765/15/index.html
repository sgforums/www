              <p>actually it is not so much i agree or not... but if one goes on
                  one particular trend of thought, the conclusion is such....</p>
              <p>the first hypothesis is: man can do good work, and if man can
                  only do good work because God inspires them.... therefore God did
                  inspire them. Loving God was not part of this equation, because
                  these people may not know God.... and these are people who are
                  prompted by God to help others, to do charity.</p>
              <p>the next hypothesis: if man can only do good work because the
                  need to love God to do good work, then because they do not love
                  God, all the works they do are not good works...</p>
              <p>actually, i would not attempt to paraphase dumb2's post.... i
                  take them at face value.... of dumb2 can explain them further, if
                  he has the time.</p>
              <p>i tend to go with the first hypothesis because there are
                  non-believers who are capable of going to great length to do
                  charity, yet they may either not know God or reject God, so if i
                  have to put a reason to why they do good works, i'd say that's
                  through the inspiration of God - however there is no way i can
                  prove that either.</p>

              <p>actually, dumbdumb is making a simple scenario to try and explain the difference of one having true faith and one that is not really interested - both professing faith. One  (with true faith) is saved and the other is not.....</p>
              <p>You have gone too far off liao leh....though I know what you are trying to say......</p>
              <p>I agree with you that they are inspire by God because all good things come from God and no one can do good works as a result of satan's work.</p>

              <p>Sharing is something that is part of being a Christian. We come from different backgrounds and different churches that teaches us slightly different views.</p>
              <p>Sharing our view in good faith can help us understand each other's view better and thus create a better Christian world.....instead of "Christian fighting Christian"....We pray to the same God and serve the same Lord.</p>
              <p>I think my question are simple and I think vince69 in 2 posts (recent ones) have make it clearer than all the 7-8 pages of arguments we have gone thru. Like I said, not everyone is here to tear and dismantle each other's view though I know there are.....I stated that when I asked the questions....it is your own insecurities that is causing your reactions.</p>
              <p>I don't see how we cannot share....even when we may not agree completely or that we are mere Christians and not scholar.....we share what we know and as dumbdumb said, when we don't, we go find out and learn.....</p>

              <p>i personally feel that both of you have more or less, nothing else to say alr.</p>
              <p>chin eng and i believe that faith alone saves, because God has the power to die for the entire sins of the entire world. As the alpha and omega, the begining and the end, he could see the first sin till the last sin, and he died the perfect death for all those sins, swallowing up death in victory.</p>
              <p>and based on scripture, lots of scripture asserted that we are saved on faith, not on works (since works are basically obedience to the law - loving God and loving men).</p>
              <p>the old covenent - do good, get good, do bad, get beat.</p>
              <p>the new covenent - a new righteousness apart from the law has been found in Christ Jesus. (can something which is righteousness be incomplete, needing men to complete what God has done?)</p>
              <p>personally, nothing wrong with good works, so long you don't start thinking that you're better than anyone else (because to be truthful, i've seen alot of catholics who are assholes - from catholic high, to various churches - which makes you a bigger hypocrite because you include good works as part of your salvation - though i feel is incorrect anyway), and that you give glory to God alone, for your salvation, knowing that you yourself are a sinner, saved by God's grace. it's not your knowledge about God (i've seen athiests knowing more about God than a christian), or your tons of good deeds (since compared to God's standard, they are nothing but filthy rags)</p>
              <p>Personally, I think, struggling with sin alone - shows your salvation, because a person who is saved, is now conscious of his sins, sure he slips alot, but he knows it's wrong, and he keeps periodically throwing out cigarettes, deleting porn, trying to find self help for his addiction etc. As quoted in james - you claim to have faith, but I have deeds which shows my faith.</p>
              <p>i think (recent revelation), i rather elevate someone, encourage someone to fight the good fight, to praise someone in their small efforts to keep the faith, than to nit pick and tear someone down. Since i am just a sinner saved by grace, with no significant good works to talk about, i think i'll choose to view everyone who believes in Jesus the same way. the ark of the covenant is made of wood, covered in gold. we're all imperfect, covered in the blood of Jesus, the perfect high priest. so whatever that is good, and worthy, I'll think of those things.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">so in the end, based on our differing doctrines, the question you should ask yourself is - when did you last do your good deed, and what's so good about it? And when is the last time you did something sinful, in thought or in action, and resulting from this questions, ask yourself, are you worthy before God on your works?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">and the question, chin eng and i ask ourselves is - what's the last good thing God did for us, that we can be really thankful for and give God the glory for?</span></p>
