              <p>from history, we have seen that nobody questioned the pope's
                  final words on any matter, except during the reformation (and like
                  i said, they were nearly killed for "heresy")</p>
              <p>if the pope has said something wrong, there is no way for you to
                  speak up, judging from the current hierachy. the most you can do is
                  tell your priest, who will probably just listen and forget about
                  it. you can only walk out if the teachings disturb you enough.
                  (that's what i do during church actually, if i hear something that
                  isn't what the bible says)</p>
              <p>but at least these are thinking people, and do not just swallow
                  everything someone says. i'm not sure if you listen to homlies - my
                  gf sometimes doze off during the most impt part of the mass (to me
                  it's the homly, although i believe every part of the service is
                  important, worship, communion, sermon, and prayer)</p>
              <p>what can you do, when the pope starts teaching dubious
                  teachings?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>As I said, there are 2 sides to a coin as far as reformation is concerned like a marriage turning sour. What will you do?</p>
              <p>What you said could be true but until the Pope has done what you said, nobody knows. The reason you get the idea is because of what you have been told and one of the thing that people used to put this point across is that all priest have taken a vow of obidience. The big question is "If the Pope said something wrong...." and until that happens, we don't know the reaction.</p>
              <p>So far have you heard anything about the Pope's teaching during Mass? As I said, the Pope is not the Church but the leader of the Church. He has his position and authority just like the senior pastor (or whatever the position is known in your Church). The teachings during all Mass are based on Catholic version of understanding of the Bibles and not based on 1 person (the Pope past or present). If you said we swallow everything at this point, yes I agree because that's what we believed in (the homily) because the priest is teaching based on the Church's teaching - not his own interpretation.</p>
              <p>Your gf dozing off during homily is really a personal issue of hers.....how can we help? Wait quarrel how? So, better leave it between you and her. But it has nothing to do with the Pope or the Church teachings - agree?</p>
              <p>I agree with you that every part of the Mass is important especially the Holy Communion for baptised Catholics.</p>
              <p>what can you do, when the pope starts teaching dubious
                  teachings? Until that happens, I cannot tell you honestly what I can and will do.</p>
              <p>But as I mentioned before, the Church was in bad shape before but there are many people who stayed and nurse the Church and St Francis of Assisi is one of them. If you have time, you can read up on this Saint and what he did.</p>

              <p>doctrines were corrupted by corrupted clergy (or pastors, if you

              <p>so if the catholic church have corrupt clergy, i am sure you
                          have corrupt doctrines....</p>
              <p>seriously, sometimes i find it quite, hilarious as how catholics

                          are attempting defend your church as being perfect.</p>

              <p>Corrupt clergy and corrupt doctrines are the same? Yes, quite hilarious to me....</p>
              <p>Corrupt clegry are something like those who think that it's ok to deviate from our convictions. So what if I am corrupted or refuse to follow the doctrines (such as the doctrine that says we will Deny Christ)? It does not affect the overall missions statement or view of the Church.....just because one deviate, so it's ok.</p>
              <p>The doctrines remained but it is corrup clegry that deviate.....the doctrines did not get corrupted. Make sense? Or maybe you can let me know which are the corrupt doctrines and are they still in the Church doctrine?</p>
              <p>I don't agree that Catholics are trying to paint any pictures or should do so. Most, if not all Catholics will admit and agree to the currupt state of affairs of the Church before....</p>
              <p>But does that means that the Church will be in the same state forever? Does that means that having corrupt clegry before means it is corrupted forever and never to be trusted again?</p>
              <p>We have corrupted minister before so how? To say our government cannot be trusted and that they are all corrupted?</p>
              <p>Reformation was brought into this by dumbdumb and his contention that reformation comes about due to lousy Pope. And it seems like as long as there is a Pope, the Church will be in that same state. So your reasoning on human running organsiation etc... is agreeable.</p>
              <p>Is reformation justified? Perhaps....like I said, when a marriage turn challenging, what would you do?</p>
              <p>By the way, can you help me fit and execute the salvation theory of faith leading to good works? Just a simple can or cannot.....</p>
              <p>And is salvation in hope certain or not? Again, a simple yes or now answer will do.</p>
              <p>One last one, can a person who deny Christ claim to have faith in Christ? Yes or no?</p>
              <p> Talking about reformation is going OT liao isn't it ??</p>

              <p>The reformers were heretics because they wanted to change christian doctrines handed down from Jesus and the apostles which the Catholic Church has been faithfully teaching for 1500 years since apostolic times. I've highlighted this in one of my previous responses, reproduced below. These doctrines were not 'corrupt' or 'contradictory to the bible'. It was clergy misrepresenting these doctrines or not living by them that was the problem. We should be censuring/removing these clergy, not changing the <em>official</em> teachings of the Church which were and remain 'uncorrupted' and certainly not contradictory to the bible in any way.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Previously posted by Omnia:</p>
              <p><br>In my view, the reformers had every right to question church practices and speak out against abuses and corruption (and I would see it as the duty of every Christian to do so). But they had no right to change christian doctrines handed down from Jesus and the apostles which the Catholic Church has been teaching for 1500 years since apostolic times.</p>
              <p>I've said in my previous posts that in my view, the reformers failed to differentiate between corrupt clergy (there were quite a few) and corrupt doctrines contradictory to the bible (there were none). ....</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>There are greater checks nowadays on this problem simply because we are more educated (more of us can read for one thing) and have easy access (think internet) to the official teachings/doctrines of the Catholic Church (eg: The Catechism and other documents put out by the magisterium - pope and bishops in communion with him that form the teaching authority of the Church). We can (and should) double check what individual priests, catholic theologians etc teach with the teachings of the magisterium.</p>

              <p>You should have casually asked them why they did that. Did they believe in these other deities in addition to Jesus ? Or did the deities perhaps belong to older folks living in the house who were not Christians ? Or were they souvenirs from vacations perhaps ?</p>

              <p>You should have casually asked them why they did that. Did they
              believe in these other deities in addition to Jesus ? Or did the
              deities perhaps belong to older folks living in the house who were
              not Christians ? Or were they souvenirs from vacations perhaps
              ?</p>
              <p>If the Catholic did indeed believe in these other gods besides
              Jesus, then they were wrong and need to be better instructed in the
              faith.</p>

              <p><br>i am quite sure the answer will be that.... these are not church teachings but it's individuals who are corrupted..... and i am quite sure that this is the truth... however it does go to show that perhaps the strict catholic teachers may not have trickle downwards to casual believers....</p>

              <p>Before, during and after the reformation, the official doctrines of the Catholic Church were sound and continue to be so. It was corrupted clergymen who either misrepresented these teachings for their own earthly gains or who did not live according to the sound doctrines they were preaching (thereby setting very bad examples for the faithful). These corrupt elements have since been excised and the Church continues to have to deal with such issues when they arise, as with any large earthly organisation.</p>

              <p>i did not say that the catholic church PURPOSELY corrupted doctrines, but that doctrines were corrupted.... hence there were doctrines wilfully corrupted by clergymen.</p>
              <p>otherwise why <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>these corrupt elements have since been excised and the Church continues to have to deal with such issues when they arise, as with any large earthly organisation. </em></span><span style="color: #000000;">I did not say that the catholic church DID nothing to the corrupt doctrines taught.... </span></p>

              choice.....but if you can take a step back and learn to let go (of
              the past), things may not be that bad.</p>
              <p>What really matters is what is the current state of affairs (of
              the church) and what you really want (in your life) and move
              on....</p>

I am never concerned about statues etc...because it does not change the facts for me - that God is not a statue and we don't worship statues.

              <p>I do not agree on "blindfully odedient" as no Catholics need to do so - certianly not to a Pope who teaches wayward stuff.</p>
              <p>What really is "more daring" to you? Reformation is about being daring? I don't think so.</p>
