              <p>If you are thinking that you need to do (good works) and prove for others to see......then it's up to you.</p>
              <p>To me, this is how I know that I am living a correct Christian life
                              that will be pleasing to God......and to know that I strive to love Him
                              more and more each day......</p>
              <p>You seems to be obessed with if a guy do some good work today, not tomorrow etc.... perhaps, you never will comprehen that being a Christian is a life long thing and not a one off issue. Doing good works must come from the heart who love Christ and part of being a Christian (so that it is not hair splitting chore). So what if someone do one today and none yesterday? How does it affect? God judge your life based on a day? Or are you saying do or not is ok because one is already saved anyway?</p>
              <p>If faith is unproven, it is just that - uproven and no fruits......yet. Therefore, cannot save yet as only true faith (that bear fruits) saves - something we agreed (maybe not you). If you need validation, try ISO...(hope this is not another attemp to go back to measure and quantify good works.....)?? I think most of us don't need....</p>
              <p>We know that we have proven faith if we have good works (done with our heart) to show....</p>
              <p>Yes, at the end, God will judge and does that means we do nothing.....?? How does it change (that in the end God judge) with the fact that we must have faith in Him?? True faith that is....one with fruits or works.....</p>
              <p>If you agree only God judge, then how can you claimed to have been "saved" ? Did you pass this judgement yourself or your pastor? Should it not come from God? This is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>not a personal attack</strong></span> but something that I really wonder..... and that is why I have the next question below......</p>
              <p>Still, you did not answer how can a faith (unproven by works yet) can save and how one can claimed to have been saved by such faith?</p>

              <p><span>Eph 2:8</span> For it is by grace you have been saved,
                              through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of
                              God— <span>9</span> not by works, so that no one can boast.</p>
              <p>actually gramatically speaking, quite clear.</p>

              <p>Of course it has not been replied...<strong>I agree with what you have quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but it does not answer the question.</span></strong></p>
              <p>In simple terms, the Eph 2:8 tell us that we are saved by the grace of God through faith. This grace comes about because of Christ sacrifies on the cross. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We all agreed on that and there was never a dispute here</strong></span>. <strong>There is nothing we can do (any works) to replace this grace as a result of Christ sacrifies......a gift from God.</strong></p>
              <p>I think you must have <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">mistaken</span> that we think <span style="color: #ff0000;">good works</span> is used to <span style="color: #ff0000;">replace</span> the fact of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Christ sacrifies</span> on the cross.....or to <span style="color: #ff0000;">replace grace</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It is not</span> ........</span></strong></p>
              <p>Salvation is freely avaiable to ALL HUMAN who desires to have them and possible only because of Christ.</p>
              <p>To attain salvations, there are conditions (which never changes the fact that it is free and by grace of God) - for you faith alone .... and for me faith and works (which makes that true faith in Christ).</p>
              <p>Good works is the fruits of true faith and only such faith (with good works) can saves....</p>
              <p>Basically, I agree we are talking about the same thing - that we are saved by our faith in God. The only difference is that we believed that we are saved by true faith (that has works to show) on judgement day.....a process that start when we profess our faith. Or simply, I define what is faith...the true faith that saves....</p>
              <p>For your side, professing of faith is enough to saves....and one is saved simply by doing that. <strong>I accept that as your view.....no problem.</strong></p>
              <p>What I am seeking to understand is<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> how can faith that is unproven yet (i.e. with no works to show yet) saves when we (again maybe not you) agrees that only true faith in Christ saves? </strong></span>And we (again maybe not you) agrees that the way to tell them apart is from the fruits or works....</p>
              <p>Then, you agreed that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>only God can judge and how can one then claimed to be saved? Who made that judgement ?</strong></span></p>
              <p>Again, I am not making personal attack or the theory.......I am only trying to make sense and logic out of this....perhaps, something is missing that will piece them up.....and that is why I am asking.</p>
              <p><strong>So, my questions remained and I have yet to get an answer .......hope this is clearer now to you.</strong></p>

                                      throughout the whole day and paid them the same amount, and those
                                      who work most complained, the rich guy said something like, too
                                      bad, that was the agreement, some of these workers hardly did any
                                      work but got paid anyway....(forgot which passage, and too tired to
                                      search, sorry)... anyway, to me it does not matter. i have long
                                      decided that i will do all within my means for God, if at the end
                                      of the day he is still not satisfied, too bad.... He's God, He can
                                      do whatever He wants with me....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>maybe God's plan is for the catholics to work your butt off, and
                                      for the protestants, everybody come in.... (just kiddin' - don't

              <p>... but at the end of the day, i still don't know what's "proven
                                      faith". i still don't know how to prove (one man's good deed is
                                      another man's kaypoh), who to prove to (do people really care?),
                                      who is to declare that your faith is proven, and do you need to
                                      continue to have this faith proven?</p>

              <p>To say that the theif have no good works is simply being judgemental.</p>
              <p>The parable about the workers is simply to tell us that the rewards from God is the same....for those who came to Christ first (as Christians) or those who come later (convert Christians) - same salvation.

              <p>If one does good works and is worried about what others says or thinks....then I cannot help. If it is done from one's heart with the love of God, all these burden will be lighten....When will one need to go on proving their faith? Hmmmmmm maybe that today got and tomorrow don't have attitude again.......</p>
              <p>But being a Christian is not a one off event or a one day affair....it's a life long affair. If one live their life as Christians should, on their last day, Christ will see their proven faith with works (done with the heart) and will be rewarded.....</p>
              <p>But all said and done, my question is still unanswered.............perhaps never will but "funny stuff" will be repeated over and over again....have fun!</p>

              <p>well, here's another look at the Methodist discipline:</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The official United Methodist doctrine is this:<br>When a person repents of sin and trusts in Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord, that person is forgiven of sin and receives the gift of eternal life (right relationship with God). The Holy Spirit takes up residence in that person, teaching and equipping him or her to he a disciple of Christ, and confirming that the person is indeed a child of God. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Article IX, The Articles of Religion, The Book of Discipline:<br><strong>“We are accounted righteous before God only for the merit of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, by faith, and not for our own works or deservings. Wherefore, that we are justified by faith, only, is a most wholesome doctrine, and very full of comfort.” </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Article IX, The Confession of Faith, The Book of Discipline:<br><strong>“We believe we are never accounted righteous before God through our works or merit, but that penitent sinners are justified or accounted righteous before God only by faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.”</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">We believe regeneration is the renewal of man in righteousness through Jesus Christ, by the power of the Holy Spirit, whereby we are made partakers of the divine nature and experience newness of life. By this new birth the believer becomes reconciled to God and is enabled to serve him with the will and the affections.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">“We believe, although we have experienced regeneration, it is possible to depart from grace and fall into sin; and we may even then, by the grace of God, be renewed in righteousness.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">” </span></strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.bethany-umc.com/AboutUs/methodistbeliefs.htm">http://www.bethany-umc.com/AboutUs/methodistbeliefs.htm</a></p>
              <p><strong>Q: How do Methodists understand the grace of God?<br></strong>A: The following information from reflects a Methodist understanding of grace, from The People Called Methodists: The Heritage, Life and Mission of The Methodist Church in Singapore. <br><br>One of the distinctive insights which the Methodist Church inherited from its founder, John Wesley, is a comprehensive view of the grace of God. Pervasive in all of creation, grace reveals God’s purpose to heal and restore humanity from the disorder of sin. <br>John Wesley defined grace as that free and undeserved love and mercy which reconciles the sinner to God, through the merits of Christ. By grace, estranged sinners are reconciled to God through Jesus Christ, enabling the pardoned and reconciled sinner to do what would otherwise be impossible.<br>But grace also transforms, and for Wesley, this expresses the essence of the Gospel of salvation that was the heartbeat of his preaching ministry. The God of grace is love and the grace of God is the demonstration of that indescribable love freely showered upon all humanity. <br>While the grace of God is essentially undivided, the saving activity of grace can be seen in these five phases of the work of the Holy Spirit:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Prevenient Grace – that comes even before the sinner has full knowledge of God, drawing him to repentance and healing; </li>
              <li>Justifying Grace – initiating the first stage of salvation, in which God pardons the sinner who trusts in Christ and begins a healing process; </li>
              <li>Sanctifying Grace – whereby the pardoned sinner is restored to the image of God; </li>
              <li>Perfecting Grace – initiating a further stage of salvation, by which Christians are so enabled to love God that they are free from accidental sins; and </li>
              <li>Triumphant grace – the power of God to glorify believers who, by faith, receive the Kingdom of God. </li>
              </ul>
              <p><a href="http://www.methodist.org.sg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=206&amp;Itemid=145#god">http://www.methodist.org.sg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=206&amp;Itemid=145#god</a></p>
              <p>if you have any issue with understanding the methodist discipline, i encourage you to write to the the Methodist Church in Singapore for their learned answer. as far as i can see, my views echoes the fundamental beliefs of the methodist discipline. in the meantime, i believe i am going through the 5 different phases....</p>

              <p>If one does good works and is worried about what others says or thinks....then I cannot help. If it is done from one's heart with the love of God, all these burden will be lighten....When will one need to go on proving their faith? Hmmmmmm maybe that today got and tomorrow don't have attitude again.......</p>
              <p>But being a Christian is not a one off event or a one day affair....it's a life long affair. If one live their life as Christians should, on their last day, Christ will see their proven faith with works (done with the heart) and will be rewarded.....</p>

              <p>but at the end of the day, "proven faith" can only be proven in the face of God.... by then, we are not able to look at each other and say "naa naa naa po po", see i told ja so..... (sorry, more funny stuff)</p>
              <p>so what "proven faith" are we talking about while we are roaming the earth?</p>
              <p>as i said, everything hinges on what happens in front of God.... and by then, it does not matter to each other which way it swings....</p>

              <p>reality of the matter is:</p>
              <p>if anyone truly wish to learn about salvation with or without works, one can always google.... there are plenty of websites promoting both views.</p>
              <p>i tried to google "proven faith" and mostly the hits are about a book written by one guy... so i still don't know what "proven faith" is....</p>

              <p>so the other <strong>thief</strong> didn't do any good
              works...</p>
              <p>Luke 23:<span>39</span> One of the criminals who hung
              there hurled insults at him: "Aren't you the Messiah? Save yourself
              and us!"</p>
              <p> <span>40</span> But the other criminal rebuked
              him. "Don't you fear God," he said, "since you are under the same
              sentence? <span>41</span> We are punished justly,
              <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">for we are getting what our
              deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing
              wrong</span></strong>."</p>
              <p> <span>42</span> Then he said, "Jesus, remember me
              when you come into your kingdom. "</p>
              <p> <span>43</span> Jesus answered him, "Truly I tell
              you, today you will be with me in paradise."</p>
              <p>seems to me both criminals were sentenced to death for crimes
              they have commited... and it was because of the plea of second
              criminal to Christ to remember him when he enter his kingdom that
              was the saving grace for him..... nothing here mentions good works
              whatsoever.....</p>

              <p>Nowhere did the story tell us that the theif did not do any good works......and to says he has not done any (in his life) is just being judgemental. What you quoted in red is to says that the thieves desrve to die but Christ have done nothing wrong and should not even be at the cross.....</p>
              <p>And the fact that he stood up for Jesus and speak out on what is right is already a good deed in itself............</p>
