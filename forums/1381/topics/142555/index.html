            <div class='col-md body'>Jesus Walks on the Water<br>22Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. 23After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone, 24but the boat was already a considerable distance[a] from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.<br><br>25During the fourth watch of the night Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake.<br><br>26When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. "It's a ghost," they said, and cried out in fear.<br><br>27But Jesus immediately said to them: <strong>"Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid." </strong><br><br>28"Lord, if it's you," Peter replied, "tell me to come to you on the water."<br><br>29"Come," he said.<br><br>Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. 30But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, "Lord, save me!"<br><br>31Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. <strong>"You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?" </strong><br><br>32And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. 33Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God."<br><br>34When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret. 35And when the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word to all the surrounding country. People brought all their sick to him 36and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak,<strong> and all who touched him were healed.</strong><br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>my comment: do we have the courage to believe in GOD? sometimes it is easier to doubt than believing. Even as Jesus' Apostle, Peter still doubted. I was very skeptical and doubted everything i come across last time. But now I prefer to put more faith than logic/reason, as the latter had made me more miserable than answer questions for me.<br><br>I believe what GOD wants is just to have more faith in him. For those who are seeking him, he is there with u. There is no distance between u and GOD. Just need to pray.<br><br></div>
