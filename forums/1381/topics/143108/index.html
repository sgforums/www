            <div class='col-md body'>I think 'liberal' should not be used. I think its all about seeking relevance.  I thinkl liberal is used on christians whom people think are going against tradition and mooting new ideas. But note that it is new ideas to preach the gospel, it is not about preaching a new God. We have to be relevant when it comes to interacting with other people about the gospel. After all, Jesus was relevant and not traditional in His times on earth.<br><br>And yes, I would believe that such divisions would lead to more christian bashings, not necessary from just non-christians but also from within. But seriously, it does not change my faith in God because faith in God is like what it is called; faith and conviction.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>[quoted oxford mushroom from another thread]Yes, Christians have been too caught up with being politically correct that they have drifted far from the Scriptures. Trying hard to please the world, they have become so worldly that they have become salt that has lost its taste.<br><br>Christians should stand up for what they believe in. The teachings of Christ will arouse anger and opposition from the world. The Greek word for the church is to be 'called out' from the masses. If our teachings and beliefs are so pleasing to the world, there is no need to call us out from the world.<br><br>I say stick to the teachings in the Scriptures. As for the issue that was mentioned, ie. homosexuality...there is no question in my mind. The Bible condemns it and so Christianity does not condone it. Christians in positions of influence and authority (and there are quite a number in our society) must unite against any attempt to introduce an alternative gospel or a liberal version of christianity.</strong>[/quote]<br><br>Taken from <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=143041" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=143041</a></div>

If liberal interpretation means changing the meaning of the message, it is then a totally bad thing. But liberal in the sense that you use modern ways to preach the gospel or to reach out, then yes I think it is good to push for more liberal/relevant ways.</strong><br><br>2) In keeping up with the times, are we compromising Christ's message too<br>much?<br><br><strong>Like I say. It is just a matter of 'Same message, different language'. </strong><br><br>3) As Christians, are we making ourselves acceptable to the world instead to GOD?<br><br><strong> Yes of cos there are many who serve men rather than God. But its up to us isnt it. You do not need a liberal christian to serve men more than GOd. A traditional one can do that just as well hehe.</strong><br><br>4) Should we be as staunch as what the rest of pple are doing, since we get bashed the most?<br><br><strong> Faith in God is a conviction. I do not really care what people says about my fervency for God. But i do care what they say about the way I do things. In this way, I can be more relevant to them.</strong><br><br>5) Is the church a easy target for bashing, since we preach abt Christ's love more than punishment for sins?[/b]<br><br><strong> We should preach both.

It's simply no nonsense/compromise for these pple of other faiths. Are we...like what mushroom had said...turning into tasteless salt?<br><br>Also, the fact that the novel Da Vinci Code had spread wide speculation in society does not help the faith at all. Should there be checks and balances on the part of the author? Or...are we taken for granted becoz we dun fight back physically (e.g. issue fatwas on somebody's head). If this happen in the other two faiths, we will know what will happen to these authors.</div>
