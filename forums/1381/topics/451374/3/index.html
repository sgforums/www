              <p>No worries, I am not taking this personally at all.</p>
              <p>God did not happen to be God. God IS. There was never a time where God was not. In fact, God is outside of time. He dwells in eternity, something that we finite beings cannot comprehend.</p>
              <p>If the universe just happens with no prior creator or cause, we've got a problem. Millions of dollars are being spent trying to figure out the "moment of creation". Not only that, it is irrational. How can something that is contingent not have a cause? In philosophy God is deemed the NECESSARY being, of which there can be only one.</p>

              <p>I can understand that. But you should know that underlying what I am saying is a Biblical worldview, and I am pointing you in that direction.</p>
              <p>You see, I am not asking you to accept the Bible as true. But I am inviting you to, just for the sake of argument and discussion, put on the Biblical lens to look at the world through Biblical glasses. See it from my perspective and see if it makes sense, if not better sense. Ask yourself, if the Bible is true, what would I expect to see of the world?</p>

              <p>Think of it this way. Newtons law of motion back then was supposedly 'complete', but Einstein realised with Netwon, the limitations of his theory, thus Einstein's law of general relativity was based on Newton's law of motion to improve upon his theory. Both are not wrong.  Just that Newton's and Einstein's like all scientific theories that only work in a control environment.</p>

              <p>What is also exciting is that these are discoveries that enable us to understand the manifold wisdom of God, how "God did it". Many like to think that the more we know about science the lesser the need for God. That is not true at all. It's like unravelling a computer software. The more one picks it apart to understand it and reduces it to bits and bytes, one does not say that therefore there is no programmer behind it or that the programmer is not needed. One simply discovers that behind the software is a very intelligent mind.</p>
