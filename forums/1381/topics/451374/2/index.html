              <p>I was raised a Christian and now a muslim convert. Im Chinese btw. No, did my malay friends forced me to convert nor did i marry a muslim women. You'd be surprised that there are millions of Chinese muslims in china. My road to conversion started 3 years ago when i started to question who god was and what the trinity actually meant. I watched videos of islam and christianity debate. In christianity, we were forced to believe that god exist as three forms Father, son and the holy spirit. When we mention the three, we see three distinct images that are non superimposible. It just doesnt make sense. 2. Why couldnt jesus christ predict the day of his return? 3. He never mentioned in the bible to worship him. 4. In the bible, jesus wanted to eat a fruit but he couldnt because it was not in season. Tell me which god is not able to make fruits bear fruits? 5. God is given birth by a women? Then what about adam who had no parents? Is he also a god. I believe that jesus was the messenger of God and prayed to god. I do not believe he would ever sacrifice himself just to clear our sins. Are we not accountable for our own sins? That was when i embraced islam. There are many reasons for my conversion but this would go on and on. Most of the islamic scholars are from non muslim backgrounds</p>

              <p>from where I come from - my nation do not allow the muslims to convert back to their own religion.</p>
              <p>I have a chinese friend who fell in love with his malay neighour's daughter. They got married and as a req, he has to convert to muslim. So he did. They got married for 3 years. After that divorced.</p>
              <p>My friend wanted to convert back to his original religion, buddhism but it was against the law. His reason was because he converted to follow the wife but syariah court not allow.</p>
              <p>So he has to secretly eat chicken rice and pork during ramadan.</p>
              <p>Recently he met a chinese girl, fell in love. After another 2 years, he wanted to propose to her but she refused because she doesn't want to convert to muslim. So he is now in quandry.</p>

              <p>Strawman away!</p>
              <p>I believe I also told you before that</p>
              <p>1. The universe began to exist. It must have a cause. It cannot
              be self-caused which is illogical. The existence of the universe
              points to a Creator. The complexity/design of the universe points
              to a Designer.</p>
              <p>2. Since the universe cannot cause itself to exist, it must have
              been caused to exist by an external cause i.e. created. This is the
              only alternative, no need to assume at all. What else can it be due
              to? And if you have come this far, congratulations you are no
              longer an atheist! Then we can proceed on to explore WHO the
              creator is. I have good reasons why the God of the Bible is the one
              and not the others. But I think that showing that would be putting
              the cart before the horse so long as you remain an atheist because
              you probably will not appreciate the reasons. Let's take it one
              step at a time.</p>

              <p>Wrong, you are not basing on my logic at all.</p>
              <p>Here's my reasoning again.</p>
              <p>1. That which has a beginning has a cause. Universe has a beginning thus needs a cause.</p>
              <p>2. God does not have a beginning i.e. He is eternal. God does not have a cause.</p>

              <p>Two things,</p>
              <p>1. Which part of my post is illogical? Are you assuming that the Bible is illogical? Why?</p>
              <p>2. Why can't I quote from the Bible? I understand that not everyone here is a Christian. But if we are going to talk about religion, ethics, morals and Christianity, then the Bible must be part of the discussion as far as I am concerned. But if we want to talk about chicken rice and carrot cakes, then we can pretty much leave the Bible out.</p>

              <p>If God has no begining, then God happens to be God, and that's it.</p>
              <p>Now at that point when "God happens to be God", can we say that that was the begining, just for argument sake.</p>
