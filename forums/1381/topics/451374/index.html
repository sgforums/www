              <p>I want to share my opinions on religion here.</p>
              <p>reject the concept of creator cos it doesnt exist.</p>
              <p>if there is salvation in itself, it is not thru an external source, you have to walk the path. just like studying for an exam, you rely on yourself to study hard, not by praying to a god  or hoping to pass the exams with flying colours just by thinking.</p>

              <p>I believe I also told you before that</p>
              <p>1. The universe began to exist. It must have a cause. It cannot be self-caused which is illogical. The existence of the universe points to a Creator. The complexity/design of the universe points to a Designer.</p>
              <p>2. Since the universe cannot cause itself to exist, it must have been caused to exist by an external cause i.e. created. This is the only alternative, no need to assume at all. What else can it be due to? And if you have come this far, congratulations you are no longer an atheist! Then we can proceed on to explore WHO the creator is. I have good reasons why the God of the Bible is the one and not the others. But I think that showing that would be putting the cart before the horse so long as you remain an atheist because you probably will not appreciate the reasons. Let's take it one step at a time.</p>

              <p>I believe I also told you before that</p>
              <p>1. The universe began to exist. It must have a cause. It cannot be self-caused which is illogical. The existence of the universe points to a Creator. The complexity/design of the universe points to a Designer.</p>
              <p>2. Since the universe cannot cause itself to exist, it must have been caused to exist by an external cause i.e. created. This is the only alternative, no need to assume at all. What else can it be due to? And if you have come this far, congratulations you are no longer an atheist! Then we can proceed on to explore WHO the creator is. I have good reasons why the God of the Bible is the one and not the others. But I think that showing that would be putting the cart before the horse so long as you remain an atheist because you probably will not appreciate the reasons. Let's take it one step at a time.</p>

              <p>Sure, we can all start playing word-replacement games, parasiting on each other's postings, mutating and distorting the intended meaning, and destroying the whole discussion. Is that where you wanna go with that?</p>

You'd be surprised that there are millions of Chinese muslims in china. My road to conversion started 3 years ago when i started to question who god was and what the trinity actually meant. I watched videos of islam and christianity debate. In christianity, we were forced to believe that god exist as three forms Father, son and the holy spirit. When we mention the three, we see three distinct images that are non superimposible. It just doesnt make sense. 2. Why couldnt jesus christ predict the day of his return? 3. He never mentioned in the bible to worship him. 4. In the bible, jesus wanted to eat a fruit but he couldnt because it was not in season. Tell me which god is not able to make fruits bear fruits? 5. God is given birth by a women? Then what about adam who had no parents? Is he also a god. I believe that jesus was the messenger of God and prayed to god. I do not believe he would ever sacrifice himself just to clear our sins. Are we not accountable for our own sins? That was when i embraced islam. There are many reasons for my conversion but this would go on and on. Most of the islamic scholars are from non muslim backgrounds</p></div>
