            <div class='col-md body'>My answer is based on the Christian worldview, but I don't claim to know everything...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by bladez87:</div><div class="quote_body">it is said that God heals the sick and lets the blind see and etc.<br><br>and God will 1 day raise the dead. my question is why would God wanna do it?<br></div></blockquote>I think this is said in reference to those who died before Christ's ascension. Every person that has accepted Christ will have his soul saved, and death would not matter. Those who died before Christ's ascension did not get the chance to accept Jesus as their personal saviour, hence, the need to resurrect the dead in order for them to be accepted into heaven.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>faith healers, in my opinion are really faith healers. not con man or such, i believe that when you have faith in your belief, miracles happen. as such is it really God healing the sick?<br></strong></blockquote>There are people who believe that all faith healers are conmen, and there are faith healers proven to be conmen. Mere believe in something does not necessarily make it true. If faith healing is true, there must be a higher power (note that I did not say positive or good), because faith healing enters the realm of the supernatural - ie doing something beyond the natural confines of the human body and it's capabilities.<br>NOTE: no where in my reply am I inferring that all "Christian" healing is true, or "non-Christian " healing is false.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>all those countries who have not been reached by Christianity, are they all doom to hell? what about in the past, we know China's religion was Buddhism. does that mean all of those who do not accept Christianity be doom to hell?<br></strong></blockquote>Strictly speaking? Yes. In your example, China's religion is wasn't exactly Buddhism. It's a mix of Taoism as well Confusionism plus some dosage of some other philosophy. Having said that, I believe that it is mentioned in the Bible that God judges a man's heart - for those who did not get the opportunity to hear the Gospel of Christ. Therefore, the true answer to this question is - it's up to God.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>another thing is, i believe in all religions, yet i stick to my religion as a buddhist because i believe in loyalty to your religion, and also because i am the only male heir in my family. i dont know if there is reincarnation, nor if the afterlife is really hell or heaven, but what happens in this sense? since i believe in all religion, or to say i believe in God, a superior being, that we humans have no way of understanding.<br></strong></blockquote>Whatever that makes you happy, dude....<br>I am also the only son in my family. My parents is a mix of buddhism and taoism. They are not overly concern over what I believe. Over the years, they have become aware that some of the stereotypes of christianity do not exist, eg, visiting the ancestors grave during Cheng Meng - I insist on doing it. My personal view on this? We choose what we believe in, independent of our family members and our traditions.  Again, whatever that makes you happy.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>also Christians are Christians, why the different branches of churches? why so many? </strong></blockquote>Logically, there is only ONE church. However, due to human weaknesses and the imperfect world, some denominations emerged because of differences. Others are just a natural course of events and should not be translated as conflict within the church (but there are some that happened because of conflict). An example of this is Methodism.... this is really an off-shot of Anglican. The name Methodists is derived from John Wesley's (who died as an Anglican) methods of Bible study and discipleship.<br><br>There!
