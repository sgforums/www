If you have neither, pour water three times on the head, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit (Didache7:1 [A.D. 70]).<br><br>Ignatius of Antioch<br><br>For our God, Jesus Christ, was conceived by Mary in accord with God's plan: of the seed of David, it is true, but also of the Holy Spirit (Letter to the Ephesians 18:2 [A.D. 110].<br><br>Justin Martyr<br><br>We will prove that we worship him reasonably, for we have learned that he is the Son of the true God himself, that he holds a second place, and the Spirit of prophecy a third. For this they accuse us of madness, saying that we attribute to a crucified man a place second to the unchangeable and eternal God, the Creator of all things, but they are ignorant of the mystery that lies therein (First Apology 13:5Â–6 [A.D. 151]).<br><br>Theophilus of Antioch<br><br>It is the attribute of God, of the most high and almighty and of the living God, not only to be everywhere, but also to see and hear all, for he can in no way be contained in a place. . . . The three days before the luminaries were created are types of the Trinity: God, his Word, and his Wisdom (To Autolycus 2:15 [A.D. 181]).<br><br>Irenaeus<br><br>For the Church, although dispersed throughout the whole world even to the ends of the earth, has received from the apostles and their disciples the faith in one God, the Father Almighty . . . and in one Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who became flesh for our salvation; and in the Holy Spirit (Against Heresies 1:10:1 [A.D. 189]).<br><br></div>

And yet we regard it as divine.<br><br></div></blockquote>The Apostles taught it to thier students. Just read quotes of our Church Fathers in this site.<br><br>http://www.scripturecatholic.com/jesus_christ_divinity.html#tradition-II<br><br>But I personally feel ur position is flawed that everythig that is necessary for salvation must be explicitly stated in the Bible.  I agree that it must be implicitly stated in Scriptures and with Tradition u might gain a complete understanding of a doctrine.<br><br>The problem, therefore, with sola Scriptura, is that the knowledge of which Scriptures are inspired and which ones are not is not contained in the Bible. The Bible does not have an "inspired table of contents." Instead, this knowledge of the canon of Scripture is a revelation from God that is necessary for our salvation, and yet came to us from outside the Bible. This was revealed to The CC whom with Apostolic Tradition selected the inspired books. By ur logic, the Bible compiled by the CC is at best unbiblical.<br><br>Appreciate Tradition and Scripture.<br><br>"If I am delayed, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and bulwark of the truth." 1 Tim 3:15<br><br>Church not Bible is the pillar of Truth.</div>
