So unless you have evidence to the contrary, just treat the verse as .. fake.<br><br>In fact this is the position taken by most modern bible translations. Look at the NIV and NRSV. They did not include the verse, but put it in a footnote.<br><br>Furthermore, the verse does not seem to be quoted by the church fathers. Well, if the verse is real, you can imagine the church fathers will all appeal to this verse to argue for the Trinity .. right?<br><br></div></blockquote>right <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><span class="large">FYI</span><br><strong>The Trinity Illustrated in the Bible</strong><br>The concept of God being triune can be illustrated in the Bible just as easily as it can be illustrated in nature. John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." This shows God to exist in two forms. The word God in this passage refers to ELOHIM, or to God as a whole. The word Word refers to God the Son, who is Jesus Christ. This is shown in verse fourteen, "and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory...as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth."<br><br>Having established that God is a singular being with a plural existence, and understanding that the term "Word" (capitalized to represent deity) in John chapter one refers to God the Son who is the Lord Jesus Christ, let us read I John 5:7, "For there are three that bear record in heaven, The Father, The Word, and The Holy Ghost: and these three are one."<br><br>Thus we have proof: His name ELOHIM (meaning three in one) is proof, the design of nature is proof, and in scripture there is proof. God is a triune being composÃ�ed of God the Father, God the Word or God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost who is often referred to as the Holy Spirit. They are each independently divine, they are each a separate aspect to the overall personality of God, yet they are combined to make one singular being.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The following is amusing. From <a href="http://logosresourcepages.org/Versions/johannine.htm" rel="nofollow">http://logosresourcepages.org/Versions/johannine.htm</a><br><br><blockquote>The NIV Study Bible, for instance, says that 1 John 5:7f "is not found in any Greek manuscript or New Testament translation prior to the 16th century." On account of this they argue that 1 John 5:7 is spurious.</blockquote>I sincerely hope the author quotes the NIV Study Bible correctly. Can some of you double check if you have it?<br><br>If the author is right .. then you should dump your NIV Study Bible liao and buy a better one.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>
