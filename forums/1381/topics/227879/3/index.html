Mary was the mother of Jesus in both of these senses; because she not only carried Jesus in her womb but also supplied all of the genes for his human body, since it was through herÂ—not JosephÂ—that Jesus "was descended from David according to the flesh"<br><br>Since Mary is JesusÂ’ mother, it must be concluded that she is also the Mother of God: If Mary is the mother of Jesus, and if Jesus is God, then Mary is the Mother of God. Its so logical<br><br>Although Mary is the Mother of God, she is not the source of her SonÂ’s divinity, for she is neither. Rather, we say that she is the Mother of God in the sense that she carried in her womb a divine personÂ—Jesus Christ, God "in the flesh" Â—and in the sense that she contributed the genetic matter to the human form God took in Jesus Christ. Mary thus carried and gave birth to the person of Jesus Christ, and the person she gave birth to was God.<br></div>
