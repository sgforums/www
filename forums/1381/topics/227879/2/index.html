U can find Pope in the Bible<br><br>Pope means Papa in Italian which is Father. Isa. 22:21 - Eliakim is called Â“fatherÂ” or Â“papaÂ” of God's people. The word Pope used by Catholics to describe the chief steward of the earthly kingdom simply means papa or father in Italian. This is why Catholics call the leader of the Church "Pope." The Pope is the father of God's people, the chief steward of the earthly kingdom and Christ's representative on earth<br><br>If u read isaiah 22:20-22 and Mat 16:18, u might actuallie understand something abt the papacy. As protestants champion, using Scripture to understand Scripture<br><br>And u cant find the New Testament Canon ( which books are inspired) in the bible as well... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br></div>

Beyond glass-paneled double doors, a conference between seven men was in progress. A folder bulging with reports lay in front of each man. At each man's elbow a full carafe of water topped with a glass was perched. Anyone happening to glance in might have said that the men gathered there were absorbed in the sort of hushed but free-wheeling discussion typical of board meetings everywhere.<br>But this was not the sort of meeting most people have ever witnessed, or even glimpsed through shut, glass-paneled doors. This conference room was on the third floor of the Palace of the Popes on Vatican Hill. The report folders were red damask and emblazoned in gold with the Tiara and Keys. Outside the door, a secretary and two Swiss Guards in traditional uniform were on duty to block all intruders. Seated at the conference table were the Pontiff of the Holy Roman Catholic Church and six of his most powerful cardinals, the movers and shakers of the Vatican, a cameo of its most formidable strength. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And the subject of discussion between them was the life or death of the Society of Jesus: whether, in other words, the Order headed by Father General Pedro Arrupe should be allowed to go on as it was, or be reorganized and reset according to the often-repeated wishes of three Popes, or be officially done to death by the power and under the authority of Pope John Paul II</span></strong>."

            <div class='col-md body'>1) Most of ur claims are based on a conspiracy best novel. I have actuallie read wadever u typed out b4 when i was researching on the realities of a jesuit plot. I have long came to the conclusion that they are jack-chick style propoganda.<br><br>2) If the Catholic Church and the Jesuits is as sinister as u might protray it to be, why are u still alive? Do u tihnk they would let 650 million heretics walk free.... Instead of killing POpes, they be killing you.<br><br>3) Mr Simon Magus destroyed ur academic credibility<br><br>4) Provide me a list of approved assisanation...very rare.<br><br>5) I too can give u quotes abt how vulgar and sex crazed ur protestants fathers were.<br><br>Pls return to the holy trinity</div>
