            <div class='col-md body'>Consider the controversy between Jerome and Helvidius, writing around 380. Helvidius first brought up the notion that the "brothers of the Lord" were children born to Mary and Joseph after JesusÂ’ birth. The great Scripture scholar Jerome at first declined to comment on HelvidiusÂ’ remarks because they were a "novel, wicked, and a daring affront to the faith of the whole world." At length, though, JeromeÂ’s friends convinced him to write a reply, which turned out to be his treatise called On the Perpetual Virginity of the Blessed Mary. He used not only the scriptural arguments given above, but cited earlier Christian writers, such as Ignatius, Polycarp, Irenaeus, and Justin Martyr. Helvidius was unable to come up with a reply, and his theory remained in disrepute and was unheard of until more recent times by Protestants like you.<br><br>We know that James the youngerÂ’s mother was named Mary. Look at the descriptions of the women standing beneath the cross: "among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee" (Matt. 27:56); "There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome" (Mark 15:40).<br><br>Then look at what John says: "But standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his motherÂ’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene" (John 19:25). If we compare these parallel accounts of the scene of the crucifixion, we see that the mother of James and Joseph must be the wife of Clopas. So far, so good.<br><br>An argument against this, though, is that James is elsewhere (Matt. 10:3) described as the son of Alphaeus, which would mean this Mary, whoever she was, was the wife of both Clopas and Alphaeus. But Alphaeus and Clopas are the same person, since the Aramaic name for Alphaeus could be rendered in Greek either as Alphaeus or as Clopas. Another possibility is that Alphaeus took a Greek name similar to his Jewish name, the way that Saul took the name Paul.<br><br>So itÂ’s probable that James the younger is the son of Mary and Clopas. The second-century historian Hegesippus explains that Clopas was the brother of Joseph, the foster-father of Jesus. James would thus be JosephÂ’s nephew and a cousin of Jesus, who was JosephÂ’s putative son. Joseph and Jesus however did not share any biological relationship sooooo,......<br><br>( Source: CatholicAnswers)<br><br></div>

'cos they argue both Joseph and Mary are descendants of King David.<br><br>but they forget that in Jewish culture, kingship is always passed down the male line. so if Jesus is not biological child of Joseph, then he cannot be the Messiah.<br><br>Erm .. the Trinity is three persons. So Mary is mother of the person Jesus only?</div></blockquote><blockquote><br># Matthew 1:20<br>But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.<br># Luke 1:27<br>to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary.<br># Luke 2:4<br>So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.<br></blockquote>OK, Shown, Joseph is a descendant of David.<br><br>now about Mary, there was no mention of whether she is a decendant of David, but she does have a cousin Elizabeth (Mother of John the Baptist), who is a decendant of Aaron<br><blockquote>Luke 1:5<br>[ The Birth of John the Baptist Foretold ] In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.<br><br>Luke 1:35-37<br>35The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called[c] the Son of God. 36Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be barren is in her sixth month. 37For nothing is impossible with God."<br></blockquote>which means, most likely, Mary is also a descendant of Aaron and not David.<br><br>Which make sense,<br>Through the line of Joseph, Jesus inherited the kingship.
