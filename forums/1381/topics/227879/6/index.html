The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, 33and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end."<br><br>34"How will this be," Mary asked the angel, "since I am a virgin?"<br><br>35The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called[c] the Son of God. 36Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be barren is in her sixth month. 37For nothing is impossible with God."<br><br>38"I am the Lord's servant," Mary answered.
