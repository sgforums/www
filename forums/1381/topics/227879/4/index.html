He was begotten from the Father before all ages as to his divinity and in these last days, for us and for our salvation, was born as to his humanity of the virgin Mary, <span style="color: red;">the Mother of God. </span><br><br><span style="color: green;">We confess that one and the same Christ, Lord, and only-begotten Son, is to be acknowledged in two natures without confusion, change, division, or separation. </span>The distinction between natures was never abolished by their union, but rather the character proper to each of the two natures was preserved as they came together in one person (prosopon) and one hypostasis."</strong><br><br></div>

It was the teaching of the church after Jesus died. So is it justifiable to have a MAN made doctrine that lead us to the belief of the existence of 3 Gods who are 1?<br><br>I mean, I understand the church was inspired by the happenings and events that took place in the bible by each of the 3 gods and thus concepted the Holy Trinity.<br><br>But at the end of the day, the Holy Trinity is still the teachings of man. And not from the word of God himself.<br><br></div></blockquote>Coming back to the original question:<br><br>I believe if we were to dispute the trinity, we may not be able to still call ourselves Christians anymore.<br><br>Why? Becoz if we accept the preposition that Jesus is not God, we may as well become followers of other monothestic faith which says Jesus is not God and just a mere man/prophet.<br><br>Furthermore, if holy spirit is not God and just "God's active force", then we might as well join a cult call JW.<br><br>I like some of the orthodox christians beliefs which I have read in some books. To them, the trinity is a mystery. Let's not go into technical details becoz all of us will be stumbled.<br><br>I know another monothestic faith always use the bible to "prove" that Jesus is not God. However, it is fundamental for Christians to believe Jesus is God. We have these verses in the bible to remind us who Christ was:<br><br>John 1:1 "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." together with John 1:14 "The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth." and John 1:18 "No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only, who is at the Father's side, has made him known."<br><br></div>

How do u think Christ becomes a descedants of King David?<br><br>Luke 1:43 - Elizabeth's use of "Mother of my Lord" (in Hebrew, Elizabeth used "Adonai" which means Lord God) is the equivalent of "Holy Mary, Mother of God" which Catholics pray in the Rosary. The formula is simple: Jesus is a divine person, and this person is God. Mary is Jesus' Mother, so Mary is the mother of God (Mary is not just the Mother of Jesus' human nature - mothers are mothers of persons, not natures).<br><br></div>
