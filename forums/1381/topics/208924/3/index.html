The chinese believe strongly in filial piety, but they also have a term for blind filial piety - yu2 xiao4. Note that not everything is in black and white. For the example, you might not say yes.

I recognise we can't have unplanned pregnancies simply because it's harmful to the child who is born as a result. My stand is that if one doesn't want a pregnancy, one shouldn't be having straight sex, but seeing as humans are rather..... sex-crazed nowadays, it's probably a necessary measure.<br><br>also if we take into account the numbers of sexually transmitted diseases, and people's inability to control themselves, perhaps u can't do without it.<br><br>the point is, to try to talk about homosexuality being wrong because it's been perceived as "unnatural" (when it's not) is quite moot, since straight people often have to resort to actual unnatural things in order to best meet the circumstances. If straight people can accept many unnatural things, its perplexing why they cannot accept something that is <span style="font-style: italic;">natural</span> which has been wrongly perceived to be "unnatural"</div>
