If u look at the sort of posts in Bar, about guys who want to touch girl's private parts or see zao geng or upskirt or wadever, the case is pretty solid that straight guys are still more indecent than gay guys. Maybe it's the gay guys in singapore, who, living in such an oppressive society, developed an indecency within them.

The chinese believe strongly in filial piety, but they also have a term for blind filial piety - yu2 xiao4. Note that not everything is in black and white. For the example, you might not say yes. But what if your parents are dying? Will you want them to die in peace or huo2 huo2 qi4 si3?<br><br>Back to the topic, NUS raised the point on yin and yang. Perhaps it is true that too much yin or yang will harm your body? Haha.</div>
