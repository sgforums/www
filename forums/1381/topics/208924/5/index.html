Yet, the divorce rates for hetero couples, and the abuse and power relations in hetero marriages are so wrong."<br><br>I'm not slagging off straight couples or anything, but take a look around you. People say that a male-female relationship is "normal". Then make me see, please, what's normal about the statistics that show that 50% (and rising) of marriages in the States end up in divorce? What's normal about abortions due to teenage pregnancies? What's normal about the increased rates of wives getting abused by their husbands?<br><br>You tell me.<br><br>Straight isn't normal. straight is just common.<br></blockquote></div>

It's like people who live in an earthquake prone place and simply have this mentality that as long as nobody mentions earthquakes, they'll be safe, instead of doing what is necessary to ensure that when one happens, they're as safe as possible, even if it means they'll have to constantly be slightly on their toes<br><br>it's people like u who too rigidly hold on to something as "right" and "wrong" without giving it any consideration simply because u were told it is.<br><br>if the world was full of people like u, slavery would still be alive, whites would still be owning chinese coolies and black slaves, women would still have no rights, u would not be able to go to NUS because your parents are not nobility, the list would go on and on and on.<br><br>Like I said, it takes a lazy person to accept concepts of "right" and "wrong" at face value without considering if something is really right or wrong.

Are u a supporter of gender discrimination, racism, class discrimination and other sort of horrible intolerances?<br><br>The world is messy now because people who cannot let go of outdated concepts are purposely making it messy.

There is only combination of yin and yang. Yin and yin or yan and yan is never allowed in the first place and problems will soon appear when there is too much yin or yang. No t a good explaination but hope u all understand.</div></blockquote>I know what I am going to say is abit no link to Christianity/Eternal Hope, but I feel the need to post. So must forgive me, before I return back to Aunt Agony.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Actually you are only partially right; the reason is because you see biological form as how the energy is manifested. It is true that woman are negative (yin) and man are positive (yang) - but the make-up of a human consist of two component, the soul and the body (your physical and your spiritual form).<br><br>Firstly, we <strong>must </strong>come to a mutual agreement that:<br><br>(I) Everything existed on Earth is natural. As it exists on Earth, it is a natural cycle of nature. Regardless of whatsoever ideology that is taught to us as 'bad', 'evil' or 'unnatural'... in the end, they are natural because it existedÂ…and it is not a myth. A gay person is not a myth - it existed, therefore it is part of nature. UFOs are a myth - they do not exist within the space/frame of Earth. Therefore they are not part of nature to be part of Earth.<br><br>(II) Love is the attraction forge between two separate energies, namely negative (yin) and positive (yang).<br><br>(III) If we measure masculine and feminine energy on a scale - NOBODY is 100% masculine/feminine. Everybody falls in between this scale. You witness this by having feminine man and masculine woman.<br><br>IV) If you believe in reincarnation, what I am going to say will probably make sense to you.<br><br>MOST people, being heterosexuals or the majority, have similar energies with their soul and body (A man with yang-dominant soul or a woman with yin-dominant soul). These category of people falls in love with the opposite gender (with the exact opposite energy) and attraction foster.<br><br>However, there are a category of people with conflicting flow of energies within them. (A man with a yin-dominant or a woman with yang-dominant). When that happens, there will be constant, unconscious battle between the body and soul - both vying for superior control of the man/woman because like fire and water, both neutralise each other, which is one classic archetype of a person with deep-seated karmic revolving love and relationship.<br><br>I did some self research, with astrology and the speaking to gay people, and realise that there is a certain pattern to it: people falling under this category usually have afflicted planetary chart that spells difficulty or promise much hardship in love and relationship. (Afflicted Venus, Moon and Uranus, Neptune, 5th, 7th and sometimes 8th house is involved). How this is achieve is very simple; it is believed that we will be reincarnated into the gender our soul dictates - and of course if our soul is masculine, we will always born into a man and when the energies of our soul and body is the same - we are heterosexual... the common or the majority. After several reincarnation, and if you change one particular reincarnation to a female... you will naturally have a clash and whatever I have mentioned above take place.<br><br>You mentioned that a relationship between two gender is 'unnatural' - remember the mutual agreement? Love is the attraction between two separate energies? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What if the energies of soul between the two man/woman is yin and yang separately?</strong></span> So you must agree with me that the Love is natural (albeit physically, we all know that we ain't made for two man/woman to have sex). Don't believe? Next time when you see a gay couple - take some time to observe other than avoidance them with your eyes; you will notice that one mate will be taking on the masculine role (e.g butch) and the other fulfilling the feminine role (e.g. passive). And the roles they adopt reflects the energy in their soul.<br><br>One might argue that the reason for this phenomenon is because a gay couple replicate the model of a heterosexual relationship, in which there must be a 'man' and 'woman' in a relationship. The fact is, indeed, there must be two separate energies before Love can foster. And the two separate energies will divide itself clearly on the masculine and feminine role of the couple. The gay man will not be interested in heterosexual woman because they share similar negative/yin energies in their soul.<br><br>Another interesting thing is also shown by the fact that a gay person could achieve as much, if not better, success than a heterosexual (Career is govern by 10th house/Saturn/Capricorn in natal placing). A gay person is NOT hinder in that manner and anything that doesn't overlap very much with love and relationship (Those affected usually includes: 4th house (Moon, Cancer ruling) - Family is affected, 2nd/7th house (Taurus and Libra ruling) - self esteem and marriage is affected, 11th house (Aquarius ruling) - friendship is affected, 12th house (Pisces ruling) - Unconscious/karma is triggered).<br><br>Then after doing all my self research regarding Homosexuality, or people with sexual crisis; I came to one main conclusion. People being tormented by homosexuality all their life, usually suffer from this: It is a mechanism created by karma, inflicted into a person this lifetime because he/she has been cruel/misused the power of love previously. To have that force exuded previously and now returning to him/her - the cruelty of love now befall onto the person, suffering his own cruelty/misrepresentation of love he previously exuded.<br><br>People less affected by homosexuality (or those eventually outgrown it), may have partial reasoning like above, but after their debts are paid, the affliction is gradually lifted. The karmic debts are lesser in degree.<br><br>I am not seeking for people to agree with me; however, this is the answer I had gotten from my studies of Love. Everybody has their own love cosmic lesson to grasp this lifetime, both heterosexual and homosexual. Remember, we are all students in Love. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
