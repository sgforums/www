              <p>What Does the Bible Say About Worry?</p>
              <p>I've spent an awful lot of time in my life worrying. I've worried about grades in school, job interviews, approaching deadlines and shrinking budgets. I've worried about bills and expenses, rising gas prices, insurance costs and endless <a href="http://christianity.about.com/od/faqhelpdesk/f/biblepayingtax.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">taxes</span></span></a>. I've even worried about having my home in perfect condition for "company," and within seconds of their arrival, the house is turned upside down and no one even notices.</p>
              <p>I've worried about first impressions, political correctness, identity theft and contagious infections. In spite of all the worrying, I'm still alive and well, and all my bills are paid.</p>
              <p>Over the span of my lifetime, worrying accounts for hours and hours of invaluable time that I'll never get back. So, I have decided that I'd like to spend my time more wisely and more enjoyably. If you're not convinced yet to give up your worrying, here are four biblical reasons not to worry.</p>
              <ol>
              <li><strong>Worrying Accomplishes Absolutely Nothing.</strong>
              <p>I don't know about you, but I don't have any time to waste these days. And worrying is a waste of very precious time. Worrying won't help you solve a problem or bring about a solution, so why waste your time and energy on it?</p>
              <ul>
              <strong>Matthew 6:27-29</strong> <br><em>Can all your worries add a single moment to your life? And why worry about your clothing? Look at the lilies of the field and how they grow. They don't work or make their clothing, yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they are.</em> <a href="http://christianity.about.com/od/faqhelpdesk/p/newlivingtransl.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">(NLT) </span></span></a>
              </ul>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Worrying is Not Good for You.</strong>
              <p>Worrying is destructive to us in many ways. It becomes a mental burden that can even cause us to grow physically sick.</p>
              <ul>
              <strong>Proverbs 12:25</strong> <br><em>Worry weighs a person down; an encouraging word cheers a person up.</em> <a href="http://christianity.about.com/od/faqhelpdesk/p/newlivingtransl.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">(NLT) </span></span></a>
              </ul>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Worrying is the Opposite of Trusting God.</strong>
              <p>The energy that we spend worrying can be put to much better use in prayer. Here's a little formula to remember: <strong>Worry</strong> replaced by <strong>Prayer</strong> equals <strong>Trust</strong>.</p>
              <ul>
              <strong>Matthew 6:30</strong> <br><em>And if God cares so wonderfully for wildflowers that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow, he will certainly care for you. Why do you have so little faith? </em><a href="http://christianity.about.com/od/faqhelpdesk/p/newlivingtransl.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">(NLT) </span></span></a>
              </ul>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
              <ul>
              <strong>Philippians 4:6-7</strong> <br><em>Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done. Then you will experience God’s peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus.</em> <a href="http://christianity.about.com/od/faqhelpdesk/p/newlivingtransl.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">(NLT) </span></span></a>
              </ul>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Worrying Puts Your Focus in the Wrong Direction.</strong>
              <p>When we keep our eyes focused on God, we remember his love for us and we realize we truly have nothing to worry about. God has a wonderful plan for our lives, and part of that plan includes taking care of us. Even in the difficult times, when it seems like God doesn't care, we can put our trust in the Lord and focus on his kingdom. God will take care of our every need.</p>
              <ul>
              <strong>Matthew 6:25</strong> <br><em>That is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life-whether you have enough food and drink, or enough clothes to wear. Isn't life more than food, and your body more than clothing?</em> <a href="http://christianity.about.com/od/faqhelpdesk/p/newlivingtransl.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">(NLT) </span></span></a>
              </ul>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
              <ul>
              <strong>Matthew 6:31-33</strong> <br><em>So don't worry about these things, saying, 'What will we eat? What will we drink? What will we wear?' These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers, but your heavenly Father already knows all your needs. Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and he will give you everything you need.</em> <a href="http://christianity.about.com/od/faqhelpdesk/p/newlivingtransl.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">(NLT) </span></span></a>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
              <ul>
              <strong>1 Peter 5:7 </strong><br><em>Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares about you.</em> <a href="http://christianity.about.com/od/faqhelpdesk/p/newlivingtransl.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">(NLT) </span></span></a>

              <p>Fear is the strongest negative energy that drains people of all their spiritual and mental strength to handle life's obstacles. Worry is a subset of fear, as it's basically the fear of not being able to do something well enough, fear of not having enough of something, fear of failure, etc.</p>
              <p>Creator/Source/God will only help people who help themselves, and He would want everyone to believe in themselves, and that they have what it takes to overcome all obstacles in their life. Anyone just sitting around, and praying that problems will get solved by themselves have only themselves to blame, if the problems remain unsolved, or get worse.</p>

              <p>Thanks TS for the post. I may be an aethist but these are still very valid points</p>
              <p>Its things like these that tempt me to convert but churches these days are more of a powerful mind control corporation than a place to simply pray and seek guidance in a messy world</p>

              <p>The problem is christians when we faced a problem in life, we dun simply pray to God,we also solve the problem urselves.</p>
              <p>If let's say u get cancer.</p>
              <p>1) U pray to God for healing</p>
              <p>2) U also seek medical treatment</p>
              <p>Let's say u got psychological problem</p>
              <p>1) u pray to God for help</p>
              <p>2) u seek counsuelling</p>
              <p>School problem</p>
              <p>1) pray to God for help</p>
              <p>2) try to solve it by asking help from teachers</p>
              <p>Dun think christian only pray all day long we also solve the problems urselves.</p>

              <p>Great that you're one of those who understand. Unfortunately, there are many people out there (may not be in your social circle), from various religions/faiths, who only rely on praying alone, but not doing anything to solve their own problems. So when things don't get solved, they will start cursing/blaming everyone else, God, Higher Beings, and everything else, but themselves. These are the type of people which Spiritual Realm will not bother to help, as it is a life lesson they'll need to learn.</p>
