Some like the Jesuits can even accept Confucius as a Saint.

And generally they don't practice dual religion, making their religion a zero-sum.</blockquote>ito<br><blockquote>jesuits believe confucius is a saint meh? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> </blockquote>wisefool<br><blockquote><br>Ya, they are the ones who came up with the latin word Confucius and Mencius while others like Sun Tzu and Lao Tzu remain in their English translation.

Not everyone called Wei Da will be called God, to the PRC, all of their leaders are Wei Da, other than Mao, hardly anyone is a god to them. If you are thinking about historical figures being conferred as deity, then thats a practice that stemmed from Shamanism.<br><br>Its difficult to differentiate culture from religion in a Chinese context. Religion in Chinese is called Jiao, similar meaning to teachings. Among the traditional Chinese religion of Confucianism, Taosim and Buddhism, the two former ones are born in China while the latter is imported from India. Both religions that are born in China started off as philosophical school of thoughts. While most schools have religious aspect such as the Five element schools or Moism, but all these schools seek to become political doctrines, not to explain how people came about or explaining after life. So for a long time in China's history, there's no such thing as an official religion. Right from the start, Chinese were only being discriminated on what you learn, not who/what you pray to.<br><br>The most religious aspect of the Chinese life back then was "Shamanism" which can be traced back to Da Yu of the Xia Dynasty. The common Chinese notion of praying to tree or river or simply just about everything derives from Shamanism. But Shamanism is not a religion, its a culture.<br><br>One of the greatest evidence that Chinese do not have the concept of religion is that up till now, there's still debate on whether Confucianism is a religion or just a school of thought. 2500 years of following the same doctrine and nobody can tell you for sure if its a religion. Things get more complicated when the three religions "merged" together and most Chinese scholars are expected to learn from all three religions' teaching. Most people today can see Chinese praying to something, but couldn't quite really say which religion the practice came from. For example, there's a practice that parents will bring their children to pray Confucius when the exams are near. If one is pray Confucius, one would expect this to be a Confucianism practice, but no, Confucian in this case is known as Wen Chang Jun, which is a Taoism title.<br><br>When Dong Zong Shu of the Han Dynasty proposed to make Confucianism the official "religion", the status of Confucianism became what the westerners call a Civic Religion. The emphasis of a Civic religion is not truth or metaphysic but to shape the mind and thinking of the population in order to govern them. So in Confucianism, there's emphasis on Jun Jun Chen Chen Fu Fu Zi Zi, which basically emphasized the importance of strict hierarchy and following the orders of those above the hierarchy. Confucianism does have traces of religious thoughts such as Tian Ren Gan Ying or Tian Ming (Mandate of Heaven), but the purpose of which is to justify the Imperial family's right to rule and the other people's obligation to obey.<br><br>Since then, the Emperor rule as political entity with religious power, but hardly anyone see him as a Pope like figure. But the Emperor can conferred titles to past away figures and let other people worship him/her. Yue Fei, Liang Hong Yu, Kong Zi and Guan Yu were all historical figures that had been conferred titles by the Emperor and became Deity like figure. But the purpose of conferring these figures were political, they were suppose to be some sort of role models or tools of govenmental propaganda. The Emperors made no denial that these acts were political and not religious act, but they couldn't see the difference in the first place.<br><br>The central thinking of Kong Zi is not truth, but Ren (benelovance). You are right in saying that culture is not a right word, most Chinese in the past didn't differentiate between education, politics, culture and religion.<br><br>As for the person who tell you that if you dont respect kong zi as God, you are not a chinese, kindly tell him to F*** off.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by wisefool83:</div><div class="quote_body">Doesn't quite understand your first sentence. Not everyone called Wei Da will be called God, to the PRC, all of their leaders are Wei Da, other than Mao, hardly anyone is a god to them. If you are thinking about historical figures being conferred as deity, then thats a practice that stemmed from Shamanism.<br><br>Its difficult to differentiate culture from religion in a Chinese context. Religion in Chinese is called Jiao, similar meaning to teachings. Among the traditional Chinese religion of Confucianism, Taosim and Buddhism, the two former ones are born in China while the latter is imported from India. Both religions that are born in China started off as philosophical school of thoughts. While most schools have religious aspect such as the Five element schools or Moism, but all these schools seek to become political doctrines, not to explain how people came about or explaining after life. So for a long time in China's history, there's no such thing as an official religion. Right from the start, Chinese were only being discriminated on what you learn, not who/what you pray to.<br><br>The most religious aspect of the Chinese life back then was "Shamanism" which can be traced back to Da Yu of the Xia Dynasty. The common Chinese notion of praying to tree or river or simply just about everything derives from Shamanism. But Shamanism is not a religion, its a culture.<br><br>One of the greatest evidence that Chinese do not have the concept of religion is that up till now, there's still debate on whether Confucianism is a religion or just a school of thought. 2500 years of following the same doctrine and nobody can tell you for sure if its a religion. Things get more complicated when the three religions "merged" together and most Chinese scholars are expected to learn from all three religions' teaching. Most people today can see Chinese praying to something, but couldn't quite really say which religion the practice came from. For example, there's a practice that parents will bring their children to pray Confucius when the exams are near. If one is pray Confucius, one would expect this to be a Confucianism practice, but no, Confucian in this case is known as Wen Chang Jun, which is a Taoism title.<br><br>When Dong Zong Shu of the Han Dynasty proposed to make Confucianism the official "religion", the status of Confucianism became what the westerners call a Civic Religion. The emphasis of a Civic religion is not truth or metaphysic but to shape the mind and thinking of the population in order to govern them. So in Confucianism, there's emphasis on Jun Jun Chen Chen Fu Fu Zi Zi, which basically emphasized the importance of strict hierarchy and following the orders of those above the hierarchy. Confucianism does have traces of religious thoughts such as Tian Ren Gan Ying or Tian Ming (Mandate of Heaven), but the purpose of which is to justify the Imperial family's right to rule and the other people's obligation to obey.<br><br>Since then, the Emperor rule as political entity with religious power, but hardly anyone see him as a Pope like figure. But the Emperor can conferred titles to past away figures and let other people worship him/her. Yue Fei, Liang Hong Yu, Kong Zi and Guan Yu were all historical figures that had been conferred titles by the Emperor and became Deity like figure. But the purpose of conferring these figures were political, they were suppose to be some sort of role models or tools of govenmental propaganda. The Emperors made no denial that these acts were political and not religious act, but they couldn't see the difference in the first place.<br><br>The central thinking of Kong Zi is not truth, but Ren (benelovance). You are right in saying that culture is not a right word, most Chinese in the past didn't differentiate between education, politics, culture and religion.<br><br>As for the person who tell you that if you dont respect kong zi as God, you are not a chinese, kindly tell him to F*** off.</div></blockquote>i always admire you guys' ability to converse your thoughts projectively.<br></div>
