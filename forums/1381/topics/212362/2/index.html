Majority of the N.T. consists of letters or epistles, and that I would not recommend as a place to start. The best book to start is the Gospel according to Matthew - 1st book of the N.T. Never read from the last book [yet], that would confuse you.</div></blockquote>I disagree that one should start with the gospel.<br><br>It is good to follow the chronological order in which they were written. And the gospels were not the earliest to be written.<br><br>Ideally one should start from the Pauline Epistles. Paul wrote about the "good news" without going into the details.<br><br>This generates an interest. So what is this good news about this risen Lord? What were the thoughts and deeds of this Christ Jesus? Why was Paul so fanatical about him?<br><br>To answer this question, we turn to the gospels ..</div>

They were expecting Christ to return pretty soon. Thus no one bothered to write down the Gospels.

Well, at least you have a theory. I suspect some people just read and never think about such issue.</div>
