Furthermore, the term 'physical' here is vague. </strong><br><br>Liberals have been denying the resurrection of the Christ by insisting that ChristÂ’s did not actually rose from the dead physically. Whereas the apostles insist that the Lord Jesus Christ rose physically. It is a major doctrine in Christianity.<br><br>Â“<strong>Furthermore, the term 'physical' here is vague.Â”</strong><br><br>I have already shown that Paul taught that Christ resurrected physically <strong>ACCORDING TO THE OLD TESTAMENT SCRIPTURES.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â“NEVER SAID WHAT KIND OF RESURRECTION? IT SAYS 'RESURRECTION FROM THE DEAD'<br><br>what kind of death did Paul knew the Lord Jesus experienced. Was it a spiritual kind of death? Was He not buried in the tomb? A physical place, a physical sepulchre?<br><br>"and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures,"<br><br>By 'buried' here was Paul referring to the immaterial part of teh Lord Jesus? Do you actually believe that Paul was saying here: and that He was buried spiritually and that He rose again the thrid day according to the Scriptures.<br><br>What "Scipture" is Paul referring here? Obviously he was referring to the Old Testament Scriptures. What did the Old Testament Scriptures say? That He will raise from the dead PHYSCIALLY.Â”</span><br><br>The Old Testament said that Christ would resurrect physically. Then you said in effect that the Old Test. Scriptures has to be examined first if they indeed taught PHYSICAL RESURRECTION. Well here it is, a short one: You agreed that in Acts the resurrection is a physical one. In Acts 2 Peter quoted a resurrection verse showing that the Christ would resurrect physically in Acts 2:24-31. He quoted OT verses [verses 25-28] to support his claim of the physical resurrection [verses 29-31].<br><br>Paul obviously referred to this verse amongst many to support his teaching of a PHYSICAL RESURRECTION  when he said :Â”according to the ScripturesÂ” Paul and Peter were on the same line in their teaching about the resurrection.<br><br><strong>Â”I already clarified, many posts before, that I am not defending my using of the term spiritual. I am sorry to confuse you. </strong>Â“<br><br>No need to apologize my friend. That's why I asked you: Â“What do you mean by SPIRITUAL RESURRECTION OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST?<br><br><strong>Â“the issue has always been whether the resurrection talked about is full of holes or glorified.Â”</strong><br><br>I apologize because i did not get that in your first few statements. Re-read it again:<br><br><strong>Is it any wonder the first books to be written, i.e. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Pauline epistles, never specifically mention about the resurrection of the flesh, the resurrection account?</span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I said resurrection of the flesh</span> .. duh.<br><br>The gospels actually talk about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">physical resurrection</span> whereas the apostle Paul saw the resurrected Christ in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">spiritual</span>.</strong><br><br><strong>The epistles never made clear that it was a physical resurrection. The way Paul described the resurrection (so glorified) doesn't match a physical resurrection.</strong><br><br>I donÂ’t really know what you understand about the resurrection. Seems to me that to you there are two resurrections-Â“holesÂ” version and glorified version.<br><br>It is confusing because the resurrection itself is the glorification of the Lord Jesus Christ. In fact in the doctrine of salvation, our [Christians] glorification is based on His glorification [resurrection from the dead].<br><br>Question: When was the Lord Jesus Christ glorified? When He resurrected from the dead.<br><br>Question: When will the believer be glorified? When the Lord Jesus Christ comes the second time to rapture His own to resurrect them and transform their lowly bodies to conform His.<br><br>You seem to be familiar with Christian doctrine. HavenÂ’t you heard about the 3 aspects of salvation?<br><br><strong>OT, common Jewish folks in 1st century Palestine (exemplied by Lazarus' sister), and Paul (who exemplified the educated rabbi) all thinks it is the glorified version</strong>.<br><br>No problem. The resurrection is the glorification of the Lord Jesus Christ. When He resurrected from the dead on the third day that was His glorification.<br><br>Joh 12:23 But Jesus answered them, saying, "The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified.<br><br>He was talking about His death and subsequent resurrection here. Notice the following verses:<br><br>Joh 12:24 "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain.<br><br>He was the Â“grain of wheatÂ” that  Â“fellÂ” into the ground but when He arose from the dead it will produce much grain. Grain that dies produces much grain according to His parable.<br>What an echo of PaulÂ’s:<br><br>1Co 15:20  But now Christ is risen from the dead, and has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.<br><br>1Co 15:23 But each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those who are Christ's at His coming.<br><br>The Lord Jesus Christ was the prototype [firstfruits] of those who will be resurrected into the likeness of His glorious resurrected body. And all this glory reserved for the Christians are based on His glorification [resurrection].<br><br><strong>It was you who tried to bring the glorified version and the holes version, as accounted by the gospel and acts, together. </strong><br><br>I have studied theology for a long time. I have sat under professors and Bible teachers countless times. I have read books on theology and etc. I have yet to encounter one theologian who teaches that the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ in the gospels [which you call holes version] is not the same with the resurrection in the Pauline epistles [which you call glorified version].<br><br>Why? Because these men understood that the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ in the gospels is His glorification.<br><br>Joh 12:23 But Jesus answered them, saying, "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified</span>.</strong><br><br>Hours after He said this, He was then betrayed, unlawfully arraigned and eventually crucified on the cross only to rise from the dead the third day.<br><br><strong>Then suddenly, you mention that 1 Cor is actually talking about the Second Coming!! What does the Second Coming Resurrection have to do with Gospel Account Resurrection?! </strong><br><br>May I quote you again so that you can see why I answered you this way:<br><br><strong>And what happens next is the famous story of Lazarus.<br><br>So Lazarus did rise .. only to die later!<br><br>This is the Jewish understanding of resurrection - it should happen on the last day. And the bodies should be glorified, definitely not with holes.<br>Which is why Ben's theory is good .. they were expecting Jesus to come soon 'cos His resurrection signifies that the end is near</strong><br><br>My answer to this is:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">1Co 15:20 But now Christ is risen from the dead, and has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.<br><br>the word 'firstfruits' have some idea of prototype there. The text is saying: Jesus' resurrection from the dead is a prototype of those who would be resurrected later in the Second Coming of Christ.<br><br>Since the Lord Jesus' resurrection is physical, it follows that the believers in Him would be resurrected physically also. Becauze the resurrection of the just is according to the prototype--the Lord Jesus'- which is a physical resurrection.</span><br><br>by the way about the resurrection of the of the saved and the Second Coming, here it is:<br><br>1Co 15:21 For since by man came death, by Man also came the resurrection of the dead.<br><br>then verse 23 says:<br><br>1Co 15:23 But each one in his own order: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Christ the firstfruits, afterward those who are Christ's at His coming</span>.</strong><br><strong>And what happens next is the famous story of Lazarus.<br><br>So Lazarus did rise .. only to die later! </strong><br><br>His resurrection was not the glorification aspect of salvation. He did not possess the incorruptible body promised at glorification. [you know a lot of Christian doctrinesÂ…for sure you know these things].<br><br><strong>This is the Jewish understanding of resurrection - it should happen on the last day. And the bodies should be glorified, definitely not with holes. </strong><br><br>Yes, they did not also understood that there are two resurrections. The resurrection of the saved and the resurrection of the unsaved. I mean they do not know that it will be intervened by 1000 years. Oh yes, glorified bodies of saved persons will be perfected and glorious. Â“No holesÂ” The Lord JesusÂ’ glorified body with the pierced side and etc. is peculiar to Him. You see when saved people get glorified [resurrected] they will not actually possess a body exactly like that of the Lord Jesus. I mean their faces would still be their faces not the Lord JesusÂ’. Their hands would still be their hands not the Lord JesusÂ’ and etc.<br><br>What glorification means for the believer is that they will possess a body LIKE that of the Lord Jesus---INCORRUPTIBLE, IMMORTAL and PERFECTED.<br><br><strong>I dunno whether the humble pie is in your mouth now or not. Or have you swallowed it without telling us?</strong><br><br>What has the humble pie got to do with our topic my friend? Are you the type of guy that involves his ego and pride when talking to someone in the internet? A certain someone whom you have not seen personally and will probably not met in your life, a certain someone whom you do not know his name?  Are you like that? If not, then why ask this question?<br><br>Is this conversation of ours a matter of winning and losing to you my friend? Or is it just a simple exchange of ideas on the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTERNET</span></strong>? If no. then why the humble pie question?<br></div>

You asked for proof from <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="large">Paul's earliest letters</span></span></strong> that Paul was indeed talking about a physical resurrection. What about I show you from Paul that he was talking about a PHYSICAL RESURRECTION SIMILLAR TO THAT OF THE GOSPELS, SIMILAR TO THAT OF PETER IN ACTS.<br><br>IN ACTS CHAPTER 13: 31 TO 38 PAUL WAS TALKING ABOUT THE RESURRECTION OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. HE CITED <strong>PSALMS 16</strong> TO PROVE THAT THE SCRIPTURES [OT] SPOKE OF THIS. <strong>PSALMS 16 </strong>THE SAME PSALM PETER QUOTED TO PROVE THAT THE CHRIST WOULD RESURRECT <strong>PHYSICALLY </strong>IN ACTS 2.<br><br>Paul and Peter used the same Scripture to show that the Christ would resurrect. Peter interpreted Pslams 16 as a <strong>physical </strong>resurrection to which you agree because you said ACts spoke of a physical resurrection.<br><br>And remember ACTS 13 is after the Damascus conversion of Paul when he saw the the risen Lord. Did Paul and Peter talked on the same lines about the resurrection? Yes. compare Acts 2 and Acts 13.<br><br><strong><br><br>I say this again - there is NO evidence that the Jesus Christ of Paul is the Jesus Christ as portrayed in the gospels and Acts.</strong><br><br>refer above.<br><br><strong> You ignored the problematic verse in Cor where Paul claimed to see the same Christ that appeared to Cephas and the other apostles.</strong><br><br>There is no problem to that verse with regards to the resurrection of tbe Lord Jesus Christ. I don't know why it should be a problem.<br><br><strong>I want to distance myself from doctrines and re-examine Scripture from an analytical point of view.</strong><br><br>that's all fine. But can i givd an unsolicited advice. You can never get to the bottom of the Scriptures without the illumination of the Holy Spirit. Why not repent first and trust in Christ alone for salvation before you can understand His book by the help of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>1Co 2:13 And these are the things which we say, not in the language of man's wisdom, but in words given to us by the Spirit, judging the things of the spirit by the help of the Spirit.<br><br>14 For the natural man is not able to take in the things of the Spirit of God: for they seem foolish to him, and he is not able to have knowledge of them, because such knowledge comes only through the Spirit.<br><br><strong>You trying to kid who? A glorified body with holes?</strong><br><br>His resurrection was His glorification. Try reading this text from an analytical point of view:<br><br>Joh 12:23 But Jesus answered them, saying, "The hour has come that the Son of Man should be <strong>glorified.</strong><br><br>He was talking about His death and subsequent RESURRECTION PHYSICALLY.<br><br><strong>Do you read books by Bishop Spong? Marcus Borg? John Dominic Crossan?</strong><br><strong>These are professors in famous universities and Spong is in charge of a big parish as well.</strong><br><br>I don't know those names sorry. Are they liberals? If they are, i will not be surprised why you have that stand.<br><br><strong><br>Why are you so defensive now?</strong><br><br>I actually asking questions. Here read it again:<br><br>What has the humble pie got to do with our topic my friend? Are you the type of guy that involves his ego and pride when talking to someone in the internet? A certain someone whom you have not seen personally and will probably not met in your life, a certain someone whom you do not know his name?  Are you like that? If not, then why ask this question?<br><br><strong>I'm quite disappointed with your reply. After a million lines, I still do not see any historical or textual analysis in your reply.</strong><br><br>The word of God is enough:<br><br>Joh 12:23 But Jesus answered them, saying, "The hour has come that the Son of Man should be <strong>glorified</strong>.<br><br>We do not need high interpretive skills in understanding that.<br><br></div>

If Paul claimed to see Christ like the few hundreds people and the apostles, and we KNOW from existing documents that Paul only saw some sort of light, then this cast strong doubts on what everyone actually saw.<br><br>In an historical analysis, what is written earlier has precedence over later works. So perhaps what everyone saw was some kind of light, some sort of spirit, a glorified body of Christ (without holes)?<br><br>Even if you disagree with this theory, the very statement from Paul has invalidated itself as evidence that Paul was supporting the gospel/acts version of the resurrection.<br><br><blockquote>Joh 12:23 But Jesus answered them, saying, "The hour has come that the Son of Man should be <strong>glorified.</strong><br><br>He was talking about His death and subsequent RESURRECTION PHYSICALLY. </blockquote>Correction - from an analytical pov, this was what the author said of Jesus, after few decades from the actual event.

            <div class='col-md body'>I never read past leviticus cos it's boring.. i tried and gaveup for probably 5-6 times...<br><br>finally i was told by my pastor to listen to the word more often as faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God. then i follow his teaching and move on to read the 4 gospel and see how good was Jesus, his love and watch passion of christ(VCD). believe in his finished work and this is the Key to unlock the whole bible. Then continue from romans to Jude. in this you will find words like "those who are in christs" or "In christ". it's refering to us christians.<br><br>Then bring this key along back to old testiments and you'll find many thing are unlocked. e.g story of Joseph is a picture of Jesus. Melchizedek king of salem is aslo a picture of Jesus.<br><br>next there's bible prophecy.( we can only comfirm after it have happened not to do fortune telling <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>Isaiah 59:19 " So shall they fear The name of the LORD from the west, And His glory from the rising of the sun (south east asia); When the enemy(devil) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">comes in </span>like a flood, The Spirit of the LORD will lift up a standard against him. A directional flood- come in-, not rise up like rain flood. ---&gt; refer to asia Tsunami.<br><br>Luke 21: 10-11 "Then He said to them, Â“Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.[world war 1 &amp; 2] And there will be great earthquakes in various places, and famines and pestilences"[bird flu, mad cow etc.]<br>there's always good news after those verses. so christian rejoice.<br><br>finally , proverbs. it's a daily reading. it have 31 chapter. so i read the chapter for the day (eg 05 oct - proverbs 5.) many of the things help me in my life in making decision.<br><br>conclusion, read the bible to find Jesus and may your eyes be opened. There's a lot of interesting and humorous (esther) story in the bible. if you are interested you can ask me where. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
