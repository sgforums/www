May i understand better how is it related to asian tsunami or even krakatoa ?<br><br>"Like a flood" doesnt need to literally mean a flood.<br><br>If you say that it is a prophecy of a flood - then it does matter whether who is actually quoting out of context.  If not it sounded like a false prophet last time, when he says that singapore will be taken by a big earthquake....which didnt happen at the time of indication. Can the false prophet then say - oh, not this time.....later will come ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no, it's more to say that the devil can come in like a flood. but come to think of it , why west will fear the Lord? and glory to the rising of the sun (east) ??<br><br>Luke 21:25-26:<br>also have saying about end times. waves and the sea roaring. more earth quick.
