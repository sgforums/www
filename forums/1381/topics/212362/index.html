            <div class='col-md body'>one of the ways to learn about God is to read the bible, but to me the bible is kinda the most untouchable book around the house. sorry about that.  i really would like to try to read the bible but its really rather dry and boring. to make it worse, the print is so fine that it makes reading it a chore. im not trying to flame anything but seriously, how do you christians read the bible? can anyone tell me how to get interested in the bible. people have told me to start reading from the new testament onwards but my interest starts to wane away once i get started and i end up throwing the bible to one side and not touching it for months.</div>

I recommend Chuck Missler, I read one of his books which you can borrow in the national library. I think it was Bible in 24 hours or something? Excellent book, taught me quite a few things.<br><br>Once you get the big picture, you know what to look out for and reading the bible becomes much easier.<br><br>Furthermore, reading a guide trains you to check the Scripture (like the brevans (sp?)). Whatever was said or quoted, double check with your bible. Take note of how the author explains certain verses.<br><br>My 0.000000002 cents.</div>

I would usually started with the first few chapters, then got dozed off.<br><br>Anyway, it would be a good start if you first treat it as a story book (or a compilation of many stories).<br><br>Personally, I would advise you to avoid Bibles with fine prints... Indeed it will be strenuous and causes drowsiness.<br><br>New Testament - I wonder if your friends tell you specifically which part of the New Testament you should start. Majority of the N.T. consists of letters or epistles, and that I would not recommend as a place to start. The best book to start is the Gospel according to Matthew - 1st book of the N.T. Never read from the last book [yet], that would confuse you.</div>
