Tao is Universal. Taoism seeks to use its teachings to bring forth the innate goodness in every individual and believes that every person is capable of attaining unity with Tao through self-cultivation. The main text that edifies the enlightenment of TAO is Tao Te Ching (Dao De Jing).<br><br>Taoism honoured Lao Zi as the Venerable Lord (Tai Shang Lao Jun), Supreme Patriarch of Taoism, Celestial Lord of Virtue, one of the Three Pure Ones. The Tao as expounded by Lao Zi is the most fundamental concept, what occupies by the place of the sacred in their very centre.<br><br>The Taoist has dedicated Lao Zi's birthday, 15th day of the 2nd Lunar Month to offer homage. All Taoist temples conduct prayers to mark respect to the Supreme Patriarch of Taoism and confer this day as the Taoist Day.<br><br>What is Taoism?<br>Taoism is about learning, cultivation and practice, that is, learning about the ways of the Tao, self-cultivation to achieve Tao and practising the teachings of Taoism. Its origins could be traced back to the time of the Yellow Emperor (Huang Di), thereafter it was promoted by the philosophical writing of Lao Zi, and finally organised as a formal religion by Zhang Dao Ling, the religion's Celestial Master.<br><br>Taoism is the only indigenous religion of China. It embodies forms of Chinese beliefs and traditions practiced from the early days of Chinese civilization. Thus, as the great Chinese writer Lu Xun put it, " The root of the Chinese people is Taoism."<br><br>The Basic Tenets of Taoism<br>The essential message of Taoism is that the Universe is governed by a set of natural and unalterable laws, which manifest themselves as a flow of continuous change. This natural order and flow is referred to as the Tao. By recognising and aligning ourselves with these laws, we can attain a state of being and achieve harmony with the salutary forces inherent in the cosmos - the transcendent Tao.<br><br>Taoism's main precepts are " loyalty " and " filial piety ". In practice, it calls on its faithful to " respect heaven, honour ancestors, and be compassionate to man and all things under heaven ". In promoting the learning and cultivation of Tao, it adheres to the principles of liberty, equality and peace. Personal cultivation in Taoism has two aspects to it: Inner and Outer. The Inner stresses a state of truth to and authenticity within one's self. The Outer requires one to be loyal, filial, benevolent and thrifty, all with the purpose of improving oneself and helping others. There is, however, no clear dividing line between the Inner and the Outer.<br><br>Worship<br>Taoism is polytheistic. Taoists worship Shen, Xian and Sheng. They may be translated into the approximate English terms of gods, immortals and saints. The deities belong to three realm: Wu ji or the Limitless Realm, Tai ji or the Great Realm and Xian Shi or the Terrestrial Realm. Taoists usually perform worship in their own household or in the temple.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Taoism in Singapore<br>According to historical records, Taoism the religion indigenous to China, has traces of presence in Singapore as early as 1796. The " Shuntian Gong" (Temple of Submission to Heaven) dedicated to the Earth Deity, Dabogong was then built at Malabar Street. Since then the number of Taoist temples has increased rapidly and gradually Taoism became the main religion among the Chinese in Singapore. With the slow growth and progress of Taoism, Taoist associations were set up to propagated teachings of Taoism.<br><br>In the early 1990s, Singapore saw a new " way" in Taoism when the younger Taoist devotees became actively involved in promoting and glorifying the religion and Taoist spirit. Today, Singaporeans have warmly accepted proper teachings and practices of Taoism, the religion culture and philosophy. Taoist has carried out many activities in social services to elderly, orphanage, interaction camps for youth, education and book fairs, forums, scripture and philosophy classes.<br><br>Apart from its circle of communication among local temples and associations, Taoists in Singapore have wholeheartedly established good relations and friendship with other religions and ethnic groups. Being in a multi racial, multi cultural and multi religious country, Taoism takes on its role earnestly to secure UNITY in the community. Taoist groups also attended religious seminars and rituals in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Malaysia.<br><br>Taoist Day, the grand event organised since 1996 has received seven consecutive years of heartwarming interest and overwhelming support from local as well as overseas participants. The Celebration commemorates the birthday of Laozi, the 15th day of the second lunar month of the year. The Celebration is to instill and promote better understanding of Taoism among the Taoist devotees and Singaporeans at large.<br><br>The 5th Singapore Taoist Day Celebration held on 17 March 2000 was honoured by His Excellency S.R. Nathan, President of The Republic of Singapore who officiated the Grand Opening Ceremony. The recent 7th Singapore Taoist Day Celebration 2002 delivered two vital undertakings for our Taoists. They are:<br><br>The Taoist Identity<br>The Taoist Day Resolution for 2002 - Uphold peace and live harmonious amongst man.<br><br>Festivals<br>Taoists celebrate a large number of festivals. Some festivals are commonly known such as the Lunar New Year, Dragon Boat Festival and Hungry Ghost Festival. Others such as the birthdays of the different Deities largely involve the local community and devotees to that particular Deity.<br><br>15th of 2nd lunar month - Taoist Day - birthday of Laozi (Taishang Laojun) is for every Taoist to celebrate.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would tend to disagree that the Lunar New Year came from Taoist. If the myths and legends are true, the Monster "Nian", the fire-crackers, the red packets, have nothing to do with Taoism.<br><br>It seems that the Taoist try to associate themselves with Lunar New Year. Thats why you see people trying to go to the temple of the eve, and trying to be the first to place the joss-stick in the joss-stick stand.</div>
