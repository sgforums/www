            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hinduism</span> is divided on the issue of JesusÂ—some hold that it is unlikely he existed, or that he was just a man, others say he was a great guru or yogi, still others equate Jesus with an avatar. A great deal of earlier inclusion of Jesus within the Hindu pantheon is connected to the emergence of the Saint Thomas Christians. The Hare Krishna sect of Hinduism believes that Jesus is the son of Krishna (who they believe is God the Father that Jesus spoke of), and they accept many of his teachings.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Atheists</span>, by definition, do not believe in a divinityÂ—and thus not in any divinity of Jesus. Some just do not think about it, some doubt he lived, some regard him as an important moral teacher, and some as a historical preacher like any other.<br><br>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith </span>considers Jesus to be a manifestation (prophet) of God, while not being God incarnate. Some <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Buddhists </span>believe Jesus may have been a Bodhisattva, one who gives up his own Nirvana to help others reach theirs.<br><br>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">New Age movement </span>has reinterpreted the life and teaching of Jesus in a large variety of ways (For example, see A Course in Miracles). He has also been claimed as an Ascended Master by Theosophy and some of its offshoots; related speculations have him studying mysticism in the Himalaya or hermeticism in Egypt in the period between his childhood and his public career. A Zen Buddhist interpretation of Jesus, based on the Gospel of Thomas, is also possible. The Multidinarian Doctrine teaches that Jesus is not one of three Persons in God (as taught by Trinitarian Doctrine), but one of a hundred trillion Persons in God. The discipline of Christology discusses who Jesus was or was not from a philosophical and theological perspective. The Christological argument attempts to prove the existence of God based on the existence of Jesus and his claims about himself as presented in the gospels.<br><br>The question of the divinity of Jesus was discussed and decided on by Ecumenical Councils, starting with the Council of Nicea and others of Constantine I's attempts at producing unity, enforcement of the resulting decision thus suggesting an air of politicisation to the religious issue. It is not the case that all scholars reject Jesus' divinity, yet some may choose to describe the social and cultural implications of claiming divinity in the 1st century. As such, scholars are interested in providing an historical context to the beliefs and tenets of Jesus' apparent Kingdom of God movement. As a consequence, some secular scholars believe he was simply a Jewish apocalyptic teacher and faith healer who was crucified, and was subsequently the inspiration for Christianity.<br></div>
