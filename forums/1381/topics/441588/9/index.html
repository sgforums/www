              <p>1. Can you highlight to me which thinga about Christianity and God that you are not 100% about? Cos it seems that all throughout our convo, you were always right? I need to know which issues about Christianity and God you arenot 100% sure about? Thanks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Yes if you give me a different method from what the other camps of christians, I will believe you. Because up to now, you keep telling me your interpretation about "certain" issues is correct by praying, reading scripture and articles. But thats what other christians do too, to COUNTER YOUR interpretations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. "<span style="font-size: 15px;"> </span><span style="font-size: 15px;">It is much better and to be preferred that people read the Bible for themselves and diligently study it, debate over it, and mature in their understanding of the Bible over time than to check their brains at the door and blindly accept that someone has the right interpretation and just accept it as it is."</span></p>
              <p>yea and another christian who counters your interpetation will also say to you "<span style="font-size: 15px;"> </span><span style="font-size: 15px;">It is much better and to be preferred that people read the Bible for themselves and diligently study it, debate over it, and mature in their understanding of the Bible over time than to check their brains at the door and blindly accept that someone has the right interpretation and just accept it as it is."</span></p>

              <p>1. If you have the perception that I am always right, perhaps you should reflect on whether it is your views that are always wrong. I don't claim to be infallible. I was wrong to believe in an old earth many years ago. It is clumsy for me to list down to you one by one what I am sure about and what I am tentative about. And what purpose does it serve anyway? So that you can go down the list and I have to defend every one of them? Like that I very boh eng right, always being on the defense?</p>
              <p>2. Again you FAILED to provide a post where I said an interpretation can be proved correct by prayer. An interpretation must be argued for, demonstrating a rigorous process of exegesis. There is no shortcut. Even if I read articles, that article is based on someone else's hardwork.</p>
              <p>3. You are looking for shortcuts. Don't be lazy. Like I said, if I tell you I have the correct interpretation, will you buy it? No. Why? Because you also want to use your own brain to evaluate what I say. At the end of the day, each believer has to make up his own mind and follow where the best arguments go with a clear conscience. Again I can think of no better way, and neither can you. But you would rather take the easy way out and say "All wrong lah! The correct view is that all is wrong lah!" But this still begs the question, how you know you are right in your view that all is wrong? Or you also don't know? And if you don't know, then why find fault?</p>

How about if another person say that it means Tcmc is a dog and insist he is right? Is he also really right? Can we therefore say that there is no way to know what I meant by that statement?

              <p>1. No. Cos I was from a tongue speaking church and they told me its from the Holy Spirit, the gibberish kind. So I wonder if all christians believe that ? Please advise. Thanks.</p>
              <p>2. Interpreting for ourselves is no problem. but it becomes amusing when a group of people claims theres an constant, unchanging god who talks to them but all of them in the group come up with different interpretations, apparently guided by the same god.</p>
              <p>3. LOL. Yes and the other christian in the other camp will show you what the author intended and you in this camp will show him what the author intended. Seriously, you guys interpret very differently!</p>

              <p>1. I already answered you, tongues are a gift from the Holy Spirit. The issue with charismatic churches today stems from the practice of it. Read 1 Cor 12-14 and you will see how tongues should be exercised. But then again, you will have an interpretation issue ya? LOL!</p>
              <p>2. Strawman argument again. No Christian I know says that God is telling them audibly or through a trance or vision concerning what a passage means. There is no short cut to be an approved student of the Word of God.</p>
              <p>3. Yes, we do interpret differently, that's why there is always room for healthy debate, but not demonising those who disagree with us over matters that are peripheral and not essential. Of course people like you who lack maturity cannot handle debate over differing Bible interpretation.</p>

              <p>1. So are you saying the modern day charismatic churches are not doing the "real tongues"? 1 Cor 12? Read IN CONTEXT FRIEND! Paul was only speaking to the church then!!! What happen to your in context???? Or you choose again???? Buffet ah?</p>
              <p>2. Ya many trained pastors and "approved students of the word of god" would disagree wiith you too about 1 Cor 12!</p>
              <p>3. Yea I agree you shouldnt demonise or say the other camp is wrong just because your interpretation is different! For e.g Mormons interpret jesus to be not God. So you should not say they are wrong! Just live and let live!</p>

According to the charasmatic, their tongues is Holy Spirit inspired! And that 1 Cor 12 is to be applicable for the Corinth church only! So according to them, you are actually setting up yourself against the HS.</p>
              <p>I mean, according to them. What do you say? Cos this is what my charasmatic friend told me.</p>

              <p>1. Hmm clearly you have failed to look at the charasmatic christian's perspective! You always fail in looking at other's perspectives. According to the charasmatic, their tongues is Holy Spirit inspired! And that 1 Cor 12 is to be applicable for the Corinth church only! So according to them, you are actually setting up yourself against the HS.</p>
              <p>I mean, according to them. What do you say? Cos this is what my charasmatic friend told me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. SOrry I know about Mormons maybe more than you and that is why I do not demonise them or border on demonising them.</p>
              <p>People only demonise others when they are ignorant!</p>

              <p>1. You failed to look at my perspective. Anyway you are clearly trolling here. Now you are arguing that nothing in the Bible is applicable today because it was all written in the first century. But why should you, an apostate who has no proper foundation in Bible study, be the judge of what the Scripture says? You show me one reputed Bible teacher who agree with you. Just one. I am not interested in your imaginary Christian friend. More likely you are just invoking people so that you can say it's not you say one. The usual hiding behind somebody tactic.</p>
              <p>2. Now I now why you demonise me. LOL! Anyway, the Mormons have been classed as cults because their doctrines DEVIATE from orthodox creeds. Not only that, the claims of Mormonism's founders have been tested and found wanting. I suppose you did not know that.</p>

              <p>1. But I am NOT against speaking in tongues. I made that clear. Which part you did not understand?</p>
              <p>2. Prostitution is legalised too. So am I being seditious to say that it is immoral? Think before you talk about the law. If something is legal then it only means the law of the country does not forbid it. It is just the legal status of the religion, not a truth declaration.</p>
              <p>3. Let me remind you that the law is not so frivolously invoked like the way you do it. The founder of the Mormon church said that all denominations are corrupt (bet you didn't know that), are you offended on my behalf?</p>
              <p>4. As for your stand, it is clear to me and some others that you are merely trying to engage in Bible bashing on the PRETENSE that you are seeking to understand.</p>

              <p>1. Wah can vomit blood! Which part of "not practising the use of tongues as taught in 1 Cor 12-14" do you not understand? How do the charismatic church you went to go about exercising their tongues. Everyone speak at the same time and hardly anyone interpret ya? Now tell me how did Paul teach it should be like in a church meeting.</p>
              <p>2. Please lah, don't try to frivously invoke the law and indict people. As a Christian I am also tolerant of Mormons whose founder says that all Christian denominations are corrupt. Are Mormons then guilty of breaking the law already? Of course you won't dare to say because you have zero knowledge of Mormonism. You do of course, have many "friends" who tell you this and tell you that. Machiam everything also got someone tell you one!</p>
