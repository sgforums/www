              <p>And so just because i have choosen not to think and so i am
              labelled? However what gives you the right to start labelling
              others as thinkers/non thinkers? The truth is still the same in
              that you have authorised yourself over others and authorised
              yourself to label others to be way below you just because ppl
              have not pondered over things you have pondered or i
              should say "things you feel ought to be
              pondered'. </p>
              <p>Anyway from all your posts and interactions, even if i explain
              myself you wouldn't have accepted it anyway. i do not hold god in
              that almighty position you hold and i do not believe he has all the
              answers. Explaining/answering to you will only result in you
              putting down more of my beliefs. </p>

              You stuck the free-thinker label on yourself, I am merely saying that in terms of label the non-thinker is a better fit. I no more authorised myself anymore than you authorise yourself to be a judge over me. In an exchange of views and arguments you should expect your views to be subjected to critical thinking and scrutiny. The same goes for mine. If the theist has the better argument just concede that instead of going for character assassination accusing your opponent of arrogance. It only ends up being a clash of personalities instead of debating beliefs and ideas.

              <p>Fact is, atheists think that EVERY religious person is deluded, not just the Christian. Why else would "The God Delusion" becomes a best seller for weeks?</p>
              <p>But in what way have I not been making sense? I only think I have the upper hand in the sense that my arguments for theism are better than the atheist's arguments for atheism. My debates with atheists is my way of "knocking sense" into them to reject atheism.</p>
              <p>BTW, I never said non-thinkers will go to hell. And it's not the fault of Christians who think that nonbelievers will burn in hell if they continue their rejection of God's offer of salvation. <strong>That's what the Bible teaches. That's what Jesus taught</strong>. But if you choose to strengthen your resolve to go to hell, then you can't blame me or anyone or God if you get what you want eventually.</p>
              <p>Or perhaps you might prefer to meet some Christians who believe in universalism? They believe that EVERYONE will go to heaven because God is so loving.</p>

              So you are dismissing it because it is a Christian source? That would be to commit the genetic fallacy. Badzmaro is right, there is a lack of critical thinking skills, on the part of atheists! How about I also disregard all your sources because you are using non-Chrustian or secular sources to attack Christianity? You OK with that?

              <p>its no wonder everyone calls you deluded. Knocking sense into you is just a waste of time. You may continue to think you have the upper hand. All non thinkers non believers like me will burn in hell. Is ok. You’ve enlightened me alot about who christians are really are and you’ve strengthen my resolve to, in your terms, go to hell.</p>
