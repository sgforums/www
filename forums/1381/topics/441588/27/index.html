              <p>from his replies I already know he takes things personally, despite him saying he doesn't.</p>
              <p>Because his replies are all too belligerent and strongly-worded to not have been written under influence of his emotions of not being taken seriously by atheists and agnostics.</p>
              <p>To give a good analogy, imagine all religions are products. And all believers of the religion are salesmen for their product. He has already agreed to buy and stick with his product, Christianity. Nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with believing that one's product one endorses is the best. But a line SHOULD be drawn when it comes to taking non-believers' opinions as insults and personal attacks; how is one going to sell one's product if one is so rude and insults (the intelligence of, etc) the users/believers of other products?</p>
              <p>Not all products are wholly good or bad. But BIC insists that his product is 100% good and accurate. Christianity is not all good. It is not all bad either. Its basic principles like "love thy neighbour as thyself" etc is GOOD. But not the ENTIRE bible can be taken seriously.</p>
              <p>Me personally? I'd prefer to sample each and every product, find out the benefits, pros and cons, and settle for those few that I think suits me.</p>
              <p>Now who is more open-minded and logical?</p>

              <p>INTELLECTUAL LAZINESS??!</p>
              <p>It IS impossible to know the truth. But that doesn't mean I am intellectually-lazy. Tbh, a lot of Christians do not like it when science is used to disprove the existence of god, or if science is used to prove that religiousness is purely a mental construct that has no real basis of truth.</p>
              <p>But science is what makes the world go round. You and I and everyone else lives with science. We have computers, laptops etc thanks to science.</p>
              <p>If science disproves the existence of god and proves that religiousness is purely a mental construct, why don't you believe it?</p>
              <p>No. I do not need to explain why I think the gods of each and every religion is the same. I don't belief that, because I have no proof. I will not believe in something that has no proof. I was merely stating that it is food for thought, it COULD BE a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">possibility</span>.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Let me ask you, is it true that it is impossible to know the truth? Answer yes and you have just rendered your earlier declaration false.</p>
              <p>What I don't like is atheists abusing science to say that it can prove the non-existence of God, or that it can prove things beyond its domain. Those who say that science can do that are ignorant of science, so why should I believe them?</p>
              <p>You failed to make the distinction between operational science (which makes the world goes round) and historical science (which tries to explain past events).</p>
              <p>Well, since you do not believe that all gods in all religions are reduced to being the same thing, then no need to dwell further on this. There's no end to entertaining possibilities, so better to focus on the more probable and plausible.</p>

              <p>Truth is, adults can also be just as gullible. Kids may well be more sensible at times. Most of them when asked will not believe that the universe popped itself into existence from nothing.</p>
              <p>Your refusal to believe the Bible you read does not say or prove anything about the Bible, because there are people who do not come to your conclusion of the matter.</p>
              <p>Are top scientists atheists and agnostics? One thing needs to be said, "SO WHAT?" BTW, there are many scientists who aren't atheists or agnostics. But this doesn't prove anything too. The existence of God is not determined by any field of science or scientists.</p>

              <p>What I don't like is atheists abusing science to say that it can prove the non-existence of God, or that it can prove things beyond its domain. Those who say that science can do that are ignorant of science, so why should I believe them?</p>

              <p>Well, since you do not believe that all gods in all religions are reduced to being the same thing, then no need to dwell further on this. There's no end to entertaining possibilities, so better to focus on the more probable and plausible.</p>

They say NO because they KNOW from experience that effects have causes, even if you can't see the causes. But yet atheists believe that nothing caused the universe to exist.

              <p>When I say it is "impossible to know the truth", I mean for this case. The bible is not concrete proof of the existence of god.</p>
              <p>Courtesy of wikipedia:</p>
              <p><strong>Agnosticism</strong> is the view that the <a title="Truth value" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Truth_value"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">truth values</span></span></a> of certain claims—especially claims about the existence or non-existence of any <a title="Deity" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Deity"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">deity</span></span></a>, but also other religious and <a title="Metaphysics" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Metaphysics"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">metaphysical</span></span></a> claims—are unknown or unknowable.</p>
              <p>Agnosticism is not atheism under disguise. It simply refers to not believing in a True God (christian, buddhist etc), whilst entertaining the possibility of having a Divine Creator of the Universe. Atheism is the view that there is NO GOD, NO DIVINE CREATOR. I admit I am an agnostic with an inclination towards atheism.</p>
              <p>The same can be said of the other party. Your strongly-worded belligerent replies are akin to you calling us atheists and agnostics idiots.</p>
              <p>I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">know</span> there is a difference between operational &amp; historic science. I am not that dumb.</p>
              <p>Wait - are you telling me you don't believe in evolution? The survival of the fittest? Adaptation? @.@</p>
              <p>So you mean modern elephants just pop out into existence because god created them? And that they are not descendants of woolly mammoths and mastodons? If that is so, why would god create woolly mammoths and mastodons and not just create our modern elephants? Saves him hassle.</p>
              <p>Do you really not believe in evolution?</p>

              <p>Tcmc, atheists like Dawkins write books like "The God Delusion" and want people to think that EVERYONE should think it makes sense. Makes sense?</p>
              <p>I also can't see how apes turning into man makes more sense than fairy tales like frogs turning into princes. Aren't they the same?</p>

              <p>Going in circles again.</p>
              <p>i have previously shown you how christians also disagree on the main essentials of faith (E.g person of jesus, nature of resurrection, person and gifts of the holy spirit).</p>
              <p>I have also shown you how the different beliefs christians have can affect "salvation". E.g christian A derives from bible that jesus is only man and a sin to worship him as god and christian B derives from the bible that jesus is god and is a sin not to worship him as god.</p>
              <p>So if the beliefs affect salvation, then which christian must nonchristians listen to? Moreover all christians derive their beliefs from the bible.</p>
              <p>I have discussed this with you before but you seem to be remembering selectively.</p>
              <p>I have also mentioned to you that if different christians say that "god" tells them different things about the same issue, then there are two possibilities -</p>
              <p>a) God tells different christians diff things (E.g god tells christian A tongues is a gift and tells christian B tongues is demonic)</p>
              <p>b) God is not there and christians interprete different beliefs differently.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Remember?</p>
              <p>So christians believing in different things is a topic worth discussing and highlighting because it tells us if what "god" says is consistent or whether he's really there</p>
