              <p>Good work there. As an ex-christian myself, I agree with
              you.</p>

              <p>I was so into the whole bible and religion thing in the past. It
              took a lot of courage and curiosity to start questioning the
              reliability and accuracy of the bible.</p>

              <p>Reasons why many exchristians left christianity -</p>
              <p>1. Errors and inconsistencies in the bible</p>

              <p>3. Behaviour of some christians that just is not in line with what they preach</p>

              <p>Everyone defines it differently.</p>
              <p>Some people say it is to be with family and friends and to do what they like to do. THat is lasting happiness for them.</p>
              <p>Some people say it's their religion which brings them lasting happiness.</p>
              <p>Some people say it is their career, money and life's satisfaction that bring them lasting happiness.</p>
              <p>Some people say doing volunteer work brings them lasting happiness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BIC, it really depends. The world is not just black and white. There are many different kinds of people and many different kinds of things that make people happy.</p>
              <p>What makes you happy might not make others happy.</p>
              <p>Similarly, what makes ME happy might not make you happy too!</p>

              <p>My point exactly! But then you said "everyone defines it differently"???</p>
              <p>Point is, life is short, full of ups and downs, death and sorrow. Seeking "lasting happiness" in this life is IMO not a good philosophy of living. If you find someone who is always happy every moment of his life, I think that would be a real mental case, seriously. Is the meaning of life to be just happy? I think we need to ask what philosophers have been asking all along, just what is the purpose and meaning of life?</p>

              <p>Demon Bane,</p>
              <p>Again, if people can define happiness in their own way, what you call foolishness for one person can be his "lasting happiness", isn't it? The point I am making is that the pursuit of "lasting happiness" is NOT a good criteria for making it one's goal in this short life we have.</p>
