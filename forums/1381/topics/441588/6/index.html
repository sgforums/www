              <p>Yea I agree.</p>
              <p>But everytime we ask a question about the bible (might be
              offending, but still many are sincere questions), you guys think we
              are bashing or that we are trolling. Then how can there be true
              engagement?</p>
              <p>Only when you have given us answers OR say that you don't know,
              then at that point, we can agree to disagree.</p>
              <p>But sometimes you guys dont even wanna give answers and just
              divert attention by saying that we are trolling or bashing</p>

              <p>You have to realise that there are different denominations in Christianity itself. The answers we give will be different. Our understanding may be different. That is why this forum was to discuss the differences and share. There will be trolls and non-trolls. The key is to know WHICH are the trolls and WHICH are not.</p>
              <p>If we can give u your answer... then the world would have had all the answers to everything.</p>
              <p>We learn we experience. Life is all about learning. You can say u learn with your books with knowledge, there are Christians who learn by trying to attain the spirituality of it.</p>
              <p>Look at the history of Eternal Hope. You cannot pin all the blame saying that people caling whoever trolls. There are trolls. Christian and non-christian alike. That is fact. And refusal to accept there are non-Christian trolls is like saying all of you guys are right. Which I have proved again and again that no. Ther are non-christian trolls. And I have shown you who the trolls are. It is up to you to decide the who is who.</p>
              <p>In case u didnt get my memo. Let me cut n paste it for you.</p>

              <p>Well let me give u a glimpse of yourself. One thing about
                                      sgforums is.. the history remains forever… at least on the net.</p>
              <p>2003</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="../../../users/56055">laurence82</a><span>         </span> 17-Jab 2004</p>
              <p>In my secondary, I had a gal friend who is a passionate
                                      christian, and she did once made me sit down in the canteen, and
                                      reading with her on The Daily Bread. Well, after that I told her I
                                      am not prepared to accept Christ in my life, but she was
                                      understanding, and we still remain friends.<br> <br> In my JC, I had a gal friend who is passionate about Christianity,
                                      for her Jesus is everything, but we still get along, altho her
                                      passion scares other Christians away. So left me one guy only talk
                                      with her.<br> <br> For me, aiyah, passionate or not, it doesnt matter, as long as they
                                      not overbearing, like keep pestering or even saying wrong things
                                      during an emergency like the above, just make sure dont be so
                                      overbearing and in the end piss people off. But at same time,
                                      everyone here should try to communicate with everyone...its
                                      challenging to communicate with someone so different, so
                                      passionate...try it!</p>

                                      <span>       </span> 31 Jan

              <p><span style="color: #800000;">As you can see. Laurence82 is
                                      still reasonable then. Because he is new.<span> </span> His
                                      posts are during a time of moderators. And he is not directly
                                      attacking Christianity. Just enlightening us on perhaps the
                                      misconception of it.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #800000;">This thread sheds some light into
                                      the position of Laurence82. Still civil. Albeit it was in an Aunt
                                      Agony thread. WITH a moderator monitoring of course.</span></p>

                                      in Eternal Hope, its still civil. Moderator SillyMe was still there
                                      during that time.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #800000;">This one is interesting.
                                      Laurence82 actually advocates for statute based religious
                                      harmony.</span></p>
              <p>“I am not sure how much of jurisdiction can the goverment have
                                      over internet content, especially with regards to using the
                                      religious harmony act.<br> <br> Since its mabbe quite limited, some people use this chance to
                                      profess their hypocritical views on other religions here, which
                                      they couldnt do outside since they could be immediately be held
                                      under citizen arrest by people who are listening.<br> <br> But it will be helpful to post some legal statutes here so that we
                                      can see how much of that act has been flouted here.<br> <br> cheers”</p>

              <p>I admit, its going to take some time to form a timeline. Given
                                      that your posts are 111,665 at 12/12 06.22am.<span> </span> And that is 248 times more than Hasene’s. Which means 2233
                                      hours.<span> </span> But that can be shortened if I skip every
                                      2 pages. Time can be shortened of course by giving it out to
                                      employees that have too much free time and don’t mind a little bit
                                      of bonus.</p>
              <p>But it does bring back some good memories. The good old times
                                      when we at least saw eye to eye. But that will all change in 2008.

                                      hatred and a personal vendetta against Christians in particular.
                                      You can see that he starts to reveal his true nature. Someone how
                                      is intolerant, who is anti- religion, anti-christianity and we do
                                      whatever it takes to bad mouth or talk down a Christian be the
                                      Christian a good or bad one. He cannot be an objective person. Have
                                      a read. His discussion back then was still civil and makes sense.
                                      You can feel he wants to attack.. but was being reigned in. Chin

              <p>“I am afraid u guys have to read up on Amway, who officially
                                      pave the way and started the MLM business in US in 1950s. It is
                                      plausible they use christian evangelism as a model to start
                                      MLM.<br> <br> But i beg to differ that CHC or in fact any evangelistic or
                                      charismatic churches are MLM in structure and form. There are few
                                      very technical differences i must say, one being churches deal with
                                      spirituality while mlm deals with business strategies.<br> <br> Although there are seemingly few similarities between them, i dont
                                      its right to label churches directly as having mlm structure. i
                                      will use it only in discussion regarding churches that seemingly
                                      want to con people out of their money. Even so, it is not right to
                                      label CHC as having mlm structure, the point being pointed out in
                                      earlier post.<br> <br> 'direct selling' or single level marketing or SLM' would be the
                                      best parallel in business world to compare with CHC.”</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">--Now this is about City Harvest
                                      Church being an MLM. Notice how he was making sense. Acknolwedging
                                      the spiritual aspect<span> </span> and it’s difference. But If
                                      I were to fast forward to 2010. Which I will eventually point out,
                                      he claims Christianity IS MLM. Notice the<span> </span> inconsistencies ? Given that it is NOT in Eternal Hope, it is in a
                                      Multi Level Marketing forum, nevertheless shows his state of mind
                                      during the earlier years. Don’t believe me ? Link Below</span></p>

                                      interesting thread. Here he seems to lament about the impartiality
                                      of the mod. And as usual.. starts a flame war.. AGAIN.. Let me
                                      highlight to you all that THIS.. is his style of flame and
                                      argument. You can clearly see how it has evolved intelligently and
                                      more aggressively over the year.</span></p>

                                      would also like to point out that this thread is not just to debate
                                      responsibilities of mod, but also in light of recent events, really
                                      uncalled behaviour of mod, and the way the forums are going now.
                                      the Bear made a good point in his thread not too long ago, and one
                                      wonders why it doesnt happen to other SI forums as iveco as pointed

                                      watching two groups flaming each other for the fun of it...<br> <br> pls dont cry helplessness and so on, when things doesnt prove u

                                      but about chhristianity, esp when someone call himself the prophet
                                      of god, and link himself to god thru this 'holy trinity'.<br> <br> I have very specific reservations abt the Protestants, who used to
                                      justify their breakaway, among other stuff, including the reasons
                                      of Pope's excessess..<br> <br> Now if you look, its more like Protestants' excessess, whereas the

                                      your old-school dad demand total respect, obedience and attention,
                                      without any question about the way he do stuff, even of you know

                                      how he supports trolls, supports those that are in his line of
                                      thinking and not looking at things objectively. That was 6 years
                                      ago. And while StupidIsSmart has improved in his vocabulary and
                                      knowledge, while his reasonings are logical, they both exhibit the
                                      same character of not trying to understand the other person’s
                                      position and that you are always WRONG and they are RIGHT. Now in
                                      2011, he still has the exact same mentality. But while
                                      StupidIsSmart has improved, Laurence82 clearly has not.</span></p>

                                      "seasoned" EH contributors are avoiding a protracted, thus
                                      pointless, discussion with the anti-Christians, we will be more
                                      than happy to discuss and when possible nudge seekers the way we
                                      see to be right. After all, as laoda, and myself (in the past) had
                                      maintained, this is a CHRISTIAN forum. No different from those who
                                      reside in Light of Atlantis or the Buddhist threat who may advice
                                      their seekers to go those ways, and as I have said before, it would
                                      be totally wrong to preach there. This is EH, you either come in to
                                      share, to seek or to argue. I'd ignore those who wants nothing more
                                      than to pick a fight.<br> <br> To anyone who does not believe in God (or the Christian God), the
                                      prayers would not offend 'cos to these people God does not exist,
                                      thus the prayers will NOT work.<br> To believers, it is well within our agenda to try to nudge
                                      non-believers to our faith.<br> While, as most forumites may know, that I am totally against the
                                      forcing-down-your-throat brand of Christianity, I will be more than
                                      happy to provide some comfort and answers, and if such answers will
                                      lead an individual to Christ I will unabashly do it.<br> <br> <em>If I am addressing the needs of a specific individual and this
                                      individual feels that these needs are met, I would not consider the
                                      opinions of those who are not involved. They are totally
                                      unimportant.</em></span></p>

              <p>You have to realise that there are different denominations in
              Christianity itself. The answers we give will be different. Our
              understanding may be different. That is why this forum was to
              discuss the differences and share. There will be trolls and
              non-trolls. The key is to know WHICH are the trolls and WHICH are
              not.</p>
              <p>If we can give u your answer... then the world would have had
              all the answers to everything.</p>
              <p>We learn we experience. Life is all about learning. You can say
              u learn with your books with knowledge, there are Christians who
              learn by trying to attain the spirituality of it.</p>
              <p>Look at the history of Eternal Hope. You cannot pin all the
              blame saying that people caling whoever trolls. There are trolls.
              Christian and non-christian alike. That is fact. And refusal to
              accept there are non-Christian trolls is like saying all of you
              guys are right. Which I have proved again and again that no. Ther
              are non-christian trolls. And I have shown you who the trolls are.
              It is up to you to decide the who is who.</p>

              <p>1. Regarding different denominations in christianity, what confuses me is you guys are supposed to believe in one God. And this one God apparently speaks to all of you, no matter the denomination. But then this one God seems to be telling you all different things regarding tongues, healings, OSAS doctrine, method of baptism, person of jesus, nature of heaven and hell, interpretation of verses, version of bible to use etc. Why does he seem like he's telling everyone different things?</p>
              <p>Sure you might say that it is human's diff interpretation. But then EVERY single christian i met tells me that it is God who tells them that OSAS is biblical/unbiblical...</p>
              <p>So how to know who's right and who's wrong? You say go back to the bible. But every christians who tells me that OSAS is biblical/unbiblical pointsme to the bible too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Of course there are nonchristian trolls like there are christian trolls. But what I am saying is, try to answer our difficult questions without thinking that we are bashing.</p>

              <p>You are obviously bashing here. You said there are differing views. But then you go from "how we know who's right who's wrong" to "Christianity is just plain wrong". By what logic you jump from being ignorant to being certain that Christianity is just plain wrong and thus must be abandoned?</p>
              <p>In the courts of law there are always differing views upon the finer points of law (that's how lawyers make money ya?), enough to make people like us confused and wondering who's right and who's wrong. Do you then reject the entire law or judicial process because of your confusion?</p>

              <p>Camp A prayed, studied the bible, interpreted the bible and also read christian articles and concluded that baptism is NEEDED for salvation.</p>
              <p>Camp B prayed, studied the bible, interpreted the bible and also read christian articles and concluded that baptism ISN'T NEEDED for salvation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So in essence you have not answered anything! You have to give me a CLEARER way or method of knowing who's interpretation is correct.</p>

              <p>So because you think there is no clear way out, you choose to take the easy way out and declare Christianity as wrong and to be rejected? This speaks more about you than the faith I believe in.</p>

              <p>I know 1+1=2, but I am asking you WHY it is the way it is. Why do mathematical axioms work the way they do? You say it is natural thing to do. It's just saying that's the way it is without explaining why. Why is it consistently that 1+1=2 everywhere in the universe? Even on earth you can say satu + satu = dua, we call it differently but the truth is that 1+1=2. Question for you is, why is there such a universal order? Why do you believe that 1+1 always will be 2? You believe that the universe is a random accident, that is is chance random processes. Explain the order that we discover please according to your worldview.</p>

              <p>I hold to the correspondence theory of truth. If something is true, then it must correspond to reality. It must account for the facts. It must explain the facts coherently. Many religions and people in the past and some still today hold to the BELIEF that the universe is eternal, that it has always been. Note though that the Biblical worldview has all along held to a finite universe, a universe that has a beginning and that will have an end. And this has now only been confirmed by modern science in the last century. It is now a fact that the universe is finite. How we account for its existence is another matter though. So if you ask me, I would say that it is no longer tenable to believe that the universe is eternal. That would be rather anti-scientific, don't you think? And if I am not wrong, Buddhists are of the view that Buddhism is very scientific.</p>

              <p>I'm sure there are scientists that have a finite view of the universe....but also many scientists also believe that the universe is infinite....when I talk about the term "eternal" I'm refering to the old one fades while a new one forms...not the same universe but a totally new one....Buddhism have too many schools of thoughts / practice / beliefs....I won't generalize all schools....</p>

              <p>Indeed there are many scientists who choose to believe in an infinite or eternal universe, despite what the scientific community has established as an incontrovertible fact, that the universe has a beginning. Again, whether scientists or religious folks, to hold to such a belief would be doing so despite what the established facts are. I would say, at the very least, that the fact of a finite universe supports or confirms what the Bible has said all along for thousands of years, that space time matter had a beginning. I think it is significant that the very first verse of the Bible is scientifically sound.</p>
