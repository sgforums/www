              Of course not. If He did would I be in the forum arguing and debating and seeking to persuade people about the faith? I would have been using physical force to compel conversion. But let's not divert from the need for critics like Jacky to back up their claims that Christianity seeks conversion by coercion.

              Also, it does not make sense for Jesus to call Himself a Christian if you know what it means to be one.

              Sandy,
              
              I presume you are aware of my view that there is no such thing as a neutral person.
              
              Anyway to answer you, yes, the Bible teaches that God desires that all be saved. Jesus died for all, not for some. But this does not mean that all must believe, for that would mean compulsion. The medium is in the preaching of the Gospel and in persuading people of the truth of Christianity.

              Can you explain in greater detail your first statement? Also, it
              does not make sense for Jesus to call Himself a Christian if you
              know what it means to be one.</p>

              By sin I mean to living on borrowed concepts and as for Christianity ( it is organized around a belief system and anything that is organised  ) and Jesus Christ preceded Christianity. Organized religion nullifies the possiblity of being a religion. When I try to organize truth (not to be confused with that of psychological/social relevance) I have already ''killed''  what is true! How can religious (aka spiritual) qualities flower when in the first place it is circumsribed and .....on closer scrutiny it is power politics. Truth cannot be objectified -  when it is alread the past and dead. 
              
              Whether it be Christianity or Hinduism or Buddhism, it does not matter. Any organized religion circumscribes and dictates what one should be or should not be. Dont all of us want to be from dictates . OnÃ©'s individuality, one's freedom, one's dignity is diminshed. To simply imbibe and swallow without intelligence is to be sleepwalking.  That seems to be the attitude of all so-called religions.My believing in Jesus, or in Krishna, or in Buddha, does not in anyway negate or nullify my ''crimes'' and ''sins''. 
              
              They were beings who had trancended sin and virtue and shared thru their being kind, being compassionate, being inclusive. This is the crux of a religious flowering and it exemplifies existential relevancy.
              
              When I am being kind, rude or ... that is an existentially relevant. However, If I think that I am kind, think that I am intelligent, think that i believe in .... the latter is merely psychological and at its best has some social relevance.

              You claimed not to care about morals yet you were moralising in all your postings. You said the real thing is your defining yourself by what you said, yet you also said that what is right today can be wrong tomorrow. It is all so self-refuting. Note that I am not agreeing with you at all.
