              Sadly atheists like Tcmc has been brainwashed to believe the impossible, like the universe made itself or that life just came from nonliving matter on its own.

              <p>Nothing wrong if Tcmc believes in these.   To each their own.    The one God theory may not apply or accepted by some, really gotta accept it, respect it.    </p>
              <p>I have no problem accepting christians who practise their faith faithfully and live by what they believe.  I also have no problem accepting buddhists, muslims, hindu and any other religious people who believe in their own religions and practise them for the good, harmony, peace and with respect to people from other religions.</p>
              <p>I do have to put up with some nuisance that affects the peace and work when one keeps preaching the word of God and quote bible verses but the behaviour is the other way round.    At work this person seems more interested to use company's resources to do her church work and put doing church work as priority in workplace.   The work quality sucks and out of kindness for reason not to delay the project work I helped to clear her shit.   But she does not appreciate it.    Old bitch!  Sigh!   </p>

              I don't know if anyone has asked this question on this topic before, but let me pose it:
                      
              WHY do non-believers of Christianity have to go to Hell? If it even exists? Isn't God ever-loving and ever-forgiving? Isn't He omni-present? Isn't He all-powerful? Didn't He send his Son to die for us? Shouldn't that cover non-believers as well?
                      
              If non-believers have to go to Hell, does this mean ALL souls go to Hell? Since there are other religions which state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. 
                      
              Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell.
                      
              Right or wrong?

              <p>Christians believe non-christians go to hell because it's their religion and their beliefs.</p>
              <p>It does not apply to everyone though and is not a universal truth.</p>
              <p>Every religion has its own "criteria" to go to heaven.</p>
              <p>For example, in Islam, you MUST be a muslim to go to heaven too.</p>
              <p>In some forms of Taoism, you must do good, believe in the Gods, pray to them to be able to enter heaven.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Hinduism, obedience to the Hindu Gods is a must to gain salvation too!</p>
