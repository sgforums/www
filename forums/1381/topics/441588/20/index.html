              <p>How am I being aggressive? At most I admit that I am tenacious in my arguments which makes the atheist feels cornered and unable to counter-argue. At that point the atheist will then lash out with all the ad hominem attacks.</p>
              <p>What do you mean by me not being open to discussion? Does being "open" means that I have to accept the atheist's arguments as true? Of course as a Christian I am obligated to respond (or shoot down, if you like) the various objections that atheists hurl against Christianity. I have to show the reasonableness of the Christian answer while exposing the unreasonableness of the atheist's objections.</p>

To me thats total judging of ppl who do not meet your yardstick as someone who is more inferior as compared to yours. Much as you have distaste for atheist, the way you bring them down gives me a feeling of disrespect to them. Unreasonableness of the atheist's objections, the way you put across things, i view it as though you are unreasonable too.

              <p>Firstly, let me just say upfront that your dislike of the way I discuss does not render my arguments wrong or invalid.</p>
              <p>Secondly, your entire post is ad hominem in nature, accusing me of arrogance more than pointing out the flaws in my arguments. Please note that even if truth is spoken with kindness impaired, it is still the truth.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, you have failed to make the distinction between accepting a person and accepting his views. I respect your right to be an atheist and fully accept that you are an atheist. But that is not the same as accepting your reasons for being an atheist as true or valid. In fact, I am not ashamed to say that I understand atheism more than most atheists here. And it is because I am knowledgeable about atheism that I can critique it well, compared to most atheists who criticise Christianity but are largely ignorant of Christianity. Of course you would consider this arrogance as well, but I think I have pretty much showed how atheists like Jacky do not know what atheism really implies.</p>
              <p>I do not just anyhow call people dishonest, but I have showed how intellectually dishonest most atheists are here, in their use of double-standards and failure to be consistent with their own beliefs. Jacky even denied he has any beliefs!</p>
              <p>I do not have a distaste for atheists, it's nothing personal. But I do find their arguments lacking in substance and logical rigour which is ironic since atheists usually consider themselves more rational than the deluded religious folks. You say I am unreasonable but you did not explain in detail how my arguments are unreasonable. For those who raised questions I have answered them. If I have answered them well or refuted them, how is that considered putting myself higher than them? Credit should be given where it is due, esp when objections have been answered.</p>
              <p>People like Tcmc are not merely pointing out irregularities, as if they are oh-so-innocent seekers. I can assure you that Tcmc certainly do not belong to this category. She completely refuses to accept the fact that reasonable answers have been given to her questions. And I should defend myself whenever I perceive that it is unfair to make certain remarks. I am certainly not an extremist like Tcmc was. You mean I should just agree with her? If defending myself against an unfair charge is considered egoistic, so be it then.</p>
              <p>As you can see, I have bothered to read what you post. I understand your views but I do not agree with them. Again if you think that my defending myself against your accusation of arrogance is arrogance itself and being egoistic, then so be it. Then it should also be applied to anyone who tries to defend himself or who thinks he is right. Make no mistake, the atheist thinks that he is right and that all religions are wrong. Is he arrogant? What do you think?</p>

              <p>you mentioned an atheist thinks that he is right and all religions are wrong? did jacky, susanteo, pinknutri, TCMC, thinks that only christianity is wrong? or that all other religions are wrong?</p>
              <p>In fact, I am not ashamed to say that I understand atheism more than most atheists here. And it is because I am knowledgeable about atheism that I can critique it well, compared to most atheists who criticise Christianity but are largely ignorant of Christianity. How is this not arrogance? To claim not to be an atheist to kno more about atheism than an atheist?</p>
              <p>To you, everyone else is wrong and others is right. Im pretty sure what you have mentioned is not and definitely has not yet be proven to be the truth. I've mentioned many times that big bang cannot be proven truth, so is god's creation. If your prove is god is the witness, no 1 can prove god is a witness.</p>
              <p>Do not place yourself on the high ground such tat ppl who have reason to be an atheist needs you to accept their reason for being an atheist. If i have a reason for being an atheist, i certainly do not need you to accept my reason.</p>
              <p>Not agreeing with TCMC does not place you as an extremist, but bashing everyone who has varying opinion is an extremist.</p>
              <p>Then it should also be applied to anyone who tries to defend himself or who thinks he is right. Make no mistake-wrong in my opinion. Everyone can defend himself and solely defend himself... but defending himself by puting others down is what you are doing which protrays arrogance and egoism.</p>
              <p>"If defending myself against an unfair charge is considered egoistic, so be it then" You can choose various ways to defend yourself... but you choose to stand on the high ground and put others down like i remember you calling me a "non thinker". I din put on a air of arrogance that "mine is always right" when u questioned my beliefs did I? As someone brought up in another religion, did i push away all other beliefs claiming mine's the only way? Your arrogance comes in a way by placing all your beliefs on the superior high ground.</p>
              <p>"Make no mistake, the atheist thinks that he is right and that all religions are wrong. Is he arrogant? What do you think?"</p>
              <p>At the very least whoever i saw here did not do a run down on all other religions. I took a look at the buddhism forum, things are peaceful there even when ppl post questions about their beliefs. Ever self reflected why are there so many "trollers" and so many ppl claiming to cease following up here?</p>

              <p>you mentioned an atheist thinks that he is right and all religions are wrong? did jacky, susanteo, pinknutri, TCMC, thinks that only christianity is wrong? or that all other religions are wrong?</p>
              <p>In fact, I am not ashamed to say that I understand atheism more than most atheists here. And it is because I am knowledgeable about atheism that I can critique it well, compared to most atheists who criticise Christianity but are largely ignorant of Christianity. How is this not arrogance? To claim not to be an atheist to kno more about atheism than an atheist?</p>
              <p>To you, everyone else is wrong and others is right. Im pretty sure what you have mentioned is not and definitely has not yet be proven to be the truth. I've mentioned many times that big bang cannot be proven truth, so is god's creation. If your prove is god is the witness, no 1 can prove god is a witness.</p>
              <p>Do not place yourself on the high ground such tat ppl who have reason to be an atheist needs you to accept their reason for being an atheist. If i have a reason for being an atheist, i certainly do not need you to accept my reason.</p>
              <p>Not agreeing with TCMC does not place you as an extremist, but bashing everyone who has varying opinion is an extremist.</p>
              <p>Then it should also be applied to anyone who tries to defend himself or who thinks he is right. Make no mistake-wrong in my opinion. Everyone can defend himself and solely defend himself... but defending himself by puting others down is what you are doing which protrays arrogance and egoism.</p>
              <p>"If defending myself against an unfair charge is considered egoistic, so be it then" You can choose various ways to defend yourself... but you choose to stand on the high ground and put others down like i remember you calling me a "non thinker". I din put on a air of arrogance that "mine is always right" when u questioned my beliefs did I? As someone brought up in another religion, did i push away all other beliefs claiming mine's the only way? Your arrogance comes in a way by placing all your beliefs on the superior high ground.</p>
              <p>"Make no mistake, the atheist thinks that he is right and that all religions are wrong. Is he arrogant? What do you think?"</p>
              <p>At the very least whoever i saw here did not do a run down on all other religions. I took a look at the buddhism forum, things are peaceful there even when ppl post questions about their beliefs. Ever self reflected why are there so many "trollers" and so many ppl claiming to cease following up here?</p>

              <p>Let's put it clearer.</p>
              <p>I believe that everyone NEEDS to know because it matters. You BELIEVE that not everyone needs to know.</p>
              <p>My reason is that because if God exists, and that we are morally accountable to Him for how we lived our lives, then it is needful that people know this truth.</p>
              <p>What is your reason for saying that people don't need to know?</p>
              <p>As for origins of life research, you should know that huge sums of money is spent on this because evolutionists want to prove that life indeed evolved and that there is no need for God.</p>

              <p>But why should Jacky be let off the hook when he made that claim? And asking me to prove that it is not is to ask me to prove a negative.</p>
              <p>As for my claim, I know what I am believing. If you accuse me of imagining things, then it only means it exists in my head, I am being delusional i.e. I need a shrink. But I am being very logical in my arguments, much more than Jacky. I am arguing from effects to causes, even if the cause (God) is invisible by definition.</p>

              <p>Please read the whole post again. I wasn't saying that you CANNOT think or that you are mentally challenged, but that you have chosen NOT to think about these things. Therefore you are not really a free thinker but a non-thinker, in the sense that you did not think about why you believe certain things. So you see, the truth is far different than what you have tried to picture it. You have completely misunderstood my point. I thereby stand vindicated of my words.</p>

              <p>And so just because i have choosen not to think and so i am labelled? However what gives you the right to start labelling others as thinkers/non thinkers? The truth is still the same in that you have authorised yourself over others and authorised yourself to label others to be way below you just because ppl have not pondered over things you have pondered or i should say "things you feel ought to be pondered'. </p>
              <p>Anyway from all your posts and interactions, even if i explain myself you wouldn't have accepted it anyway. i do not hold god in that almighty position you hold and i do not believe he has all the answers. Explaining/answering to you will only result in you putting down more of my beliefs. </p>

              <p>This is not a distraction. I am asking you not to employ double standards here. If Christianity should be charged with arrogance for its exclusive claims, so should atheism.</p>
              <p>Now for my answer, it is NOT arrogance for Christianity to claim that those who refuse to believe in God will face an eternity in hell.</p>

              <p>My answer is christianity is arrogance. Simply because it pushes for itself and rejects all others in the same realm. Pushes away all other religions.Atheism rejects all religion while it isolates itself from religion. There is a distinctive difference be it you like it anot or whether you feel there is anot. I used to think really strong believers of the faith go way past that. Your sentence proved me othewise and showed me more of his "love" </p>

              <p>If Christianity is arrogance because of its exclusive claims, then so is atheism, whether you like it or not or whether you feel it is or not. Atheism does not isolate itself from religion. As a worldview it attacks all religions as false. You probably never even read Dawkin's "The God Delusion" where he attacks all religions but Christianity in particular. Whatever distinctive difference between Christianity and atheism's exclusive claims to truth that you see is IMO non-existent since both makes exclusive truth to claims. You will be engaging in the fallacy of special pleading if you make such kind of concession for atheism and immunise it from the same charge of arrogance.</p>
