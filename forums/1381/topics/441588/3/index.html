              <p>When you see something and ask what is it for, what do you think
                  is an appropriate response? I would say, let's ask the maker! The
                  maker knows the purpose of something that he made. Would you think
                  that this is a reasonable course of thinking?</p>

              <p>It's a fact of life. There is reality (which is), and there are many ways to look at it. There is one objective reality but a variety of ways to view the world. The three main lenses to view the world is</p>
              <p>1. Theism</p>
              <p>2. Atheism</p>
              <p>3. Pantheism</p>
              <p>Each lens used will determine how one answers the ultimate questions of life. There will be a worldview that is correct. It's like prescriptive lenses. There are the letters on the wall (objective reality) and your vision is blurred. What lenses are you going to use to see those words? Or what colored lenses are you going to use.</p>
              <p>Something for you to think about. And you may wish to google the word "worldview" and learn more. Even reasonable.atheist uses that term.</p>

              <p>Why do you call me extreme again? The word "beautiful" is really subjective. I prefered the word "diverse" which I think is a more appropriate one. And why so defensive? I am only asking you if you also think the world is beautiful with the religions founded by those I mentioned. I don't think you would. Me too. That's my point.</p>

              <p>It's OK lah, better to "fight" with words than with swords, ya?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I think we should all try to remain cordial and not use words that are clearly intended to cause offense. Of course sometimes even the most polite words or carefully chosen words can cause offense, but when the intent or motivation is not there I think we should cut some slack.</p>

              <p>1. Beautiful is subjective. I neither agree nor disagree. I would prefer to say that the world is diverse because of that.</p>
              <p>2. If there's no need to persuade others to subscribe to one's beliefs, why are you then doing that here opening threads?</p>

Now, let's be clear on this, it seems that you are NOT quibbling on methodology here (be it street or door to door or flyers), but the CONTENT of the preaching. To you, it is insulting and degrading to say that truth is exclusive, that only one is right and the others are wrong. Is this your position? Please confirm.</p>
