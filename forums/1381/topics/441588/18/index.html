              <p class="MsoNormal">The problem is, up to now, you have not proved that your god exists. You and I have spoken before in the past and you have admitted that there is NO evidence to prove empirically that your god exists. You also admitted before that there are errors in the bible. So with so many questions, the existence of the bible god should be questioned. So if you theres no evidence of the existence of your god, how can you even conclude “he” is infinite?</p>

              <p>Since when did I say that "Who created God" is not a legitimate question? Mind you, I have answered that question more than once on this forum. I only said that it is an IRRELEVANT question when I am asking you about the cause of the universe. Looks like you are the one guilty of pushing away the question of the cause of the universe.</p>

              <p>Atheists are quick to point out that throughout history large numbers of people were killed in the name of Religion; but they fail to mention the countless millions who were killed by leaders who worshipped themselves or by militant atheist-Communists who were driven by a hatred for God and Religion.</p>
              <p>If religion has to apologize for all the violence done in its name, so should atheism. Religion is not the only cause of evil in the world. In fact, <strong>more people have been killed by atheist regimes in the twentieth century than in all the religious persecutions of Western history</strong>. Mao was responsible for over forty million deaths, Stalin for more than twenty million, and Hitler’s count is over ten million. And those are just the big three atheists—we haven’t event mentioned other tyrants like Pol Pot, Enver Hoxha, Nicolae Ceausescu, Fidel Castro, and Kim Jong-il. <strong>In a single century, atheists have killed more than one-hundred million people.</strong> On the other hand, the Crusades, the Inquisition, and the witch burnings together killed about 200,000 people. It is not violence done in the name of religion that has caused the most evil in the world, but violence done in the name of atheism.</p>

              <p>Fact of the matter is that modern science was born within a Judeo-Christian worldview, thus having its roots in the Bible. Like it or not, that's the truth.</p>
              <p>But people who advocate that religion should leave science alone and vice versa do not walk the talk. Fact is, science keep poking its nose into religion, trying to "explain" why there is religion, trying to find the gene that makes people religious etc etc. And you have atheists like Victor Stenger who wrote that science has proven the non-existence of God.</p>

              <p>Apparently you don't get the point. Infinity is NOT a value.</p>
              <p>The way I understand it is this: Just as it is absurd to define a value for infinity, it is also logically absurd to ask what caused an eternal God to exist. Or who's the bachelor's wife for that matter. We've been through this before, haven't we?</p>

              <p>1. Not knowing the cause of the universe does not automatically make your god the only cause for the universe. There are many other possible reasons, and possible gods.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Knowing the cause of the universe isn't necessary for everyone. Some people just don't find the NEED to know the cause of the universe as it does not affect their daily lives.</p>

              <p>Why is it surprising or entertaining that Christians can't agree? Even atheists disagree with each other. Everyone disagrees with everyone else over some things.</p>
              <p>People disagree for all sorts of reasons. But the point is that either all are wrong or one is right. You can't have everyone saying contradictory things and still be correct.</p>
