              <p>then don't believe the Bible, why keep using the Bible to tell Christians what the Bible says?</p>
              <p>I dont' know Quran or Hindu scripture, so I don't know comparison. It must be great mathematician like you who know the Bible, the Quran, The Hindu Scripture, the Dao De Jing, the Science...to make comparison, prove them with mathematical equations and say what is right, what is wrong.</p>
              <p>So what are you going to say about the Magic Talking Teapot? How does your Magic Talking Teapot compared to the Quran and Hindu? you are going to prove that Magic Talking Teapot exists?  <img src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I dont' know Quran or Hindu scripture, so I don't know
              comparison. It must be great mathematician like you who know the
              Bible, the Quran, The Hindu Scripture, the Dao De Jing, the
              Science...to make comparison, prove them with mathematical
              equations and say what is right, what is wrong.</p>
              <p>So what are you going to say about the Magic Talking

              The question then is, did Jesus teach that Christians should win converts by the sword? For your allegation to hold you have to show that Jesus taught this and that the NT writers taught that too.

              I think it is important to establish whether what Christians have been alleged to have done in the name of God are consistent with the  teachings of Christ Himself. If such cannot be done or in fact it is contrary to what He taught then this argument destructs.

              Fair question, but not difficult to answer at all, just show us from the Gospel that Jesus Himself coerced people to believe in Him at the point of the sword i.e. He led by example, or that He taught it, and that His apostles also followed His example and taught it, and that the early church in the first three centuries followed suit. I submit to you that the critics would have an impossible task ahead of them. And of course if it is alleged that the Bible is vague and any interpretation is possible, then how is it that Bible critics are so sure that their interpretation is correct? How can they be sure of their interpretation and yet ask how can anyone be sure when an opposing interpretation is offered? That would be special pleading.
