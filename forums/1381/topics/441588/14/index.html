              <p>It would be a mistake if you think that the Bible does not teach that the present life is important or that we have to be useful people. The Bible does not teach that the present is not important, in fact it teaches that in this life we make a most important decision that will affect us for the rest of eternity. It teaches us that we should not store our treasures on earth where it will be temporary and can decay but that we should store up treasures in heaven where no thief can steal and no moth can eat. It also teaches us to do good to all. But the Bible also teaches that there are forces of evil at work to turn people away from God. We need to be mindful of spiritual forces at work. It teaches the triumphant end in that the devil will finally be destroyed forever.</p>

              <p>Indeed religions in general teach people to live good moral lives. But let's just consider three religions for the time being, Christianity, Buddhism, and atheism.</p>
              <p>Starting with atheism first, atheism has nothing to say about good vs evil, because in the denial of God there is no longer any objective basis for good and evil, no moral laws, no ultimate foundation for ethics. What's more important for atheists is the survival of the fittest via natural selection, and not the idea of truth, good, and evil.</p>
              <p>Buddhism, in my understanding, deals with the personal effort to attain nirvana. There is no ultimate victory over evil or the vanquishing of evil, but only the escape from samsara and rebirth. The existence of evil and suffering and death is eternal.</p>
              <p>Christianity teaches that God created a perfect world which was corrupted by man's wilful rebellion, thus bringing with it suffering and death. By Adam's disobedience sin, death and suffering entered the world. But by the obedience of Jesus (the Second Adam) through His vicarious suffering and death, the power of sin was broken. Man, who is dead in sin, can now have eternal life in Christ. And there will be a final consummation of all things where the devil and all that is evil will be vanquished by God forever. And God will usher in a new heavens and a new earth where perfection will last for all eternity.</p>

              <p>Jesus also taught many things to His disciples, and progressively revealed more and more to them. But His teachings never contradict one another.

              <p>As mentioned earlier, Jesus certainly taught and did much more than what the Gospel writers chose to record which is sufficient for our instruction. Your personal preference for more documentation does not in anyway undermine that which is already documented for us. In addition, we also have the writings of the NT writers besides the 4 Gospels which also continue to teach that which Christ has taught the apostles.</p>

              <p>Yes, Buddha taught for many years till over 80 years old whereas Jesus lived only 33 years and taught for 3. But then again, the brevity of Jesus' life must be seen in the context of His purpose for coming, which was to atone for the sins of the world. Moreover, the Buddha's words were only documented centuries after the death of Buddha but Jesus' words were recorded within decades of His resurrection. Lastly, the truth of a teaching lies not in the volume of words documented. You may of course wish for more of Jesus' words to be documented but it would be rather unreasonable to compare Jesus' 3 year teaching ministry with Buddha's 40 odd years of teaching.</p>

              <p>Why are you so upset that Demon Bane (or anyone else here) would want to discuss Buddhism here? Why do you want to stop him, and why should he obey you anyway? If atheists can discuss, or rather, impose their atheism here, why can't Buddhists discuss their Buddhism here, whether it be comparing or contrasting with the Christian faith? What's your fear?</p>
