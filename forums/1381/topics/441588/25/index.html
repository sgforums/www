              Here is a new book that refutes Richard Dawkins' The God Delusion and effectively dismantles the arguments of the new atheists. It is freely downloadable as a PDF file at the present time. I urge resident atheists here to take up the challenge to respond to this book.

              <p>Should the fear of being branded "silly" be a factor when it comes to matters of truth?</p>
              <p>Either what the Bible says is true or it is not. Whether people think it is silly or not is irrelevant. In any case, what you are doing is distorting the Bible and not treating it with respect and with fairness. For example, you think dragons are just myths, but creationists believe that is simply one of the words used BEFORE the word "dinosaur" was invented in 1841 by Sir Richard Owen. I doubt you knew this, right?</p>
              <p>But here's the fact, the Bible always have the habbit of being right after all. You would have think that the Bible was silly in stating that time, space and matter had a beginning. But with modern discoveries we know the Bible is right, and those who think the Bible was silly and believed in an eternal universe proved to be fools themselves.</p>

              <p>EXPECTING animals to talk is certainly silly. But give me a Bible teaching that supports such an expectation. Or that Bible characters have a habit of actually having a mutual intelligible conversation with an animal as though it is normal.</p>
              <p>Of course I can say that "God did it", or "the devil did it" as in the case of the serpent in Eden, because this answer is ALLOWED under the Biblical world view. I am not at all being inconsistent or contrary to the Biblical worldview. You are just saying it is silly because you dismiss the Bible flat out.</p>
              <p>Can God cure all HIV people? Of course God can. He is God mah! But again the Biblical worldview allows the answer that this is a fallen world, and many people are suffering the consequences of their own rebellion. A man reaps what he sows. Furthermore the Bible did not teach that in this fallen and cursed world God will heal everyone of any sickness in their life, regardless of whether they are Christians or not. Sickness and death comes upon all. It is by God's grace that some people are healed. And even if God chooses not to heal for reasons only He knows, what is that to you? Consider God's servant, Job. So you see, I am not making any excuses at all.</p>
              <p>Why are you so upset that I would speak up for God? The apostles command us to contend for the faith.  God chooses to use human vessels to preach the Good News and to defend it when required. With some common sense and Bible knowledge I believe it is more than adequate to refute your objections.</p>

              <p>I don't think the CEO analogy is flawed.</p>
              <p>Tcmc failed to note that you were only trying to make the point that the CEO can speak through those below him. When she tries to stetch the analogy too far it becomes absurd. But then again, most of her points are pretty much bordering on absurdity.</p>
              <p>In any case all analogies to God are always limited so care must be taken not to press the analogy too far beyond what it was just intended to convey.</p>

              <p>It's basic common sense really. Scientists use analogies all the time. Most of us also use analogies when we try to explain more difficult things in a simple way. But that's just helping the hearers to easier grasp a point we are making. We know that the analogies are less than perfect to capture the full picture, but they are helpful in limited ways. Of course, using the appropriate analogy also goes a long way.</p>

              <p>The meek/timid Christian would be a floor mat for those of your ilk, Tcmc.</p>
              <p>Me arrogant? Maybe, but usually when dealing with those of your ilk. For the sincere seeker who genuinely displays a humble spirit desiring to understand, I would gently entertain the most frustrating of questions. Different strokes for different folks, I'd say.</p>
              <p>But village atheists who without restraint bash the faith are least qualified to complain about "arrogant Christians". They are just upset that some Christians can take their objections and demolish them, and lacking a comeback argument they go whining about how arrogant or unChristian their opponents are.</p>
              <p>In the NT we have Jesus and the apostles occasionally employing sarcasm, wit, riposte and yes, even insults when dealing with certain groups of people. See <a href="http://www.tektonics.org/lp/madmad.html">http://www.tektonics.org/lp/madmad.html</a></p>

              Truth is, one doesn't need the Bible to demolish atheism. But one needs the Bible to get the right worldview and to provide Biblical answers. Sure there are those who reject God, but that should not be confused with refuting the arguments for God. And you have for the umpteenth time failed to substantiate your polemical assaults on the Bible.
