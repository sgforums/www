              <p>again, what is "mixed"?</p>
              <p>In chemistry, there is reversible reaction and irreversible
              reaction.</p>
              <p>when red and blue color mix, it becomes violet, and you cannot
              separate violet and return it to blue and red color again.
              that is 1 + 1 = 1.</p>
              <p>Oxygen and hydrogen can mix to become water, but water can be
              separated to form oxygen and hydrogen again. that is
              reversible.</p>
              <p>In chemistry there are many many irreversible reactions!!</p>

              <p>I talked about oxygen and hydrogen in water as a reversible reaction. Adding a red color and a blue color to get a violet color is an irreversible reaction. In an irreversible reaction, 1 + 1 = 1. Your father and mother gave birth to you, you are 1, you are not two compenents of your parents, that is also 1 + 1 = 1!!</p>

              <p>1. Issue is not reversible or not. Issue is whether 1+1=2. Answer me - How many "solutions of colors" are there in the mixture of blue and red? How many components make up violet in that mixture? ANswer straight pls and stop diverting attention to the issue at hand.</p>
              <p>2. Yes I can be wrong that is why I stand corrected if I am. But clearly you are wrong about the number of components in the mixture.</p>
              <p>You're telling me 1 red + 1 blue = 1 violet . Yes 1 violet, but how many componenets in there? 2.</p>

              It never fails to bemuse me how you keep avoiding the need to grapple with the contents if the answers given but keep harping on the methodologies. So what if other Christians also use my methods? You mean you are that incompetent to evaluate the arguments? If that is so, then don't project your own incompetence and ignorance to everyone else.

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>1. I don't claim I am absolutely right, that would be to claim infallibility. But I would claim that I am absolutely right on SOME things, but tentatively right on other things. And for some things I am absolutely wrong.</p>
              <p>2. You know what's your problem dude? You claimed to want to know the right method ya? So let's grant your argument. Let's say someone finally declare there is a right method and claims that now everyone can know the truth. What then? You gonna just accept everything he says? No need to think anymore? I don't think so. You forget why people bled and died for the Bible to be made available to us in our vernacular language, it is such that people can be free to discover for themselves what the Bible says. You are simply wanting to be told what to believe, yet you keep harping that Christians are just being told what to believe. You are really one inconsistent dude!</p>
              <p>3. It is much better and to be preferred that people read the Bible for themselves and diligently study it, debate over it, and mature in their understanding of the Bible over time than to check their brains at the door and blindly accept that someone has the right interpretation and just accept it as it is.</p>

              <p>1. Can you highlight to me which thinga about Christianity and God that you are not 100% about? Cos it seems that all throughout our convo, you were always right? I need to know which issues about Christianity and God you arenot 100% sure about? Thanks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Yes if you give me a different method from what the other camps of christians, I will believe you. Because up to now, you keep telling me your interpretation about "certain" issues is correct by praying, reading scripture and articles. But thats what other christians do too, to COUNTER YOUR interpretations.</p>

              <p>yea and another christian who counters your interpetation will also say to you "<span style="font-size: 15px;"> </span><span style="font-size: 15px;">It is much better and to be preferred that people read the Bible for themselves and diligently study it, debate over it, and mature in their understanding of the Bible over time than to check their brains at the door and blindly accept that someone has the right interpretation and just accept it as it is."</span></p>
