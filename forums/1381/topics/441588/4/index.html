              <p>Ah, finally someone get the message! Now, let's be clear on this, it seems that you are NOT quibbling on methodology here (be it street or door to door or flyers), but the CONTENT of the preaching. To you, it is insulting and degrading to say that truth is exclusive, that only one is right and the others are wrong. Is this your position? Please confirm.</p>

              <p>what truth? christian truth or universal truth? depending on whom you ask, if you ask xtians, hell its the truth, but if you ask non christians, hell no. go think and fathom what is wrong with the message. if you do not think there is something inherently wrong in this message, then you are leaning towards christian extremism and fundamentalism and that is wrong, cos we are living in a secular society here.</p>

              <p>I knew you would say this. But you are mistaken and confused about the notion of truth. 100 religions can say they have the truth, but the truth is that either all are wrong or only one is true. You said science is the arbiter of truth. Can you prove the truth of that claim? If you are a believer in relativism, then you have no grounds to say who is right or wrong, what is true or not. Unlike you, I am an absolutist. I am absolutely sure that there are absolutes in life, that some things are objective right and wrong, some things are objectively true and some things are objectively false.</p>

              <p>1. I think you are still missing the point! Tell me, do you think the truth exists as to whether there is a God or not? Or do you entertain the silly view that what's true for you is not true for me?</p>
              <p>2. Whether people concur on something or not is IRRELEVANT to the truth of that thing. A proposition (God exists) is either true or false. Call me names if you like, name-calling is not an argument for anything. I can call you a militant atheist also but that adds little to whether atheism is true or false. An atheist like you would insist that it is true that all religions are man-made and false. Do you for one second as an atheist would believe that there is a God? No. So why are you harping at me insisting that there is a God while you do not see that you are just as insistent that there is no God? You can insist on your beliefs being true but I cannot? Double standards!</p>
              <p>3. You speak condescendingly of people who lived a couple of centuries. CS Lewis called your kind of attitude CHRONOLOGICAL SNOBBERY. You think people in the past are dimwits who simply believe what has been told them and who exhibit no semblance of rational or critical thinking. Again may I remind you that the science that you speak of owes it existence and rise to the Bible and its influence on the pioneers of modern science. Why do you think modern science arose and took root in the West? The East has its discoveries and inventions but somehow it never took the world by storm. You know why? Go find out.</p>

              <p>1. No one knows. You do not know and I do not know because we do
              not have all knowledge. I am not sure if there is a supreme being
              beyond our universe. BUT one thing I am sure is that the religions
              available today are not enough to represent this "supreme
              being"</p>

              I suppose it doesn't dawn on you that it was a lazy cop out on your part. Instead of finding out you just declare no one knows.
              
              If you are unsure if there is a God, then you should change your label to agnostic. Funny that you can be so sure in one instance when just the previous sentence you are unsure. I guess you suka suka decide what can be known?

              Muse over this ;
              A pickpocket  was trailing a gem merchant and wanted very much to get hold of this gem â€“ he tried all means and ways and to no avail and in spite of that was still trying; all this time the merchant knew what he was up to and allowed the thief to be and when an opportunity rose he dropped the precious gem into the pocket of the thief.
              After a lapse of some moments, the pickpocket out of his frustration blurted out that he was a professional in pickpocketing and queried where is the gem as it could not even find it in the merchant!
              To that the merchant replied â€“ I put it where u would LEAST look for it â€“ in your pocket!
              This allegory illustrates the predicament of searching in the â€™â€™wrongâ€™â€™ places and hoping to find â€¦.
              
              Eg :When I practice a particular â€¦. thinking that I am a particular â€¦. looking for a particular â€¦ eg merits or to arrive someday somewhere I m merely spinning on my fictional self â€“ I am playing mind games!
              That was before and that which is now and that which may appear is all happening in the nowhere. Existence preceded essence. Till the latter is unreconciled one is simply spinning around and moving further away from what always was and is always is.
              
              PS - One has to be wary of the traps of scirptural concepts and understand that it is no difference with worldly knowledge. There is no such thing as Christian truth, Hindu truth, Muslim trtuh or ... any religion that points to what is true is real religion.

              <p>Practically you live like an atheist. But epistemologically speaking you are an agnostic. In short, you don't live as you believe. Also, you really need to be sure what atheism entails. If you even entertain the notion that you are unsure then it means you are an agnostic. You should then say evidence is lacking to conclude that there is certainly no God, but you BELIEVE that there is none.</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>1. You are again guilty of distorting my beliefs. For the thousandth time, I do not believe that everything in the world is black or white. No where did I say that there are no grey areas. I clearly said that where the Bible is silent we can exercise Christian liberty and charity. You obviously went "lalalala" over what I said. A propositional statement is either right or wrong, true or false. Disagree with me and you should go back to elementary school or take a starter course on Logic 101.</p>
              <p>2. You claim the label of atheist, but you are wearing the WRONG label. Perhaps this is just your blind spot. You reject God based on there being lack of evidence, but this rejection is NOT justified. You can of course insist on being an atheist, but when push comes to shove, you are not an atheist. An atheist confidently asserts "there is NO God." The moment you say "MAYBE there is a God" you cease to be an atheist.</p>
              <p>3. Quit playing semantics here. Redefining atheism as a lack of belief is but a RECENT debate strategy to evade the burden of having to defend your beliefs. An atheist don't just do not have God in his life, an atheist believe at least in the following:</p>
              <p>1. I believe that matter is all there is.</p>
              <p>2. I believe that life came from nonliving matter billions of years ago. </p>
              <p>3. From 2, I believe that I am the product of evolution over billions of years.</p>
              <p>4. I believe that I am related by common ancestry to the swinging monkeys in the tree, the probosis monkey, and the baboon. </p>
              <p>That's just a sampling of beliefs of the atheist. Negatively speaking of course it means</p>
              <p>1. There is no God</p>
              <p>2. There is no purpose and intelligent design to life</p>
              <p>3. There is no creation of humans or animals according to their kinds etc etc</p>
              <p>You wanna call all these a "lack" of beliefs, be my guest. Any discerning person can see through the semantic smokescreen and call your bluff on it.</p>

              <p>Rooney,</p>
              <p>I take it as a compliment that you would fault me with possessing a Biblical worldview. The problem with many Christians today is that they lack such a worldview. I am surprised though that you actually hold to the correspondence theory of truth,, that truth means that which corresponds to reality. Perhaps you have forgotten what I have said earlier regarding that? There is ONE reality, with many ways of looking at it, but only ONE worldview will correspond with reality. And I have briefly laid them out as</p>
              <p>1. Theism</p>
              <p>2. Atheism</p>
              <p>3. Pantheism</p>
