              <p><br> Truth is, one doesn't need the Bible to demolish atheism. But one
              needs the Bible to get the right worldview and to provide Biblical
              answers. Sure there are those who reject God, but that should not
              be confused with refuting the arguments for God. And you have for
              the umpteenth time failed to substantiate your polemical assaults

              <p>I am not surprised. you know how their beliefs works despite the flaws and illogic that comes with it. they will continue to defend their beliefs no matter how illogical and irrational it is, because in their perception, only their religion is true and all others are false and satanic and that we are going to hell. this is just naivety and deluded isnt it.</p>

              <p>The best way to argue with a christian is to own belief patterns against them.</p>
              <p>And because all religions work the same way, the best way is to use religion comparison to argue with them.</p>
              <p>You will see them accepting their own religion and rejecting other religions when both basically work the same way, just because of personal bias!</p>

              <p>Can you explain WHY if I believe in the Bible's account of creation it means I also have to believe all other creation accounts found in other religions? What's the rationale? I will help you differentiate if you can first justify your assumption that the Bible is not any different from any other religious book and must be placed on equal footing or validity.</p>

              <p>Dude, you no longer belong to the category of the sincere person who seeks answers to sincere questions. You have already decided that Christianity is false. Right now you are just throwing questions (not really wanting to hear the answers) just to justify your rejection of Christianity. Everyone is also making claims here, atheists included. Please spare the crap of Christians pushing these claims to everyone. The Bible does not teach that we are to compel people to believe, and even if some Christians do that it is not because they are acting consistently with the Bible's teachings. And it is not about who make more claims, it is about whether the claims are true.</p>

              <p>INTELLECTUAL LAZINESS??!</p>
              <p>It IS impossible to know the truth. But that doesn't mean I am intellectually-lazy. Tbh, a lot of Christians do not like it when science is used to disprove the existence of god, or if science is used to prove that religiousness is purely a mental construct that has no real basis of truth.</p>
              <p>But science is what makes the world go round. You and I and everyone else lives with science. We have computers, laptops etc thanks to science.</p>
              <p>If science disproves the existence of god and proves that religiousness is purely a mental construct, why don't you believe it?</p>
              <p>No. I do not need to explain why I think the gods of each and every religion is the same. I don't belief that, because I have no proof. I will not believe in something that has no proof. I was merely stating that it is food for thought, it COULD BE a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">possibility</span>.</p>
