              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>1. The NT Gospel writers all claim to record things said by Jesus or done by Him. Your "no one will ever know" basically renders ALL historical knowledge suspect. Is that where you want to go? How will you ever know if we are all not merely brains in a vat? Being skeptical is OK if it is healthy skepticism, but being cynical is another thing.</p>
              <p>2. On what basis do you think that Jesus was not dead as in really dead?</p>
              <p>3. Concerning Jonah's three days in the belly of the fish, aren't you missing something? In the same way, no human being can be really dead for three days and then come back to life. In the same vein no donkey or snake is gonna talk anytime soon. But the thing you are missing here is the hand of God in all this. And it's not that the Bible is vague, but that the Hebrew language is such that some words can have certain vagueness and depends on context. And I would challenge the view that anything can be misconstrued in the Bible.</p>
              <p>4. You don't seem that informed about the Bible, though you claimed to have some kind of Christian or church background. Read Exodus 20 please. Yours is an argument by incredulity. If it sounds incredulous then it must be false. Anything that is miraculous -- such as predictive prophecy -- is dismissed out of hand. Sometimes a touch of insult is added upon those who believe in miracles. Even if you think your argument is logical and plausible, it does not mean your view is true.</p>
              <p>5. Yes, the Bible was written by humans for humans. But it was not just a human book. Paul claimed that ALL Scripture is God-breathed i.e. God is the divine author who spoke through humans. You said the Bible has been re-written many times. Where's your evidence? Or is this just your opinion? And then as if to excuse yourself from having to prove anything you conveniently come up with the "how would anyone know?" kind of question.</p>
              <p>6. To say that you find the Bible hard to believe is very subjective. It depends very much on your worldview. If you hold to naturalism as a belief system, anything that hints at the supernatural is hard to believe. But truth is, even atheism is hard to believe. Why? Because atheism says that the universe made itself from nothing. You find that easy to believe?</p>

              <p>1. I happen to have a healthy dose of skepticism, thank you. I just agree to take everything with a pinch of salt.</p>
              <p>2. On what basis do you think that Jesus was really dead? Medical technology was not there then. Majority of the people were not that highly educated. Point proven - I've told you about Criss Angel, have I not? It is just MY <span style="text-decoration: underline;">theory</span>, I'm not saying it's true, so keep your hair on.</p>
              <p>3. "the Hebrew language is such that some words can have certain vagueness and depends on context." There you go..not saying you haven't, but have you considered the possibility that some people before you, in the very early times, miscontrued something and hence the bible has been this way since then?</p>
              <p>4. You seem to disbelieve that I have a Christian background. Anyway, this is out of point.</p>
              <p>5. It is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> an opinion. Why would I 'conveniently' try to 'excuse' myself from having to prove anything? WHICH book has never been re-written? You hold too much faith in humanity to think that the bible would not have been edited. I'm just saying, keep your mind open that the the bible has probably been edited. Just because there is no proof it was edited, does not mean it hasn't been.</p>
              <p>You are the one taking offense too easily. Very un-Christian like. Defend your faith, not carry out personal attacks on people.</p>
              <p>6. What makes you think I am atheist? I simply do not believe in God/religions. I'm not about to classify myself into a group. And to answer your question, Yes, the Atheist view is easier to believe. 'Nothing' can imply 'nothing that we can see with our naked eyes' which are atoms and molecules. I believe in the big bang theory and evolution. I do not believe in "Let there be light, and there was light".</p>

              <p>1. Do you also take a pinch of salt with your currently held views about the Bible?</p>
              <p>2. No historian of repute dispute the death of Jesus. What kind of medical technology do you need to ascertain that dead people stay dead in ancient times? </p>
              <p>3. We can entertain "possibilities" all day long over every conceivable thing. But what's the point of it? Again it seems to me that your view of things is more of a cynic than a skeptic. A healthy skeptic asks for evidence before believing. But you are more like asking "How you know we are all not brains in a vat?"</p>
              <p>4. Pardon my disbelief, but I am really skeptical of someone who claims to have some kind of Bible background but yet ask "Did God say cannot make idol and worship?"</p>
              <p>5. If you have no evidence to support the allegation that the Bible has been re-written and edited, why should it not be properly called an opinion? Else it would be an argument from ignorance you are invoking. And it wasn't a personal attack to suggest that you were taking a cop-out position. Just think, if you are already decided that "nobody really knows" then it makes all answers moot. I can give you all the evidence and you can just simply wave it off with a "well nobody really knows" dismissive answer.</p>
              <p>6. Whether you are an atheist or not I leave it to you to clarify. When dealing with nonbelievers I tend to assume I am dealing with atheists unless they have already identified themselves as belonging to another religion. By nothing I mean absolutely nothing, not unseen atoms. Thanks for telling me you BELIEVE in big bang and evolution. When we deal with the past it's pretty much boils down to belief since we cannot test it. So how does something come from absolutely nothing? How does life come from nonliving matter?</p>

              <p>God did not come from anywhere. There was never a time when God did not exist. God is eternal, i.e. He has always existed. And since God did not come from nothing, you don't have a case at all. In any case, it would be just as absurd for me to even believe that God came from nothing.</p>
              <p>Huh? Atheists don't believe in God because of the passages in the Bible? That's most weird. Now, even if the Bible is non-existent the issue of God's existence remains. While the existence of the Bible depends on God existing, the converse is not true. Sorry but you are not left off the hook still.</p>
              <p>Typos and printing errors are problems with PRINTING and PUBLISHING. This is not the same as saying that there are errors in the Bible when it was first written. Please make the proper distinction.</p>
              <p>I would need evidence that the Bible has indeed been edited, i.e. evidence that words have been taken out, put in, such that we know for sure that what we have got today was not what was originally written. BTW, if there was editing, how come it did not edit out the errors and inconsistencies? Why would "editors" still allow atheists to find so-called errors? Surely it would have been ironed out by the last century ya? Either the editors suck at their jobs or there's been no editing at all.</p>
              <p>It's good to ask questions, provided the questions have been well thought through.</p>

              <p>God created the universe and established the laws of nature which gave us rain, rainbow, evaporation etc. But before man fell into sin, there was no earthquake. we believe that <em>all</em> natural disasters are ultimately a consequence of man’s rebellion against God.

              <p>how convenient of you to attribute that to your almighty god, where the existence of your god is still debatable. utter nonsense.</p>
              <p>honestly the big bang theory is just a theory, but if you ask me, I rather trust big bang than a book written by some unknown ancient men. yeah sure the big bang is a hypothesis but at least it attempt to explain the origin of the universe using science. It  is a zillion times better than a book with so much inconsistency and paradoxes written 2012 years ago, where science and society are not advanced.</p>

              <p>EXCEPT that when the notion "Does God Exist?" is publicly debated, the atheist loses. See <a href="http://www.thinkatheist.com/forum/topics/why-are-so-many-atheists-losing">http://www.thinkatheist.com/forum/topics/why-are-so-many-atheists-losing</a></p>
              <p>But check out the lame reasoning of an atheist here when it comes to losing debates. He actually thinks that even when atheists lose they still win! LOL! <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/formal-debates-are-a-win-for-atheists">http://www.examiner.com/article/formal-debates-are-a-win-for-atheists</a></p>
              <p>You are CONFUSED about what the Big Bang Theory is. It is NOT science. In fact, it is a piece of naturalistic explanation of origins dressed up in scientific jargon. And I don't think you know the Big problems with the Big Bang.</p>
              <p>Do yourself a Big favour, see <a href="http://www.creationstudies.org/Education/big_bang.html">http://www.creationstudies.org/Education/big_bang.html</a> and <a href="http://creation.com/astronomy-and-astrophysics-questions-and-answers">http://creation.com/astronomy-and-astrophysics-questions-and-answers</a></p>
