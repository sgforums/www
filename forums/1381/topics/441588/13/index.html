              When one is always being rational, one is bound to forget the heart. It is reduced to an organ that pumps blood only. When ones lives only in the mind it is tantamount to being in a desert. Nothing grows there -- no flowers, not even an oasis.
              
              Reasoning (aka rationalizing) is fine n good as far as objects, dead objects are concerned; may work for scientific research it is the best instrument. For things, reason is the'' Ã­nstrument'' of discovery. However, the moment one  questions or a question arises about anything ''living'', reason is impotent. And if one were to ask for reason a question concerning life, love, peace .... it simply negates, as if these things don't exist.
              The dictionary meaning of existence and existenliasm is fine when one is looking for meaning. Good, useful in the marketplace or in an exam hall. Useless when it is still  a concept or a belief. All beleifs belie this fear and doubt. hence the constant defensive stance to justify one's ...  and where does one go to reinforce when it is not one in one's expereince - simply fall back on the past, regurgitate and prop onself again.  As long ti is not experientially true (aka existential experience) it is playing mind games and on closer scrutiny - merely intellectual masturbation. 
              
              Ps -  Martin Heidegger, Satre and the likes of Jasper overlooked this  - they depended only on reason and it was philosophizing.

              One's mirror that is thick with the dust of the past, cannot see clearly what is. One only sees what one wants to see, hence one misses! One cannot respond to what is. One merely reacts and all one does is use the past. Of course, the past is dead, it is only alive in the mind. The wise knows and accepts that the illusion of certainty cannot co-exist with existential uncertainty. At the most, one is clutching at straws of certainty!
              
              What can i say when the mind is utterly divisive which is the case lah - truth spoken is truth negated. Beliefs bind and what is being true (now) liberates.

              I think the bigger irony is that you don't seem to have any knowledge of what Christ taught in the Gospel. Why are you even harping on the point about Jesus never calling Himself a Christian? Does it even make sense for Jesus to have made such a profession?

              Jesus did not become what He was. He became what He was not, a human. He is God who emptied Himself to become one of us so that we can be in Him. You talk about love and loving, but the Bible teaches that God is love and that He so loved the world that He sent Jesus to die for our sins.

                  You failed to distinguish between those who play on the feelings of others and those who do not. Neither did Jesus played on the feelings of His hearers or taught it. So please stop poisoning the well on Christianity.
