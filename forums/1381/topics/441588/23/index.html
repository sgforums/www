              <p>Christians believe non-christians go to hell because it's their religion and their beliefs.</p>
              <p>It does not apply to everyone though and is not a universal truth.</p>
              <p>Every religion has its own "criteria" to go to heaven.</p>
              <p>For example, in Islam, you MUST be a muslim to go to heaven too.</p>
              <p>In some forms of Taoism, you must do good, believe in the Gods, pray to them to be able to enter heaven.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Hinduism, obedience to the Hindu Gods is a must to gain salvation too!</p>

              <p>I know that Christians believe non-Christians go to Hell. But WHY? On what basis? No one has ever been able to answer me that question.</p>
              <p>If the bible holds all the answers, why can none of the Christians answer me that simple question? What is salvation? Why is believing in God salvation?</p>
              <p>Religion is all a mental construct; people seek mental solace when they decide to 'join' a religion.</p>

              <p>Christians believe salvation is based on believing that jesus is god. Their method of salvation is BASICALLY TO BELIEVE that jesus died and he is god.</p>
              <p>They get this basis from their bible.</p>
              <p>Of course, as nonchristians, we question the authencity and credibility of a book writtened thousands of years ago by shepherds and fishermen, which contains many huge and "spiritual" claims like donkeys talking and men walking on water.</p>
              <p>Yes I agree with you that all religions are Man's doing.</p>

Hypocrite!  A real disgrace to God  Hypocritical like the PHARISEES in the bible.    Jesus had many times spoke about these hypocritical pharisees.    .   This I know those nice and well behaved christians will agree.    </p>

              <p>Question for christians....</p>
              <p>Jesus died for humankind...but I wonder....what if Jesus, was just a normal HUMAN being named Jesus, and not God's Son as people like to claim?</p>
              <p>And if he is raised to Idol status cos he 'died for us', why don't we have lots of cults and religions for all the war heroes who died serving their countries?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>EDIT : I read the bible before. I used to go to church for years (against my will), but I have never believed. My mind just refuses to swallow all the malarky. There are parts of the bible I agree with like "love thy neighbour as thyself" blah blah, teaching us how to be good.</p>
              <p>But the stories in there are just what they are - stories. Stories with morales maybe, but no truth. Whales can't swallow anything bigger than an orange - scientific fact.</p>
              <p>I don't agree with how we should Idolise and revere anything, human, object, spiritual. Didn't the bible say that Idolization is a sin?</p>

              <p>If the bible holds all the answers, why can none of the Christians answer me that simple question? What is salvation? Why is believing in God salvation?</p>

              <p>You asked, "I know that Christians believe non-Christians go to Hell. But WHY? On what basis? No one has ever been able to answer me that question."</p>
              <p>The simple answer would be "Because God says so in the Bible." The basis is that ALL have sinned and fallen short of God's glory. ALL are condemned before God because none of us are morally perfect. But God has made provision in Jesus Christ dying on the cross as an atonement for our sins. Those who believe ("believe" in the Bible is not just mere intellectual assent) in Jesus would be forgiven of their sins and saved from an eternal fire. Those who reject Jesus would not be saved but would perish in their sins in the lake of fire.</p>
              <p>Even if people seek mental solace by joining a religion, it does not invalidate the truth claims of the religion. Neither does it prove that religion is all a mental construct. In any case, this amounts to an ad hominem argument on your part.</p>

              <p>I know "God says so". But, WHY? Why does he say sinners have to pay (in spades) for their sins? No one is sinless. So that basically condemns the WHOLE human race to hell. Is this a forgiving God?</p>
              <p>Isn’t God ever-loving and ever-forgiving? Isn’t He omni-present? Isn’t He all-powerful? Didn’t He send his Son to die for us? Shouldn’t that cover non-believers as well?</p>
              <p>You know there are some people with warped logic who have said "oh, god forgives. So I shall just commit this crime and pray for forgiveness, god will forgive me. afterall, ask and thou shalt receive." I do not do that, just, how would you answer these people?</p>
              <p>BIC,</p>
              <p>I have asked a lot of people these questions. I have attended years of bible study classes. I have asked my cellgroup leaders, fellow church goers. I always get your type answers. NO convincing answers at all. All I'm asking, is for convincing answers. Is that so hard? God has to have a reason why he is condemning all sinners. According to the bible, he created man, he should know that probably more than half of his creation will be going to hell if that's what he decrees.</p>

              <p>Question for christians....</p>
              <p>Jesus died for humankind...but I wonder....what if Jesus, was just a normal HUMAN being named Jesus, and not God's Son as people like to claim?</p>
              <p>And if he is raised to Idol status cos he 'died for us', why don't we have lots of cults and religions for all the war heroes who died serving their countries?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>EDIT : I read the bible before. I used to go to church for years (against my will), but I have never believed. My mind just refuses to swallow all the malarky. There are parts of the bible I agree with like "love thy neighbour as thyself" blah blah, teaching us how to be good.</p>
              <p>But the stories in there are just what they are - stories. Stories with morales maybe, but no truth. Whales can't swallow anything bigger than an orange - scientific fact.</p>
              <p>I don't agree with how we should Idolise and revere anything, human, object, spiritual. Didn't the bible say that Idolization is a sin?</p>

              <p>1. If Jesus was a mere man like you or me, then He is nothing more than just another religious guy. But He will certainly be the worst of men since He would have been guilty of making grand claims about Himself and leading people. He would have been the world greatest fraud and liar. No normal human being would make the kind of claims He made.</p>
              <p>In his famous book <a href="http://www.cslewis.org/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Mere Christianity</span></span></a>, Lewis makes this statement, "<em>A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic - on the level with a man who says he is a poached egg - or he would be the devil of hell. You must take your choice. Either this was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us</em>."</p>
              <p>2. The difference between Jesus dying for us, and other humans dying for us, is that Jesus ROSE from the dead thus vindicating His claims to deity and deserving our worship. Perhaps there are many people who have been idolised for their sacrifices for the greater good, but rational people know better than to give worship to mere man. But Jesus was not just a man.</p>
              <p>3. On what basis do you conclude that the contents in the Bible are not truth but just fiction stories? And I think you were referring to Jonah in mentioning about the whale's inability to swallow an orange. But who told you that a whale swallowed Jonah? The Bible mentioned it was a big fish. But if a sperm whale can eat a giant squid (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/04/rare-photos-sperm-whale-e_n_345506.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/04/rare-photos-sperm-whale-e_n_345506.html</a>), who knows maybe it was one that swallowed Jonah? And maybe Jonah was not a big man?</p>

              <p>Why do we have to compensate someone if we have wronged them? This is called justice. How much more then when it comes to offending God who is holy and eternal? Offence against an infinite God would merit infinite/eternal punishment.</p>
              <p>Yes, the Bible teaches that the entire human race is condemned, we are all dead in Adam. But Jesus the Last Adam came to die for our sins. Those who believe on Him will be clothed with Christ's righteousness. This provision is made available to ALL but not everyone wants it. The choice is yours to make.</p>
              <p>And if you can show me a person who claims to be a true Christian but does all kind of evil acts and crimes thinking that he will simply be forgiven, then I will show you a person who distorts the Word of God and is not a true Christian. Even Jesus told the woman caught in adultery to "Go and sin no more". What does that tell you?</p>
              <p>I can only tell you what the Biblical answer is, convincing or not is besides the point. I see my role as communicating the truth of God's Word to nonbelievers. But there will also be some people who have decided that they will not and do not want to be convinced, regardless of the reasons given.</p>

              <p>1. If Jesus was a mere man like you or me, then He is nothing more than just another religious guy. But He will certainly be the worst of men since He would have been guilty of making grand claims about Himself and leading people. He would have been the world greatest fraud and liar. No normal human being would make the kind of claims He made.</p>
              <p>In his famous book <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cslewis.org/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Mere Christianity</span></span></a>, Lewis makes this statement, "<em>A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic - on the level with a man who says he is a poached egg - or he would be the devil of hell. You must take your choice. Either this was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us</em>."</p>
              <p>2. The difference between Jesus dying for us, and other humans dying for us, is that Jesus ROSE from the dead thus vindicating His claims to deity and deserving our worship. Perhaps there are many people who have been idolised for their sacrifices for the greater good, but rational people know better than to give worship to mere man. But Jesus was not just a man.</p>
              <p>3. On what basis do you conclude that the contents in the Bible are not truth but just fiction stories? And I think you were referring to Jonah in mentioning about the whale's inability to swallow an orange. But who told you that a whale swallowed Jonah? The Bible mentioned it was a big fish.

              <p>2. Ok, so Jesus rose from the dead. You know there are drugs that slow down the body organs to the point that that person seems dead?</p>

              <p>In the book of Jonah the Hebrew word for the sea creature is <span class="hebrewtext">×“×’</span> <em>dag</em>, meaning ‘fish’. In the New Testament, the Greek word used by Matthew was <span class="greektext">κÎ®τος</span> <em>kÄ“tos, </em>meaning ‘sea monster’, and is so rendered in the Revised Version margin. The <em>King James Version</em> translators translated this term as ‘whale’, possibly because it was the largest sea creature of which they knew. What the text says is that ‘<span class="scripture">God had prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah</span>’ (<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=JONAH+1:17&amp;language=english&amp;version=ESV&amp;showfn=on"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Jonah 1:17</span></span></a>). The words imply either a special act of creation, or of modification of an existing sea creature to accommodate Jonah safely. Jonah prayed to God ‘<span class="scripture">out of the fish’s belly</span>’ (<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=JONAH+2:1&amp;language=english&amp;version=ESV&amp;showfn=on"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Jonah 2:1</span></span></a>). ‘Belly’ is a fairly vague term in English, let alone in ancient Hebrew, so if Jonah was swallowed by a creature such as a sperm whale, he might have been in the great laryngeal pouch; if by a shark, he may have been in the stomach of a creature specially prepared by God to protect him from the effects of its gastric juices.</p>
              <p>The bible is so vague. Anything can be miscontrued.</p>

              <p>We have Criss Angel. And this is 2012, people STILL find it hard to believe their eyes, despite our new technological advances, despite being so much more highly educated.</p>
              <p>Could we not have a 'Criss Angel' in those times too? People will have been much easier to fool, believe me.</p>
              <p>The bible was written by humans, for humans. It has been re-written so many times. How would one know if old stuff was taken out and new things added? Stories, even if true, would change. There are so many flaws.</p>
              <p>The more I read the bible, the more incredulous I get. It is not a matter of whether or not people want to be convinced or not; the bible is just so hard to believe for most people.</p>

              <p>1. The NT Gospel writers all claim to record things said by Jesus or done by Him. Your "no one will ever know" basically renders ALL historical knowledge suspect. Is that where you want to go? How will you ever know if we are all not merely brains in a vat? Being skeptical is OK if it is healthy skepticism, but being cynical is another thing.</p>
              <p>2. On what basis do you think that Jesus was not dead as in really dead?</p>
              <p>3. Concerning Jonah's three days in the belly of the fish, aren't you missing something? In the same way, no human being can be really dead for three days and then come back to life. In the same vein no donkey or snake is gonna talk anytime soon. But the thing you are missing here is the hand of God in all this. And it's not that the Bible is vague, but that the Hebrew language is such that some words can have certain vagueness and depends on context. And I would challenge the view that anything can be misconstrued in the Bible.</p>
              <p>4. You don't seem that informed about the Bible, though you claimed to have some kind of Christian or church background. Read Exodus 20 please. Yours is an argument by incredulity. If it sounds incredulous then it must be false. Anything that is miraculous -- such as predictive prophecy -- is dismissed out of hand. Sometimes a touch of insult is added upon those who believe in miracles. Even if you think your argument is logical and plausible, it does not mean your view is true.</p>
              <p>5. Yes, the Bible was written by humans for humans. But it was not just a human book. Paul claimed that ALL Scripture is God-breathed i.e. God is the divine author who spoke through humans. You said the Bible has been re-written many times. Where's your evidence? Or is this just your opinion? And then as if to excuse yourself from having to prove anything you conveniently come up with the "how would anyone know?" kind of question.</p>
              <p>6. To say that you find the Bible hard to believe is very subjective. It depends very much on your worldview. If you hold to naturalism as a belief system, anything that hints at the supernatural is hard to believe. But truth is, even atheism is hard to believe. Why? Because atheism says that the universe made itself from nothing. You find that easy to believe?</p>

              <p>i would like to add on a little here about whether the bible is God's word...i do not affirm that it can be proven but wad i offer is an illustration which deem it possible for the bible to be God's Word...</p>
              <p>Say today, I want something to be written and I tell BIC: hey can u do me this favour? write on a piece of paper these words:'' today is 3rd of May 2012, its a sunny day.'' qn: '' today is 3rd of May 2012, its a sunny day.'' Whose words are those? Now BIC is the one who wrote the words BUT whose words are those? mine or his? the bible is God's Word cos God instructed some people to write them. Technically, we can say that man wrote the bible but the words of the original Hebrew-Greek bible are not from the people who wrote them. Thats what christians affirm.</p>
              <p>so now, imagine 2000yrs have passed. some people are asking:'' how do we noe the words on that piece of paper came from despondent? knowing tat everyone who lived 2000back are all dead, is tat possible to be proven? is it reasonable to ask for a proof in this? IMO, no...</p>
