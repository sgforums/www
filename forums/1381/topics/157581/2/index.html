We humans can never understand what God is doing no matter how high iq we r. Maybe some of u with iq 150-200 could but not me cos dont belong to gifted stream. And those with iq&lt;100 might have some difficulty also. This is a real life eg here. Try preaching to a educationally subnormal or mentally impaired person. You just cant unless God helps us. They just cant understand God like those who are smarter. Maybe God in their own terms then they understand like trusting by faith. They need more faith u know bcos cant understand what the heck people talking abt-all the chim english bombarstic words. Sometimes i dont even understand also.</div>

And notice the order ?  Heart - Soul - Strength - Mind.  As mentioned by the brothers and sisters here, intelligence can know that we need to love God - but the heart can say No.  Possible ? Yes - The Pharisees can tell you that is it possible because of the following:<br><br>"Where your heart is, your teasure will be" - Matthew 6:21.<br><br>Re-new our mind with God's Word - why ? less sometimes it be corrupted by the pride of our own intelligence.<br><br>There you have it - you answered your own doubts.  At all times, God speaks gently and simply. Its only sometimes, we read too much into what He is trying to say.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting ideas, John the Baptist.<br><br>You've got to love Christianity.  A good man can go to hell because he comits a sin a moment before death.  A sinner can go to heaven because he repents of his sins a moment before death.  A non-Christian can go to hell because he doesn't believe in Christ even if he hasn't heard of him!  (okay, the last one is from a couple of  Jehovah's Witnesses who knocked at our door)<br><br>Christianity is political, and features moral judgements as determined by the conservative social norms of the day.  As a man dear to me says,<br><br>"if there is a God, a King of the universe, then he is a great God. Any attempt to present a mean, nasty, small-minded or deceiving being as Lord of creation can be dismissed as kids' stuff or worse, and of zero probability." .<br><br></div>
