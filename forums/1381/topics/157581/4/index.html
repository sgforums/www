Why ask me?<br><br>Method could be: Gather in one place in gps of 100s &amp; pray &amp; wait for the Holy Spirit to come.<br><br>Manifestation could be: A rushing in like a mighty wind with loud noise with tongues of fire falling on the heads of believers &amp; everyone starts to speak in a foreign language.<br><br>Consequences could be: So that everyone will hear &amp; come rushing to see what the heaven is happening there &amp; hear the disciples speaking in their own native tongues even though they are unschooled fishermen, tax collectors, zealots, ex-pros, ex-sinners etc. &amp; then the leader will stand up &amp; give a heart cutting speech so that 1000s will be saved.<br><br>Btw, this is only one of the method, manifestation &amp; consequences listed.

            <div class='col-md body'>Referring to someone's something to satanic tongues.. the speaking in tongues in christianity is due to an outpouring of the holy spirit. I'm quoting the below from some booklet thingy..<br><br><u>Q: Is it possible for an interpretation of tongues to run contrary from the teachings of the bible?</u><br><br>A: if the holy spiriit has authentically inspired the intepretation, it will never contradict the teachings of the bible. if it is contrary to the scripture, it is out of order and must be ruled so. the bible is the measure by which all utterances must be judged. the scriptures cannot be contradicted. [Psalm 119:89; Matt 5:18; 24:35; 1 Peter 1:25] They are complete and cannot be added to. [Rev 22:18,19]<br><br>paul did not hesitate to establish guidelines within which the gifts of the Spirit must operate. he stated that any utterance, message or gift expression must line up with scripture and be judged by it. he declared that God's messenger, whether speaking with a prophetic word or in tongues followed by interpretation, must rule his own spirit and submit always to the guidelines of scriptural truth. [1 Cor 14:33,40; 1 John 4:1-3]<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------<br><br><u>Q: Since in 1 Cor 14:19 paul said that it is better to speak intelligibly than in tongues in church, why speak in tongues then?</u><br><br>It does seem contradictory when paul says "i thank God that i speak in tongues more than all of you. but in the church i would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue." [1 Cor 14:18,19] the seeming contradiction evaporates when we examine the chapter more fully. <i>paul was addressing a specific problem in the church at Corinth, namely, spontaneous utterances in tounges at an assembly of believers without accompanying intepretations. he equated this with disorder and confusion. [1 Cor 14:13, 32,33] he purposely exaggerated ("ten thousand words") to make his point. it was not made to invalidate the benifit and the use of tongues, but to bring order to the church. actually he encouraged the exercise of the spiritual gift of tongues and intepretation of tounges by explaining in some detail how they should operate. [1 Cor 14:26-33] Also he placed great value on tounges in a believer's life. [1 Cor 14:4]<br><br>when biblical truths fall into obscurity and neglect, people often seek explainations. when speaking in tongues is no longer experienced, and they ask the reason, critics have answered by isolating this particular statement and giving it an unsound meaning.<br><br>Paul was not opposed to tounges.
