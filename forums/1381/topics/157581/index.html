            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, do you know Christians can go to hell? I believe much of the war generated here b/w me &amp; certain other ppl r bcos of what unpleasant experiences we had w Christians &amp; the severe rejection we faced in church. Let me share some of my experiences.<br><br>One reason why i backslided last time was i see so much hypocrisy &amp; politics in church, from gossip mongers to backstabbers. Name any kind of office politics &amp; u have them in church politics. Of course, there r other personal reasons w/c r not convenient to share here. Ppl just ignored me in church. Pastors even counsellors sent me here &amp; there, resulting in much confusion &amp; anger. Worse in megachurches. They dont even heck care me. They want ppl to join cell grps but i just couldn't fit in. Christians &amp; non christians alike have labelled me antisocial, proud, gay, insane, faithless, uncircumcised in heart &amp; ear, stubborn, etc etc. &amp; the list goes on forever.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But there's another side to church. When i was in hospital, Christians visited me even pastors. Some Christians &amp; pastors really cared by bringing me to church &amp; prayer. I know who r the real ones &amp; who r my true friends. But sometimes even real frens can betray us. Even pastors &amp; leaders! Yes, Amen? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Even father &amp; mother can forsake us, but God will never forsake me. Nobody not even satan can snatch me from Jesus' hand. Neither death nor life, nor angels nor demons, nor things present, nor things to come, nor persecution, nor famine, nor distress, nor hunger, nor pain, nor sorrow, nor hypocrites, nor govt, nor corrupted ppl, nor rich men, nor poor men, nor unfair rejection, nor unkind words, nor stupid morons, nor crazy fanatics, nor unreasonable bigots, nor pride, nor oppressors, nor insane ppl, nor politicians, nor untrue media reports, nor slanderers, nor liars, nor homos, nor myself will be able to separate me from the love of God w/c is in Christ Jesus my Lord.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Yes, do u know Christians can go to hell? What did Jesus say? If we renounce Him in front of men, He will renounce us in front of God! No pt twisting the message of grace. God knows all our secret thots. His eye searches the hearts of all humans. He knows whether we did something for ourselves, for others or for Jesus. He knows the rejection we r feeling now as He bottles up our tears. Even God's anointed like King Saul can betray God &amp; persecute Christians like King David. So learn from David's story in the Psalms, Chronicles, Kings etc. Even brothers in Christ like Rueben, Judah, Simeon, Asher, Gad, Ephraim, Dan, Levi, etc  can betray a brother like Joseph. But God meant it for good &amp; God will use all the betrayed brothers &amp; sisters to help these betrayers. God will raise up Davids &amp; Josephs to estab His Kingdom &amp; help the world.<br><br>Are you feeling lonely, rejected, hateful, bitter, depressed, sick, unloved, poor, sinful, angry, revengeful, mad, jealous, envious, unfair etc right now? Go to Jesus in prayer. Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God &amp; He will exalt u in due time. But not to take revenge bcos vengeance belongs to God alone. He will vindicate. He will speak up with His thunderous voice &amp; all creation will bow down b4 Him. The mountains melt like wax &amp; the hills are leveled in His presence. God is laughing from heaven &amp; waiting to put His enemies permanently under His footstool. Why do the gentiles rage &amp; the nations plot in vain? They set a snare to snare God's ppl but they themselves will fall into the trap &amp; perish. All glory &amp; thanks &amp; praise to God who is from everlasting to everlasting &amp; there is none besides Him! Hallelujah! Maranatha! Grace &amp; mercy &amp; truth be with you all! In Jesus' name, Amen. Come Lord Jesus. Amen. It is done! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

People who rejects Jesus ARE NOT CHRISTIANS, even though they may be once our brethren.<br><br>I don't know what you mean about being "betrayed"? Do I sense that you have issues with relationship with people? May I ask what your background is: stuff like age group, working/student etc? While on the surface of your posts talks a lot about some odd theological interpretation, the under layer of the content is about your emotional turmoils. It is indeed troubling......<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>JTB, pouring out your sorrow on a forum like this will not help you. you should find somebody to talk to, personally, face to face. Find another church pastor, if you do not trust your current pastors. May be go to a smaller church where the pastors are closer to the ppl.<br><br>Your post, especially the title, is very misleading and is casting the salvation of Jesus in doubt, you might be doing more harm here then you think.<br><br>Take time to pray, talk to a pastor and may be don't write anymore for the time being.</div>
