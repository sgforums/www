            <div class='col-md body'>I repeat Christians cannot got to hell when they have already accepted Jesus as their Lord &amp; Saviour &amp; trusted in His salvation. Those witches sent by the covens have led me astray. U better tell them to watch out for cursing me so much. I will expose all of them if they still dont watch out. These are those who are the goats who torture Christians &amp; are fake believers even speaking in tongues. Satanic tongues.<br><br>Neither death nor life nor principality nor powers nor angels etc can separate us from the love of God which is in Chris Jesus our Lord! I die, live, oppressed by demons etc will not get me to hell. I will cling on to the Blood of Jesus &amp; these will be condemned to hell ppl with severe delusions. U better tell them to watch out. Now i know who are the witches &amp; who try to disturb me &amp; lead me astray. They had better repent or they will face the consequences. U want me to list their names one by one?</div>
