In the eyes of the 62-year-old Baptist minister, God was behind his marriage last year to a pretty young Filipina girl, 40 years his junior.<br><br>And at a time when he could have been forgiven for considering retirement and a quieter pace of life, his unwavering faith was also behind his decision to leave his home in Warrington, Cheshire, and move to the marshy wilderness of the southern Philippines with his young bride.<br><br>There on the wild, rural island of Mindanao, Brash preached that tragedies and disasters were God's punishment for the "sin of mankind", unaware that the most evil sin of all was being plotted against him.<br><br>Last week, barely a month after he left the UK for the last time, the deeply religious missionary's badly burnt body was recovered from a swamp in the village of Barangay Tagapira.<br><br>It has yet to be formally identified, but his 22-year-old wife Annalyn has, according to Filipino authorities, already confessed to paying two men to have him killed.<br><br>In addition, she has been charged with the crime of "parricide" - a strangely archaic term which usually refers to the killing of a parent or close relative.<br><br>From the point of view of the Filipino police, the case is as good as closed. Two men, Renante Puerto Prado, Brash's 22-year-old driver, and Noah Martinez Noah, 30, have also been charged with the minister's murder despite the fact that they are still on the run.<br><br>But in a country notorious for corruption, the investigation into Mr Brash's death is still mired in confusion and rumour.<br><br>Now, the Mail has pieced together the extraordinary series of events which led to this complex man's brutal murder.<br><br>According to local media reports, Mr Brash's wife Annalyn and suspected hitman Prado were lovers. Annalyn is also alleged to have told police her husband was beating her.<br><br>Could such a serious allegation against this man of God really be true, or is it her attempt to defend her actions in arranging his death?<br><br>Just hours before confessing to the police, she sent a text message to a Filipino pastor who had been best man at her wedding to Brash, begging for forgiveness and prayer, and admitting that she had succumbed to "anger, emotion and temptation".<br><br>Back in Britain, Brash's former wife, 61-year-old Veronica, and their two sons, Andrew, 36, and Ian, 35, are struggling to come to terms with his death, as are members of Runcorn Independent Baptist Church, who waved him off on his missionary dream last month.<br><br>And yet the meticulous diaries Brash kept for the past five years and posted on his personal website give clues to the dangers he faced, long before he married a young woman who appears to have led him to a terrible and agonising death.<br><br>Ultimately, David Brash was an idealist. He believed in the goodness of people, and his blinding faith left him vulnerable to being exploited.<br><br>According to friends, he embraced his new life in the Philippines with typical zeal, seemingly uncaring that his new home was in what the Foreign Office describes as a "no-go area".<br><br>He became embroiled in a world shrouded in church corruption and financial scams. When he died, according to his diaries, he was on the brink of exposing the lies he had encountered.<br><br>But five years ago, Brash was living a different, far more ordinary life.<br><br>The farm labourer's son, who was born and bred in Liverpool and Cheshire, ran his own one-man computer repair company and devoted most of his spare time to his church. His wife Veronica and two sons completed the happy family picture.<br><br>Then, in February 2002, he received an e-mail invitation from pastor Edgar Burgonios, whose church was on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. Brash visited for two weeks the following August, a trip he later described as "life-changing".<br><br>"After years of plodding along in a small church, my horizons have widened considerably," he said.<br><br>He was bowled over and flattered by the chance to preach to seemingly adoring crowds of foreigners and as soon as he arrived back in the UK, he began excitedly planning his next trip.<br><br>That took place in May 2003. This time, Brash began distributing heavily- discounted Bibles wherever he could.<br><br>But he also soon found himself caught in what he later discovered to be a financial scam - allegedly at the hands of Edgar Burgonios, the man who had originally invited him to the islands.<br><br>Brash used his own credit card to obtain cash to buy land after Burgonios said it would be used to build a church and an orphanage.<br><br>That he did so without question might be seen, by some, as an example of his selfless generosity. Others would regard it simply as a deep-seated naivety. In his diary, Brash wrote: "Truly the Lord was at work. Add to that the fact that I was there and able to lay my hands on money instantly, and you can see the Lord's timing. The building project certainly has the Lord's seal upon it."<br><br>But during his next trip to the Philippines, in the summer of 2004, Brash began to suspect his friend's motives.<br><br>After discovering that the pastor had bought the land in his own name - and not the church's - Brash appears to have seen the light (as he might have put it) and took legal action to try to get his money back, having told friends that he had uncovered corruption.<br><br>Later, during another visit to the island, he finally confronted the pastor and his wife.<br><br>He wrote: "If they want me to drop my action they must cooperate fully with my lawyer (I doubt that they will). I told them that I was fed up with being lied to by Christians, that those who tell lies about me are not my friends."<br><br>By now, he had met Annalyn, the young teenage girl who would eventually become his second wife. Their paths first crossed in August 2004, after which he told friends he "got on very well" with the 19-year-old, whose mother worked for the local Pentecostal church.<br><br>But it seems their friendship grew the more he went to visit the island - a situation which appears to have made him a target for enemies and detractors.<br><br>During one church tour, he found that only two hotel rooms had been booked for himself, his "lady assistant" and their driver.<br><br>He recalled: "To my amazement, the pastor booked the young lady and myself into the double room, in spite of my protests. 'Say that she is your daughter,' I was told.<br><br>"After the pastor had departed we swopped around so that the young lady had the single room.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/12_02/058AnnalynBrash_228x257.jpg"><br><br>"I was baffled by what had been arranged. The idea of a white man (an 'Americano') sharing a room with a Filipina means only one thing to Filipinos - immorality.<br><br>"I said at the time that the only reason I could think of for him doing that was to discredit my ministry."<br><br>Was this the case, or could it be that there was more to the relationship than he was prepared to admit?<br><br>In fact, rumours were already rife that Brash was having an affair with the young woman. Back in Britain, his overseas trips appeared to be taking a toll on his marriage, and by the end of 2004 he and his wife Veronica were divorcing.<br><br>Over the course of the next two years, Brash lived mostly in Cheshire as he came to terms with the fact that there was to be no prospect of a reconciliation with Veronica.<br><br>At one point he recalled: "In the two years since my wife got her divorce, she refused to have anything to do with me.<br><br>"When we met at a meeting in another church, she would not acknowledge me even though I greeted her in a friendly manner.<br><br>"I waited patiently for her, but my family advised me that she had made a new life without me and that our marriage was definitely finished."<br><br>No doubt that was the reason he felt it would be acceptable to make a new life in the Philippines - and that a new wife some 40 years his junior would be the perfect companion in his ministry.<br><br>Having grown increasingly close to Annalyn, he married her on October 7, 2007, in the Provincial Training Centre near his wife's family home in Agusan del Sur. The traditional white wedding cost him around Â£800, and the couple honeymooned on an island paradise favoured by romantic couples.<br><br>"Annalyn wanted a wedding with 'all the trimmings', which she got," he wrote. "She wanted to look like a princess, with me as her Prince Charming. She did indeed look gorgeous."<br><br>Another Filipino pastor, Marlon Dalin, who acted as Brash's best man, recalls: "He was very, very happy. And I thought Annalyn was happy, too. There was nothing to suggest that anything was wrong."<br><br>Barely a month after the wedding, on November 9 last year, Brash returned to Warrington, planning to tie up loose ends at the church he had led for 12 years. But finding a replacement and arranging his business affairs took longer than he had planned.<br><br>He returned to the Philippines in March "to get my bride and bring her to the UK for a few months".<br><br>They stayed in an unremarkable flat above a women's clothes shop in a Cheshire village, and Brash legally made Annalyn a secretary of his limited company, perhaps to help him wind up his business affairs in the UK before they left permanently for the Far East.<br><br>The friend who rented them her flat remembers seeing Annalyn around the village.<br><br>"She was very quiet and very young," she recalls. "I did think it seemed odd, with her being so young, but I never asked about his business. He was a good friend and seemed perfectly happy so there were never any questions asked."<br><br>Indeed, it seems that nobody was prepared to question what Brash continuously claimed was "God's will".<br><br>Annalyn returned to the Philippines at the end of the summer this year, before her British visa ran out. Brash finally left Britain on November 1.<br><br>In his last diary entry before leaving, he wrote: "Annalyn has asked that we spend Christmas and New Year with her family. It will be our first Christmas together.<br><br>"Annalyn is making preparations for our reunion. I want her to be happy about where we live. Me? I would be happy to live anywhere with her, so long as we are serving the Lord."<br><br>But Brash's evangelical dream was on the point of violent disintegration. Even before the day of his murder - believed to be November 22 - he had already had a confrontation with his driver Prado, accusing him of stealing his Honda motorbike.<br><br>Prado apparently told police that the new Mrs Brash had given it to him as a gift. Was this the flashpoint that led to Brash's death?<br><br>By the end of last month, Annalyn had reported her husband missing. At first police believed he might have been kidnapped by Muslim extremists in an area where terrorism and attacks on Westerners are an ongoing threat.<br><br>But, according to police sources, under questioning, Annalyn eventually confessed and admitted her role in her husband's murder.<br><br>She then led police to the swamp where his body had been concealed. According to local news reports, Brash's charred remains were found exactly a week ago with his hands and feet tied with steel chains. It is hard to imagine what agonies he must have suffered in his final moments.<br><br>Police believe he was tortured before being set alight and added that they would never have found his body without being led to it by Annalyn.<br><br>According to Senior Superintendent Ramon Espiritu, deputy police chief of the area: "She revealed during police interrogation that out of hatred and anger, because of what she claimed was her husband's maltreatment, she had him killed."<br><br>He added that Mrs Brash confessed to paying around Â£350 to two hitmen.<br><br>Pastor Marlon, Brash's best man, says that last weekend he replied to Annalyn's text messages which begged for forgiveness, telling her: "I have already forgiven you and I will continue praying for you."<br><br>As a staunch Christian, his desire to forgive Annalyn is entirely commendable. But somehow, Brash's own words seem more appropriate.<br><br>"Hell is a real place and you are in danger of being swept into it," he once warned his flock.<br><br>If Annalyn's confession is genuine, how apt those words are now for the young woman David Brash - in his peculiarly idealistic way - once thought was the key to a happy and fulfilling future.<br><br>Now, he is dead and she is languishing in a prison cell, a most ungodly end to what was a truly bizarre marriage.<br><br>/End</div>
