              <p>"If one is not a Christian, one will subject himself or herself for bashing, attacking and flaming by evil Christians", I myself can't agree this is right. Just because you are a non-Christian or "non" of any religion, it doesn't mean you should get bashed.</p>
              <p>I must thank you at least for some level of distinction that not all who call themselves Christians or church-goers are the same.</p>
              <p>However, the logic that just because "one is a non-Christian and will get bashed by Christians" sounds more like the logic that some (not all) non-Christians staunchly believe as the truth.</p>

              goodwill. A forum is a medium where ideas can be discussed with
              civility. Unfortunately, there will usually be trolls who are out
              to ambush the discussion, usually by making unnecessary,
              unjustified assertions and in some cases, unrelated suggestions.
              Don't think i'll relent from attempting civil discussions, the
              trolls cant strut their stuff, doesn't faze me.</p>

              <p>I agree, for some it is all about the conflict and about their agenda.</p>
              <p>Nevermind what the discussion was about, some of these people just want the conflict, the mudslinging and all. Still, I believe it's important that we state our real stand over the issues, even if we have to do it again and again.</p>
              <p>For me in this thread, it would be about the belief of heaven or hell. Non-Christians going to hell is part of our belief, and to say otherwise would be wrong and a lie. However, it is very clear and obvious we do not say it to curse others, or as wishing that they would go there. If anything, we would want for them not to go there.</p>
              <p>However, if one does not believe in the heaven and hell as stated in the bible, then what is it to that person?</p>

              <p>if morals change change and are as what you said, based within
              local areas, how can anyone say that the Holocaust was wrong, after
              all it was merely the expression of Nazi Germany's moral tastes?
              Secondly, are u then suggesting that there might come a time when
              child abuse, rape and murder will be considered morally acceptable?
               Thirdly, if as u claimed, morals are based within tribal
              groups, wouldn't suicide bombing be considered not morally wrong
              since it's called for within a small sect of religious zealots?
              What then is our right or grounds to condemn such
              actions? </p>
              <p>Re arguments made by most atheists - if that's true, it's really
              an a priori rejection based on their personal preferences / desires
              rather than one arrived at through reasoning and intellectual
              engagement. although i hesitate to generalize as there are those
              with a real reasonable case, rather than a personal
              vendetta. </p>
              <p>Re evolution, i never claimed evolution to be false. My question
              was, "<span style="color: #333333;">What evidence
              would convince you that evolution is false? If no such evidence
              exists, or indeed could exist, how can evolution be a testable

              <p>Actually, what you say about morales does make some sense. Morales are decided by the group or the majority. Although in itself does not make it bad, it does not mean it will be good either such as in the examples you've given.</p>
              <p>Just to further add, dancing whereby the man puts his hands on the woman used to be considered immoral. Pre-marital sex used to and is still considered by some to be immoral, but the view and consensus towards this has also largely changed over the years.</p>
              <p>Not going to comment on the points about evolution though, at least not right now.</p>

              <p>This post is for TTFU, Despondent and whoever else was talking about free will on page 9.</p>
              <p>The thing about free will is that people have the chance to choose the right for themselves or the wrong for themselves. Free will means having the chance to make mistakes. Some people believe everything should be controlled, so that nothing wrong or bad will happen, that in itself is another debate altogether.</p>
              <p>Actually this theme about free-will is very often addressed in various movies or stories. Sometimes it's one dictator saying he is trying to control everything for the greater good, whereas the protaganist is saying people should be allowed to choose for themselves.</p>

              <p>vividcritique, dragg, all these nicks are nice and understanding
              christians who are responsible to quote bible verses when they
              communicate here.    Only those evil christian
              trolls don't dare quote bible verses.    Think they
              dare not quote bible verses, they know if they quote , they must
              base on what they quote to behave here.  FRom here we can
              see, they put the words of god, jesus away when they come here to
              kill attack us.</p>

              <p>Just to let you know, the anti-Christians were the ones who also said Christians should not quote bible verses here. So you think Christians should quote bible verses, these other people don't.</p>
              <p>Decide for yourself if they are like you or not.</p>
              <p>I would not call you an anti-Christian, and neither do I deny your bad experiences with Christians. Still you yourself state you know there are good Christians and bad Christians, I just hope you not let others make you lose sight of that (Intentionally).</p>

              <p>Yes, to really answer questions properly about Christianity it's better done one to one. Because in open forum there's a lot of input from both sides. And sometimes as you've seen it goes way off track because people on both sides have their own agenda.</p>
              <p>Others beside vividcritique have also made similar offers to address issues or questions via pm. And like I always say, I hope for yourself and others to continue to meet more Christians like that.</p>

              <p>You have been diverting and avoiding such questions even before the skythewood incident.</p>
              <p>Again let me ask you,</p>
              <p>Do the negative practices you talk about happen in some Churches
                                      or all Churches?</p>
              <p>Do you yourself really not know of any 
              Christians or Churches
                                      that do not conform to negative stereotypes?</p>
