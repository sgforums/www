              <p>I know there are some Christians who are insensitive and tell non Christians in their faces that they will go to hell if they do not believe in Christ. I was once like that and have learnt that it is extremely insensitive so say such things and deeply regretted saying such things in the past.</p>
              <p>However, if a non Christian asks, he/she should bear an open mind and the Christian should not shy away from speaking the truth. The bible has stated very clearly in Romans 3:23 - for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. God do not judge based on human standards, He judges by His own perfect standards. Most people would not have physically committed murder or adultery, but If you have lied before, you are a liar; if you have taken anything that doesn't belong to you (even if it's just a sweet), you are a thief; if you have lusted after a woman apart your wife, you are an adulterer; the list goes on. Whether you like it or not, those are God's standards and He will judge you according to those standards.</p>
              <p>You might think that a person is "good", but that is based on your own standards. Why are some people loved by many and yet hated by many at the same time? We all have different standards and our standards are flawed, only God's standards are perfectly just. It's up to you whether or not to believe, but we Christians believe that our sins can only be forgiven by accepting Jesus Christ as our Lord and savior and repenting of our sins, only then can we escape judgement and suffer eternal seperation from God or what many call hell.</p>

              <p>hang on a sec, the truth? just like another man's meat is another one poison, so the truth of one religion doesnt mean the truth in others. the truth in christianity may not be the truth in another religion. similarly, their truth may not correspond with the truth in christianity. just like you the existence of god is beyond any doubt in your religion, but to atheist and agnotists, there are no god or at the very least bring out proof of the existence of god. pls bear in mind not everyone in this world believes in a god or hell thingy. so it really is relative to who you are speaking with.</p>

              <p>Agree with you that salvation has already been won for us by Jesus Christ. Just would like to add that it is also an ongoing process as we demonstrate through our actions that we desire this salvation that has been prepared for us. In other words, Christ has opened the door to heaven for us, but we have to want to walk through it.</p>
              <p>Indeed, the Bible does state that in addition to faith, much of our salvation will also depend on our love for others and the way we have lived our lives, not just because we are Christian (Matt 25:31-46, Matt 7:21, 1 Cor 13:13).</p>
              <p>And if our non-Christian friends demonstrate this love of Christ in their lives, who is to say that they will also not receive their own eternal reward from He who is full of compassion and mercy? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Actually all Yeshua has done is redeem us. We are not saved yet. We have been redeemed to the right of salvation. Hence the need to work out our salvation with fear and trembling for it can be lost.</p>
              <p>BTW, if you read your bible carefully, there is no such thing as the going to heaven or hell. The bible says that man's inheritance is the EARTH. We stay put. We do not get whisked away to some lala fairytale land as the christians so describe. Read the book of Revelation, there will be a new heaven and a renewed earth, and we will dwell here with Yeshua.</p>

              <p>its written in the bible lar. anyway christians regard their truth to be the universal truth, but I ask them back this question. What about the truths in other religions, so your truth in your religion doesnt mean it is the truth in their religion and vice versa isnt it.</p>
              <p>if everybody in their religion started using their truths to interpret and explain the world, how many truths do you think is the truth in so many religion?</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 14px; color: #333333;">1. “Truth exists.” Clark establishes this point by reminding us of the self-defeating nature of any attempt to deny the existence of truth. Since skepticism is false, there must be knowledge; and if there is knowledge, there must exist the object of knowledge, namely truth.<br><br>2. “Truth is immutable.” It is impossible for truth to change. As Clark says, “Truth must be unchangeable. What is true today always has been and always will be true.” For Clark, all true propositions are eternal and immutable truths. He has no use for pragmatic views of truth that imply that what is true today may be false tomorrow. If truth changes, then pragmatism will be false tomorrow-if, indeed, it could ever be true. Truth itself is unaffected by the fact that sentences like “I am now typing” are sometimes true and usually false. Since I’ll present a rather long argument in defense of this claim later in this chapter, I’ll assume that this possible problem can be answered and move on to Clark’s next point.<br><br>3. “Truth is eternal.” It would be self-contradictory to deny the eternity of truth. If the world will never cease to exist, it is true that the world will never cease to exist. If the world will someday perish, then that is true. But truth itself will abide even though every created thing should perish. But suppose someone asks, “what if truth itself should perish?” Then it would still be true that truth had perished. Any denial of the eternity of truth turns out to be an affirmation of its eternity.<br><br>4. “Truth is Mental.” The existence of truth presupposes the existence of minds. “Without a mind, truth could not exist. The object of knowledge is a proposition, a meaning, a significance; it is a thought.” For Clark, the existence of truth is incompatible with any materialistic view of man. If the materialist admits the existence of consciousness at all, he regards it as an effect and not a cause. For a materialist, thoughts are always the result of bodily changes. This materialism implies that all thinking, including logical reasoning, is merely the result of mechanical necessity. But bodily changes can be neither true nor false. One set of physical motions cannot be truer than another. Therefore, if there is no mind, there can be no truth; and if there is no truth, materialism cannot be true. Likewise, if there is no mind, there can be no such thing as logical reasoning from which it follows that no materialist can possible provide a valid argument for his position. No reason can possible be given to justify an acceptance of materialism. Hence, for Clark, any denial of the mental nature of truth is self-stultifying. In Clarks words,<br><br>“If a truth, a proposition, or a thought were some physical motion in the brain, no two persons could have the same thought. A physical motion is a fleeting event numerically distinct from every other. Two persons cannot have the same motion, nor can one person have it twice. If this is what thought were, memory and communication would be impossible…It is a peculiarity of mind and not of body that the past can be made present. Accordingly, if one may thing the same thought twice, truth must be mental or spiritual. Not only does [truth] defy time; it defies space as well, for if communication is to be possible, the identical truth must be in two minds at once. If, in opposition, anyone wished to deny that an immaterial idea can exist in two minds at once, his denial must be conceived to exist in his own mind only; and since it has not registered in any other mind, it does not occur to us to refute it.”<br><br>To summarize Clark’s argument thus far, truth exists and is both eternal and immutable. Furthermore, truth can exist only in some mind.<br><br>5. “Truth is superior to the human mind.” By this, Clark means that by its very nature, truth cannot be subjective and individualistic. Humans know certain truths that are not only necessary but universal. While these truths are immutable, the human mind is changeable. Even though beliefs vary from one person to another, truth itself cannot change. Moreover, the human mind does not stand in judgment of truth: rather truth judges our reason. While we often judge other human minds (as when we say, for example, that someone’s mind is not a keen as it should be), we do not judge truth. If truth and the human mind were equal, truth could not be eternal and immutable since the human mind is finite, mutable, and subject to error. Therefore, truth must transcend human reason; truth must be superior to any individual human mind as well as to the sum total of human minds. From this it follows that there must be a mind higher than the human mind in which truth resides.<br><br>6. “Truth is God.” There must be an ontological ground for truth. But the ground of truth cannot be anything perishable or contingent. Since truth is eternal and immutable, it must exist in an eternal Mind. And since only God possesses these attributes, God must be truth.<br><br>“Is all this any more than the assertion that there is an eternal, immutable Mind, as Supreme Reason, a personal, living God? The truths or propositions that may be known are the thoughts of God, the eternal thoughts of God. And insofar as man knows anything he is in contact with God’s mind. Since further, God’s mind is God, we may… say, we have a vision of God.”<br><br>Therefore, when human beings know truth, we also know something of God’s nature. There is a sense in which all knowledge is a knowledge of God.<br><br>-Ronald Nash – Faith and Reason - p. 161<br></span></p>
