A forum is a medium where ideas can be discussed with civility. Unfortunately, there will usually be trolls who are out to ambush the discussion, usually by making unnecessary, unjustified assertions and in some cases, unrelated suggestions. Don't think i'll relent from attempting civil discussions, the trolls cant strut their stuff, doesn't faze me.</p>

              <p>About morals-  Yes, this world dont comprise of only one
              culture. What you said may not be wrong Moral relativism. But now
              we generally follow a universal set of morals regardless of
              culture, people. Moral universalism.Thats why holocaust/suicide
              bombing is deemed to be wrong. I personally support Moral
              universalism also. </p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: normal;">moral universalism doesn't answer the question. it just expands the playing field a bit bigger than moral relativism. the question remains, what is the atheist's rational warrant for calling one choice "moral" and another choice "not moral"? because these people said it? does that mean morality becomes an issue of numbers or rather, political influence (history is dictated by the victors, in this case, pax Americana) a practice of enforcing one's cultural imperative? smells of hegemonic colonialism. if Germany had won WWII, would that mean it would be right to practise systematic racial extermination?  </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 16.0px Arial;">before moral universalism came on the scene, then how can one rationally claim that evil existed? i mean, if morality hasn't been properly agreed upon till moral universalism entered the picture, how should we deal with those people whose moral judgments differed from ours? </p>
              <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 16.0px Arial;">Lastly, the notion of morality that moral univ promotes, can only concern itself with what <em>is</em>. But morality as understood by Christianity, is concerned with <em>ought</em>. Can anyone derive <em>ought</em> from <em>is? </em></p>

              <p>I have been in church in the past and mixing around with
              Christians for this I can tell who are the nasty and pleasant

              <p>you might want to think twice before associating yourself with rooney9 after all, he has sold all non believers out by declaring that he has never seen a logical and coherent response from them. Does the term "friendly fire" ring a bell? fratricide? </p>
              <p>Just a note of caution, thats all. Don't take it as attacking you again!</p>

              <p>PLUS i do disagree with you on this account. Because non christians are able to do the right thing, make the ethically moral decision. If something is wrong, they're able to stand up and defend the innocent. </p>

              <p>no problem. you already know and can tell who are the non-believers and who are the anti-christians. the problem is that the handful of anti-christians like to hide under the cover as non-believers (sheep in wolf's skin?) and create impression that christians are "attacking them" but it is not the case......they have no guts to stand up and be counted as anti-christians.</p>
              <p>they typically joined hands and help each other out when they find that their argument is flawed and unsupportable.....they lies, change subject, become abusive and troll their way out.....and it happened over and over again...so they never have to face the truth that they lie....</p>

              <p>So in the spirit of peaceloving, be mature and see their point. if you insist that kong and ho owned 13 units, then so be it but state your stand and explained your stand.</p>
