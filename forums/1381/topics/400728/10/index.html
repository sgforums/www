              <p>if morals change change and are as what you said, based within local areas, how can anyone say that the Holocaust was wrong, after all it was merely the expression of Nazi Germany's moral tastes? Secondly, are u then suggesting that there might come a time when child abuse, rape and murder will be considered morally acceptable?  Thirdly, if as u claimed, morals are based within tribal groups, wouldn't suicide bombing be considered not morally wrong since it's called for within a small sect of religious zealots? What then is our right or grounds to condemn such actions? </p>
              <p>Re arguments made by most atheists - if that's true, it's really an a priori rejection based on their personal preferences / desires rather than one arrived at through reasoning and intellectual engagement. although i hesitate to generalize as there are those with a real reasonable case, rather than a personal vendetta. </p>
              <p>Re evolution, i never claimed evolution to be false. My question was, "<span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333;">What evidence would convince you that evolution is false? If no such evidence exists, or indeed could exist, how can evolution be a testable scientific theory?" </span></p>

              expected...haha...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway, the point i have been trying to make all these while is
              1) tat one cannot view christianity from the eyes of buddhism, 2)
              the teachings of good works does not have its roots in heaven and
              hell but rather nirvana which is heaven somewhat but its a
              metaphorical heaven rather than an actual one that exist as a
              place, 3) salvation by grace and salvation by good works are 2 very
              diff teachings...although they are not mutually exclusive, they are
              very diff....in christianity, we have grace and good works but one
              refers to salvation the other refers to the aftermath of
              salvation...</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>1) buddhism is a non theistic philosophy. it would be like comparing apples and oranges. </p>
              <p>2) disagree on nirvana being somewhat heaven. in heaven, we maintain our sense of self and desire, except that the object of our desire will be with us perpetually. </p>
              <p>3) agreed.</p>
              <p>anyway laws of nature do not prescribe any moral standards to us. Moral standards need to be grounded in something transcendent, otherwise it's impossible for us to claim that anything is morally wrong or right. </p>

              <p>if morals change change and are as what you said, based within
              local areas, how can anyone say that the Holocaust was wrong, after
              all it was merely the expression of Nazi Germany's moral tastes?
              Secondly, are u then suggesting that there might come a time when
              child abuse, rape and murder will be considered morally acceptable?
               Thirdly, if as u claimed, morals are based within tribal
              groups, wouldn't suicide bombing be considered not morally wrong
              since it's called for within a small sect of religious zealots?
              What then is our right or grounds to condemn such
              actions? </p>
              <p>Re arguments made by most atheists - if that's true, it's really
              an a priori rejection based on their personal preferences / desires
              rather than one arrived at through reasoning and intellectual
              engagement. although i hesitate to generalize as there are those
              with a real reasonable case, rather than a personal
              vendetta. </p>
              <p>Re evolution, i never claimed evolution to be false. My question
              was, "<span style="color: #333333;">What evidence
              would convince you that evolution is false? If no such evidence
              exists, or indeed could exist, how can evolution be a testable
              scientific theory?" </span></p>

              <p>About morals-  Yes, this world dont comprise of only one culture. What you said may not be wrong Moral relativism. But now we generally follow a universal set of morals regardless of culture, people. Moral universalism.Thats why holocaust/suicide bombing is deemed to be wrong. I personally support Moral universalism also. </p>
              <p>Re evolution - I need to read up more about this before i can reply you.</p>

              <p>however, the ides of salvation by good works is usually teaching abt the individual judging for themselves if wad they did is rite/wrong...remember, its the individual's own judgement, not the judgements of the ppl around...</p>
              <p>base on this, terrorisdm may be condemned by many of us but since its up to the individual's judgement, i am afraid the terrorists themselves dun believe they have done wrong...so base on their judgement of the ir own deeds, wouldnt they be in heaven?</p>

              <p>Lets take another example, like closing the door might offend god, dropping my one dollar coin might offend god, sneezing might offend god,is there any issue that cant be linked to god ? or is it just humans.</p>
