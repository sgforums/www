              <p>mate, that's the thing. I didn't ask you ANYTHING! I can't be bothered to because i'm certain you cannot answer anything at all. Experience has proven to me you've nothing of substance to contribute to any intelligent discussion at all.  </p>
              <p>From my post above, any idiot (now i shouldn't insult idiots by mentioning you and them in the same sentence) can see that I've addressed despondent, Badzmaro and TTFU. Nothing to you at all. You had to jump in with a brainless comment, "<span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333;">gee I cant believe what I am reading here. so this is what your rationale is based on"</span>  </p>

              <p><br>I am patient because to hammer rocks, one needs to be patient. I learn from my fellow trolls. To be a troll. and to beat a troll, one has to BE a trolll. Like Luke Skywalker, to master the darkside of the force, he has to succumb to it.</p>
              <p>The word "coherent" and "logic" does not seem to compute for them. I often wonder if they even understand the word.. "understand". I have been waiting for the supposedly "questions" and "answers" that were asked or given.</p>
              <p>Yes, we cannot generalise. As tempted as it is... must resist such temptation. To give in.. is to lose ones self. We must believe that there is still the possibility .. for them to be able to "understand".</p>

              <p>you have no idea what you are talking about to begin with. you are confused, very confused. I know it feels good talking abstract, but clearly you have no idea what you are trying to convey as you are confused and muddle-head.</p>

              <p>the atheist cannot perform objective testing without first presupposing an objective reality in the first place. the laws of nature don't work itself out over the years. the law of gravity existed way before it was discovered, it wasn't invented. same with the laws of logic - Aristotle discovered it, he didn't create it. So the question then is how do these laws come about? In a constantly changing universe, as the atheist has suggested, how does he account for universal, unchanging and immaterial laws? </p>
              <p>ur kind because when they failed to answer your question according to the point, and move on other irrelevant topics, you grant them the leeway and indulge them in it. kind as in generous, not in the moral sense. there's nothing wrong in being nice to some people, but there has to be a limit - one should not throw pearls before swines. </p>

              <p>that is why i don't believe in creator and creation. it is a never ending story if you believe in it. i believe we are self exist just like god.</p>
              <p>however, i don't deny there are gods and goddess in all the religions. or else how come there are so many followers in all the religions, there must be some truth in all the religions. as you know we humans are very practical, if it is not true, the religions would have die off long ago. the question now is which god is the most powerful, god of all gods.</p>

              <li style="list-style-type: decimal; list-style-position: outside; list-style-image: initial; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Therefore the universe has a cause.</li>
              </ol>
              <p> Premise 1: Does the Christian God have a beginning? Nope. Genesis 1, "In the beginning, God..." - He's already existing. Other passages throughout the bible also tell us that He exists outside of time and that He made all things, including time and space. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Regarding the 2nd premise, God exists apart from the universe and transcends it. Is God part of the universe in a physical sense? Nope.  Again, this premise doesn't apply to Him too.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">No beginning, no cause, not part of the physical universe. So how is this question valid for the Christian God? The premises of this question don't even apply to Him. </p>
