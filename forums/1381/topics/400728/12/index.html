              <p>I think you are mistaken. They did not pick on you or attack you because you post the article...it's all over the media.</p>
              <p>They just want to clarify that kong and ho did not own 13 units as you claimed but 13 units was the total own by a group of people that include kong and ho.</p>
              <p>So in the spirit of peaceloving, be mature and see their point. if you insist that kong and ho owned 13 units, then so be it but state your stand and explained your stand.</p>
              <p>They have stated theirs and explained why they says so.....so you should have your say too right?</p>
              <p>Hope to read your stand on this....I.E. how many units do you think kong &amp; ho woned and explain how you come to that conclusion now that you have been given explanation why you may have mistaken.</p>
              <p>No need to approach SPH because it has nothing to do with them....and it was not their answer that they are seeking.....it is your answer.</p>

              <p>Thanks for being kind to post this.  They did more than what you stated.    I am only for mature, pleasant, peaceloving christians.   I am not interested in these louts who called themselves christians but behave otherwise.   </p>
              <p>Why are they so defensive if they are not condoning the act of Kong Hee?</p>
              <p>I am not here to please their ego to allow more attack from them.      Such behaviour if not repented will land them in hell.   </p>

              <p>is this a fact you are sure of, a guess or hear say???</p>
              <p>if this is verifiable and real, then i think chc will have lots to explain and it would be interesting to know who are the people in this group.</p>

              <p>We who come here to read and post know the way they are , they
              are all here to attack non christians for the sake of
              attacking.  Talking sense to them does not
              work.   </p>
              <p>Please stop to tell me to do this and that.   
              For your info, I am not accountable to you and definitely not
              obligated to comply to what you say.    I know
              whatever I want to say to them on this I will get attack from them,
              it is not a wise choice to make it clear to them as you
              suggested.  they are all the way here to get satisfaction from
              attacking non christians and as far as I am concerned i will not
              let them have their way.</p>

              <p>Why is it that when forumers disagree with you and point out your mistakes, you turn around, bite them and tell them to stay out of it, or just call them a troll. Nice. </p>

              <p>Say what you want, evildoer 24/12 if this so please your evil soul.     YOur so evil that God cannot even save you.     For no reason you pick to attack me by subtlely pretending to be nice by asking me the question.   It is not a paranoid thing it is about you being sneaky, cunning and evil.</p>
              <p>Damn it, you go to hell and enjoy the fire there!      God detests evildoing!     I believe in your heart you have no god when you are carrying out evil work.  hahahaha</p>
