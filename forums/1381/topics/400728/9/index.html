              <p>True. the USSR did violently quell religion... And the French Revolution was violent for the atheist. To be fair, both side has its number of fanatics. So what do you see of religion. Some might say, God is only a medium through which the religion gains power. What do you see in a world without religion ?</p>

              <p>the atheist cannot perform objective testing without first
              presupposing an objective reality in the first place. the laws of
              nature don't work itself out over the years. the law of gravity
              existed way before it was discovered, it wasn't invented. same with
              the laws of logic - Aristotle discovered it, he didn't create it.
              So the question then is how do these laws come about? In a
              constantly changing universe, as the atheist has suggested, how
              does he account for universal, unchanging and immaterial
              laws? </p>
              <p>ur kind because when they failed to answer your question
              according to the point, and move on other irrelevant topics, you
              grant them the leeway and indulge them in it. kind as in generous,
              not in the moral sense. there's nothing wrong in being nice to some
              people, but there has to be a limit - one should not throw pearls

              <p>if that's where the evidence and reasoning leads to, then yes. </p>
              <p>it sounds as if you're uncomfortable somewhat with the thought of an entity that reigns supreme over you and controls all things. A reason for the a priori rejection of God seems to be moral rather than intellectual, e.g. I don't want God to exist rather than it's not possible that God exists. I might be wrong though. </p>

              <p>True. the USSR did violently quell religion... And the French
              Revolution was violent for the atheist. To be fair, both side has
              its number of fanatics. So what do you see of religion. Some might
              say, God is only a medium through which the religion gains power.
              What do you see in a world without religion ?</p>

              <p>arbitrariness, more violence (a trend observed by the War Audit), and more unreasonable people? To be fair, the "blame" cannot be attributed to religionist or non-religionist, there's no middle ground to be sought, it's what it means to be a human - we do such things, it's in our nature. We should be looking for an answer and explanation of this human condition, not sweep it under the rug.  </p>

              <p>huh? premises can be the same, but can lead to different conclusions. also, one needs to establish the soundness of the premises through reason, not assertion. </p>

              <p>what is evil? what is suffering? in a world without basis for objectivity, how can there be moral absolutes? why are we using such terms without thinking about how they are perceived? </p>
              <p>To quote Ravi Zacharias on the evil happening in the world, "If there is such a thing as evil, aren't you assuming there is such a thing as good? If there's such a thing as good, you must affirm a moral law on the basis of which to differentiate between good and evil. But when you admit to a moral law, you must posit a moral lawgiver. That, however, is who you are trying to disprove and not prove. For if there's no moral lawgiver, there's no moral law. If there's no moral law, there's no good. If there's no good, there's no evil. What, then, is the question?"</p>

              <p>i've never seen anybody make this argument, mostly because it is unsound - how does the speed of light or the law of gravity proceed to provide objective moral laws for minds?</p>
              <p>if moral standard is determined according to our conscience or at best, individual opinions, then nothing i do can be rationally termed as wrong, simply because i opine that it is right. The rapist is not wrong since he's following the steps of his own conscience. The sociopath is justified in his murders since he derives personal satisfaction. Who then are we to pronounce judgments on them? What gives our opinions more weight than their own?</p>
              <p>Not that everything needs a beginning, but everything that begins to exist - there was a time when it was not and now there is. The God revealed in the Christian scriptures is transcendant and prexisting, before (or when) time came to be, it was revealed that He was already there. And i also reckon people will seldom disagree that the universe doesn't have a beginning.</p>

              <p>anyway, the point i have been trying to make all these while is 1) tat one cannot view christianity from the eyes of buddhism, 2) the teachings of good works does not have its roots in heaven and hell but rather nirvana which is heaven somewhat but its a metaphorical heaven rather than an actual one that exist as a place, 3) salvation by grace and salvation by good works are 2 very diff teachings...although they are not mutually exclusive, they are very diff....in christianity, we have grace and good works but one refers to salvation the other refers to the aftermath of salvation...</p>
