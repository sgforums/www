                  universalism doesn't answer the question. it just expands the

              <p>Atheists derive their morality ( a guess) largely from the Golden Rule. Don't be a prick, be civil, be
                  peaceful, be generous when you can, be loyal when it's warranted, etc.
                  Basically the same principles religion has picked up and tried to use
                  to sound legitimate, but again, these "rules" have been around longer
                  than religion. They just listen to the rules directly instead of through
                  a deity/religious label.</p>

              <p>The right? No. But the power to enforce these morals? Quite possibly.
              And if they went unquestioned it likely would have played out that way.<br> <br> Another example. Christian rule during the Dark Ages.
              History is written by the winners, and Christian authority was
              definitely winning in Western Europe. Heathens were tortured and
              killed, what saplings of science were there were ignored or squashed,
              and general reasoning was stamped out in favor of faith and loyalty to
              the church.<br> <br> We're still feeling the "moral paradigm" of Christianity to this day. So, yes, I just compared Christianity to Nazi Fascism.</p>

              <p>Well, I personally view "good and evil" as "beneficial and detrimental
              to the most people" (utilitarian viewpoint). I wouldn't call them
              exactly synonymous, but close.<br> As far as how we deal with those whose cultural and personal morals
              differ - we do so very carefully. Anything harmful (human rights, etc)
              we judge in attempted unbiased manner with our "moral backbone" in
              mind. Anything else (cultural customs, etc) we should leave alone
              (unless they can be improved in efficiency).</p>
              <p> Religious "ought" morality not
              necessarily a bad thing, it gives people hope and something to aspire
              to be. carrot on a stick?</p>

              <p>Generally can morals change, I think it's a bit of both. There's an inherent moral "backbone", if
              you will, that is passed down genetically and just a part of our
              psyche. Psychology (especially evolutionary psychology) has found many
              reactions, expressions and emotions that are inherent across the globe
              in humans.<br> <br> So things like "don't kill, don't steal, don't lie"? Those are all just
              ingrained in our psyche. They are there because we're pack animals, and
              performing those actions (killing, stealing, etc) in a pack creates
              disharmony. <br> <br> However, I do that that beyond that inherent moral backbone there are
              cultural and personal morals. Cultural being what you've been taught
              (rather, what you've assimilated) and personal being your own personal
              ethics, influenced by your personality, genes, and upbringing.<br> <br> Morality is NOT strictly "objective" (universal) or strictly "subjective" (relative), that much I am sure about.</p>
              <p>Perhaps religious people sometimes think their religion was the source of this
              moral backbone, but it sadly was not. That small bit of universal
              morality has been around way longer than religion.</p>

              <p>the atheist cannot perform objective testing without first
              presupposing an objective reality in the first place. the laws of
              nature don't work itself out over the years. the law of gravity
              existed way before it was discovered, it wasn't invented. same with
              the laws of logic - Aristotle discovered it, he didn't create it.
              So the question then is how do these laws come about? In a
              constantly changing universe, as the atheist has suggested, how
              does he account for universal, unchanging and immaterial
              laws? </p>
              <p>ur kind because when they failed to answer your question
              according to the point, and move on other irrelevant topics, you
              grant them the leeway and indulge them in it. kind as in generous,
              not in the moral sense. there's nothing wrong in being nice to some
              people, but there has to be a limit - one should not throw pearls
              before swines. </p>

              <p>The athetist not entirely sure that these
              laws are "never-changing". Scientists think that the scientific laws we
              know of were the result of the big bang, and could have very likely
              been different before the bang. If the big bang erupted from the death
              of a previous universe, it is not unlikely that universe had very
              different laws.<br> There's also the fact that these laws change depending on what level of
              matter you're looking at. Subatomic and quantum scale is very different
              from astrophysics is very different from the physics of you bouncing a
              basketball.<br> <br> Now I don't think any atheist ever claimed that man created any laws of
              physics, they just discover, label, and "mathematize" them. We
              acknowledge that these laws have been with this universe for possibly
              as long as the universe has been "alive", but we attribute them to
              energy states and the big bang, not a deity</p>
              <p>I think you're saying "they didn't just appear over time" and not "they
              don't change over the years". In which case: how do you know and what
              makes you so sure? If a deity could come out of nowhere with no
              creator, why can't something so simple as Weight = Mass * Gravity come
              out of nowhere with no creator?</p>
              <p>Perhaps They're there as certainly as anything else. Nobody has to account for them any more than the wind has to be accounted for.<br> But think for a second, you might say "well surely it's weird that no
              laws change, I should be here and watch gravity change each day because
              that'd be way more random and natural." But if the universe was like
              that it'd be totally unstable, and life probably could never exist, let
              alone our planet and sun (which goes out for a century every 1,000
              years because the laws change). You wouldn't exist, so you would not
              experience them. You only exist because the laws are stable enough. You
              cannot be alive in an unstable universe, so you can never experience
              unstable laws.<br> <br> You are far too concerned with "why are these laws like this."<br> Science is not concerned with why, it doesn't care whether there's a why. It only cares what <em>is</em>. It <em>is</em> fact that those laws happen to be that way and whether a deity wrote
              those equations in his notepad or they just popped out of thin air
              doesn't change the fact the laws are there and they appear to have been
              stable ever since the big bang.</p>

              <p>That is the belief system of those who believe in the bible. To tell you otherwise would be a lie.</p>
              <p>It should be noted very clearly that we do not tell or say this to you wishing you would go there. If anything, we don't wish for you or anyone else to go there.</p>
              <p>However, if you do not believe in the heaven and hell stated in the bible, then what is it to you?</p>
              <p>In any case, there is more to Christianity than heaven and hell. I just hope you open up your mind and experiences to it.</p>

              <p>remind me of somebodyinsg when he got caught as clone of

              <p>he denied it even when whole forum censure him for doing so</p>
              <p>seems clone/troll masters come from members of particular faith,

              <p>Wow, you are really dragging this David thing aren't you?</p>
              <p>Again my suggestion to you if you are truly about truth, why not you go back to your fellow p-members and ask them if they really think I am David. No need to post the replies here, but if you yourself knowing that I am not David yet continue to do this, then it says a lot about you really.</p>
              <p>In any case, my being David has or not has no relevance here, and I can tell you in honest truth this other guy is not me either. In fact, as of this post I still do not know yet who is this other person you mention but I guess I would know later.</p>
              <p>And Laurence, even if you don't ask your fellow p-members now, I already know for sure that you are aware I and David are not the same person. I just wish to further point out on top of it not being true that it has nothing to do with the posts in EH.</p>
