            <div class='col-md body'>The Emerging Church: Another Road to Rome<br><br>Commentary by Roger Oakland<br>www.understandthetimes.org<br><br>The Emerging Church controversy continues to explode. Perhaps the best way to describe the Emerging Church phenomenon is to compare it to an avalanche. Every day more and more information is being made available regarding what the Emerging Church is and where it may be headed.<br><br>The Emerging Church<br><br>It is not my purpose in writing this commentary to define every aspect of the Emerging Church. In fact it would require several volumes to do so. Even then, some would say that the Emerging Church was not defined properly.<br><br>The common denominator being promoted is the idea that the time has come for Christianity to be reinvented for our generation. In order to do so, the church must provide the environment and the experiences to attract people. Christianity, the Emerging Church promoters say, must become relevant to our postmodern generation. No longer does reason or GodÂ’s Word hold the answers to lifeÂ’s questions. Experience must become the key factor to encounter spiritual reality.<br><br>A  Prayer Station that was on display at Capo Beach Calvary<br>April, 2005 - with instructions on how to pray with an icon<br><br>The following statement taken from a book written by Chuck Smith Jr. titled There is a Season (foreword by Brian McLaren and endorsed by Leonard Sweet) provides insight into how Christianity may be Â“reinventedÂ” in the future as the Emerging Church moves away from the Word of God towards the concept of experiencing God. Chuck Smith Jr.states:<br><br>What would happen if we allowed people to Â“feelÂ” what we cannot explain, to know with the heart and not with the brain? We would open the door of faith to a wider audience than if we continued to insist on a rational belief in the facts as the only legitimate starting point of the Christian faith. [1]<br><br>A prayer station created for use during the Emerging Church service at Capo Beach Calvary illustrates what Chuck Smith Jr. means by allowing his congregation to Â“feelÂ” and Â“know with the heart and not with the brain.Â”  This prayer station was on display during the month of April, 2005. Further, the prayer station complete with candles, incense and icons featured an instruction sheet to assist church attendees in how to pray with an icon. The instructions stated:<br><br>Praying With Icons<br><br>Draw in a slow deep breath. As you do pray, Holy Spirit surround me,<br>fill me, breathe life into me.<br><br>Empty your mind of all anxiety.<br><br>Empty your heart full of desire except for God.<br><br>Focus on one icon and imagine what that person might say to you about God, yourself, and others<br><br>Read the icons as if the person who painted it wanted to send a<br>message to you. Notice the details.<br><br>The icon is there to remind you of God: to make you conscious of His<br>presence, all around you.<br><br>Pray in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and the Holy Spirit.<br>(option) Cross yourself as you say these words.<br><br>Brian McLaren summarizes what the Emerging Church is in the title and subtitle of his book A Generous Orthodoxy: Why I Am a missional + evangelical + post/protestant + liberal/conservative + mystical/poetic + biblical + fundamentalist/calvinist + anabaptist/anglican + methodist  + catholic + green + incarnational + depressed-yet-hopeful + emergent + unfinished  Christian.<br><br>According to McLaren, the goal of the Emerging Church is to formulate a Christianity for the twenty-first century that is based on a smorgasbord of ideas in the name of Christ. There are really no ideas barred. However, based on what we read in Scripture, many of these ideas lack support or are outright heretical.<br><br>Pls click for full article:<br><a href="http://understandthetimes.org/commentary/c46.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://understandthetimes.org/commentary/c46.shtml</a></div>
