Here the concept of god was based on fear, as they are unable to understand these are not acts of god, but natural phenomenon.</p></div>

              <p>Not contradicting to some Christians, cause God is a superior being thus it's okay for him to be jealous not for humans as he is above the laws he set for humans.</p>
              <p>It's a dictatorship, which ruler/king/emperor is answerable to the laws he set when his words are the laws?</p>
