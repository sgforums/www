              <p><br> i strongly believe ghosts are not demons in disguise.
              many real life stories told me they ae not. it seems that
              all 3rd eye see ghosts but interpret them differently due to
              their religions.</p>
              <p>christians with 3rd eye will say ghosts are demons in disguise.
              my friend told me her friend who has 3rd eye said one of her
              siblings who was a christian did not go to heaven and was in
              pitiful state, her friend could even communicate with her sibling's
              spirit.</p>
              <p>her friend had not seen her sibling but was able to describe her
              sibling and that was how my friend knew that the spirit was her
              brother. my friend is a free thinker but begin to believe in
              afterlife due to this incident.</p>
              <p>i still believe only good christians will go to heaven until
              proven otherwise.</p>

              <p><br>Actually, that is how faith starts. From hearing, hearing gracious testimonies of how the Glory of God was revealed to them. If the person above really did witness God's glory to what was told him. Then we Christians don't question it. Unless otherwise, well deem it false.</p>

              <p>Even King James Bible is perverted cause it created by a descendant of Henry VIII who separated the Church of England from the Papal authority so as to divorce his wife to marry another woman.....that's a bloody poor excuse to start a separated Church isn't it?</p>
              <p>lol,okay jokes aside...King James Bible is one of the English translated Bibles, and it known that some Greek words (the original language that the NT is written in) can't be translated into English thus a replacement word was used so it's hard for someone to claim that other bibles are perverted and not King James Bible.</p>

              <p><br>It seems you're not a bible enthusiast. Nonetheless, here is my two cent on this. The author of the KJB or any bible is none other than the Almighty himself. As to whoever translates the words inside it and what he does in his life is simply a man's choice.</p>
              <p>Did God want divorce? In the book of Malachi God's words was clear: "I hate divorce".</p>
              <p>If I put it clearly, the person who translated the KJB chose to divorce his wife. The question is, did he divorced his wife before or after he transcribed the KJB?</p>

              <p>It's obvious you don't understand what I'm saying...nor did you read the post that I reply to...maybe I shouldn't use the word "created" but can Christians stop rushing to defend the Bible without understand what is being discussed?</p>

              <p>I believe in most cultures, there are stories of people having the 3rd eye. Where they can see the realm of the supernatural. I wonder that this is a curse or a blessing.</p>
              <p>I had a colleague who can see the unseen since young. He shared that the spirits exist 24/7 irregardless day or night or be it Chinese 7th month or not. His parents had brought him to see a number of priests &amp; mediums. Some of them said that the 3rd eye was given to him for a divine reason. Maybe to help those who passed on but still have some uncompleted wishes in the mortal world.</p>
              <p>However this gift of the 3rd eye is disturbing his life &amp; he felt very frustrated indeed. He often prayed sincerely at his altar but his wish of closing his 3rd eye is not granted. When all resources seem drained &amp; he felt hopeless, his girlfriend (his present wife) who was a devout Christian, persuaded him to attend church with her &amp; get a Pastor to pray over this matter. He was skeptical but since he had nothing to lose,he went.</p>
              <p>A Pastor prayed for him, not knowing for what reasons (which he never shared with me), he accepted Christ as His Lord &amp; Savior. Since then, without realising it, his 3rd eye had been closed. Of course, he was overjoyed. Since then he had been also a devout Christian although he had changed a few churches &amp; now we attend the same church. Years later, he was blessed with promotions (because he was blessed with the patience to deal with our demanding boss), as well as the financial wisdom to save up for a wedding which he could'nt wait to testify the Lord's goodness to us.</p>
              <p>The rest was history. We parted our ways when my contract finished but we still kept in contact. This is not the only story of the 3rd eye which I heard. My Pastor shared of a case where a member brought his uncle to attend service. His uncle also has the 3rd eye &amp; he is a Chinese medium or "Tang Ki", where he uses his 3rd eye to help people who seek him.</p>
              <p>What happens next is breath stopping. His uncle told him that he saw human like beings with a golden aura standing beside the Pastor when he was preaching &amp; he was sure ordinary people could'nt see it. At the end, it was not known whether this person's uncle received Christ but they did enjoy the service.</p>
              <p>Well, this story is not to share whether who's God is real but it is to testify that the spiritual realm does exist although religion itself seems like just a set of theories &amp; a guideline for the way of life.</p>
              <p> </p>
