              <p>I believe in most cultures, there are stories of people having the 3rd eye. Where they can see the realm of the supernatural. I wonder that this is a curse or a blessing.</p>
              <p>I had a colleague who can see the unseen since young. He shared that the spirits exist 24/7 irregardless day or night or be it Chinese 7th month or not. His parents had brought him to see a number of priests &amp; mediums. Some of them said that the 3rd eye was given to him for a divine reason. Maybe to help those who passed on but still have some uncompleted wishes in the mortal world.</p>
              <p>However this gift of the 3rd eye is disturbing his life &amp; he felt very frustrated indeed. He often prayed sincerely at his altar but his wish of closing his 3rd eye is not granted. When all resources seem drained &amp; he felt hopeless, his girlfriend (his present wife) who was a devout Christian, persuaded him to attend church with her &amp; get a Pastor to pray over this matter. He was skeptical but since he had nothing to lose,he went.</p>
              <p>A Pastor prayed for him, not knowing for what reasons (which he never shared with me), he accepted Christ as His Lord &amp; Savior. Since then, without realising it, his 3rd eye had been closed. Of course, he was overjoyed. Since then he had been also a devout Christian although he had changed a few churches &amp; now we attend the same church. Years later, he was blessed with promotions (because he was blessed with the patience to deal with our demanding boss), as well as the financial wisdom to save up for a wedding which he could'nt wait to testify the Lord's goodness to us.</p>
              <p>The rest was history. We parted our ways when my contract finished but we still kept in contact. This is not the only story of the 3rd eye which I heard. My Pastor shared of a case where a member brought his uncle to attend service. His uncle also has the 3rd eye &amp; he is a Chinese medium or "Tang Ki", where he uses his 3rd eye to help people who seek him.</p>
              <p>What happens next is breath stopping. His uncle told him that he saw human like beings with a golden aura standing beside the Pastor when he was preaching &amp; he was sure ordinary people could'nt see it. At the end, it was not known whether this person's uncle received Christ but they did enjoy the service.</p>
              <p>Well, this story is not to share whether who's God is real but it is to testify that the spiritual realm does exist although religion itself seems like just a set of theories &amp; a guideline for the way of life.</p>

              <p>For christians, demons pretend to be ghosts of dead humans. Christians believe that when humans die, they are dead until judgement day is up. Kinda different from other cultures since most of the others have an immediate afterlife. And excorcism is more about chasing demons T_T</p>

              <p>God i took so many good pictires of places in singapore. And many others did the same taking wonderful snapshots of singapore.</p>
              <p>I once heard people say sg no good photos and palces to take photos. i guess they fear take photos of ghosts.</p>
              <p>Do a search over the internet and see how wonderful sg places can appear in photos.</p>
              <p>Was it religion then? Nope its not the religion not the faith. Its not the camera not photography. its the man.</p>

              <p><br>Okay reading from the source this thread the guy's got promotions and the stuff. Now i believe he must have some thing about him for such a fast promotion. But if you ask me to convert or take up christianity base on this nope. I want a religion not for promotion not for wealth and riches and status. Sorry but TS' not selling me the right stuff. Sel sopme toasit or buddhist who see religion for this aim maybe.</p>

              <p>Ghosts are just souls who did not return to the spiritual realm, as they should, so are stuck here in our realm. In normal circumstances, ghosts in real-life do not look like those in movies. They are shadowy forms but have very clear shapes of human form, almost transparent, but facial features cannot be seen. Yet, it's possible to know their sex and estimated age. I've seen personally up-close, so can say this with confidence. They can appear anywhere, anytime, not just night-time, as in movies. Generally, most people shouldn't need to fear ghosts, as they are not bothered with us. Often, typical people could be standing right next to a ghost, in bright daylight, without even knowing it. :)</p>
              <p>However, people with very negative energy levels ought to take care, as they will naturally attract ghosts' special attention in their vicinity, who need their type of energy. My post on Law of Attraction ( <a href="/forums/1381/topics/390177">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1381/topics/390177</a> ) will give more explanation why this is so. Less serious cases will result in energy drainage, and gradual growth of negativity in the person. More serious cases will take the form of possession, and take-over of the person's mind and behaviours (may not be every moment of the day like a zombie, but the person often loses control of himself/herself at crucial times).</p>
              <p>As for people who encounter frightening or more troublesome ghosts, it could be due to the ghosts' unfinished business, which could be related to them. Obviously, the intentional encounters are not meant to of 'fun nature'. The ghosts do not usually go hunting and killing a person outright, like in movies, but can cause things around the person to happen, that may harm him/her. Or in cases of possession, the affected person could do things that may harm himself, eg. slash wrists, causes multiple cuts with sharp objects etc.</p>
              <p>A very common misconception is that ghosts are afraid of religious (any religion/faith/belief) items, so by wearing these items or displaying them in the home/office, a person will be safe. Often times, people continue these beliefs to have a sense of security, but ghosts seldom bother about typical people, so these these people don't encounter harmful ghosts in their lives, so continue to believe that the religious items are keeping them safe.</p>
              <p>If the person has extremely negative energy levels, and/or has a lifeplan that requires him/her to encounter negative entities, in order to learn a certain lesson, he/she cannot avoid the encounters, no matter what religion/faith he/she has, or what items he/she carries. Only when the lesson has been learnt, will the encounters end. True unselfish faith/belief (of any religion or spirituality of Light nature) can then help the person to recover in a shorter time than normal, but not prevent the encounters. </p>
              <p>People who know how to help these ghosts move on to the appropriate realms should do so, as it's only humane to do so, and it's considered a good deed. Otherwise, seek help from those with the ability and proper experience to help them move on. They are stuck here in our realm, often due to trauma at death, or have unfinished business to settle, and have problems returning to the spiritual realm on their own.</p>
