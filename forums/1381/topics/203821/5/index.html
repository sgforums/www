She sang very well (much better than the priest  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> who sang some other song ). I forgotten the content but I remember need to repeat certain parts. And funny symbols on left hand margin, I think it was &lt;1. Haha.<br><br>The prayers very funny. They include the names of many Catholic saints (like Barthamelow) in brackets but never read. LOL .. print for what. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Today I solved the mystery of the offerings. Earlier I said no offerings during Mass, but I was corrected. Actually what happened was they don't pass the bag around like the Protestants (which I am more familiar with), they attached a long stick to the bag so the helpers walked around and people just drop their money.<br><br>Mass ends promptly on my watch. Exactly 1 hour.</div>
