So sometimes it isnt Christians' fault that they are hated also. Even Jesus Himself said the world will hate Christians just like how they hated Him bcos a disciple cannot be greater than his master. Also Jesus said that He came not to bring peace but a sword so that man's enemies will be within his household. Brothers will betray brothers, fathers against children, mother-in-laws vs daughter-in-laws etc etc.<br><br>Jesus is such a good compassionate loving Man already, still ppl hate Him &amp; crucify Him. How much more Christians who really follow Him?<br><br>So Christians need not feel too sad if persecution happens bcos then they are really accounted worthy to suffer for Jesus. Of course, we must not do wrong things ourselves as Peter(or is it Paul?) said we are not to suffer for doing evil things but to suffer for doing good.</div></blockquote>Christians are not Jesus and Jesus isnt a christian.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Because the prophecy that the Messiah will come from the House of David, Tribe of Judah, must be fulfilled.

(or else you think satan so stupid go and tempt someone who cannot be tempted?)</div></blockquote>The battle of Satan and God throughout the Old Testament is very interesting.<br><br>I'm not sure whether Christians have thought of this question (the pros like Ironside probably did):<br><br>God revealed His plan for salvation very early on. In Genesis 49:10:<br><br><blockquote>The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come, and to him shall the people be obedient.<br><br>The Herbew: Lo-yasur shevet miyhudah, umechokek miben raglaw; ad ki-yavo shiloh, welo yikhat amim.</blockquote>Since the origin of the Messiah (from Judah) is no open secret (satan can read Hebrew at least) .. how do you think satan tried to thwart the plan of God?<br><br>This topic is very interesting and we can start a new topic if enuff pple join in the discussion.<br><br>PS: Lau .. remember in the movie Passion satan was in the garden of gethesmane spying on Jesus. I believe even at the last minute .. satan was hoping God's plan of salvation will fail.</div>
