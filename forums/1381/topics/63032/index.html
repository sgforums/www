He had two horns like a lamb, but he spoke like a dragon. 12He exercised all the authority of the first beast on his behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed. 13And he performed great and miraculous signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth in full view of men. 14Because of the signs he was given power to do on behalf of the first beast, he deceived the inhabitants of the earth. He ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived. 15He was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that it could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. 16He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, 17so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name.<br>18This calls for wisdom.

            <div class='col-md body'>yes....6 is the number of man.666 is the mark of the beast just as there is the mark of God.<br><br>Both marks are impressed upon the foreheads. Satan is not original, watever God does, he tries to give another counterfeit version.<br><br>Those who belongs to God has a mark of God written across their foreheads...not a physical and visible sign but rather...the mark of God is the worship of God Himself and allegiance to Him.<br><br>Likewise, as what some ppl say that the cash cards and micro chips, barcodes and so on are the mark of the beast 666, well....personally i dun think so. These 'marks' are too common and many people are talking abt it...and cannot be the mark of beast. No doubt, the anti-christ may make use of such technologies to control people.<br><br>God in the Old Testament says that He will writes His name on the foreheads of those who belong to Him. what makes satan so high tech to make that mark into a micro chip?</div>
