              <p>there are many cases like what you mentioned, illnesses (like late stage cancer) got cured, happen in other religions too (e.g. Buddhism). thus, it does not happen to christians only. thus, there is nothing to be arrogant about.</p>

              <p><br>there is a thing called anecdoctal evidence and there is a thing call factual evidence.</p>
              <p>if you want anecdoctal evidence, then many of us are quite stupid when our parents refer to us as å‚»ä»”ã€‚</p>
              <p>my point is, sometimes you need to read beyond the actual meaning... many old folks say things like that because they do not want to be seen as being swayed by a supposedly "western" religion and may seem to feel a lose of face to them.</p>
              <p>but it is interesting, what you said that "many of these folks don't even go to church", then I ask, how so can one become a Christian, if they do not go to church?</p>
              <p>... and why is it that i see many old folks attending my church.... without their children?</p>
              <p>... and many of these old folks are also very good counsellors to young people....</p>
