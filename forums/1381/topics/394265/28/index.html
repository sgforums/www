              <p>Yes, while you guys are on that about state of mind.</p>
              <p>I do not discount any negative experiences you or others have had. I can only ask and hope your experience with Christians widens.</p>
              <p>There are many Christians who have not replied, and even more out there who do not conform to the stereotype many here in sgforums talk about.</p>
              <p>I can only hope that yourself and others keep an open mind and not slam the door shut on them just on basis that they are Christian. Likewise, how my Christian friends and I do not deal with non-christians on preconceived notions or with sweeping statements and perceptions.</p>
              <p>It is not about asking you to believe in the same faith and it is not about theological debate.</p>
              <p>This thing you say about negative thinking, I hope you apply it to your approach to Christians not just here but in your real daily lives as well.</p>

              <p>For anyone posting or making comments here, whatever faith or non-faith you may be.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself this, are you really doing it to share and for the discussion itself? Or are you just all about the arguement itself.</p>
              <p>To some people here more specifically and you know who you. You try to make it seem as if you are being wronged or bullied, when your words and questions are more aimed to provoke more than anything. It's even worse when you know you can phrase things differently, yet you phrase it deliberately to provoke, to anger, to incite ill-feeling. Yet you go about accussing others of being trolls. The irony and hypocrysy of it all.</p>
              <p>Theological debate here is moot in any case, because ultimately everybody here ends up in the same state of belief or non-belief. In any case, so often the debate goes haywire because of people who are all about the arguement and conflict rather than really trying to exchange ideas and understand the other. It's not just in this forum, it's in the whole of sgforums.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself as well, are you just carrying out your own perverted and warped sense of 'justice'? Are you just ranting or are you truly trying to make a point and to tell the person something. Provoking thought is one thing, provoking ill-feeling is another.</p>
              <p>You know yourself the intention of your posts, is it really to share and to communicate or is something more sinister that you mask with illusions of 'justice' or 'righteousness'.</p>

              <p>Thank you for making the distinction. I am not here to agree or disagree with you about them. I can only ask you to be more open and understanding about Christians and maybe even people in general.</p>
              <p>Rooney9 obviously has some very personal issues as well with Christians and other forumites who have posted here. I can only say leave him to his personal squabbles.</p>

              <p>What has happened now is the very reason why a former moderator
                      requested for this sub-forum to be closed. However, for reasons I
                      stated earlier, it will not be closed.</p>
              <p>In fact, I'm sure a few of the senior forumites here are fully
                      aware of it. Yet one or two of them in particular come in and
                      continue to do what they do because they know the forum won't get
                      closed. They also know they will not even be asked or told off to
                      cease and desist the negative things they are doing and they take
                      joy in the conflict and negativity they cause.</p>
              <p>The manner of your posts not just here but in other forums says
                      volumes about what you are and what you are trying to do. If it was
                      just telling people your thoughts you could do it differently, but
                      you know that don't you?</p>

              <p>I'm just guessing but maybe it's the format of the forums that has caused your misunderstanding. This post above by me is not part of the post that quoted you. So it was not directed to you.</p>
              <p>Hope you can at least note that I've tried to understand where you are coming from.</p>
              <p>I find it very sad that based on past correspondance we had some ok conversation, it's very sad and dissappointing. To clarify, I am not dissappointed with you in particular, just dissappointed that this misunderstanding has happened.</p>

              <p>Yes, we all know who you are talking about....that laurence82 better known now as mickey mouse he lor...it's obvious what. and he will encourage and flame his doggy gang to continue.....there is nothing we can do about it or we should do about it. . It's his character or lack of it....as proven all over this forum. let him add on to his own bad karma......which is very rotten already.......</p>
              <p>you don't waste your time talking sense and being polite with this gang of doggies.....they just bark and now even pee up the wrong trees....</p>
              <p>since you bother to read, you will know that they are never here to discuss or prepared to. they are here to bark up the wrong trees......and will never face up to what they said. simply put, they have no guts and will escape by making rude, abusive, personal attacks, twist the facts and wriggle out by trolling pages after pages.....</p>
              <p>you expect them to live to their words? forget it! they are cowards and this is why I said that Christians who are not preached those issue these doggies are barking about thread in thread out will be comforted that they are being preached the right thing. And looking at the kind of behaviour of these doggies, aren't you happy that you can tell what is right and wrong?</p>
              <p>unlike that mickey mouse he and doggy gang who cannot even differentiate between A &amp; B.....</p>
              <p>and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>these are all not non-believers as they like to call themselves but anti-christians.</strong></span></p>
              <p>calling themselves non-belivers is to add numbers, so that they can flame non-beliveres and sow hatred. evil intend as usual.</p>
              <p>just stay out as they will mud-sling you.......and call you names non-stop.....because they do not know what else to do here.....especially when deep inside them, they know we speak the truth.</p>
              <p>you are right - <em><strong>It is one thing to be a non-Christian. It is a
                                      different thing to be an anti-Christian.</strong></em></p>
