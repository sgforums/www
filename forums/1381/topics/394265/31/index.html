              <p><em>Ask yourself this, are you really doing it to share and for the
                              discussion itself? Or are you just all about the arguement
                              itself.</em></p>
              <p><em>To some people here more specifically and you know who you. You
                              try to make it seem as if you are being wronged or bullied, when
                              your words and questions are more aimed to provoke more than
                              anything. It's even worse when you know you can phrase things
                              differently, yet you phrase it deliberately to provoke, to anger,
                              to incite ill-feeling. Yet you go about accussing others of being
                              trolls. The irony and hypocrysy of it all.</em></p>
              <p><em>Theological debate here is moot in any case, because ultimately
                              everybody here ends up in the same state of belief or non-belief.
                              In any case, so often the debate goes haywire because of people who
                              are all about the arguement and conflict rather than really trying
                              to exchange ideas and understand the other. It's not just in this
                              forum, it's in the whole of sgforums.</em></p>
              <p><em>Ask yourself as well, are you just carrying out your own
                              perverted and warped sense of 'justice'? Are you just ranting or
                              are you truly trying to make a point and to tell the person
                              something. Provoking thought is one thing, provoking ill-feeling is
                              another.</em></p>
              <p><em>You know yourself the intention of your posts, is it really to
                              share and to communicate or is something more sinister that you
                              mask with illusions of 'justice' or 'righteousness'.</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              
              <p>I'd like to repeat this not just for people who mention about others trying to make themselves appear as victims, but for anyone in general.</p>

              <p>I think it's very obvious I do not have a problem with non-Christians in itself.</p>
              <p>Also, I don't think what you are going through now can hardly be called persecution. I think it's not fair to those other people who are really getting persecuted. And I am not referring to just members of a particular faith or non-faith.</p>

              <p>In case you are trying to insiniuate something, just like to point out again that I do no have a problem with non-Christians. It is obvious as well.</p>
              <p>I believe your comment about FB game is just your own comment and unrelated to whatever I have said.</p>
