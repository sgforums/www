              <p>Once again, you completely showed that you are incapable of
              defending your stand and so you "siam" by bashing rubbish......and
              making wild assumption like "googoomuck and tehtarlek may well be
              the same person" or is it because you are clone of somebody and
              feeling guilty and insecure?</p>
              <p>Your mind and beliefs  is fixed (as proven by what you
              post) and you claimed you want to ask questions to clarify?</p>
              <p>When you hear nonsense uttered, you believed that that's what
              Christianity is about and bashed them non-stop - yet  when you
              heard it yourself (something good),  you believe
              otherwise.....</p>
              <p>Be honest lah and don't think we cannot tell that you are a
              hippocrate and like you said, you have no credibility at all.</p>
              <p>You are bashing based on your wrong and misconceptions and yes,
              thus barking up the wrong tree.....</p>
              <p>Otherwise, try to defend and make a stand on what you said as
              quoted. Don't hide like a coward.</p>
              <p>Or you just go on barking up the wrong tree..............</p>

              <p>I merely quote what he said and asked him to make a stand.... and stop barking up the wrong tree.... cannot? Flamming?</p>
              <p>Can he explained himself? Or did he fly into making wild, rude and nonsense bashing? Is that the kind of right behaviour you think we should all adopt?</p>
              <p>And before you said that (flamming), it is wise to read every page (I know it is 
                          long) and then you may realise that there was no personal flame (I can't
                           speak for dongdongtan - maybe he does cause he thinks I am googoomuck).</p>
              <p>Actually, I feel your current actions is trying to flame dongdongtan to continue with his behaviour.......which may be agreeable to you?</p>
              <p>I am not sure what led to the downfall etc....but you read the the thread here and you get the clue on what's happening. That's why I said, EH has more non-christians than christians and it has become a christian bashing forum....</p>
              <p>Rony Tah, CHC, NCC whatever are really a small fraction of Christianity (and many will agree that they twisted the gospel and present wrap teachings) and their actions  does not represent Christianity as a whole.</p>
              <p>Which is why I said that main stream Christians are comforted to know that they are preached the right thing.</p>

              <p>Hey guys, we dont have to take the topic so literally...for one religion is up to everyone's interpretation, and us being humans ultimately means everyone has their own opinions and way of life. Some prefer to have a guiding light in their lives via their embracing of a higher being, supposedly with better knowledge to guide them in the path of light, whereas others believe in themselves. Even in these two camps there are innumerable variations...free-thinkers, atheists, self-believers etc.</p>
              <p>Personally i am a free-thinker, and i am happy about it. However we shouldnt place our own preferences upon others, without allowances for multiple thinkings and such. Tolerance and respect are of utmost importance, and its because of the lack of that we have terrorism, racial riots, breakouts etc.</p>

              <p>Tehtarlek, I have this question for you. On page 16 of this
                  thread I said:</p>
              <p>Christians in today's world mostly preach about the love of God,
                  they tend to omit the jealous, violent and authoritarian side of
                  God as shown in the OT.</p>
              <p>I wonder what are your view on this?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>My personal views is that you need to understand the context in the OT - something I cannot help you over this forum.......</p>
              <p>But, think about it - if christians believed in hell today, then God is still "violent" right?</p>
              <p>In my opinion, God does not send people to heaven or hell..... People choose where they want to go.......but the way to heaven is only made possible by the death of Jesus Christ. (Not everyone will accept this which is fine)</p>
              <p>Like someone said earlier, all religions (other than cults, extremist etc..) do teach people to be good and that include Christianity (and someone who is barking against christians also leak in his post that he heard the pastor preaching to his congregation to be good)  As far as I am concerned, being good and doing good is the path to heaven....</p>
              <p>and if one know that something is a sin or wrong and continues to do it anyway, then they are moving away from heaven....</p>
              <p>and did God put them in hell? Or did they choose to walk down that path?</p>
              <p>And if one do not believe in heaven and hell, then nothing else to discuss....it is just that - one choose not to believe...</p>
              <p>And if you choose to believe in Christ, then following His way is the only way to heaven. For Christians, following Christ's commandment is the way. If a Christian continues to sin and still think he will escape hell, then I think that's his own illusion....</p>
              <p>You choose your own path....not God. God is love cause He points you in the direction to heaven.....and in Christian context, follow Christ's way.</p>
              <p>Hope this will help and for those who comes to attack and bark on this, I will not response and you go on barking for all you want.</p>
