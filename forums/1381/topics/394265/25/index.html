              <p>so now i know why you guys resorted to barking, name calling, rude remarks etc...</p>
              <p>it's a sign of desperation.....i see. understood.</p>
              <p>but of course, non-believers like you and your doggy gang will continue to bark and avoid facing facts that you guys lied........luckily you and your doggy gang is not a true representation of all 
              non-believers</p>
              <p>and your lies and barkings will never put believers down succesfully........</p>
