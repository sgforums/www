              <p>My personal views is that you need to understand the context in the OT - something I cannot help you over this forum.......</p>
              <p>But, think about it - if christians believed in hell today, then God is still "violent" right?</p>
              <p>In my opinion, God does not send people to heaven or hell..... People choose where they want to go.......but the way to heaven is only made possible by the death of Jesus Christ. (Not everyone will accept this which is fine)</p>
              <p>Like someone said earlier, all regilions (other than cults, extremist etc..) do teach people to be good and that include Christianity (and someone who is barking against christians also leak in his post that he heard the pastor preaching to his congregation to be good)  As far as I am concerned, being good and doing good is the path to heaven....</p>
              <p>and if one know that something is a sin or wrong and continues to do it anyway, then they are moving away from heaven....</p>
              <p>and did God put them in hell? Or did they choose to walk down that path?</p>
              <p>And if one do not believe in heaven and hell, then nothing else to discuss....it is just that - one choose not to believe...</p>
              <p>And if you choose to believe in Christ, then following His way is the only way to heaven. For Christians, following Christ's commandment is the way. If a Christian continues to sin and still think he will escape hell, then I think that's his own illusion....</p>
              <p>You choose your own path....not God. God is love cause He points you in the direction to heaven.....and in Christian context, follow Christ's way.</p>
              <p>Hope this will help and for those who comes to attack and bark on this, I will not response and you go on barking for all you want.</p>

              <p>If religions cannot stand up to facts and science and gets bashed, there is nothing you can do about it. But first, not every bashing is supported by facts and like rony tan's bashing on Buddhism, supported by ignorance. There are too many instances of miracles in the christian faith that cannot be supported by facts and therefore gets bashed which is expected.</p>

              <p>You are right and I have no problem with that.... but many times, science or not, christians bashing are also based purely on ignorance and hear say....too.</p>

                                      stopped his behavior (at least for the time being in thsi thread)
                                      ????</p>
              <p>33,000 members is not a small fraction? How small do you think
                                      the Christian community is ?</p>
              <p>You defend what? Bad behaviour? Barking?</p>
              <p>again, do what you preach -  cease and desist flaming
                                      people</p>
              <p>Once again, please do what you preach - stop your personal
                                      flaming and get a life</p>
              <p>It is proof that you do not read carefully and think......and
                                      please get a life and stop twisting facts.</p>
              <p>You are right that there is complete lack of intellect, wisdom
                                      whatsover - in fact, it's a no brainer......when following the
                                      commandment simply means doing good and if one choose to do good,
                                      then heaven is the reward....if one choose to do evil, then heaven
                                      has no place for them. If that beats you....no one can help.</p>

              <p>He is running away like a coward and diverting attentions with
              rude, wild allegations, lies and barks.....and like I said before,
              perhaps, that's the kind of right behaviour you can accept and like
              to encourage...??</p>
              <p>You loved his kind of behaviour don't you? Especially used in
              this forum against christians.... Make your stand on this.</p>
              <p>He have no guts to make any stand and it has nothing to do with
              anyone else.....you just kaypo here and flamming him ...... I did
              not falsey accussed him of anything and if anyone else has done
              that, it's have got nothing tyo do with me or you.....</p>
              <p>And how do you know when he will make any stand and under what
              circumstances? Another flamming tactic of yours since he has
              stopped his behavior (at least for the time being in thsi thread)
              ????</p>

              <p>Behaviour? You mean i like to start thread bashing non christians and then tick off non christians who defend themselves? Unfortunately the answer is no</p>
              <p>Since you are the one who started this behaviour in this thread, lets start from you first..unless you wish to continue avoiding?</p>
              <p>Precisely, a pastor who commands the following of at least 33,000 people...you said small numbers of christians nia, but to everyone else its a big impact</p>
              <p>So stop brushing down what the likes of rony tan and takeover of aware people did</p>
