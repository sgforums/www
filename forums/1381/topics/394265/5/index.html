              <p>Because of that holier than thou attitude</p>

If the way to heaven is by signing up for a 'membership' with God, then I guess I'll rather go to hell than be stuck with hypocrites for the rest of eternity.</p>

              <p>But the only problem is, we think we can totally comprehend God. We are setting Man's limits on God. lol. We are talking about an Omniscient being. Problem is also that we are NOT Omniscient, so how the hell can we think like an Omniscient ? hahaha</p>
