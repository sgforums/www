              <p>many people ask why Yahweh would have so many requirements of us... yet many do not stop to think, we live on the earth with its laws and regulations, we are expected to behave a certain way according to the laws and customs of each country, and if one needs to present oneself before a king, we do not just walk in unannounced, in times past, this could be cause for loosing your head.</p>
              <p>so why the rituals and why the blood? Because Yahweh has prescribed for us how we should come to Him, we are visiting with the King, so should we not follow the correct procedure? it is what He has required of us to do. The blood is not just for salvation, redemption and restoration,  there is also the sanctification and justification so that we may come into the presence of Yahweh.</p>
              <p>Yahweh has set down rulings and laws and the way we have to do things, what confidence can we have then in a G_d who is fickle and changeable as the weather? Therefore because He has required certain things of us to be cleansed and to be made pure, He himself had to give us the example, according to His prescribed practice so that we may have the confidence in Him. He can forgive, but without the blood, the angel of death will not passover us. Hence the required sacrifice once and for all to defeat sin and death, this though not for now, but for the world to come.</p>
              <p>whether you can or cannot justify the cause for His existence, He still is. None of us can change that fact.</p>

              <p>Yaakov did not steal the birthright from Esau, if you are able to understand and read hebrew, you will read it very differently, it was actually Yaakov that was supposed to be the first born and it was Esau who tried to steal the birthright and destroy Yaakov at the same time.In hebrew, when the passage in the Tenakh describes the meeting of Esau and Yaakov after Yaakov had Rivkah and Leah, there are six dots above the description of the word in hebrew for kiss, meaning that Esau wanted to bite Yaakov and it was not as brotherly a kiss as it would seem in english.</p>

              <p>That is the reason why not everyone is a Christian. It is a
              matter of personal choice. Faith is something which is not seen yet
              believed. Just like how people believes in electricity but it is
              something not seen. For the visible is temporal but the invisible
              is eternal. For the atheist, they can say that those who believe in
              God are weak minded but Christians say that for they weak, their
              God is their strength. Christianity is for those who are weak &amp;
              helpless. It is not for those who are strong &amp; mighty in their
              own strength &amp; wisdom.</p>
              <p>It is about a God who accepts you no matter who you are &amp;
              what you did. It is about a God who came as Man to know your pains
              &amp; to pay for your sins so that He can have your curses &amp;
              you can have His blessings. His finished work trancends time so
              that He would only have to die once &amp; rest on His Father's
              right hand after His work is completed. You may ask how many Gods
              are there in Christianity. I can say it is One but the One is the
              Triune God. The Son, the Father &amp; the Spirit. Just like me, I
              am the son, the father &amp; the husband. For the Israelites call
              Him "Elohim", which is in plural whereas ,"Eloha" is in singular.
              Eloha is used in other faiths in other languages.</p>
              <p>About the Blood issue,what I have stated is just the revelations
              mentioned in the Bible. Extracted from the book of Exodus. The eve
              of the passover when Moses brought his people out from Egypt &amp;
              the people of Israel ate the passover lamb. God sent the angel of
              death to bring judgement on the Eygptians. For the angel of death
              did not see the good deeds of the Israelites but the blood of the
              Lamb on the door post &amp; passed over them. For they believed in
              the blood &amp; ate the Lamb for their healing from all the
              inflictions which the Eygptions gave them. You can say that it is
              written by Man. But at the end of the day it is about the
              individual choice. As for me, I believe.</p>

              <p>Still the blessings will not come until there is obedience to Torah, where else do you find the blessings? If you want to claim the blessings, you have to take the responsibility of following Torah, without which you will most definitely get the curses.</p>
              <p>Yahweh is Echad, one, the idea and nature of a triune god does not exist in the bible.</p>
              <p>There is no where mentioned in the bible that the Ruach, Yahweh and Yeshua are one. It is only mentioned that Yahweh and Yeshua are one.</p>
              <p>There is more to the blood than meets the eye but the naunces will be lost to the traditional christian believer unless you understand the temple and the temple sacrifices.</p>

              <p>Christians believes anyone who disbelieve in their God would go to Hell. I apologise to you if you ever had such tactless remarks by my fellow believers. But think with me for a moment &amp; look around you. The human race is attacked by new viruses, natural disasters, economic crisis &amp; it seems that those problems are getting from bad to worse recently. We don't need Hell to see all the sufferings. Just look around you.</p>
              <p>The weak &amp; the helpless believe in God so that they can have hope towards life. Don't you agree that life can be harsh &amp; cruel? Faith is the strength for us to carrying on with life in the face of adversity because human life is more fragile than you think. You can say that faith may be just a part of our imagination. The end results is the attitude towards life. The human life is fragile &amp; yet there are times miracles just sprout out of nowwhere. If not why most doctors choose not to reveal the truth to patients with terminal illnesses? Faith can be unproven very easily. But what is the gain? To prove whether a belief is right or wrong? A moment of victory in life?</p>
              <p>Believers of different faiths have different ways to express their faiths. For Christians, the centre of the Christian faith is in a sinless yet powerful highest form of being giving up His life so that you can have His blessings &amp; He can have your curses. Can you imagine it is something like a parent sacrificing an organ for his beloved child but this is something on a even greater scale. For the Bible says that if you as a imperfect parent knows how to give good things to your child how much does you Heavenly Father above? These is a great expression of love that the Greeks call it "Agape" The greatest expression of love where no human can achieve.</p>
              <p>I agree that that is totally beyond any human logic. But can you tell me whether faith is logical or not? It may seem foolish to believe but I will rather choose believe than to face the harsh realities of life. Yes. This seems like an excuse to escape from problems but in the 1st place if you can solve all the problems on your own there is no need to believe. That is why Christianity is for the weak &amp; helpless who has seen themselves coming to the end of the road. However, sometimes the end can be the beginning. You just need that streak of hope to carry on. It may not have to be Jesus. Human are created with freedom to choose, my God did not force anyone to choose Him although sometimes believers may have gone overboard. I chose Jesus because I see His goodness.</p>

As for what god prescribes, how do you know it is true? It is ultimately written by a man. Who can say what is "correct" and what is wrong? You choose to believe the bible, yet why do you ignore the orders to kill and plunder found in over 800 instances in the bible? As for jesus being an example, thousands upon millions of people die in wars in the past centuries, one man's death wouldn't make a difference in the eyes of god.</p>

              <p>in the natural kingdoms of the world, when there is an invasion or a war, the kings of those warring nations would give the order to plunder and destroy the other kingdoms. Likewise in the bible when the nation of Yisrael who are Yahweh's chosen go out against the rest of the kingdoms out there who worship other gods, the order will be to destroy and kill, would you leave your enemies alive knowing that they can you more harm later as evidenced by some of the kings who did not totally destroy the nations that they were sent against, these have lived to harass the nation of Yisrael till today.</p>
              <p>you can accept that kings and rulers in the world today order to kill and destroy, but you cannot accept that Yahweh would command His people to do the same of the enemies of Yisrael?</p>
              <p>hence I have already said you do not understand the rituals of the temple and the significance of them and the requirements that have been laid down by Hashem. Natural kings have their set requirements, why can't Elohim have them too? Thousands have died but thousands are not the perfect lamb.</p>
              <p>to you the bible may just be some story book written by men... but to the nation of Yisrael, it is their history.</p>

              <p>Christians believes anyone who disbelieve in their God would go
              to Hell. I apologise to you if you ever had such tactless remarks
              by my fellow believers. But think with me for a moment &amp; look
              around you. The human race is attacked by new viruses, natural
              disasters, economic crisis &amp; it seems that those problems are
              getting from bad to worse recently. We don't need Hell to see all
              the sufferings. Just look around you.</p>
              <p>The weak &amp; the helpless believe in God so that they can have
              hope towards life. Don't you agree that life can be harsh &amp;
              cruel? Faith is the strength for us to carrying on with life in the
              face of adversity because human life is more fragile than you
              think. You can say that faith may be just a part of our
              imagination. The end results is the attitude towards life. The
              human life is fragile &amp; yet there are times miracles just
              sprout out of nowwhere. If not why most doctors choose not to
              reveal the truth to patients with terminal illnesses? Faith can be
              unproven very easily. But what is the gain? To prove whether a
              belief is right or wrong? A moment of victory in life?</p>
              <p>Believers of different faiths have different ways to express
              their faiths. For Christians, the centre of the Christian faith is
              in a sinless yet powerful highest form of being giving up His life
              so that you can have His blessings &amp; He can have your curses.
              Can you imagine it is something like a parent sacrificing an organ
              for his beloved child but this is something on a even greater
              scale. For the Bible says that if you as a imperfect parent knows
              how to give good things to your child how much does you Heavenly
              Father above? These is a great expression of love that the Greeks
              call it "Agape" The greatest expression of love where no human can
              achieve.</p>
              <p>I agree that that is totally beyond any human logic. But can you
              tell me whether faith is logical or not? It may seem foolish to
              believe but I will rather choose believe than to face the harsh
              realities of life. Yes. This seems like an excuse to escape from
              problems but in the 1st place if you can solve all the problems on
              your own there is no need to believe. That is why Christianity is
              for the weak &amp; helpless who has seen themselves coming to the
              end of the road. However, sometimes the end can be the beginning.
              You just need that streak of hope to carry on. It may not have to
              be Jesus. Human are created with freedom to choose, my God did not
              force anyone to choose Him although sometimes believers may have
              gone overboard. I chose Jesus because I see His goodness.</p>

              <p>Hey breyton/Catknight,</p>
              <p>Judaism is coming back as the true scripture god intended. Every
              generation just like the torah days, evil nations and their pagan
              religions (christianity, baal, asteroth, greek myth, etc) will not
              stay long and His Laws and Will comes back to newer generations
              becuase the Law is everlasting and naturally logical.</p>
              <p>Because WWII showed that the christians and muslim leaders know
              the rising of Judaism is a threat to them and thats why they use
              the war as a guise to exterminate them systematically.</p>
              <p>But God's Promise prevailed as long as there is ONE righteous
              Jew. </p>
              <p>This internet genearation where the hebrew scripture is open for
              all to see will be the finality of Christian NT and Quram.</p>
              <p>The proof is in the text. There is nothing to discuss or
              intimidate like what you are doing now brey.</p>

              <p>when you talk about Yahweh, you have to take the whole thing into context, not just as the christians today preach a G_d of love, grace etc... the christians seem to forget that they are worshipping the G_d of Avraham, Yitzak and Yaakov... it is the whole book of the bible that describes who He is, what He wants and how we interact with Him.</p>

              <p>Even extermination based on race and religion? It is certainly ironic that we call Hitler a murderer for his extermination of Jews, but don't flinch after reading the racist genocides depicted in the bible. It really shows how a religion can use the excuse of god to justify anything, which is my main contendment with the abrahamic religions. Why would god actually command his followers to kill when he could just do it himself? It certainly seems that god is not the actual voice to the people, but rather the justification of it.</p>
