            <div class='col-md body'>Hi just to share a simple testimony abt the power of prayer in Jesus name.<br><br>My bro &amp; i were in the car waiting for a parking lot at Bishan Junction 8. We were running out of time for the cinema show. He stopped the car &amp; waited somewhere in front of the fully parked lots. We then decided to pray for a parking lot. I was a bit low on faith but i don't know abt my bro. Nevertheless i prayed with much difficulty a short prayer.<br><br>Do u know what happened the second after we prayed? Yes in a few seconds, the male car owner of the car directly where we were, came &amp; drove the car away. We were in the lot just less than a minute after we prayed.<br><br>This happened quite some time ago. It also happened many times already to us. Wow that was some answer!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I would encourage ppl not to give up praying bcos God might just answer directly &amp; quickly. I would also encourage those who never prayed to try praying to God. Who knows what might happen?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[quote]Originally posted by Chin Eng:<br>My comments above is an attempt to highlight the attitude of Christians, who may have focused on the wrong things.<br><br>Healing? or Strength to perserve? We all know that healing does not always come. So if healing does not come, what then? Blame God for not healing, or ask for strength to perserve. <strong>Nowadays some Christians focus more on the blessings rather than on Christ. Think this is how it draws people to the church but imho it won't keep them in church. Once the blessings dun realise they will seek blessings else where, mebbe a Toa Pek Kong Temple. This is like a "MacChrist" mentality rather than seeking god sincerely.</strong><br><br>Good results in exams? or Concentration to study hard? By merely focusing on the results and asking God to provide, we are not taking the responsibility to work hard ourselves. So do we need to ask for miracles each time, or ask for strength to work hard? <strong>For me, I always told myself I work hard and let GOD do the rest. It is silly to just pray and not work hard. My pastor once shared that he has a fren who believe that if he go to a certain church he can pass his exams. In the end he failed and stop going church entirely. Dependence on blessings will not make one a better believer. Meditate rather on god's word rather than his blessings is more important, which is why I am against the health/wealth prosperity.</strong><br><br>Wealth? or Stewardship? Is wealth a given thing, or are we admonished to be good stewards? Focusing on wealth is "I am entitled to the money because I am God's child!". Focusing on stewardship is "I have been given all I need and I want to be able to handle it"<br><br><strong>True....the most important is....we are all merely stewards of the money we have now...some christians bend on stocking treasures for themselves in this world rather than for heaven, hence account for all the big cars/condos and the thing they use for defence is quite stupid, which I will not elaborate further. </strong><br><br></div>

Then u can either condemn Him or confess He is true after all.</div></blockquote>so when other religions pray to their Gods and their prayers are answered, does that mean that Christianity is either false in saying its the only true religion, or that there are more Gods than the Christian God, or what? Because there are so many more testimonies about the power of other faith's prayers as well. What does it really prove? I guess then by the same logic that miracles have happened in most faiths' prayers, all religions and their Gods and beliefs are true and valid, not just Christianity's, and that makes it immoral for Christians (or people from any other religion) to say that non-believers go to hell. Thats what getting your prayer answered proves.</div>
