We all know that healing does not always come. So if healing does not come, what then? Blame God for not healing, or ask for strength to perserve. [b]Nowadays some Christians focus more on the blessings rather than on Christ. Think this is how it draws people to the church but imho it won't keep them in church. Once the blessings dun realise they will seek blessings else where, mebbe a Toa Pek Kong Temple. This is like a "MacChrist" mentality rather than seeking god sincerely.</strong><br><br>Good results in exams? or Concentration to study hard? By merely focusing on the results and asking God to provide, we are not taking the responsibility to work hard ourselves. So do we need to ask for miracles each time, or ask for strength to work hard? <strong>For me, I always told myself I work hard and let GOD do the rest. It is silly to just pray and not work hard. My pastor once shared that he has a fren who believe that if he go to a certain church he can pass his exams. In the end he failed and stop going church entirely. Dependence on blessings will not make one a better believer. Meditate rather on god's word rather than his blessings is more important, which is why I am against the health/wealth prosperity.</strong><br><br>Wealth? or Stewardship? Is wealth a given thing, or are we admonished to be good stewards? Focusing on wealth is "I am entitled to the money because I am God's child!". Focusing on stewardship is "I have been given all I need and I want to be able to handle it"<br><br><strong>True....the most important is....we are all merely stewards of the money we have now...some christians bend on stocking treasures for themselves in this world rather than for heaven, hence account for all the big cars/condos and the thing they use for defence is quite stupid, which I will not elaborate further. </strong><br><br>[/b]</blockquote>I might not be xtian or even very religious, but im not wrong in saying that the right attitude towards praying is to ask for the inner strength to endure hardships in times of trouble.

Right now, my older son continues to tell me what goes on in his life and occasionally, I will share with him my opinions on some of the decisions he had made. But I have no wish to have him needing me to help him do what he wants to do, because I have mentored him sufficiently for he to be independent.<br><br>I will be very sad if my sons come up to me with the what's-in-it-for me attitude, or "I-deserve-this-because-I am-your-son".<br><br>I am not addressing the love of God for us, which is unquestionable. I am addressing the flippant attitudes of Christians who pray in with a wrong attitude and for the wrong reason.<br><br>I believe God wants us to continue to pray him through worship and praise, as well as seeking his direction, but I think he will be sad when his children continue to seek shallow answers and short term goals, like, "I want to go out, God, please stop the rain" or "I pray for good results, God, and I have confident you'd provide, so I just go out and play now".[/i]</div></blockquote>My point in my reply is to where to draw the line in prayer, my idea of prayer is that we can go to God, our Father for anything (whether He think its best for us or not is another issue), another thing about prayer is that its not only about asking for things/favor or when there is a need, its also about sharing our concerns/worries/happiness/thanksgiving...etc it can be any aspect of our lives, its about submitting everything to him in prayers and supplication believing that He indeed hears our prayers.<br>God bless.</div>
