            <div class='col-md body'>Then does god have a religion? Do u mean god is a Christian? Or Cathalic or others? People say my god is the greatest. So do u mean god is so great that he only save Christians? If he is so great that onli help the believers?  Do u know u have underestimate the greatness of the god u believe in? Do u believe tat he is so great tat he is always with everyone in the universe and talks to us though our heart? He is always with us never leave us. If onli u open your heart, my dear friends. Why did u believe tat he is so great tat he save u but not mi? God have no form. He is the great unseen. He saves everyone. His love for us is eternal, and so ours to him. We can't seek god from the outside. Tats why I say he speaks through us. Have u wonder why all religion prays, regardless of the method. Bcos we seek him within. We all are always one and will always be one. God bless us all.</div>

              <p>Guys, I just wanna say that there is one common message that God want us to follow; obey god and don't associate partners with him. No matter you are a jew, christian or a muslim, we share the common belief of god-fearing. I would just like to highlight to you what i have learnt at the MUIS Lecture 2010 which took place at Hyatt Hotel last night on the topic "Forging a Common Humanity" by Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, Chairman of the Cordoba Initiative.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In his lecture, he highlighted a verse in the Quran that says "O mankind! We have created you from one male and one female, and fashioned you into tribes and nations that you might get to know one another. Indeed the best of you with God are the most pious of you."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do note it doesn't say "O Muslims!" in the Quran. It always refers to "O Mankind!", even in the last sermon of the prophet Muhammad, he refered to those who listened as "O Mankind!". It's just that with passage of time, muslims began to think that they are more superior than others. This is sadly true especially in the middle east where you here plenty of clerics saying condemn jews! I'm not joking, They even show pics of the Holocaust and say that this is what the Jews deserve.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You think that 'O believers!" only refer to muslims only? By god! It can also refer to others who are god-fearing as well. We need to forge a brotherhood regardless of race, language or religion to come together and form a common humanity where there is no wars, no injustice, no corruption.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There was an example in the form of Cordoba, a community in spain in the 9th century where people regardless of religion lived together in peace. Do note this verse from the Quran before i leave you that most people don't seem to get into their head.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"There is NO COMPULSION in religion"</p>
              <p> </p>
