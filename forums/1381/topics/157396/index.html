            <div class='col-md body'>I think it's very strange to me that Christians who run the website apologetics index r willing to come down hard on so called "errant heretic" branches of Christianity but r almost silent on buddhism &amp; buddha. Pls go to:<br><br><a href="http://www.apologeticsindex.org/b13.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.apologeticsindex.org/b13.html</a><br><br>Also they r silent on taoism. Go to link:<br><br><a href="http://www.apologeticsindex.org/t00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.apologeticsindex.org/t00.html</a><br><br>Also similarly for islam. Go to link:<br><br><a href="http://www.apologeticsindex.org/i07.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.apologeticsindex.org/i07.html</a><br><br>They r also not hard on ecumenical cults like New Age:<br><br><a href="http://www.apologeticsindex.org/n09.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.apologeticsindex.org/n09.html</a><br><br>&amp; Eckankar:<br><br><a href="http://www.apologeticsindex.org/e13.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.apologeticsindex.org/e13.html</a><br><br>for egs.<br><br>Why the tolerance of other religions but not "heretics" in church? Is it silent acceptance of other mainstream religions &amp; ecumenical cults but when it comes to Christians who r deemed "heretics", they r implicitly &amp; explicitly persecuted? I dont know what the website owners r up to (maybe just provide database info of all religions, cults, sects or afraid of backlash by other religions?) but pls go to their freedom of religion webpage:<br><br><a href="http://www.apologeticsindex.org/r04.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.apologeticsindex.org/r04.html</a> to see what they r talking abt. Also click this link for their views on religious pluralism:<br><br><a href="http://www.apologeticsindex.org/p14.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.apologeticsindex.org/p14.html</a><br><br>I suffice to say read for yourself &amp; dont judge by what others say only. Come to a conclusion yourself not just listen to anyone. Pls read 1 John 2:22-23: "Who is a liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is Antichrist who denies the Father &amp; the Son. Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who acknowledges the Son has the Father also." Also, i urge u to read the whole bk of 1 John. God bless u all!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The meaning of the word "Apologetics" as defined by the dictionary:<br>1. The branch of theology that is concerned with defending or proving the truth of Christian doctrines.<br>2. Formal argumentation in defense of something, such as a position or system<br><br>First and foremost the purpose of apologetics is to defend or to prove the truth of Christian doctrines - THIS IS AN INTERNAL AUDIT CHECK. An internal audit of those who call ourselves Christians. Hence the emphasis on any organisation or individual who call themselves Christian.<br><br>You are probably a little upset that I am able to show that your sources of information is, at best, questionable, at worst, heretical.<br><br>I do not make it a point to run you down. Unfortunately when we post links, we need to be responsible for what we are putting up. It has to stand up to the scrutiny of the many forumites who take great pains to ensure that what we put up is credible. That, you have not done so.<br><br>The apologetics site that I have shared contains links from every conceivable angle of arguments, one only need to go into these links to draw their conclusions.</div>

I didnt flame anyone here in the 1st place until they flame me, w/c i regret &amp; apologise. I was saying beware of dangerous ideas slipping into church today subconciously. Should we be so tolerant that we lose our focus? Should the other religionists or govt use RHA &amp; sedition laws to restrict evangelism or even discussing religion in public? What if u happen to evangelise to a buddhist student &amp; their parents complained to the press &amp; MOE like what happened recently? What will happen if MOE decides to ban preaching in even Christian schools? As i said, i am deeply saddened &amp; discouraged by seeing the church not united &amp; hitting out at one another with many cults forming. Do we want to condemn those 2 young men for spewing obscenities in the name of religion when even other religions have forgiven &amp; accepted them? Both r destroyed career wise with a new yellow coloured ic for criminals. How to find jobs? Even if they find jobs, ppl will look at them w coloured glasses. Christians in general might even be hated for this incident. So how?</div>
