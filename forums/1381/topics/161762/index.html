The first time to inform the other EH folks that it exist, the second was to followup to MC2 suggestion to have either you or JTB answer that query. As JTB's forum is suppose to deal with apocalyptic matters, it may be a better platform to post, plus wouldn't it make that forum more credible instead of having JTB or you only posting stuffs?<br>My dissecting your posts? Don't take it personally, I dissect everything I hear, including things from my family members. I even dissect even my own posts (as can be seen on the first para here). I don't see it wrong to dissect posts especially when we are trying to go through facts. Unless the entire thread is some boh-liao nonsense, we can joke about it. Otherwise, it's facts, facts and facts. You don't like me to dissect your post? Write responsibly. The fact that you disclose PMs shows your lack of maturity. Think! why is it termed PERSONAL MESSAGES?<br><br>To Laoda and NT:<br>I want to reiterate to Laoda (assuming he's reading) and Neon (aka NT2), that I DID NOT COMPLAIN about you guys. Our styles may be different, but such are personal issues and no cause for complain. I wanted to bring HH, previously known as JNWK into the EH family by explaining to him what had transpired between you guys and some of your favourite nemesis, plus giving him my opinion on some of your writing styles compared to his.<br><br>Back to HH<br>I am aware that you are peeved with my style. I don't like your style either, but I live with it. I have <strong>never </strong>complained to anyone about you except for that one time that someone PMed with a question relating to you and JTB which I replied with my comments (not complain).<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Btw, you sound and behave more and more like a small kid to me too.<br></strong></blockquote><br>It's ok.... it's your opinion.

When encountered with such a situation and you know that the information is wrong, what do you do? Didn't Paul rebuked the churches when they erred?<br><br>If nobody attempts to analyse such erroneous writing, you think the writer can learn? If I did not attempt to inform the readers that some links has cultic origins, the writers will know?<br><br>As I had said before, don't want people to dissect, write responsibly, check your facts.
