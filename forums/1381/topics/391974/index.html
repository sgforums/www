              <p>Has anyone heard of Biblical Numerology?</p>
              <p>My Pastor often preached that each number in the Bible has it's significant meaning.</p>
              <p>Such as number 1. If the name or topic is mentioned for the 1st time in the Bible, there are some significant details in it. That is the law of 1st interpretation.</p>
              <p>For number 5, 5 is the number of grace. If the same name is mentioned in the Bible for the 5th time, grace is given &amp; breakthroughs happens to the person. Such as Abram changed his name to Abraham &amp; the promised son was born.</p>
              <p>6 is the number of speed. On the flip side, 6 can also stand for self effort, rejection of God's salvation. In the ark of the covenant (Exodus), in the wooden box made of acacia wood, it contains 3 items, the Rod of Aaron, represents Man's rejection of God's leadership. The Golden Pot of Manna, Man's rejection of God's provisions. The 2 tablets of the 10 Commandmants, Man's rejection of God's laws. This is a picture of "666", which is mentioned in Revelations.</p>
              <p>The golden pair of Cherubims sitting on the cover made of solid gold represents judgement (remember the Cherubims outside the Garden of Eden?). During the Passover Day, the High priest will slay a lamb &amp; sprinkle it's blood on the cover between the cherubims to represent judgement paid &amp; God will see the blood instead of Man's rejections inside the box. The lamb is a picture of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross, which also happened on the Passover Day.</p>
              <p>Besides these numbers, it was also mentioned that 7 is the number of Completion. 7 is also the number for Rest. Where God created the world in 6 days &amp; rested on thr 7th day. It was also mentioned that Jesus rose to Heaven &amp; sat on the right hand of God on the 7th day. A sign of His finished work. Because the high priest in the Old Covenant never gets to sit because his work is never finished.</p>
              <p>4 is the number of Jesus, represented by the 4 cannonical Gospels, Mark, Peter, Luke, John. In the book of Exodus, the 12 tribes of Israel is lead by the 4 main tribes,Judah, Ephraim, Reuben &amp; Dan. Each of those 4 tribes has each banner which contains the picture of a Man, an Eagle, a Lion &amp; an Ox. It happens that the 4 cannonical Gospels potrays Jesus as Man, God(Eagle), King(Lion) &amp; Servant(Ox). </p>
              <p>As for other numbers, 3 represents the Holy Trinity, where the human body is also represented as Trinity. Flesh, Soul (Our emotions) &amp; our Spirit. Jesus mentioned that He prospers you just as your soul prospers. Rather than material prosperity, what He meant was that your Soul (state of emotion) is the bridge between your Flesh &amp; your Spirit &amp; when the Trinity are linked, that is when breakthroughs will occur. Restored relationships, destructive habits broken, renewal of Hope &amp; so on.</p>
