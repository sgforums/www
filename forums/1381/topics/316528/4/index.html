              <p>The first myth on vampires predates back to roughly 4000 B.C.E. from the ancient Sumer civilization. The ancient Sumerians existed in Mesopotamia and facts prove that by 3100 B.C.E., their culture brought the earliest archeologically proven dynasty; the first cities were built along with establishing the city and state religions were set up and practiced. The Sumerians is the first civilization to receive our attention as the first and oldest myth of a vampire-like being that is the Ekimmu.</p>
              <p>The Ekimmu, like many vampires of folklore, was believed to have been created when someone died a violent death or was not buried properly. Although not referred to out right as a vampire, the way they are described as helps us to draw the conclusion that these creatures were real intentional psychic vampires. They were described as demonic in nature, severely rotting corpses, phantom-like entities that roamed the earth, unable to rest, in search of victims.</p>
              <p>Bear in mind , this is a civilisation way ahead of its time and not a tribe of mad men who are into hocus pocus.</p>
              <p>The Sumerians are the earliest archaeologically proven dynasty that practises building of cities and have state religions which in those days are practises that are unheard of. They also have a deep insight into mathematics and geometry which they used to calculate and build impressive pieces of architecture. For a group of people who have such an advanced form of civilisation and technical advancements, they are no mere simpletons who are your everyday supersitious group.</p>
              <p>It is also recorded in alot of ancient nations' history that there were vampires of all a certain form in their culture.... from the Kangsi in Ancient China to even Langsuir across the causeway in Malaysia... In Africa, there was a vampire called the obayifo and Vrykolakas in Greece.</p>
              <p>What you do not see does not mean it does not exist.You do not see air but does it not exist?</p>

              <p><br>Humans have evolved over a long period. I do not want to bring religion into e issue but if you do not believe man came from apes than the theory of evolution might not affect you.</p>
              <p>Vampires do evolve too over time. A simple analogy is to see how bloodlines thin over generations and this happens to them too.Certain people also explain Vampirism as a form of illness that causes them to be adversely affected when they comes into contact with the sun and in the process become more active at night and thus lose the healthy glow human beings possess. To keep it short, the modern views on vampires have been corrupted by media.</p>
              <p>To end it off..... There are 4 main kinds of Vampires- the immortal blooddrinker, the mortal blooddrinker( a sick kid trying too hard at cosplay) , an intentional psychic vampire and an unintentional psyhic vampire( normally explained off as someone who is severely sick and might have stolen energy from people around them to maintain their existance on earth.)</p>
