            <div class='col-md body'>
              <div>Eve was not the first woman that God made as a companion for Adam.</div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div>Before Eve, there was Lilith. She who was made the same way as Adam. She was not the submissive specimen that will yield to the demands of God and Adam. She questioned God and longed to claim her birth right. For that, she was casted out of the Garden of Eden.</div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div>Not long after, Adam and Eve were also casted out after eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Eve bore Adam 2 sons- Canine and Abel. Both were given control over the land. Canine over the plants and Abel over the lifestock. Canine and Abel in turn had to give their their choicest crops and lifestock as a sacrifice to God. Canine's sacrifice was not looked upon positively as Caine's ability to grow and harvest them was born of God's curse upon Adam: that he should toil in the dust of the Earth. Abel's mastery over the animals came from God's gift of the same skill to Adam, and this made his sacrifice pure. Thus Abel was blessed over Canine.</div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div>Canine rebelled and murdered his brother in cold blood and flee the lands in fear of God's wrath.</div>
              <p> </p>
              <div>It was during his time fleeing from God that Canine meet Lilith in the lands of Nod, east of Eden.</div>
              <p> </p>
              <div>She gave Caine succor and showed him the power she had found, and Caine, desiring that power, fed on Lilith's blood to gain it. He then fled her house rather than battle her rage and continued his journey alone. Among his newfound powers were invincibility against Adam's descendants, great speed and strength, ability to manipulate time, shadows, flesh and mind; these powers would later evolve into the Disciplines which his children would wield, although with far less potency than Caine possessed.</div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div>At this point, Caine was visited by the archangels Michael, Uriel, and Gabriel, each in their turn and offering Caine salvation if he would but seek forgiveness from God for murdering his brother. Caine rejected each offer, feeling that God was a hypocrite and that he was the wronged party; enraged by his lack of humility and the bitter defiance he showed them and God, each angel cursed Caine:<br>Michael cursed Caine to forever fear fire;<br>Uriel cursed him to be unable to dwell in sunlight and to live forever in darkness;<br>Gabriel cursed him to be neither living nor dead, neither human nor beast, unchanging, undying and ever without hope; to feed upon blood alone; that hunger shall devour mercy; and that his offspring shall war with one another, young and weak against old and strong, that he may be their judge and know what it is for a father to condemn his children.</div>

              <p>I go to google and type vampirism and enter search.there are a lot of vampire websites in the internet.There is one Christian website that make me conclude that if vegetarians exist in this world, then vampires also exist.That website tells all Christians to avoid vegetarians and vampires.Please do not condemn vegetarians and vampires.Christianity forbids Christians to drink blood.Even my father condemns vampires and says drinking blood is wrong.</p>

              <p>I think you have gotten the context wrong. when Jesus said "flesh of the Son of man,
                                      and drink his blood" he did not mean literally drinking his blood and eating his flesh. He means that those who believe and partake in him. Not really eating and drinking.</p>
              <p>And vampires do not exisit. If you search the net properly you will find a few articles about a European ruler who loved bloodshed and would kill his enemies in the most horror ways where they will bleed and stuff. Hence, vampires tales evolved from this.</p>

              <p>I did a google on Lilith and though she wasn't specifically mention, it was hinted that in the Hebrew bible that a woman was created before Eve. She was also mentioned in the Dead Sea Scrolls and other ancient texts and she became more 'popular' during the Medival Times.</p>
              <p>In the Hebrew Bible in Genesis 1:27 it says "And God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them."</p>
              <p>However, in Genesis 2:22, it says "And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from the man, made He a woman, and brought her unto the man."</p>
              <p>I dunno if the 1st woman in the Hebrew bible was Lilith but it was hinted God made a woman before Eve.</p>

              <p>I did a google on Lilith and though she wasn't specifically

              and other ancient texts and she became more 'popular' during the

              <p>yeah, some ppl use that verse to justify that lilith was created. i've never read the torah before, so i don't know.</p>
              <p>but the way i see it is that, u know like powerpoint presentation? you go through the overview first, then go into details.</p>
              <p>so i see it as the bible says that God created man and woman. then later the bible described what actually happened in the creation of man and woman.</p>

              <p>Thanks. I appreciate people who do their research before jumping to conclusions.</p>
              <p>Ignorance is bliss. Easier to criticise than to find out the truth.</p>
              <p>A few centuries back, everyone thought the Earth was flat and anyone who said otherwise was laughed at. On a historical context, history itself was never any good at being impartial, it records events from certain angles and certain knowledge was lost.</p>
              <p>I am not saying Vampires do exist but how sure can one be that it doesn't?</p>

              <p>you dont see vampires walking around in the streets do you? There may be but they wont appear as much as they do in the past.</p>
