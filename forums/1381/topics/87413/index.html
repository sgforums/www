            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>For those of us who would like to learn more about Catholicism, I would like to recommend a book written by Scott Hahn.  Scott Hahn was a Presbyterian minister, the top student in his seminary class, <span style="color: red;"><strong>a brilliant Scripture scholar, and militantly anti-Catholic,</strong></span> and the book tells you about his "conversion" to Catholicism.<br><br>I started this thread as I felt that there were many questions about our faith in numerous posts in this forum.  To put it one way, there the threads were full of "lively debate".  Whatever the initial intent of those threads, i felt that some of the threads wound up as rectorical Catholics vs the world "arguements".<br><br>For Catholics, this book is a great read about Scott's journey in faith.  For non-Catholics this book may shed light on your questions about Catholicism from a protestant perspective.<br><br>I would like to state clearly that i don't have an agenda to "convert" anyone with this.  I just think that there many insights in the book that we can all learn from.<br><br>My 5 cents on it is : Read the book and draw own conclusions from it.  Whether you agree or disgree it's still up to you.  Whatever the case maybe, i'm sure you'll be enlightened from the experience.<br><br>More details on the book can be found at : http://www.getfed.com/product_detail.cfm?ID=531&amp;AID=164&amp;new=yes<br>If you interested, you can buy it online, or from most Catholic bookstores in Sgp.  Additionally, i willing to lend my copy of the book to anyone sincerely<br>interested in learning more about our faith.<br><br><strong>More on Scott Hahn</strong><br><br>Â• Ph.D., Marquette University (1985-95) Systematic Theology Summa Cum Laude (Phi Beta Kappa)<br>Â• M.Div., Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary (1979-82) Systematic Theology Summa Cum Laude<br>Â• B.A., Grove City College (1975-79) Theology, Philosophy and Economics Magna Cum Laude<br><br>Scott Hahn was a Presbyterian minister, the top student in his seminary class, a brilliant Scripture scholar, and militantly anti-Catholic ... until he reluctantly began to discover that his "enemy" had all the right answers. Kimberly, also a top-notch theology student in the seminary, is the daughter of a well-known Protestant minister, and went through a tremendous "dark night of the soul" after Scott converted to Catholicism.<br><br>Now these two outstanding Catholic apologists tell in their own words about the incredible spiritual journey that led them to embrace Catholicism.<br>Their conversion story and love for the Church has captured the hearts and minds of thousands of lukewarm Catholics and brought them back into an active participation in the Church. They have also influenced countless conversions to Catholicism among their friends and others who have heard their powerful testimony.<br><br>Written with simplicity, charity, grace and wit, the Hahns' deep love and knowledge of Christ and of Scripture is evident and contagious throughout their story. Their love of truth and of neighbor is equally evident, and their theological focus on the great importance of the family, both biological and spiritual, will be a source of inspiration for all readers.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Isn't it interesting that no one wants to take up this offer?<br><br>I guess it's preferable to post anti-Catholic rethoric than to read about an ex-protestants point-of-view.

So it's better to close your eyes and maybe this dumb Catholic will go away, and stop bugging people to read a darn book.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.... I was also actively involved in a Protestant Church and then went to the Catholic church.  Why didn't I publish a book?  hehe<br><br>Anyway, mine was quite straightforward.  Nobody preached to me.  Nobody brainwashed me.  I did read up some Catholic literature and some Protestant ones.  In the end, I decided to read something more neutral, rather than 1 sided (I shall not mention which book(s) that I read was one sided).  I went to the school library to dig out all the history books and ecyclopedia.  And all trace the Catholic Church back to the beginning of church history.<br><br>This is a very brief introduction of my conversion....hehe.  There are actually a lot a lot more... but then, I lazy to write.  That's probably the reason why I didn't write a book like Scott Hahn did.   heheh</div>

The Rock was a person, not a place. So where Peter went, there went the foundation of the Church.<br><br>The Church immediately tried to fulfill the mandate to "go out to the ends of the earth baptizing in the Name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit." The Church never saw Jerusalem as its home, but it did see Peter as its leader, which is why the Church "grew up" around Rome. Also, James only had the authority to head the Jerusalem church, whereas Jesus, in making Peter the rock, gave him authority over the entire Church.<br><br>Also, it depends on how you define "institutional body." The fact that it may not have had the organisational structure that it had now does not void its existence. Likewise, the Catholic Church did not begin at the date in which it had such a structure, but has existed in apostolic authority and belief from the very beginning.<br><br></div>
