              <p>what is logical to one may be illogical to another and vice versa....of course, there are instances when the illogical is obvious and agreed upon all or at least the majority.</p>
              <p>before logic can kick in, one need to understand. unfortuantely, 
                  christianity is not a destination.....it's a journey....a journey to 
                  knowing God.</p>
              <p>most people attend church for a while and left with 
                  many doubts and misunderstanding...bringing with them all sorts of 
                  misconceptions. so, they find christianity illogical....as a result of 
                  their lack of understanding.</p>
              <p>some are only interested in reading 
                  anti-christians materials and mis-represented "facts" and hold on to 
                  them with their dear life as the truth. thus logics kicks in again.</p>
              <p>many
                   christians on the other hand find that the more they search, they more 
                  they "see and experience" God. it becomes very logical to them as they 
                  understand more about God.</p>
              <p>thus, i agree that most (if not all) 
                  christians do doubts at some point but our doubts does not means we do 
                  not believe or that God does not exist. it is just like at a traffic 
                  light or caught in a traffic jam on our journey to knowing God...once 
                  cleared and turned green, we can move on and mover further...</p>
              <p>Bible
                   contain the Word Of God. we need to understand the message each and 
                  every event / parables in the way that God wants us to......which is why
                   priests and pastors spend years to study them.....</p>
              <p>mother teresa is able to dedicate her whole life to serving the poor and abandon is simply because she believed in God and allow God to show her the way...so that those she served not just know God's love but benefitted from His love and grace.</p>
              <p>she can only achieved what she did because of the presence of God in her life.</p>

              <p>Whether you really are a Christian or not, do know that whatever you do does not give Christians a good name.</p>
              <p>For all we know, you are doing this intentionally with such an aim in mind.</p>
              <p>I suggest and ask that you stop this, and if anything, I believe you deserve to be reported for exactly what you are doing and the kind of nicknames you are creating.</p>
              <p>Tell me though, do you really consider yourself a Christian at heart? When you pray or when you attend church and you think about it that you're doing, what do you think? What do you feel?</p>
              <p>Would you tell your other Christian friends or your church mates what you do in this forum?</p>

              <p>i get wad u mean but u must understand tat i am questioning where the knowledge comes from??? and from the responses, u can see tat there are ppl who are on my side. its like we noe heaven is good but why do we noe its good? where is our reference pt? its the reference pt i am referring to...this reference pt is in our subconscious mind which often we are unaware of until someone/sth awakens us to it...its like why do we noe having 12 fingers is abnormal? its because we noe that normality requires a human to have 10 fingers...apply the logic to sufferings and blessings...although context is different, applications are the same...</p>
              <p>i have a feeling that we are on diff platforms for this...i more or less expected it cos my analogy and the comparison btw 1st noeing good b4 noeing bad has its roots in creation...whereas like wad TTFU said, atheists por even agnostics focus mainly on the wad, the facts rather than the why, the how....which is why i always said, christianity and buddhism are different...</p>

              <p>non-creationist mindset is sth like this:</p>
              <p>the world is full of sufferings...sufferings are real...they are bad...qn: why does God allow sufferings?</p>
              <p>creationist mindo we noe they are bad? if God is to blame for sufferings, then who do we thank for blessings?</p>
              <p>notice that one view is more factual while the other view is very questioning...the qns are why and how....</p>
              <p>dset is sth like this:</p>
              <p>the world is full of sufferings...sufferings are real...wait a min, how do we noe they are sufferings? how do we noe they are real? how another simple analogy for u...i noe this guy who is allergic to seafood(true story)...so there was once when another frend asked him how he felt not being able to eat delicious seafood like crabs, prawns etc...guess wad was his answer? he doesnt feel any loss at all cos he has nvr eaten seafood all his life so he doesnt noe how seafood taste like...u see, to the other frend, it is seen as a loss to miss out on the delicious seafood but why did she feel tat way? cos she was asking him the qn on the basis tat she herself alredi noes how delicious seafood taste like...hence, to her, its a great loss to miss out on seafood...but to the one who nvr eaten seafood due to allergy, wad kind of loss is tat? he doesnt feel any loss cos he had nvr eaten seafood anyway...</p>
              <p>i hope its clearer now where i am coming from...like i said, we could be on diff platforms...moreover, this view is creationistic and focuses on how/why...</p>
