              <p>still, it was never Christian teaching that "life in heaven will be better when you
                                          suffer on earth"....</p>
              <p>doing good is never about any merit system and certainly has no such thing as "A desire to gain points on what some would call the entry to heaven
                                          merit system?"</p>
              <p>doing good is what God wants his followers to do and is what is preached in the Bible...not prosperity and the bunch of twisted issues that are circulating around...</p>
              <p>what she did was definitely religion driven or in her case, really God 
                  driven.....what else could it be? she is just a shining example of one that believed in, trusted and have complete faith in God doing what she has been tasked to do.</p>
              <p>as the Bible said :"So you can see that his faith 
                  was working together with his deeds; his faith 
                  became perfect by what he did."</p>
              <p>think above also explained the "why even bother to help those dying in the slums?" which really are the people that God wants to reach out to and help....through His people..</p>

              <p>I have always been wondering about the subtleties of a purpose-driven life vs a spirit led life.</p>
              <p>" When we talk about suffering,Christian believers are not immune from suffering. In fact, sometimes
              it seems that sincere Christian believers suffer more than others! God
              has promised us many things, but He has not promised us immunity from 
              suffering
              in this life. "Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord
              delivers him out of them all." (Psalm 34:19). "Yes, and all who desire
              to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution." (2 Timothy 
              3:12).
              Suffering will be a reality for us in one form or another until Jesus 
              returns. "</p>
              <p>The issue of suffering is a complex one, since there are many kinds of
              suffering, many possible reasons for each kind, and often many 
              perplexing
              mysteries. Our faith in the goodness of God may be tested through 
              sufferings,
              and our responses to suffering in this life have the potential to make
              us or break us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"When we suffer, our response is very important. We need to remember that
              God still loves us, and while there is life, there is hope. The subject
              of our response to suffering needs to be explored further and developed
              with further teaching. Briefly, if you are suffering because of your 
              sins,
              <a href="http://www.christian-faith.com/forjesus/repentance">repent</a>.</p>
              <p>If you are suffering
              because of mistakes, seek to learn and gain wisdom. If you are suffering
              because of sickness, give thanks to God for His promises and learn how
              to <a href="http://www.christian-faith.com/forjesus/divine-healing">receive
               the healing</a> God
              has for you.</p>
              <p>If you are suffering because of the sins of another 
              Christian,
              confront him or her according to Matthew 18:15-18, forgive him or her 
              and
              seek wisdom from God.</p>
              <p>If you are suffering persecution from unbelievers,
              offer your suffering to God, pray (James 5:14), give thanks to God and
              rejoice (James 1:2-5; 1 Peter 4:13)!</p>
              <p>You are also called to love your 
              enemies,
              pray for them, and bless them. (Matthew 5:44).</p>
              <p>If you are suffering 
              because
              the events of life seem to be conspiring to frustrate you, seek God 
              about
              it, be patient in your wilderness experience and look forward to the 
              promised
              land of blessings God is leading you into.</p>
              <p>Don't allow discouragement 
              and
              bitterness against God to enter your heart. Learn from the experiences
              of the children of Israel. Also try to get as many as possible to pray
              for you and your situation. This will help, but you still need patience."</p>
              <p>lol.. I know talking about it is easy, hell, the doing part is a where most of us really fail.</p>
              <p>Trapped between the material needs and the spiritual needs, its extremely hard.Who is really willing to give up their all to be with those that have none.</p>
              <p>"A lot of our suffering is due to our own unwise choices. But we are
              actually guaranteed by God that we will suffer persecution if we truly
              want to live for Him. Sickness and disease - both physical and emotional
              - can generally be overcome in this life by faith in God, but suffering
              will remain part of our lives on and off until we pass beyond this 
              temporal
              existence into what God has prepared for those who love Him."</p>
              <p>Above is mostly cut n paste from <a href="http://www.christian-faith.com/forjesus/suffering-believer">here</a>.</p>
              <p>But looking at Mother Teresa's point of view, she was driven by the teaching of Jesus, to simply "help the unfortunate".</p>
              <p>Even if the driving force was religion, her being there is already testament, that belief gives her that much faith to persevere and continue doing what she did for a long time. And doing what she did also shows that religion allows one to continue doing what that really believe in when forsaken by the rest of the world.</p>

              this life. "Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord
              delivers him out of them all." (Psalm 34:19). "Yes, and all who
              desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution." (2
              Timothy 3:12). Suffering will be a reality for us in one form or
              another until Jesus returns. "</p>
              <p>The issue of suffering is a complex one, since there are many
              kinds of suffering, many possible reasons for each kind, and often
              many perplexing mysteries. Our faith in the goodness of God may be
              tested through sufferings, and our responses to suffering in this
              life have the potential to make us or break us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"When we suffer, our response is very important. We need to
              remember that God still loves us, and while there is life, there is
              hope. The subject of our response to suffering needs to be explored
              further and developed with further teaching. Briefly, if you are
              suffering because of your sins, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.christian-faith.com/forjesus/repentance">repent</a>.</p>
              <p>If you are suffering because of mistakes, seek to learn and gain
              wisdom. If you are suffering because of sickness, give thanks to
              God for His promises and learn how to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.christian-faith.com/forjesus/divine-healing">receive the healing</a> God has for you.</p>
              <p>If you are suffering because of the sins of another Christian,
              confront him or her according to Matthew 18:15-18, forgive him or
              her and seek wisdom from God.</p>
              <p>If you are suffering persecution from unbelievers, offer your
              suffering to God, pray (James 5:14), give thanks to God and rejoice
              (James 1:2-5; 1 Peter 4:13)!</p>
              <p>You are also called to love your enemies, pray for them, and
              bless them. (Matthew 5:44).</p>
              <p>If you are suffering because the events of life seem to be
              conspiring to frustrate you, seek God about it, be patient in your
              wilderness experience and look forward to the promised land of
              blessings God is leading you into.</p>
              <p>Don't allow discouragement and bitterness against God to enter
              your heart. Learn from the experiences of the children of Israel.
              Also try to get as many as possible to pray for you and your
              situation. This will help, but you still need patience."</p>
              <p>lol.. I know talking about it is easy, hell, the doing part is a
              where most of us really fail.</p>
              <p>Trapped between the material needs and the spiritual needs, its
              extremely hard.Who is really willing to give up their all to be
              with those that have none.</p>
              <p>"A lot of our suffering is due to our own unwise choices. But we
              are actually guaranteed by God that we will suffer persecution if
              we truly want to live for Him. Sickness and disease - both physical
              and emotional - can generally be overcome in this life by faith in
              God, but suffering will remain part of our lives on and off until
              we pass beyond this temporal existence into what God has prepared
              for those who love Him."</p>

              <p>But looking at Mother Teresa's point of view, she was driven by
              the teaching of Jesus, to simply "help the unfortunate".</p>
              <p>Even if the driving force was religion, her being there is
              already testament, that belief gives her that much faith to
              persevere and continue doing what she did for a long time. And
              doing what she did also shows that religion allows one to continue
              doing what that really believe in when forsaken by the rest of the
              world.</p>

              <p>isn't this a false dichotomy?  you're assuming that just because a person might be suffering as a mortal, he should be sent to heaven when he will "prosper". You might be ignoring the possibility that his suffering will end soon, the redemption that comes with the alleviation of that suffering might be greater than that suffering itself, or ignoring the possibility that suffering has value in itself as well.  </p>

              <p>24/7,</p>
              <p>wad u said requires personal experience or faith and dadeadman
              is like some forumers here;believing that things are to be proven
              and that faith is sth that is controversial...</p>

              <p>not really. what i've described are the results of faith and i think that forumer had truly posited a false dichotomy (extreme thinking; black or white) without considering the in betweens.</p>
              <p>blind faith is controversial, a practice evident in most forms of thought, but Biblical faith is not.. In any case, one needs to have faith first before being able to begin to believe (e.g. when one believes in science, one believes in the testimony of scientists, their senses, or the constancy of the universal laws of nature). </p>
