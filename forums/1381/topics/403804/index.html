              </span></p><p>THE DARK LETTERS</p>
              <p>The writings address numerous topics, 
              but the ones most likely to create a stir are what Doubleday called the 
              "dark letters."</p>
              <p>"Please pray 
              specially for me that I may not spoil His work and that Our Lord may 
              show Himself -- for there is such terrible darkness within me, as if 
              everything was dead," she wrote in 1953. "It has been like this more or 
              less from the time I started 'the work.'"</p>
              <p>Then in 1956: "Such deep longing for God -- and ... repulsed -- 
              empty -- no faith -- no love -- no zeal. (Saving) souls holds no 
              attraction -- Heaven means nothing -- pray for me please that I keep 
              smiling at Him in spite of everything."</p>
              <p>And then in 1959: "If there be no God -- there can be no soul -- if 
              there is no Soul then Jesus -- You also are not true."</p>
              <p>At times she also found it hard to pray.</p>
              <p>"I utter words of community prayers -- 
              and try my utmost to get out of every word the sweetness it has to give 
              -- but my prayer of union is not there any longer -- I no longer pray."</p>
              <p><span style="color: #00ccff;">However,</span></p>
              <p></p>
              <h4 class="lgPanelResponseExcerpt">The apparent abandonment by God of 
              the poor and the helpless would be enough to shake the faith of anyone.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Faith and doubt are both sides of a religious experience.</p>
              <p>Thiese letters remind us that any faith that is certain is no faith at all, just as any love never doubted is very shallow love.</p>
              <p>But in theend , that Mother Terese still continued to long for God as she laboured in the soul-alienating slums of Calcutta signifies the genuiness of her faith.</p>
              <p>N her actions as well as her words, she exhibited more faith than any doubter - or non doubter</p>
              <p>The recent revelations of Mother Teresa's spiritual struggle should remind all believing Christians that our faith is in Christ , not in our feelings.</p>

              <p>well, if that is your honest opinion, then its fine...i shall not try to prove He is powerful/in control of everything...neither will i try to prove He is loving cos i noe ppl have diff definitions for love and the meaning of being in control of everything....</p>

              <p>u are looking at absolutes here...so juz cos we cannot choose when to die and be born means there is TOTALLY no freewill???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for ur information, christianity defines choice like this...u could not choose when to die or live but somebody else did...putting God aside, ur parents chose when they wanted to try for a baby, ur mum conceived and gave birth to u abt 9mths later...in a sense, tat is ur parents choosing roughly when u are to be born...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so the qn now is this...are we toking abt freewill on earth or freewill for self??? cos since ur parents could choose when to give birth to u, tat is freewill in a sense isnt it? juz tat it wasnt ur freewill but theirs...</p>

              <p>who made logical sense of christianity?</p>
              <p>all religions are based on faith - believing in something that cannot be proven.</p>
              <p>the last thing that a religion has is logic.</p>

              <p>some have not heard of a better answer than christianity. some people's prayers are answered. some believe in creator.some have heard but too afraid of the power of god. some know that it does not make sense but the bible says so, so must be true. some dare not to think further because they were told we cannot comprehend god.  many are afraid of going to hell etc.  only the daring ones dare to challenge god, we doubt his power of pushing the non believers to hell.</p>
