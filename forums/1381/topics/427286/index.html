              <p>Dear brothers and sisters in Christ, if you are wondering if the miracles in the bible that happen in the days of Acts are still happening in today's world, look no further.</p>
              <p>Check up this book, The Heavenly Man, by Paul Hattaway and Brother Yun.</p>
              <p>It talks about the house churches in China. At a time in China, when China forbids any form of religion to exist, christianity struggles to stay faithful to Jesus.</p>
              <p>Brother Yun, a peasant, became a christian, and even though, he was tortured and imprisoned for his faith in Jesus, he continued to live his life as a christian, imitating Jesus.</p>
              <p>At one point in his life, he was locked in a prison in China, but he choe to pray and fast and showed love to the prison guards and prisoners who treated him in a cruel manner and laughed at him for continuing to believe in his Jesus.</p>
              <p>His faith in Jesus comes to a good purpose when all the prisoners who used to laugh at him and beat him up repented and became christians.</p>
              <p>Here, in this book, we read about what God is doing in China. The christians in China, in the house churches of China, are willing to give up everything to follow Jesus, and their faith pays off, because they are able to bring many, many people to Jesus through their faith in Him.</p>
              <p>Jesus still works, and He works in even a country like China. Check up the book, Heavenly Man. It will really open your eyes.</p>

              <p>pls do not be fooled.</p>
              <p>My frens in china have told me that the chinese churches are actually cults that brainwash the chinese people for monetary gains.</p>
              <p>the tithe offering is more than 10%.</p>
              <p>that is why it is so profitable to set up the church</p>
              <p>basically the chinese churches are like city harvest.</p>
              <p>Promoting the bible is only secondary.</p>
              <p>Profit making is the primary objective.</p>
              <p>they prey primarily on the farmer peasant who is lowly educated .</p>
              <p>the more intelligent chinese are harder to brainwash as they worship money.</p>

              <p>wadever jesus has prevented, is it possible for us to noe? if 1000 disasters were meant to happen, but he prevented 999 of them...we will only noe tat he allowed 1 to happen but will we noe he prevented 999 of them from happening? wad he prevented wun happen at all and hence we wun witness the prevention of it...newspaper reports number of accidents that actually happen but does it report the number of accidents prevented and seriously, do we even noe how many accidents are prevented???</p>

              <p>to trust u can come up with this sort of warped logic. show proof if Jesus (if he exists) prevented 1000 diasters. otherwise anyone can say whatever you want, without showing proof.</p>

              <p>How do you fit two brontosaurus, tyrannosaurus rex into Noah's Ark? Also avoid the tyrannosaurus rex from eating everything on the ark?</p>

              <p>the bible did give the measurements of the ark and if u convert it to modern day mode of measurements, those dinosaurs could fit in...anyway, the book of job toked abt huge beasts which are believed to be referring to these so-called dinosaurs and if u trace the history of the book of job, it was recording teh years before man existed...although genesis is the 1st book in the bible, it does not record the earliest of life...a bible study of Gen 1:1-2 will tell us tat there is a huge gap of many years between these 2 verses and bible scholars believe that this gap is recorded in the book of job...this is wad i noe...</p>
