            <div class='col-md body'>Pastor pays hookers to counsel them<br><br>By Theresa Tan<br><br>PASTOR Joseph Sim is a man on a mission - to Geylang.<br>One of a number of volunteers reaching out to such women, Pastor Sim has been talking to prostitutes from China at Geylang every other day for two years, trying to turn them over a new leaf. What sets the pastor apart from other counsellors is that he will pay the women - out of his own pocket - to get them to talk to him and his helper, a volunteer. -- DESMOND WEE<br><br>He is in the area almost every other day talking to prostitutes from China, whom he calls 'hospitality entrepreneurs'.<br><br>Sometimes, he even pays them, just so they will talk to him.<br><br>The 76-year-old grandfather has been combing the streets of the red-light district for the past two years, trying to convince the streetwalkers to turn over a new leaf.<br><br>He said: 'My hope is that they repent and turn to God.'<br><br>Pastor Sim is among a number of volunteers who have been trying to reach out to prostitutes operating in Geylang over the past seven to eight years.<br><br>These volunteers hope to counsel them and help them find other work, said Reverend Edward Job, executive president of Christian Care Services (Singapore), a non-profit group.<br><br>In fact, Rev Job and a network of churches in Geylang are in the process of setting up a drop-in centre there to help prostitutes, loan-shark victims and foreign workers.<br><br>But what sets Pastor Sim apart from other counsellors is that he will pay the women - out of his own pocket - to get them to talk to him and his helper, a volunteer.<br><br>He says paying them is a necessary part of his job.<br><br>'These girls are not interested in talking to you. All they want is money. They are oblivious to all other things.'<br><br>Even so, he said that he has managed to get only about 10 of the women to have in-depth chats with him.<br><br>Of these, he said, he believes he has persuaded two of them to change.<br><br>His work does not end with talking to them. He follows up by going to China to see the women he has talked to.<br><br>Some are now leading comfortable lives back home, he said, but still want to make more money.<br><br>'It's greed that brought them to Singapore,' he said.<br><br>Why not let the police solve the problem?<br><br>That alone will not change the situation, he said.<br><br>'Today they may catch 10; tomorrow, 20 new girls will fly in,' he said.</div>
