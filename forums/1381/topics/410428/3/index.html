              I'm well aware of the answer to my questions, no. We'll still live
              in fear of terrorism, and terrorists will still be around to ruin
              everyone's day. Nobody will be happy until the Islamization of the

              <p>i agree with you, the answer is no. but hav you even wonder why you'll still live
              in fear, and why terrorists will still be around to ruin
              everyone's day?</p>
              <p>let's say the book got burned. does that mean the US is no longer in fear of terrorism? have all the terrorists gone away now? the answer is still a resounding no.</p>
              <p>in fact, such action of hatred creates more hatred and increase everyone's fear and the likelihood that someone will be around to ruin your day.</p>
              <p>sadly and obviously, this is not obvious enough to many who are clouded with hatred and fear.</p>

              <p>It is obsolute lunacy to burn a religious book like the Quran - some more burning it in a Church by an idiotic Church Pastor &amp; getting away scot free without any legal action by the US Government.</p>
              <p>The collateral damage of the act will be immense in terms of the hatred, anger &amp; destructive reactions from the Muslims who will definitely generalized this blasphemy as an act of all Americans.</p>

              <p>Do I think burning qurans is a good idea? No.</p>

              <p>Do I support Terry Jones' right to burn them...YES.</p>
              <p>I don't want him to burn any Qurans, but the United States has a constitution which gives us many basic rights, many of which are due to Americans giving their lives or fighting for them. The first amendment is a guarantee of free speech and assembly, and that's where this falls under. We also have the 10th amendment, which limits the Federal Government's power...so even if Obama doesn't want it to happen, he can't stop it.</p>
              <p>Many years ago there was a big debate in my country about burning the flag. You cannot burn your flag in Singapore, but you can burn the American flag in the US. Many people were outraged and fought to ban burning the flag as it desecrated everything the flag stood for and disrespected the many men and women who gave their lives for it. In the end, people are allowed to burn the flag. The same thing goes with the religious groups who protest funerals of dead soldiers or gays with signs like "God Hates Fags" and "Thank God for Dead Soldiers." If we don't ensure constitutional rights are given to every American, regardless of what we think of them, then eventually no one would have them.</p>

              <p>Well, what people will fear (And actually did applied in olden days as well) is that, if I (Authorities) prosecuted a minority individual / groups of criminals, especially with to do with race / religion thing who involves overthrowing government or even acts of terrorism, the rest of the majority from this race / religion will say "see, the government is supressing us, we should overthrow this government, regardless if its gonna take 5, 10 or 50 years".

              <p>It is like the Jews or Christians who stick on to the old testaments. I understand the armenians are also some who do not agree with modernization. They can be fundamentalists, but not necessary terrorists.</p>
              <p>But it is the basic belief in love and respect for others that is lacking. I believe love is taught in all religion and culture. But people do not practice the teaching, twisted it to suit their own agend and desire. </p>
              <p>Singaporean muslims are more open to the outside world, they see and they respect without having to emulate. They take moderate stance to accommodate others. In many places, muslims listen only to their religious teachers.</p>

              <p>It is obsolute lunacy to burn a religious book like the Quran -
              some more burning it in a Church by an idiotic Church Pastor &amp;
              getting away scot free without any legal action by the US
              Government.</p>
              <p>The collateral damage of the act will be immense in terms of the
              hatred, anger &amp; destructive reactions from the Muslims who will
              definitely generalized this blasphemy as an act of all
              Americans.</p>
              <p>Fortunately this jerk chicken out at the last moment but I am
              pretty sure although he did not carry out the act, his evil
              thoughts still linger.</p>

              <p>It is like the Jews or Christians who stick on to the old
              testaments. I understand the armenians are also some who do not
              agree with modernization. They can be fundamentalists, but not
              necessary terrorists.</p>
              <p>But it is the basic belief in love and respect for others that
              is lacking. I believe love is taught in all religion and culture.
              But people do not practice the teaching, twisted it to
              suit their own agend and desire. </p>
              <p>Singaporean muslims are more open to the outside world, they see
              and they respect without having to emulate. They take moderate
              stance to accommodate others. In many places, muslims listen
              only to their religious teachers.</p>

              <p>I agree, somehow Islam is not so lucky to have more such people in modern era. Whats worse is like u mentioned:</p>
              <p><strong>The trouble with the other good muslims is that they WILL NOT
                                      condemn the treacherous acts of the muslims terrorists, for they
                                      are "BROTHERS".</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you think that after you murdered people, and say I believe in whichever god = no need to go for punishment in hell after death?</p>
              <p>Preceisely this is the reason, hence if I am the ruler, I would give a reason to "è¯›ä¹�æ—�" on these fundamentalists and  to any degree of their supporters so that they wont revenge on me and brought peace, despite any underhand means also must seriously consider.</p>
