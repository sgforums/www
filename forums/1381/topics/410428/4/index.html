              <p>What has worked in the US, and I'll venture to say in Singapore as well, but I truly don't know as I'm going off my own observations, is the separation of Church and State. This has worked in the US, because the Church is not the law, and the Church must operate within the confines of the law. In Islam, you have the eventual Islamization of a country because it is the destiny of Muslims to live under a Sharia law.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This was what my original support of the pastor burning the Quran. It could have been the Bible for all I care, but it was a point of the State and by proxy its citizens are not controlled by any religion.</p>

              <p>If the State's not doing it, it's not repression. It was one man, or perhaps a small group of people, who were exercising their First Amendment rights. Were there protests in Singapore over the Quran burning? Probably not, since the government would probably deny the permit request to protest. THAT is repression. The only thing I heard out of Singapore was an Islamic leader asking Muslims to not go crazy in reaction to the Quran burning.</p>

              <p>If this stupid situation has taught the world anything, it's the hypocrisy of Islam as the "Religion of Peace." For all the tolerance they ask for, they sure had to go out of their way to make sure everyone knew if the Quran was burned, there may be consequences for Americans abroad.</p>

I guarantee not, as Bible burning isn't a new concept in America. People have done it in the past for various reasons of protest or whatever. Not one person blew themselves up over it.</p>

              <p>Seems like debating on two different sides. Both sides are not wrong.<strong> Argyle</strong> pointed out the american side which buring a quran is not wrong. This guy basically has the right to burn 1000 Qurans if he wants to. He may be an
              idiot, but he has the right to do that and burn American flags, and
              curse out the president, watch massive
              amounts of gay porn and rub honey all over his naked body as he

              think the same would happen if Bibles were burned? I guarantee not,
              as Bible burning isn't a new concept in America. People have done
              it in the past for various reasons of protest or whatever. Not one
              person blew themselves up over it.</p>
