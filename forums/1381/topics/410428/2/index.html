              <p>I don't want him to burn any Qurans, but the United States has a constitution which gives us many basic rights, many of which are due to Americans giving their lives or fighting for them. The first amendment is a guarantee of free speech and assembly, and that's where this falls under. We also have the 10th amendment, which limits the Federal Government's power...so even if Obama doesn't want it to happen, he can't stop it.</p>
              <p>Many years ago there was a big debate in my country about burning the flag. You cannot burn your flag in Singapore, but you can burn the American flag in the US. Many people were outraged and fought to ban burning the flag as it desecrated everything the flag stood for and disrespected the many men and women who gave their lives for it. In the end, people are allowed to burn the flag. The same thing goes with the religious groups who protest funerals of dead soldiers or gays with signs like "God Hates Fags" and "Thank God for Dead Soldiers." If we don't ensure constitutional rights are given to every American, regardless of what we think of them, then eventually no one would have them.</p>

              <p>/New York, Sep 11 (IANS) After a day of flip-flops, a Florida pastor, who earned international headlines and censure after threatening to burn copies of the Quran on the 9/11 anniversary Saturday, 'has agreed in principle' not to go ahead with the controversial event.</p>
              <p>Pastor Terry Jones arrived in New York City late Friday night apparently for a still unscheduled meeting with the imam in charge of the New York Islamic center planned near ground zero site of the Sep 11, 2001 attacks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I don't have anything to say right now,' he told a group of reporters who followed him out of LaGuardia Airport and to a taxi cab, according to CNN.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>CNN also cited K.A. Paul, an evangelist in contact with Jones, as saying that there will be no burning of the book Saturday evening as had been originally planned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Earlier Friday, Jones gave mixed messages about whether he intends to carry out his plans, which have sparked international controversy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jones told CBS' 'The Early Show' that 'we have called the event off'. Soon afterwards, however, he told reporters in Florida the burning is still being contemplated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jones also said a promised meeting with Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf was part of what convinced him to halt the planned burning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jones said the meeting was promised Thursday by local Florida Imam Mohammad Musri, who also told him the Islamic centre would be moved in exchange for the burning being called off.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Musri said that a meeting may happen next week between Jones and Rauf as it might be difficult for the parties to meet Saturday because of events planned to mark the ninth anniversary of 9/11.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Musri said he envisions a meeting Monday or Tuesday involving Jones, Rauf and himself. 'If we're successful to do it tomorrow, (that) will be wonderful,' Musri was quoted as saying. If not, he said, they could meet Monday, Tuesday or 'as soon as all three parties can find the time to get together'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a statement Friday, Rauf said that he was 'prepared to consider meeting with anyone who is seriously committed to pursuing peace' but that no such meeting had been set up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'Our plans for the community centre have not changed,' he said. 'With the solemn day of September 11 upon us, I encourage everyone to take time for prayer and reflection.'</p>

              <p>/New York, Sep 11 (IANS) After a day of flip-flops, a Florida pastor, who earned international headlines and censure after threatening to burn copies of the Quran on the 9/11 anniversary Saturday, 'has agreed in principle' not to go ahead with the controversial event.</p>
              <p>Pastor Terry Jones arrived in New York City late Friday night apparently for a still unscheduled meeting with the imam in charge of the New York Islamic center planned near ground zero site of the Sep 11, 2001 attacks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I don't have anything to say right now,' he told a group of reporters who followed him out of LaGuardia Airport and to a taxi cab, according to CNN.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>CNN also cited K.A. Paul, an evangelist in contact with Jones, as saying that there will be no burning of the book Saturday evening as had been originally planned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Earlier Friday, Jones gave mixed messages about whether he intends to carry out his plans, which have sparked international controversy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jones told CBS' 'The Early Show' that 'we have called the event off'. Soon afterwards, however, he told reporters in Florida the burning is still being contemplated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jones also said a promised meeting with Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf was part of what convinced him to halt the planned burning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jones said the meeting was promised Thursday by local Florida Imam Mohammad Musri, who also told him the Islamic centre would be moved in exchange for the burning being called off.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Musri said that a meeting may happen next week between Jones and Rauf as it might be difficult for the parties to meet Saturday because of events planned to mark the ninth anniversary of 9/11.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Musri said he envisions a meeting Monday or Tuesday involving Jones, Rauf and himself. 'If we're successful to do it tomorrow, (that) will be wonderful,' Musri was quoted as saying. If not, he said, they could meet Monday, Tuesday or 'as soon as all three parties can find the time to get together'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a statement Friday, Rauf said that he was 'prepared to consider meeting with anyone who is seriously committed to pursuing peace' but that no such meeting had been set up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'Our plans for the community centre have not changed,' he said. 'With the solemn day of September 11 upon us, I encourage everyone to take time for prayer and reflection.'</p>

              <p>People should be asking what/who put thoughts of stirring up trouble in his mind. The answer could be a surprising one. Expect more events and incidents of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">potential</span></strong> unrest that can spread quickly and involve many people around the world in coming years. Religion has always been the easiest thing to manipulate to cause people to fight and kill each other.</p>
              <p>As for whether the potential unrest becomes actual unrest, depends on the level of Consciousness of people in coming years. Course of action and reaction is always a personal choice, which many people unfortunately have given up to conform with group actions/reactions, led by misguided or malicious (in disguise) souls. </p>

              <p>When did I get Christians involved? I'm talking about constitutional rights, I'm not talking about Christians. I'm not talking about a religious war from my end. I don't know how to make it any clearer. What if I end the sentence with lah....now do you understand?</p>

              <p>To begin with, it was a church pastor who call on his members to burn koran in a church. That implicate christians and that is why christians are discussing if what he did was right or wrong, not if he had the right to do.</p>
              <p>and you come on to a christian forum to defend based on constitution rights. Wrong place.</p>
              <p>Like I said earlier, get out of the church, call on all americans to burn koran in time square, or in front of the white house, or some monuments, and lets see what happen.</p>
              <p>I will be watching CNN. Won't interfere with the constitution rights of the american, in the american soil.</p>
              <p>Nobody here discuss whether the mosque should be allowed to be built at ground zero, do they have the right?</p>
