              <p>hi boyboy,</p>
              <p>i'm a catholic. BTw, are you in RCIA? which parish if you do not mind to reveal?? Generally, people at RCIA do talk to each other. If you feel you are "isolated" form the rest.. talk to yr sponsor. or yr facilitator. They may intro you to others. Maybe others are shy too.. so just smile and say hello.. no harm.. after all we are all sisters aand brothers in christ even though you may not be baptised as yet.. '</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cheers Godd luck!</p>

              <p>this is not a good forum to post this, full of trolls who deny Catholics as Christians</p>
              <p>i would suggest Catholic forum instead</p>

              <p>May I know which church did you go to? People in catholic churches are generally warm and friendly and will be more than happy to welcome you to their church. Some of these churches include Imm.Heart of Mary, Church of Risen Christ, Novena. You will find that the above churches mentioned have a good conducive environment for praise and worship.</p>
              <p>However, please avoid catholic  churches in District 10/ Bukit Timah area as some of the people there are cold and arrogant because  they think that they are damn rich  ,have status and drive BMW 7 Series, Merc S. Class, Jaguar XL, Ferrari to church. ( U shld noe which church i m referring to...haha.)Politics also happen in these churches.</p>

              <p>Being a Catholics is a process......sometime it takes time to self reflect upon. As for social group, sponsors are human too it takes time to get to know the person spiritually. </p>
              <p> Its may just takes more times.</p>

              <p>Ultimately do you find yourself growing spiritually as a church-goer. If you find the level of fellowship does not suit you or you are not growing spritually, then you might want to consider changing your enviroment.</p>
              <p>And by changing your enviroment, I don't mean just changing church, but maybe something change within your current change that you can initiate? Just a thought.</p>
