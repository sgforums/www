              <p>But you can scorn can't you to tell what is right what is wrong.</p>
              <p>So SCORN!!!!!</p>
              <p>Well what you wrote is true however if you do not rebuke satan(literal or evil spirit) when it comes to bug you you're letting it to do more damage to you. The same with people whose lives are an insult to God(and to his fellow misunfortunate men). I'm surprised that with money people would terrify believers into submission and accordingly they 'disavowed' God. I say FUC* THEM. <strong>No wonder so many Christian lives are sterile.....what is worse than being a sterile Christians. The rituals would save or cheerish you?! If I were them I would turn into a complete evil. </strong>I'm not saying you have to be a saint or take up arms but for God's sake stand up to evil. Your god is not evil but the God of Abraham who shone His face to the people of Israel. One potent Christian could do a thousand more than a million sterile Christians.</p>
              <p>And Jesus did condemn the Pharisee then. <br>Peter condemned a couple to death too.</p>
              <p>You see what you wrote is not aplicable to any situation. In some situation it's better and it is expected to take your stand and show the other that they were wrong. If they don't listen wait for reinforcement from God LOL while enduring whatever insult and persecution yourway. In time(luckily it's a one way journey) you'll be proven right if you remain faithful.</p>

              <p>it's taken rather out of context by ongsoonsiang.</p>
              <p>the crowd which Jesus addressed to, at that point of time, were thirsty for blood, and was about to stone a woman in adultary to death. and they questioned Jesus, to test Him, wanting him to trap Himself with His own words.</p>
              <p>If He allowed the woman to live, He would indirectly be saying, that he condone her sinful actions, thus He is over-riding the law, and they could use it against Him.</p>
              <p>But if He allowed them to stone the woman to death, He wouldn't be the "sheperd who came to seek and save the lost", because He didn't love her enough to save her.</p>
              <p>But instead, Jesus, in His wisdom, didn't disallow anyone to stone her, which was right by the law. but He pointed out the hypocrisy of the action. Can anyone stone her without any hypocrisy? and everyone knew they couldn't, so they left.</p>
              <p>and Jesus, being the sinless one, could have stoned her, but chose to give grace, and grant her 2nd chance in life. "Go, and sin no more."</p>
              <p>being judgemental would mean you're pointing out the errors of others, without the intention to help the person better themselves. you're more concerned with the wrongdoing than the person who did it. you're eager to point fingers, to shame and ridicue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but God didn't tell us to ignore sins. in fact the bible said in Galatians 6:1 - Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should <strong>restore</strong> <strong>him</strong> <strong>gently</strong>. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted.</p>
              <p>and TS was wrong in saying that God does not judge. God judged the isrealites throughout the old testament. Jesus himself judged the outward holiness of the pharasees and teachers of the law, condemning them for putting burdens on the people without lifting a finger to help.</p>
              <p>and Jesus do judge the sins of the prostitutes and money collectors. But He could see right through their hearts, and acted accordingly. And there was repentance. sometimes he also became harsh, and beat up those people who desecrated God's temple by turning it into a marketplace.</p>
              <p>You'll notice Jesus especially went against the teachers of the law, because they weren't holy inside, but acted holy outside.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so i totally disagree with everything TS said</p>

              <p>Sadly though, many Christians are very judgmental. Some usual comments heard, if you're a Christian from:</p>
              <p>A small church: Small church= no blessing from God = not walking right with God</p>
              <p>A megachurch: Megachurch = evil = going to hell</p>
              <p>Dressing trendy: Oh! Your clothes have pictures of the skull. Satanic!</p>
              <p>Dressing plainly: You dress too old-fashioned, not attractive. Not walking right with God.</p>

              <p>it's taken rather out of context by ongsoonsiang.</p>
              <p>the crowd which Jesus addressed to, at that point of time, were thirsty for blood, and was about to stone a woman in adultary to death. and they questioned Jesus, to test Him, wanting him to trap Himself with His own words.</p>
              <p>If He allowed the woman to live, He would indirectly be saying, that he condone her sinful actions, thus He is over-riding the law, and they could use it against Him.</p>
              <p>But if He allowed them to stone the woman to death, He wouldn't be the "sheperd who came to seek and save the lost", because He didn't love her enough to save her.</p>
              <p>But instead, Jesus, in His wisdom, didn't disallow anyone to stone her, which was right by the law. but He pointed out the hypocrisy of the action. Can anyone stone her without any hypocrisy? and everyone knew they couldn't, so they left.</p>
              <p>and Jesus, being the sinless one, could have stoned her, but chose to give grace, and grant her 2nd chance in life. "Go, and sin no more."</p>

              <p><br>Actually what happened was that there was a travesty of the law. It is weird nobody pointed that out.</p>
              <p>According to the Old Testament:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Leviticus 20</p>
              <p><span class="vv">10</span> If a man commits adultery with the wife of<a><sup class="fnote"><span style="color: #0000ff;">*</span></sup></a> his neighbour, both the adulterer and the adulteress shall be put to death.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>So where is the man? ;p</p>

              <p>My understanding is that not every events in the bible happened as it is......and the bible was written much later. The events are passed down as oral traditions.</p>
              <p>However, the teachings and meaning behind such events are important as in this case. It shows the wisdom of Jesus (as point out by dumbdumb), the hypocrisy of the Pharisees, the grace of God (in forgiving the sins) and everything else that dumbdumb has said.</p>
              <p>So becareful when quoting bible verses....</p>
              <p>Important point - God does not contradict his teachings.</p>
