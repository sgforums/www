            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Icemoon:</div><div class="quote_body">I've seen Protestants using Timothy 3:16 on the basis of principle. Meaning not directly mentioned, but by principle.</div></blockquote>But on a deeper level, Tim 3:16 strengthens the catholic position LOL.<br><br>1) It fails to mention what is the NT scripture<br><br>2) It refers to the OT scripture.<br><br>3) The deep part:<br><br><blockquote>2 Tim. 3:14 - Protestants usually use 2 Tim. 3:16-17 to prove that the Bible is the sole authority of God's word. But examining these texts disproves their claim. Here, Paul appeals to apostolic tradition right before the Protestants' often quoted verse 2 Tim. 3:16-17. Thus, <strong>there is an appeal to tradition before there is an appeal to the Scriptures, and Protestants generally ignore this fact.</strong><br><br>2 Tim. 3:15 - Paul then appeals to the sacred writings of Scripture referring to the Old Testament Scriptures with which Timothy was raised (not the New Testament which was not even compiled at the time of Paul's teaching). This verse also proves that one can come to faith in Jesus Christ without the New Testament.<br><br>2 Tim. 3:16 - <strong>this verse says that Scripture is "profitable" for every good work, but not exclusive. The word "profitable" is "ophelimos" in Greek. "Ophelimos" only means useful, which underscores that Scripture is not mandatory or exclusive. </strong>Protestants unbiblically argue that profitable means exclusive.<br><br>2 Tim. 3:16 - further, the <strong>verse "all Scripture" uses the words "pasa graphe" which actually means every (not all) Scripture. This means every passage of Scripture is useful.</strong> Thus, the erroneous Protestant reading of "pasa graphe" would mean every single passage of Scripture is exclusive. This would mean Christians could not only use "sola Matthew," or "sola Mark," but could rely on one single verse from a Gospel as the exclusive authority of God's word. This, of course, is not true and even Protestants would agree. Also, "pasa graphe" cannot mean "all of Scripture" because there was no New Testament canon to which Paul could have been referring, unless Protestants argue that the New Testament is not being included by Paul.<br><br>2 Tim. 3:16 - also, these inspired Old Testament Scriptures Paul is referring to included the deuterocanonical books which the Protestants removed from the Bible 1,500 years later.<br><br>2 Tim. 3:17 - Paul's reference to the "man of God" who may be complete refers to a clergyman, not a layman. It is an instruction to a bishop of the Church. So, although Protestants use it to prove their case, the passage is not even relevant to most of the faithful.<br><br>2 Tim. 3:17 - further, Paul's use of the word "complete" for every good work is "artios" which simply means the clergy is "suitable" or "fit." Also, artios does not describe the Scriptures, it describes the clergyman. So, Protestants cannot use this verse to argue the Scriptures are complete.<br><br>James 1:4 - steadfastness also makes a man "perfect (teleioi) and complete (holoklepoi), lacking nothing." This verse is important because "teleioi"and "holoklepoi" are much stronger words than "artios," but Protestants do not argue that steadfastness is all one needs to be a Christian.<br><br>Titus 3:8 - <strong>good deeds are also "profitable" to men. For Protestants especially, profitable cannot mean "exclusive" here. </strong><br><br>2 Tim 2:21- purity is also profitable for "any good work" ("pan ergon agathon"). This wording is the same as 2 Tim. 3:17, which shows that the Scriptures are not exclusive, and that other things (good deeds and purity) are also profitable to men.<br><br>Col. 4:12 - prayer also makes men "fully assured." No where does Scripture say the Christian faith is based solely on a book.<br><br>2 Tim. 3:16-17 - Finally, if these verses really mean that Paul was teaching sola Scriptura to the early Church, then why in 1 Thess. 2:13 does Paul teach that he is giving Revelation from God orally? Either Paul is contradicting his own teaching on sola Scriptura, or Paul was not teaching sola Scriptura in 2 Tim. 3:16-17. This is a critical point which Protestants cannot reconcile with their sola Scriptura position.</blockquote>In short a nice analogy for the term profitable = useful.<br><br>Water is useful for survival but is not sufficient alone. One will still need food to survive.<br><br>Scripture is useful for salvation but is not sufficient alone. One still need Apostolic Tradition.<br><br>So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught by us, either by word of mouth or by letter."<br>2 Thess 2:15</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok.<br><br>My first comment was directed at Nicholas' statement that the Church has the authority to forgive. I disagree.<br><br>I think my simplistic comment was not good enough. Let me elaborate.<br><br>I think the first part regaring sinning against the other person maybe have been confusing.<br><br>If we offended any person, naturally we should ask for the person's forgiveness.  Maybe it is not what a common person call as sin, not the Christian sin, sin. Perhaps, misgiving or wrongdoing maybe a better word.<br><br>For example if I stole something from another person. Awhile later, I confessed up and return it.  Only he can choose to forgive me.  That kind of "sin".</div>

It's about whether the Catholic church is correct and everything else is wrong.<br></div></blockquote>Mind you, I have not quoted from any Catholic Church dogma.<br><br>I have merely quoted from Apostolic and Church Fathers and Scriptures. Or perhaps the early Christian and Apostolic Fathers position is too catholic for your liking?<br><br>And you should not feel Catholic Church is right and everyone else is wrong. Based on sola scriptura, anyone's intepretation of Scripture is correct. If u follow your doctrine well enough, both of us are right. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> It doesnt seem logical to me but for you I suppose it will be alright as its your doctrine of sola scriptura.<br><br>Lastly, I have not at all criticised the protestant position of God alone can forgive sins. I am merely advancing the Catholic position that God shares His power with his Church, his Bride. Ironically its those who refuse to accept this position as <strong>ANOTHER</strong> valid (despite Scripture and Apostolic Father quotes) form of exercising the sacrament of penance, that believe they are right and the CC is wrong.</div>
