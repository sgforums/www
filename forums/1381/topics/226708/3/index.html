But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away."<br><br>Paul is not saying, that tongues or prophecies will cease at a time in the future from where his era was, but he means that tongues, propehecies, knowledge are not eternal and that they should be proclaimed / used with Love.  Without Love, what is the use of speaking in tongues and prophecies ? Similarly, a person can be knowledgeable in biblical theology. But without having a loving / pastoral heart, whats the use of that knowledge?  To tell men that you are intelligent?<br><br>Let us go on to verses 9 - 13<br><br>"For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. 11When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. 12Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known." 13And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.<br><br>Seriously, i dont think Paul is half as interested to tell us here, that tongues will cease as teaching us, the two greatest commandments that Jesus Himself has said in Matthew 22: 36 - 40<br><br>36"Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?" 37Jesus replied: " 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.'[b] 38This is the first and greatest commandment. 39And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'[c] 40All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments."<br><br>Again, in John 20, i tend to agree more with Matthew Henry's commentaries, that when Jesus breathed into the disciples, it signifies that the Great Commission can only be carried out through the Holy Spirit and not by their own strength. More so, i quote: "the Christ which is received in the heart by faith, comes accompanied by this Divine breathing; and without this there is neither light nor life. Nothing is seen, known, discerned, or felt of God, but through this. After this, Christ directed the apostles to declare the only method by which sin would be forgiven. This power did not exist at all in the apostles as a power to give judgment, but only as a power to declare the character of those whom God would accept or reject in the day of judgment. They have clearly laid down the marks whereby a child of God may be discerned and be distinguished from a false professor; and according to what they have declared shall every case be decided in the day of judgment. When we assemble in Christ's name, especially on his holy day, he will meet with us, and speak peace to us. The disciples of Christ should endeavour to build up one another in their most holy faith, both by repeating what they have heard to those that were absent, and by making known what they have experienced." - Biblegateway, Matthew Henry's concise commentary on the Bible.<br><br>If some men can or should be forgiving the sins of others, why then does our Lord says in Hebrews 9:28:<br><br>28 so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.<br><br>And:<br><br>1 John 2: 1-6<br><br>1My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defenseÂ—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. 2He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for[a] the sins of the whole world. 3We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands. 4The man who says, "I know him," but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 5But if anyone obeys his word, God's love[b] is truly made complete in him. This is how we know we are in him: 6Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did.<br><br></div>

The beginning of this great project is customarily marked by the arrival of the Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci (1552-1610) in Beijing in 1601, though the indefatigable Ricci had come to south China in 1583 and was able to present himself at the Imperial court only after eighteen years of trying.<br><a href="http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft9708/articles/horner.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft9708/articles/horner.html</a></blockquote>Just simply based on these two, we can see, at the time of St Augustine, the Catholic had not yet spread to all nations nor able to speak the language of every race.<br><br>Therefore, I can safely assumed that this nations in the 'the language of the nations' are only refering to the known civilised world (ie. either part of the Roman Empire or perhaps have some relations with the Roman Empire).<br><br>Question: given that St Augustine made this statement in view that tongue-speaking was only for purposes of evangelization and is no longer needed because the Church is able to speak the language of all races.....<br>IF St Augustine had know that in fact the Church is not able to speak the language of all races yet, Do you think he will still make this statement?<br><br>*added, try putting yourself in his shoe, at his time and moment.</div>

Lets see how the early Christians especially in the first century explained it.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Â“In church confess your sins,</strong> and do not come to your prayer with a guilt conscience. Such is the Way of Life...On the Lord's own day, assemble in common to break bread and offer thanks; but first confess your sins, so that your sacrifice may be pure." Didache, 4:14,14:1 (c. A.D. 90).<br><br>"Moreover, it is in accordance with reason that we should return to soberness[of conduct], and, while yet we have opportunity, exercise repentance towards God. <strong>It is well to reverence both God and the bishop</strong>." Ignatius, Epistle to the Smyraeans, 9 (c. A.D. 110).<br><br>"Moreover, that this Marcus compounds philters and love-potions, in order to insult the persons of some of these women, if not of all, those of them who have returned to the Church of God--a thing which frequently occurs--have acknowledged, confessing, too, that they have been defiled by him, and that they were filled with a burning passion towards him. A sad example of this occurred in the case of a certain Asiatic, one of our deacons, who had received him (Marcus) into his house. His wife, a woman of remarkable beauty, fell a victim both in mind and body to this magician, and, for a long time, travelled about with him. At last, when, with no small difficulty, the brethren had converted her, she <strong>spent her whole time in the exercise of public confession</strong>, weeping over and lamenting the defilement which she had received from this magician." Irenaeus, Against Heresies, 1:13 (A.D. 180).<br><br>"Such are the words and deeds by which, in our own district of the Rhone, they have deluded many women, who have their consciences seared as with a hot iron. <strong>Some of them, indeed, make a public confession of their sins; but others of them are ashamed to do this, and in a tacit kind of way, despairing of [attaining to] the life of God</strong>, have, some of them, apostatized altogether; while others hesitate between the two courses, and incur that which is implied in the proverb, 'neither without nor within;' possessing this as the fruit from the seed of the children of knowledge." Irenaeus, Against Heresies, 1:13 (A.D. 180).<br><br>"Father who knowest the hearts of all grant upon this Thy servant whom Thou hast chosen for the episcopate to feed Thy holy flock and serve as Thine high priest, that he may minister blamelessly by night and day, that he may unceasingly behold and appropriate Thy countenance and offer to Thee the gifts of Thy holy Church. <strong>And that by the high priestly Spirit he may have authority to forgive sins.</strong>.." Hippolytus, Apostolic Tradition, 3 (A.D. 215).<br><br>"The Pontifex Maximus--that is, the bishop of bishops--issues an edict: 'I remit, to such as have <strong>discharged (the requirements of) repentance, the sins both of adultery and of fornication</strong>.'" Tertullian, Modesty, 1 (A.D. 220).<br><br>"In addition to these there is also a seventh, albeit hard and laborious: the remission of sins through penance...when <strong>he does not shrink from declaring his sin to a priest of the Lord."</strong> Origen, Homilies on Leviticus, 2:4 (A.D. 24<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br>"For although in smaller sins sinners may do penance for a set time, and according to the rules of discipline come to public confession, and by imposition of the hand of the bishop and clergy receive the right of communion: now with their time still unfulfilled, while persecution is still raging, while the peace of the Church itself is not vet restored, they are admitted to communion, and their name is presented; and <strong>while the penitence is not yet performed, confession is not yet made</strong>, the hands Of the bishop and clergy are not yet laid upon them, the eucharist is given to them; although it is written, 'Whosoever shall eat the bread and drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.'" Cyprian, To the Clergy, 9 (16):2 (A.D. 250).<br><br>"Moreover, how much are they both greater in faith and better in their fear, who, although bound by no crime of sacrifice to idols or of certificate, yet, since they have even thought of such things, with grief and simplicity confess this very thing to God's priests, and make the conscientious avowal, put off from them the load of their minds, and seek out the salutary medicine even for slight and moderate wounds, knowing that it is written, 'God is not mocked.' God cannot be mocked, nor deceived, nor deluded by any deceptive cunning. Yea, he sins the more, who, thinking that God is like man, believes that he evades the penalty of his crime if he has not openly admitted his crimeÂ…I entreat you, beloved brethren, that each one should confess his own sin, while he who has sinned is still in this world, while his <strong>confession may be received, while the satisfaction and remission made by the priests are pleasing to the Lord?"</strong> Cyprian, To the Lapsed, 28-29 (A.D. 251).<br><br>"For if any one will consider how great a thing it is for one, being a man, and compassed with flesh and blood, to be enabled to draw nigh to that blessed and pure nature, he will then clearly see what great honor the grace of the Spirit has vouchsafed to priests; since by their agency these rites are celebrated, and others nowise inferior to these both in respect of our dignity and our salvation. For they who inhabit the earth and make their abode there are entrusted with the administration of things which are in Heaven, and have received an authority which God has not given to angels or archangels. For it has not been said to them, <strong>'Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in Heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in Heaven.' They who rule on earth have indeed authority to bind, but only the body: whereas this binding lays hold of the soul and penetrates the heavens; and what priests do here below God ratifies above, and the Master confirms the sentence of his servants.</strong> For indeed what is it but all manner of heavenly authority which He has given them when He says, <strong>'Whose sins ye remit they are remitted, and whose sins ye retain they are retained?' What authority could be greater than this?</strong> 'The Father hath committed all judgment to the Son?' <strong>But I see it all put into the hands of these men by the Son." </strong>John Chrysostom, The Priesthood, 3:5 (A.D. 387).</span><br><br>So u can clearly see, the early Christians intepretated Scripture the Catholic way. Im afriad Henry exegis of Scripture is hardly historical.<br><br>On the Biblical issue, he is moving in circles attempting to confuse his reader with Christ sacrifice on calvary and the Church ability to forgive sins. Christ gave the Apostles the power to 'forgive and retain sins'. How do u intepretate that?<br><br>First, we see that Jesus breathes on His apostles in the upper room. The only other time God breathted on man was when He created him and breathed life into his body. Genesis 2:7. When God breathes on man, a transformatoin takes place. Here, the apostles were transformed and filled with the Holy Spirit and with Jesus' divien authority to forgive sins. Thus,Mathtew writes that God gave the authuority to forgive sins Â“to men.Â” Matt. 9:8. By virtue of God's mercy, the apostles are able to forgive all sins.<br><br>While such authority is reserved to God alone, Christ shared this authority with the apostles.<br><br>I cant see any way out of this intepretation.</div>

When Paul says that prophecies and knowledge will Â“pass awayÂ” (1 Cor. 13:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, the phrase Â“pass awayÂ” (in Greek, katargeo) indicates that these gifts will be replaced by a superior power.
