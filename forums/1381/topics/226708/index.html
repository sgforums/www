Others are from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia, 10Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, parts of Libya near Cyrene, Rome, 11Crete, and Arabia. Some of us were born Jews, and others of us have chosen to be Jews. Yet we all hear them using our own languages to tell the wonderful things God has done.<br></div>

Written in such a way that it's like a standing order for anyone to understand. Please read the entire chapter. It will help to clear the air very quickly.<br><br>The entire chapter boils down to orderly, understanding of the tongues. But the current day in some churches, tongues are totally abused and messy.

            <div class='col-md body'>The gift of tongues will cease.  Paul says Â“as for tongues, they will ceaseÂ” (1 Cor. 13:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.  The Greek word for Â“ceaseÂ” (pauomai) means that the gift of tongues will end abruptly, on its own, and will not be replaced by another gift.  The gift of tongues is the only gift of the Holy Spirit that is said to Â“ceaseÂ” in this way.  When Paul says that prophecies and knowledge will Â“pass awayÂ” (1 Cor. 13:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, the phrase Â“pass awayÂ” (in Greek, katargeo) indicates that these gifts will be replaced by a superior power.  This appears to take place when we begin our life in eternity (1 Cor. 13:10-12).  Not so with tongues.<br><br>Paul does not say when the gift of tongues would cease, and whether the gift would return intermittently after its cessation.  However, Augustine wrote that the gift of tongues had ceased by the time of his day.  Augustine explained that this was because the Catholic Church now spoke the language of the nations, and tongue-speaking was only for purposes of evangelization (Aquinas agreed). The fact that the gift of tongues is not recorded in later books of the New Testament suggest that the gift may have even been ceasing during the biblical period.<br><br>Nevertheless, there are a few recorded instances of saints speaking in tongues over the centuries (Sts. Dominic, Anthony of Padua, Francis Xavier, John of the Cross, Ignatius of Loyola).  This demonstrates that the gift of tongues is very rare, and given to the holiest of people<br></div>

So it is with Christ. 13For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one bodyÂ—whether Jews or Greeks, slave or freeÂ—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.<br><br>14Now the body is not made up of one part but of many. 15If the foot should say, "Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body," it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body. 16And if the ear should say, "Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body," it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body. 17If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? 18But in fact God has arranged the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be. 19If they were all one part, where would the body be? 20As it is, there are many parts, but one body.<br><br>21The eye cannot say to the hand, "I don't need you!" And the head cannot say to the feet, "I don't need you!" 22On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, 23and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty, 24while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has combined the members of the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lacked it, 25so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other. 26If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <strong>27Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it. 28And in the church God has appointed first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, also those having gifts of healing, those able to help others, those with gifts of administration, and those speaking in different kinds of tongues. 29Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? 30Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues[d]? Do all interpret?</strong></span> 31But eagerly desire[e] the greater gifts.<br>And now I will show you the most excellent way.<br></blockquote>I saw too many people speaking in tongues, or faking it in CHC.<br><br><blockquote><br><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20cor%2014;%20Luke%208;&amp;version=31;" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20cor%2014;%20Luke%208;&amp;version=31;</a><br>1 Corinthians 14<br>Gifts of Prophecy and Tongues<br>1Follow the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy. 2For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God. Indeed, no one understands him; he utters mysteries with his spirit. 3But everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their strengthening, encouragement and comfort. 4He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church. 5I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, but I would rather have you prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may be edified.<br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">6Now, brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction?</span></strong> 7Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the flute or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes? 8Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle? 9So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air. 10Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning. 11If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and he is a foreigner to me. 12So it is with you. Since you are eager to have spiritual gifts, try to excel in gifts that build up the church.<br><br>13For this reason anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret what he says. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">14For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. </span></strong>15So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind. 16If you are praising God with your spirit, how can one who finds himself among those who do not understand[e] say "Amen" to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying? 17You may be giving thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified.<br><br>18I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. 19But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.<br><br>20Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults. 21In the Law it is written:<br>"Through men of strange tongues<br>and through the lips of foreigners<br>I will speak to this people,<br>but even then they will not listen to me,"[f] says the Lord.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">22Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is for believers, not for unbelievers. 23So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and some who do not understand[g] or some unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind?</span></strong> 24But if an unbeliever or someone who does not understand[h]comes in while everybody is prophesying, he will be convinced by all that he is a sinner and will be judged by all, 25and the secrets of his heart will be laid bare. So he will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, "God is really among you!"<br><br></blockquote></div>

But these 'extras' to different people is also important. I am sorry for my outburst earlier. But as a Catholic, a priest is extremely important for 2 reasons<br><br>1) He (representing the church) alone can forgive sins<br>2) Without him, who can conduct Mass to turn the bread to flesh and offer it up to the Father.<br><br>As for tongues, i do know it ceased.<br><br>St Augustine wrote that the gift of tongues had ceased by the time of his day.  Augustine explained that this was because the Catholic Church now spoke the language of the nations, and tongue-speaking was only for purposes of evangelization (Aquinas agreed)<br><br>Aquinas and Augustine are greatest theoligcans.</div>
