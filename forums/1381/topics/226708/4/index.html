            <div class='col-md body'>Â“<strong>In church confess your sins</strong>, and do not come to your prayer with a guilt conscience. Such is the Way of Life...On the Lord's own day, assemble in common to break bread and offer thanks; but first confess your sins, so that your sacrifice may be pure." Didache, 4:14,14:1 (c. A.D. 90).<br><br>"Moreover, it is in accordance with reason that we should return to soberness[of conduct], and, while yet we have opportunity, exercise repentance towards God. <strong>It is well to reverence both God and the bishop</strong>." Ignatius, Epistle to the Smyraeans, 9 (c. A.D. 110).<br><br>"Moreover, that this Marcus compounds philters and love-potions, in order to insult the persons of some of these women, if not of all, those of them who have returned to the Church of God--a thing which frequently occurs--have acknowledged, confessing, too, that they have been defiled by him, and that they were filled with a burning passion towards him. A sad example of this occurred in the case of a certain Asiatic, one of our deacons, who had received him (Marcus) into his house. His wife, a woman of remarkable beauty, fell a victim both in mind and body to this magician, and, for a long time, travelled about with him. At last, when, with no small difficulty, the brethren had converted her, she <strong>spent her whole time in the exercise of public confession</strong>, weeping over and lamenting the defilement which she had received from this magician." Irenaeus, Against Heresies, 1:13 (A.D. 180).<br><br>"Such are the words and deeds by which, in our own district of the Rhone, they have deluded many women, who have their consciences seared as with a hot iron. <strong>Some of them, indeed, make a public confession of their sins; but others of them are ashamed to do this</strong>, and in a tacit kind of way, despairing of [attaining to] the life of God, have, some of them, apostatized altogether; while others hesitate between the two courses, and incur that which is implied in the proverb, 'neither without nor within;' possessing this as the fruit from the seed of the children of knowledge." Irenaeus, Against Heresies, 1:13 (A.D. 180).<br><br>"Father who knowest the hearts of all grant upon this Thy servant whom Thou hast chosen for the episcopate to feed Thy holy flock and serve as Thine high priest, that he may minister blamelessly by night and day, that he may unceasingly behold and appropriate Thy countenance and offer to Thee the gifts of Thy holy Church. <strong>And that by the high priestly Spirit he may have authority to forgive sins</strong>..." Hippolytus, Apostolic Tradition, 3 (A.D. 215).<br><br>"The Pontifex Maximus--that is, the bishop of bishops--issues an edict: 'I remit, to such as have <strong>discharged (the requirements of) repentance, the sins both of adultery and of fornication</strong>.'" Tertullian, Modesty, 1 (A.D. 220).<br><br>"In addition to these there is also a seventh, albeit hard and laborious: the remission of sins through penance...when <strong>he does not shrink from declaring his sin to a priest of the Lord.</strong>" Origen, Homilies on Leviticus, 2:4 (A.D. 24.<br><br>"For although in smaller sins sinners may do penance for a set time, and according to the rules of discipline come to <strong>public confession</strong>, and by imposition of the hand of the bishop and clergy receive the right of communion: now with their time still unfulfilled, while persecution is still raging, while the peace of the Church itself is not vet restored, they are admitted to communion, and their name is presented; and <strong>while the penitence is not yet performed, confession is not yet made, the hands Of the bishop and clergy are not yet laid upon them</strong>, the eucharist is given to them; although it is written, 'Whosoever shall eat the bread and drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.'" Cyprian, To the Clergy, 9 (16):2 (A.D. 250).<br><br>"Moreover, how much are they both greater in faith and better in their fear, who, although bound by no crime of sacrifice to idols or of certificate, yet, since they have even thought of such things, <strong>with grief and simplicity confess this very thing to God's priests</strong>, and make the conscientious avowal, put off from them the load of their minds, and seek out the salutary medicine even for slight and moderate wounds, knowing that it is written, 'God is not mocked.' God cannot be mocked, nor deceived, nor deluded by any deceptive cunning. Yea, he sins the more, who, thinking that God is like man, believes that he evades the penalty of his crime if he has not openly admitted his crimeÂ…<strong>I entreat you, beloved brethren, that each one should confess his own sin, while he who has sinned is still in this world, while his confession may be received, while the satisfaction and remission made by the priests are pleasing to the Lord</strong>?" Cyprian, To the Lapsed, 28-29 (A.D. 251).<br><br>"For if any one will consider how great a thing it is for one, being a man, and compassed with flesh and blood, to be enabled to draw nigh to that blessed and pure nature, he will then clearly see what great honor the grace of the Spirit has vouchsafed to priests; since by their agency these rites are celebrated, and others nowise inferior to these both in respect of our dignity and our salvation. For they who inhabit the earth and make their abode there are entrusted with the administration of things which are in Heaven, and have received an authority which God has not given to angels or archangels. For it has not been said to them, 'Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in Heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in Heaven.' They who rule on earth have indeed authority to bind, but only the body: whereas this binding lays hold of the soul and penetrates the heavens; and what priests do here below God ratifies above, and the Master confirms the sentence of his servants. <span class="large"><strong>For indeed what is it but all manner of heavenly authority which He has given them when He says, 'Whose sins ye remit they are remitted, and whose sins ye retain they are retained?' What authority could be greater than this? 'The Father hath committed all judgment to the Son?' But I see it all put into the hands of these men by the Son</strong></span>." John Chrysostom, The Priesthood, 3:5 (A.D. 387).<br><br><strong>Apostolic Fathers and Church Fathers intepretations of that verse.</strong></div>

Thanks </div></blockquote>Sola Verbum Dei means Word of God alone. This is the Catholic source of authority. Its basically, that the word of God is found in Apostolic Oral Tradition (2 Thess 2:15) and Written Tradition or Scriptures. The Church uses Tradition (Apostolic Teachings depositied in the Church) to intepretate Scriptures. A prime example would be the Canon of the Bible. Tradition was used to determine which books were inspired as Scriptures does not give a list of inspired books.<br><br>"We do not take our scriptural teaching from the parables but we interpret the parables according to our teaching." Tertullian, Purity 9,1 (c. A.D. 200).<br><br>Sola Scriptura is  scripture alone. It is the protestant doctrine formulated by the Reformers. It is the assertion that the Bible as God's written word is self-authenticating, clear ) to the rational reader, its own interpreter ("Scripture interprets Scripture"), and sufficient of itself to be the only source of Christian doctrine. Basically private intepretation.</div>
