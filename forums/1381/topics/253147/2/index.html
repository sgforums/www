And if we deny the ultimate freewill, theologically, it's almost impossible to explain. And theological studies should be taken whole, not bit and pieces.

St Thomas's argument: suffering happens due to a lack of goodness<br>2. bounded rationality of humans. thus, only God can see the big picture<br>3. the sufferings occurring in the world can be attributed to free will (this itself will be another big talking point)<br>4. suffering and love is not a dichotomy.
