            <div class='col-md body'>Just a thought......<br><br>I tend to believe that there are many ex-christians (or people who were exploring into Christianity) lost faith and in the end write a lot of bad things about the faith, here on sgforums and elsewhere.<br><br>I believe that sometimes it really is God's sovereignty that u become a believer / the things u experienced that draws u closer to God. It is all God's work and very little is on what you do. Life is indeed very unpredictable and now I know why we should pray for our salvation trembling and fearing God.<br><br>For those who has detached away from God, the only way we can do is to pray for their well-being.<br><br></div>
