            <div class='col-md body'>"Be it according to thy word."<br><br>Â–(Exodus 8:10)<br><br>I used to worry about making decisions for God. I used to be afraid to step out on faith and declare I was going to do something new that He'd shown me to do. I'd think, "What if I fail?" I was so scared of failing, I'd muddle around in indecision for weeks. Then one day I found out it wasn't my power that was going to carry it out anyway. But it took my decision to move God in on the scene. Once I decided what I was going to do and set it down firm, God backed me!<br><br>What I learned is a truth from the Word of God that, if you'll pay attention to it, will revolutionize your life. It's truth that carries an awesome responsibility with it, but it's a wonderful thing to realize.<br><br>Here it is: The right, the privilege, and the power to DECIDE has been left by God in the hands of men.<br><br>You have the right, for example, to decide where you're going to spend eternity. You have a right to make that decision, and God will back your decision.<br><br>God can do everything for you but decide. He's provided the power. He's provided His Name. He's provided the blood of Jesus. He's provided the kingdom of God. He's even made us partakers of it (Col. 1:12).<br><br>But He's not going to stuff that inheritance down our throats. Somewhere down the line we each have to make the decision to receive it.<br><br>Now the beautiful part is this: When you make that decision, God will back you to the hilt with His power. Once you make a decision to be born again, there's no devil in hell big enough to stop you. All you have to do is decide.<br><br>Decide now. Declare your decision. Let it be done unto you according to your words.<br><br>Is God leading you in some new direction? Is He leading you to step out in faith for healing or prosperity or to take a whole new step of ministry? Don't let fear hold you back.<br><br>SCRIPTURE READING: Romans 4:13-21<br>__________________</div>
