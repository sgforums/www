Dr. (Internet degree) Pastor Kong Hee and his City Harvest Church emotionally announced the departure of Rev.

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">Pastor Kong, already in a difficult spotlight following his denial of the plagiarism accusations, his celebrity wife, and the CAD investigation, got his prophecy wrong in both accounts.</span></p>

              <li style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 13.5pt; font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial;">It happened VERY FAST: Within 2 months of Derek Dunn’s departure, and</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial;">It is NOT a City Harvest Church: The already up and running church is called DEREK DUNN MINISTRIES (</span><a style="font-size: small; line-height: 13.5pt; font-family: Arial;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.derekdunn.org/">http://www.derekdunn.org/</a><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial;">). CHC members will undoubtedly notice the similarities with the CHC websites, except that Kong Hee’s face is replaced by Derek Dunn’s.</span></li>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">It takes more than just Faith to believe that it is possible to set up a completely new church within 2 months.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">This leads to the question: Did Kong Hee know?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 13px;">
              <li><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial;">If yes, and Kong Hee did know, why the charade? Does Kong Hee not trust the ability of his flock to handle the truth?</span></li>

              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;">If no, and Kong Hee did not know, why did </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Derek Du</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">nn not share his plans to start his own church with his mentorpersonal friend? Lack of trust?</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">First allegations of connections to the CAD investigation are already floating around on the internet raising questions where Derek Dunn got the funds to start his church? Was Derek Dunn involved in the ARA Trust Management who sold the 39,8% Suntec shares to City Harvest Church at an exploded price multiple times the market price?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">No doubt on anybody’s mind that businessman Kong Hee will come up with a professionally crafted excuse to  reassure his CHC army. Kong Hee can never be wrong.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">Derek Dunn is well advised to live up to his “City Harvest Church is my church—you can’t get rid of me, I will always be a part of CHC.” as Derek will have to rely heavily on the support of CHC to start-up his business. </span></p>

              <p>Thanks for the sharing again. However, I think you might have over-reacted on this. </p>
              <p>It seems to me that when Kong Hee mentioned that Derek would start a City Harvest Church in the USA it meant a church (very) similar to CHC, not that it would necessarily bear the name and logo of CHC. It would be like the other CHC-affiliate churches in other parts of the world.  Also in Derek's website it was mentioned that he has the backing and support of CHC. So I don't think there is some boo boo here. And it certainly wasn't a prophecy failure.</p>

              <p>Following my recent research on CHC, they are notorious for taking the truth with a huge clump of salt. But true, with a little bit of imagination, one could interprete KH's "a while" as being a few weeks only; and "It will be a City Harvest hurch" as "It is a Church in the same spirit as City Harvest Church" </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; text-align: justify;">If I read:..."There are plans for the Dunns to plant a City Harvest church in the US once Dunn’s mother is well on the road to recovery. Kong says, <strong>“That won’t happen for a while yet</strong> — Derek has to focus on getting his mom well—but we have discussed it, and when it happens, <strong>it will be a City Harvest Church in the US</strong>, and we will support it to the hilt.” There are over 50 affiliate churches and Bible schools across the globe."</span></p>
              <p>... I would not be wrong saying, "<strong>it happened within 8 weeks</strong>", and "<strong>it is not a City Harvest Church</strong>".</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 100%;">You say CHC supports this?</span></p>
              <p><strong>Where does it say on the Derek Dunn Ministries website that Derek Dunn has the backing and support of CHC?</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>True, Derek Dunn does mention his work in CHC. He needs to put some credibility to his new church using his experience in CHC. He even goes as far as publishing pictures where he is sheeply seated next to his "Heroes".</p>
              <div>Derek Dunn is the 3rd Pastor leaving CHC to open up his church. But previous pastors received an honorable mention of their efforts, including a disclaimer that they have CHC's "spiritual" support.</div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Why is there no mention of "Derek Dunn Ministries" to be found on the CHC website?</strong></p>
              <p>In addition, I would say that the website succeeds very well in putting zero focus on KH. How many Kong Hee pictures did you spot?</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; text-align: justify;">It has been a very difficult decision, both for Dunn and his Singaporean wife Susan, who will be relocating to the US with him and their three children, and for the church leadership. But after months of attempting and considering every other solution, both sides agree that the imperative issue is Dunn’s mother gets the best care right now, and he needs to be there to ensure that.</span></p>

We really tried to work out another way—the easiest for us would be to just go there several times a year, but after looking at the state my mom is in, and how much disrepair her house is in, it’s just not possible for me not to be physically there.”</p>
              <p style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; text-align: justify;">This is a decision the Dunns have come to after months of prayer and discussion with Kong Hee, senior pastor of City Harvest Church, and his wife Sun. “It is a very, very hard decision for us. But the Bible says, if we honor our father and mother, things will go well for us. Now is the time for Derek to take care of his mother. Anyone who remembers her will know she’s a sharp, beautiful woman. She needs to get well.</p>

              <p style="text-align: left;">KH the businessman meticulously plans every step in detail. Would KH have given the above anouncement knowing that Derek Dunn was to start a church 8 weeks later? KH might be a little of things, but stupid is not one of them</p>

              <p>It seems that derekdunn.org is more like a blog than a church. And over at <a href="http://www.derekdunn.org/about/">http://www.derekdunn.org/about/</a> it is mentioned that he travels as an itinerant speaker. Also no mention of worship services and timings on the website. As such I don't think this CHC-like church pastored by Derek has materialised yet in the USA.</p>
              <p>Just to clarify, I am not defending CHC here. But I think you might have gotten the wrong impression that Derek has already started his own church.</p>
