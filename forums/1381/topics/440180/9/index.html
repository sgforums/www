              <p>That is not realistic. Many things in this world are grey. And people can choose many kinds of middlegrounds. It doesnt always have to be as simple as YES OR NO.</p>

              So let me get this right.
              
              There is no white or black. There is grey. And you guys can be in the middle ground. But religious people in particular Christians cannot take a middle ground or have a simple YES or NO. Is that what u are saying ?
              
              If its NO, then when Christians of different denominations some have a middleground on what they believe and not believe they are simple minded ?
              
              Is that what u mean ?
              
              If NO,
              
              Explain.

              *Bravo* 
              
              But we are in Christian Forum. The premise being that we assume we believe in a God. 
              
              Now if I am debating with about What is Right and Wrong. For example, Killing. You will go on and on about how Killing is grey because u can kill in some circumstances u cant in some.. yada yada yada.
              
              That is all good and all, but why cant it be black and white ? U can choose to Kill or Not Kill. If your principle demands you not to KILL, you don't need to kill. And if you are killed by not killing, well, you are a man of principle, or people will call you stupid. Grey are just excuses. You know what is a virtue right ? Virtues have no middleground.  
              
              Back to Christianity -
              
              #1 Bible says that we should love and care and give to the needy.
              
              #2 Bible says too that we should not throw pearls at pigs.
              
              Black and White right there. But we decide to interpret a middle ground. Some circumstances should help.. some should not.
              
              Those that believe #1 , will always help. They will get used and abused in the process, but are u to say they are stupid and ignorant ?
              
              Those that believe #2 wont always help. You will then say that they are unbecoming of Christians
              
              Those that choose the middle ground : And will still get blamed for not being consistent when they are using thier own mind and ability to interpret.
              
              If you guys have alreayd understood it, why still making baseless attacks on Christianity as a whole ? It just means that you got intolerant, hateful, anti-Christians here. The purpose is just to attack attack attack even when thier attacks have been answered and explained. U get where I am getting at ?

              <p>This is what you said:  "I realise something about you christians is you guys like to always go to the extremes. It's either YES OR NO or BLACK OR WHITE."</p>
              <p>you then changed and said "most christians I met always .." Don't twist!!</p>
              <p>The world is not only BLACK AND WHITE, it is in fact very colorful, there are not only RIGHT AND WRONG, there are many things that are NICE AND BEAUTIFUL!! But there are also many who are confused. The world is still big enough to accommodate these kind of people, but don't make it complicated, learn to accept others.</p>

              <p>Well, those christians who do not agree with the prosperity theory more or less share the same views as what some non christians think of it.     Church is not a place for money making.     Many of the mega churches are using the name of God to get in more money which is uncalled for.  </p>

              <p>Go else where to make money not church, understand?    </p>
              <p>I have been to many churches including mega churches.  Mega churches' leaders have to glib of the tongue to persuade more money for what crap.    In the mega church like City Harvest, Kong Hee preached and asked them to sell their HDB flats and donate to church.     Why the church people and not himself?  He and wife own many private property why not sell them and donate to church why only the church christians&gt;?      He expect them to sell the HDB flat and where do they stay after that, stay in his apartments is it?</p>
              <p>Crap, lah, don't need to justify to support the mega churches money making theory, I am strongly against it.      </p>

              <p>I don't agree but of course will not stop it from happening.    Let's take a case like temple medium asking for donation and the willing ones give.   Later found out that they misuse the fund to buy racing car.    How would you feel?   I am quoting this not on the Kong Hee's case only but in general.    </p>
              <p>I think you still don't get it that a church is for worshipping God .  It is not a place for profit making, understand&gt;?    I am sure if you want to make money you will not go to mosque and ask for donation and use this money for your own.</p>

              <p>questions should be asked of the pastor and the church goers there.</p>
              <p>was the pastor and his wife enriched and living off the donor's donation money? as money is involved, it must be transparent  and accountable to the church goers. accounting must be established, as its account has millions of dollars. how much is the pastors drawing monthy salary?</p>
