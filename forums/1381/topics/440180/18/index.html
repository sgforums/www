              <p>About Kong Hee and prosperity gospel, it is the same thing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's about interpretation of the bible.</p>
              <p>Christian A studies the bible and interpets that God wants every christian to prosper materially, spiritually and physically.</p>
              <p>Christian B studies the bible and interprets that God does not want every christian to prosper materially, spiritually and physically.</p>

              <p>Where did you get the idea of an inspired interpretation of the inspired Word of God? Nowhere does the Bible says that there is an inspired interpretation of Scripture, or that there is any person endowed with such a capability. Prove such an idea from the Bible please. Only the text of the Bible is inspired lah! See, once again you have been exposed for your lack of knowledge about what the Bible teaches. This I have empirically proven over and over again, but yet you refused to believe! Duh!</p>

              <p>You are the one twisting the argument, not me. Christians are not claiming that they got their interpretation from God directly. In fact you have earlier conceded this point. But now you seem to eat back your own vomit. Christians are saying that they are interpreting the Word of God and arrived at different conclusions or interpretations. Why different conclusions? I already alluded to some of the reasons, and funny thing is that you also agreed with them. Yet you keep harping on a strawman argument that God is directly speaking to Christians about what each verse means. Dude, if that's how it works then there's no need for Bible helps and references liao, everyone just open the Bible and go into trance can liao lor! Duh!</p>

              <p>The interpretation of the bible differs from christian to
              christian.</p>
              <p>Example.</p>
              <p>Christian A interprets the bible, studies it and concludes that

              <p>Christian B interprets the bible, studies it and concludes that

              <p> </p>
              <p>So I feel "message" of the bible is subjected to how each

              <p>So I wouldnt want to go into a lengthy discussion about

              <p>First of all, are already prescribing limitations to this omnipotent being. When U prescrib with it limitations, you are already subjecting this supreme entity into your world view.</p>

              <p>I am not ignoring it. They have been answered over n over n over n over again.</p>

              <p>And answering paradoxes, Buddhism strives on the paradoxes. Its like a paradox of paradoxes. But it cannot be explained. Well, they can attempt to, but it requires years of meditation, understasnding.... combined with thier precepts.. experiences and what nots.</p>
              <p>No one can reach such enlightenment or experience or spirituality, by just reading the words without deeper understanding of the meaning behind it. Which in truth, there is NO easy way out. You have to go through the process. And how such process is determiend by these Enlightened people like Buddha or Jesus to try and put it into words so you and me can try to attain such an experience.</p>
              <p>You think these people took them a few years to reach that level ? No.. it takes them years.. decades... or even until death.</p>
              <p>So who am I or you .. or who are we to claim paradoxes when we ourselves didnt even go through such a journey ourselves to understand the deeper meaning in such short time when these people have spent thier entire life to do it.</p>

              <p>Anyways, you know what I am trying to say. As you can see in the WiKi link itself, even the word itself has problem describing omnipotence. If my explaination is too simple, you can read the link for more detailed explaination with big words. It at least explains it in a great more detail.</p>
              <p>You got these great minds and thinkers since centuries trying to answer the very question they pose to themselves and even up until now, there is no real answer.</p>
              <p>Again I emphasise that we have yet to reach that level of enlightenment to be able to answer the questions of the universe. So until then, the paradoxes are only paradoxes when you want it to be a paradox.</p>
              <p>There is a very good book called, 'If the Universe is the answer, What is the Question?' And its a good read.</p>

But what I am refuting is your silly strawman idea that Christians are hearing directly from God as to what the Bible means. There is no such thing as an inspired interpretation of God's Word, geddit? So you assume? Now what did Jacky say about ASSume? You just made an ass out of yourself by assume things and then whacking your own strawman.</p>

              <p>Sorry.</p>
              <p>As much as you like to ignore the paradox of <span style="font-size: 15px;">'Can God create something so big he cannot lift', the paradox still exists.</span></p>
              <p>It doesnt mean if you ignore it, it will go away.</p>

              <p>Sorry, it's not a paradox, it's the atheist's silly caricature of God based on his own ignorance of what the Bible teach and inability to think critically.</p>

              <p>It's from the Bible lah! But of course the Bible is God's Word

                                      Christians are hearing directly from God as to what the Bible
                                      means. There is no such thing as an inspired interpretation of
                                      God's Word, geddit? So you assume? Now what did Jacky say
                                      about ASSume? You just made an ass out of yourself by assume things

              <p>As usual you FAILED to read. I already said that the Bible is God's Word to us. As such we have to read it and interpret it using accepted rules of hermeneutics (which you obviously have no clue about!) and understanding of genres (which again you know next to nothing about). Anyway, the words of the Bible is God inspired. The interpretation is mine. And I believe my interpretation is correct because it takes the most natural and plain sense meaning, and because it does not conflict with other passages, and it can explain apparent conflicts with other passages, and it is consistent with and does not contradict the accepted creeds of the faith.</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>Problem is that you can't even recognise what a circular argument is! LOL!</p>
              <p>Anyway, you commit the fallacy of false dilemma. I acknowledge the EXISTENCE of differing interpretations, but I do not subscribe to the silly idea that all differing interpretations are equally valid or true or that we CANNOT know for sure. If this is the case, then you must also entertain the idea that all forms of communication is moot liao. If I say you are an idiot will you say that you are not sure what I meant? Duh! Again I said that each man must prove his own interpretation. There are accepted methods of Bible interpretation (which you are blissfully ignorant of) to be used but often times the principle of GIGO applies, or the person is not rigorous enough in his exegesis.</p>
