              <li>But--during these same 200-400 years--Amalekites were welcomed into Israel as immigrants! (See the discussion on 2 Sam 1 below). <strong>There was a period of 'amnesty' and 'clemency' unparalleled in ancient history up to this time</strong>. <strong>God gave the individuals within the nation <em>centuries</em> to 'get out'</strong> (or maybe even time to reform the nation; it is <em>possible</em> that this judgment pronouncement was conditional without being stated so explicitly, as was the case with Nineveh in Jonah 3.4 and as embedded in the general principle of Jer 26.1-6 and Jer 18.7-8: "<em>At one moment I might speak concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom to uproot, to pull down, or <strong>to destroy it</strong>; 8 <strong>if that nation against which I have spoken turns from its evil, I will relent concerning the calamity I planned to bring on it</strong>.</em> ") As with the vast majority of the Canaanite population, the sensible Amalekites would have migrated somewhere else. All that would have been left at the time of Saul would have been a leadership raised and steeped in anti-Israel violence and hatred. This is NOT some innocent nation, protecting its homeland from an invading and greedy people. This is the sins of the fathers being <em>continued by</em> their children.<br><br></li>
              <li>It is only after 200-400 years of opportunity and influences to change, and after 200-400 years of continued (and actually escalating) violence against Israel (who had not even been sanctioned or ordered to occupy Amalekite territory!), that God decides to execute the judgment given earlier.<br><br></li>
              <li>The execution of the king of the Amalekites by Samuel (in 1 Samuel 15) shows that the judgment on the Amalekites was not SOLELY due to the ancient, initial savagery against Israel, </li>

              their forefathers</em></strong>--oppressing and attacking Israel
              for between 200 and 400 years (Judges 3,6,7, 10) and actually even
              AFTER the 'annihilation' of the main group of Amalekites (1 Sam
              30).</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>But--during these same 200-400 years--Amalekites were welcomed
              into Israel as immigrants! (See the discussion on 2 Sam 1
              below). <strong>There was a period of 'amnesty' and 'clemency'
              unparalleled in ancient history up to this
              time</strong>. <strong>God gave the individuals within the
              nation <em>centuries</em> to 'get out'</strong> (or
              maybe even time to reform the nation; it
              is <em>possible</em> that this judgment pronouncement was
              conditional without being stated so explicitly, as was the case
              with Nineveh in Jonah 3.4 and as embedded in the general principle
              of Jer 26.1-6 and Jer 18.7-8: "<em>At one moment I might speak
              concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom to uproot, to pull
              down, or <strong>to destroy it</strong>; 8 <strong>if
              that nation against which I have spoken turns from its evil, I will
              relent concerning the calamity I planned to bring on
              it</strong>.</em> ") As with the vast majority of the
              Canaanite population, the sensible Amalekites would have migrated
              somewhere else. All that would have been left at the time of Saul
              would have been a leadership raised and steeped in anti-Israel
              violence and hatred. This is NOT some innocent nation, protecting
              its homeland from an invading and greedy people. This is the sins
              of the fathers being <em>continued by</em> their
              children.<br> <br></li>
              <li>It is only after 200-400 years of opportunity and influences to
              change, and after 200-400 years of continued (and actually
              escalating) violence against Israel (who had not even been
              sanctioned or ordered to occupy Amalekite territory!), that God
              decides to execute the judgment given earlier.<br> <br></li>
              <li>The execution of the king of the Amalekites by Samuel (in 1
              Samuel 15) shows that the judgment on the Amalekites was not SOLELY
              due to the ancient, initial savagery against Israel, </li>

              <p>my qns is still unanswered. can you or anyone come up with a theory, equation and experiments that god exists. if it is concurred by the physicists, the world will accept that god exists.  Warped theories on god existence is just not good enough. you have to come out with a theory that is supported by an equation, cos equation is the language of physics.

I also want to put this question to bed once and for all. so the debate continues..................until someone can put out the equation and proven to be right by physicists.</p>
