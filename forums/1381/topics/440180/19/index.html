                  humans? why shift attention to humans when who is the omnipotent

                  of course humans got limitation, are you saying the same for god

              <p>Come on. You know what I am talking about. The human analogy are examples explaining our understanding of human beings using language and our limitations as human beings. Our physical limitations.</p>
              <p>I already answered your question.If such a question can be answered in such definitive answer, we would already have the answer already. Right ? Comprende ? Kapish ?</p>
              <p>Lets say I entertain your question with a definite answer of NO. And then what ? What u going to say ? Are u going to say that an Omnipotent Omniscience being can fail ? So if so.. exaplain. And then we will go round and round on the definition of Omnipotent or Omniscience. You get it ?</p>
              <p>I don't see you attempting to explain anything or discuss ANY of the philosophers argument  in WiKiLink.</p>
              <p>And great thinkers of course include Stephen Hawkings and Buddha. But did they attempt to answer such a question themselves ?So what is your point ? Are u anywhere near these people ? Just because I did not name EVERY SINGLE great thinker does not mean I do not acknowledge thier existence right ? Did u see my replay with "AND MANY MORE".</p>
              <p>So where do you stand in terms of intellect as compared to these great thinkers ?No where close, because you cant even understand what they are talking about when I gave you the human examples. AND the link to read.</p>
              <p>You talk so much about it being a paradox and you can only come up with Stephen Hawkings and Buddha. Please man.</p>
              <p>Yes.. good that you dont waste your reply. So I take it you wont post here anymore ?</p>
              <p>Just give it up. The more you insist on this charade, will only expose yourself of your ignorance.Well, its no longer ignorance.. its just plain dense. Like a rock. That needs to be hammered... hammered and hammered until it breaks.</p>
              <p>You know, this is not the first time someone asked this question, and people who does and then insist on a simple answer without taking into account the reasonings of the great minds before them, really exposes thier own stupidity. I must thank you because you are giving me the opportunity to refine and streangthen my answers over n over n over again. While you all just ask the same stupid question over n over again.</p>

              <p>I just thought of an even better example.</p>
              <p>Consider this.</p>
              <p>Its like the irresistable force meets immovable object. You know that these are two logically absurb things and that these two definitions cannot exist in real space and time TOGETHER. Not to mention they are just self packaging of words</p>
              <p>So consider that the definition of Omnipotent does not include the ability to do the logically absurd. E.g Creating something so big that he himself cannot lift. You are already inhibiting the very nature the words you intend to express. It becomes a non-question. And the task of doing something logically impossible is no longer a task at all. Its just like you said it, logically impossible. Its like another self packaging of words with inhibitions in them.</p>
              <p>Now consider that this Omnipotent being can do the logicall impossible. okay.</p>
              <p>So now he can create something he cannot lift..... and then just lift it. Because he already CAN do the logically impossible.</p>
              <p>So what now ?</p>
              <p>This is one of the most simplest explaination I can give without going down into the philosphical argument of definitions, premises and what nots of the likes of Decartes or Ludwig.</p>
              <p>Now if you cannot understand this example. I am afraid you will not be able to understand the WikiLink. And thus I can understand why you think you are smart.</p>

              Many scientists can agree and still be wrong. The history of science is littered with many errors and wrong conclusions. That is why science text books are constantly out of date and in need of revision. Not so with the Bible.
