              <p>Of course I dont care. Do I look like I know Rony Tan or AWARE or really give a damn on what they do ? The authorities seem to have taken action, so why do I need to worry ? I don't go around telling other peoples religion is bad and that they are going to hell did I ? I didn't. Nor do I evangelise.</p>
              <p>What AWARE does is AWARE's problem, and honestly, I dont even know what is AWARE doing there until you people mentioned AWARE in the forumes about a year ago or so.</p>
              <p>Its obvious that there are people who took offence in whatever they did or going to do , but what is it got to do with me ?</p>
