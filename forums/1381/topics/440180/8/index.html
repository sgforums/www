              <p>You really think "they preach prosperity gospel for very good reasons found in the bible"? just days ago you said " I just don't understand how christian pastors can preach to their members to give 10%". You understand what the mega churches are doing?</p>

              <p>bags are for passing around, during service when offering is part of the worship where christians shows our commitment to the cause of the church by offering money.  Boxes are to be put there for those who are willing. In my church, non christians are not required to participate in the offering, just pass the bags around.</p>

              <p>Yes I dont understand them, but I dont judge them and I've heard how they justify their prosperity gospel with good verses in the bible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've been there and listened to their point of view, and I think it's reasonable. Have you even tried to understand their point of view before your accusations?</p>

              <p>But I guess there'll always be a certain amount of peer pressure (even among adults) to put in money. This is human nature and you cannot deny it. To pass the bags around when everyone's there, there's peer pressure. Best way is still learn from the temples - to put the boxes there and let anyone give if they want to.</p>
              <p>There's no pressure or compulsion</p>

              <p>So you support megachurches or not?</p>
              <p>A "normal" church has no plan, it grows or doesn't grow on the funds it receives or doesn't receive, ie God's plan.</p>
              <p>Megachurches have a plan for how much percentage of your income to take, before you even step into your church. A plan for how much many of you to recruit, and how many more each of you should recruit.</p>

              <p>A "normal" or small church has plans. You say they have no plan because maybe you are not in the leadership. If you go to any church's leaders meeting, it's full of planning and concepts. EVERY organisation needs planning....You sound abit ignorant on this</p>

              <p>No you don't have to agree with me and neither do megachurches members and I have to agree with you.</p>
              <p>However think about it. They reason that since God is good and is the provider, every christian should prosper if they follow in his ways. I find that it is quite in line with biblical teachings. Prosper materially, prosper spiritually.</p>
              <p>Just curious, what about prosperity gospel do you find "strange"?</p>

              <p>bags are for passing around, during service when offering is

              <p>I think the same goes to all churches, they don't expect non christians to participate.    As usual in catholic and christian churches bags are passed around.</p>

              <p>Yes I dont understand them, but I dont judge them and I've heard

              <p>I've been there and listened to their point of view, and I think
              it's reasonable. Have you even tried to understand their point of
