              <p>When the law fails and all avenue of justice have been exhausted. Personally ? I believe in vigilante justice.</p>
              <p>Imagine you got an asshole in town, going around calling all those that believe in bigamy stupid fools, ignorant and that the human species is into polygamy.  Now the town folks are loving and compassionate people. N it is exactly because they are compassionate and loving that betrays thier weakness when the asshole comes back again and starts to burn thier village and raping thier wives.</p>
              <p>Should I wallk up to him and stab him in the neck with a pencil ? Sure. Of course. Why not ? Because when you got people that bullies the weak but scared of the real bullies, the ordinary peace loving folks gotta do something about that. And believe or not, vigilante justice happens more than you think.</p>

              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 17px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">But I see a lot of instances of "vigilante" in the bible. For example, in the bible, it records that the "jewish people of god" were vigilantes when they claimed that "god spoke to them to annihilate amalek babies, women and children" because they were too "sinful".</p>

              <p>When the law fails and all avenue of justice have been
              exhausted. Personally ? I believe in vigilante justice.</p>
              <p>Imagine you got an asshole in town, going around calling all
              those that believe in bigamy stupid fools, ignorant and that the
              human species is into polygamy.  Now the town folks are loving
              and compassionate people. N it is exactly because they are
              compassionate and loving that betrays thier weakness when the
              asshole comes back again and starts to burn thier village and
              raping thier wives.</p>
              <p>Should I wallk up to him and stab him in the neck with a pencil
              ? Sure. Of course. Why not ? Because when you got people that
              bullies the weak but scared of the real bullies, the ordinary peace
              loving folks gotta do something about that. And believe or not,
              vigilante justice happens more than you think.</p>

You will be in deep trouble if you take justice into your own hands! The civilised and proper way is to go to the police today, not to use vigilante justice and take justice into your own hands!!

              <p>The question is, who has the right to take a life? And since God is the One who created us and gave us life, He also has the sovereign right to take it from us. Yet the Bible does not teach a capricious God, but one who is love, merciful, compassionate, just, holy etc etc.</p>
