              <p>1. Vigilante justice on babies and children too? Hmm
                      thats what the Exodus book recorded. The "people of god" metted
                      their own justice on the babies and children.</p>
              <p>2. So you do agree that it is ok to kill because
                      someone is sinful?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. "<span style="font-size: 15px;">Should I wallk up to
                      him and stab him in the neck with a pencil ? Sure. Of course." ---
                      Oh no. You will be in deep trouble if you take justice into your
                      own hands! The civilised and proper way is to go to the police
                      today, not to use vigilante justice and take justice into your own
                      hands!! How warped is your thinking?</span></p>

              <p>First of all,its assuming that all legal and authorative remedies have been exhausted and yes. Lets say we are peace loving compassionate people. N you know how my story goes.. yada yada yada.. and they come back again.. and again.. and again.</p>
              <p>Just because another 'sins' does not mean we have to kill. Like that we have to kill everyone because we are all sinners. So to answer your question on that part 2. NO.</p>
              <p>Like I said already, there will be those that wont br violent, but there are those that believe that enough is enough and with a different interpretation to the words.</p>
              <p>Vigilante justice happens when the law fails and that all have failed and a combination of emotions and what nots force a person to go down in a blaze of glory</p>
              <p>Your question is so broad but the answers seem simple. Not to mention just quoting some bible verses and asking me on vigilantism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I might as well ask you, if you have a gun in your hand, will u save the bus full of nuns and children, or just let the terrorist blow it up because you are a non-violent person. Either question is one of morality and ethics too.And religion such as Christianity will also affect the manner you make your choice. Such philosophy have been debated since time immemorial. </p>

              <p>I was specifically referring to babies, children and defenseless old people.</p>

              <p>The terrorist is an adult who who has premeditated to kill and harm. Of course it is right to stop him from taking OTHER innocent lives.</p>

                  Timna
                  (Gen 36:12) and became a "clan" or "chief" in the tribe of

                  against Israel, <strong>but also included PRESENT atrocities as well</strong>.

              destruction of Amalek (Num 24.20). Moab and Midian were closes
              allies of Amalek throughout biblical history, and this prophesy
              would have been well known by the leadership of Amalek before they
              started the next couple of centuries of oppression and violence
              against Israel. [That Balaam was a famous prophet in this area has

              <strong>Amalek <em>continues the behavior of their
              forefathers</em></strong>--oppressing and attacking Israel for
              between 200 and 400 years (Judges 3,6,7, 10) and actually even
              AFTER the 'annihilation' of the main group of Amalekites (1 Sam

              <ul style="margin-top: 0in;">
              <li><span>But--during these same 200-400 years--Amalekites
              were welcomed into Israel as immigrants! (See the discussion on 2
              Sam 1 below). <strong>There was a period of 'amnesty' and
              'clemency' unparalleled in ancient history up to this
              time</strong>. <strong>God gave the individuals within the
              nation <em>centuries</em> to 'get out'</strong> (or maybe even
              time to reform the nation; it is <em>possible</em> that this
              judgment pronouncement was conditional without being stated so
              explicitly, as was the case with Nineveh in Jonah 3.4 and as
              embedded in the general principle of Jer 26.1-6 and Jer 18.7-8:
              "</span><em><span>At one moment I might speak concerning a nation
              or concerning a kingdom to uproot, to pull down, or <strong>to
              destroy it</strong>; 8 <strong>if that nation against which I have
              spoken turns from its evil, I will relent concerning the calamity I
              planned to bring on it</strong>.</span></em> <span>") As with the
              vast majority of the Canaanite population, the sensible Amalekites
              would have migrated somewhere else. All that would have been left
              at the time of Saul would have been a leadership raised and steeped
              in anti-Israel violence and hatred. This is NOT some innocent
              nation, protecting its homeland from an invading and greedy people.
              This is the sins of the fathers being <em>continued by</em> their children.<br> <br></span></li>
              <li>It is only after 200-400 years of opportunity and
              influences to change, and after 200-400 years of continued (and
              actually escalating) violence against Israel (who had not even been
              sanctioned or ordered to occupy Amalekite territory!), that God
              decides to execute the judgment given earlier.<br> <br></li>
              <li>The execution of the king of the Amalekites by Samuel
              (in 1 Samuel 15) shows that the judgment on the Amalekites was not
              SOLELY due to the ancient, initial savagery against Israel,
              <strong>but also included PRESENT atrocities as well</strong>. In
              fact, the initial atrocity is not mentioned at all in this
              judgment.</li>

              <p>Well, at least I got some sort of source. How about u ?I am not taunting you. You are the one here saying the Amalekites are innocent. But I pointed to you some historical facts digged up by Archeology. Not to mention our understanding of Nomadic tribes in the region. Unlesss you say that they are all wrong. These people never existed, and that there are no violent nomadic tribes roaming the middle east and central asia, then I stand by what I said.</p>
              <p>Like I said, I look at the BIGGER picture. You are the one here telling it never happened.. and that they were innocent. So again, until you have some form of credible archelogical source to prove it, I might as well say that you are being one-sided right ?</p>
