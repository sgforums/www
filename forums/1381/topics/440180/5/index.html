              <p>the Kong hee's case is not new .  Before the threadstarter posted the topic to find out about the progress of the case, both christians and non christians are already aware of it.  Why people don't bring up other church but CHC?  Think about it.</p>
              <p>Even christians in the mainstream churches are not agreeable to the way Kong Hee preach or ask for money.    <strong>Christians who bother to be on the right track with God will not agree with his way, they will not take it that people especially non christians  bring up this case to make fun of the church and religion.  </strong> I am sure God is not happy about the way Kong Yee is doing it.     </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>My point is that until Kong Yee is proven guilty, we should give him the benefit of doubt that the allegations against him are wrong, and lets don't paint him black, or worse, call the people stupid for being conned, or even worse, make fun of the religion.</p>
              <p>All religious organizations are governed under the charity act, especially with regards to the office bearers, the collection and use of fund. CHC, and some churches have grown very big, handling millions of dollars, and the use of these money has brought up great concerns, that is one reason why other churches, who handle little money, are not under lime light.</p>
              <p>I am not from CHC and I do not fully agree with some of the theology and doctrines preached. The way I view this case, to a fellow human being, he is guilty when he is proven guilty by the law; to non christians, we assure you that christians and christians organizations are still bound by secular law, in addition to what God has demanded; to the christian haters, all christians are guilty of something until proven otherwise.</p>

              Yes, I think that should be the gist of the discussion. The effects and consequences. Whether such theology is in line with what the bible intends to reflect upon.

              I disapprove of the prosperity theory too. But such preachings tend to attract more people because of the supposedly tangible proof of such 'blessings'. And when once promises wealth AND eternal salvation, it is like a win win have the cake and eat it too kind of situation. And most of the time, the main prosperity teaching centres on a few misinterpreated preachings in the bible.

              <p>I fully agree with you on the part of prosperity theory. There is never the need to sell the only house christians have to offer to the church, rich member can sell one of their many houses to offer to the church for specific purposes. And most importantly, there should never be an expectation for return on the part of God.</p>
              <p>God cannot be bribed, that is why prosperity theory is not fully in line with the Bible.</p>

              <p>If he is asking for money from the church to donate to the poor, victims of natural disaster and other charity, I support.    </p>
              <p>For this action of his, it is without doubt people would say he is abusing God.   God will deal with him if there is no repentence when the time comes.    </p>
              <p>The prosperity theory is encouraging greed.   The other teaching of his I cannot accept is his belief in being rich as christians.    He told his people that Christians to be rich to preach the gospel so it will convince the non believers.   Jesus was not rich when he preached on earth.   The disciplines of Jesus were not rich, consisted fisherman and so on.    I am lost what to describe his misrepresentation of the doctrine, theory, belief or whatever one thinks of it.    In summary, Kong Hee creates his own brand for christianity.</p>
              <p>It is sad for the Christians , especially the newly converted ones in his church to absorb wrong teaching.        </p>
