              </p><p class="MsoNormal">I went to the 5pm CHC Service last Saturday. What did the
              CHC members learn during this session. My report:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Service started of with worship songs. A semi-professional
              rock band played Christian rock in karayoke style.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">A guitar player/singer led most of the songs. While singing
              his face went into a grin which I can only imitate when sitting on the toilet,
              trying to squeeze out last night’s curry. In short, he meant serious business.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The lead female singer, who was admittedly quite hot and has
              a very good voice, mixed singing with “speaking in tongues” to heat up the
              atmosphere.  And it worked. In no time,
              95% of the congregation had this weird expression in their faces, eyes closed,
              hands up, some of them even crying.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I wonder what they would think if they saw themselves. Very
              awkward and very uncomfortable indeed. People have been strapped up, arms on
              their back for less. The songs were no different sounded the same as last week,
              supported by the fact that everybody seemed to know all the words by heart.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">What was Kong Hee’s message to his troops?<br> <br> Message 1: Tithing is not enough – Offering is in order.<br> In short,  “Almost all of us are tithing
              10%”. The “almost” being a little slap in the face of the culprits not
              performing their CHC duties. I wonder if they felt it as such. “The tithing is
              needed for the ministries of the church. Yet, Kong Hee continued, “In order to
              seed, and later on reap the rewards, we must give more than the 10%. Offerings
              are in order.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">To prove he is right, he violated a verse from 1 Kings,
              where a poor lady is giving precious water, and her last flower and oil to
              Elijah…The Lord would ensure that the flower bucket will never run empty.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Translated by Kong Hee: “If you give your last penny, your
              bank account will never run dry” A lady who offered 1,700 some SGD last time,
              received the Lords blessing. The blessing was: Her grandfather died ??? (some
              blessing), and the family decided to sell the house, leaving her with 400kSGD.
              Praise the Lord. I wonder how the grandfather feels about this blessing when
              looking down?.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I learned very quickly that there is no point in having a
              mature discussion on tithing with CHC members. Their minds have been
              programmed. For those CHC members with still a little bit of rational left, I
              suggest to google “tithing in the bible”. Without going into detail, they will
              find that tithing in the OT was indeed required as the church played the role
              of provider of material as well as spiritual health. Tithe can be compared to
              paying the IRAS taxes today. The tithing, which was usually not money but
              grain, fruits, … was used to support society. Of the tithes going to CHC very
              little (7%) returns to the community, as such, whatever money you give Kong
              Hee, it is not the tithing as referred to in the Bible. In addition, you will
              find the word tithing only 3 times in the NT. And in all 3 cases, it does not
              mean, giving money. Go look it up – or better – ask your Cell group leader to
              explain.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Message 2:<br> SOT (I assume this is the 8 months bible school program) needs new blood. 2
              people, a obviously nervous lady, and a more confident young fellow, testified
              how great SOT has been for them. The major achievement of the lady is: She is
              no longer shy to talk in public, proving by answering prepared questions in
              front of the 7,500 gathered. Whether she really is successful in her business
              as claimed, was not detailed. She does manage her time better, similar to I
              guess most of the mother’s in Singapore.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">A positive surprise was Dr. Robi Sonderegger. I assume that
              he is a real PhD, unlike KH’s online purchased honorary PhD. Robi actually had
              the guts, and the wits, to stand in front of the complete <br> <br> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">CHC congregation to tell them following:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">“Let’s not build yet another church” – “Let’s stop seeding
              in order to receive for ourselves” – “Let’s start giving without expecting
              return to family, friends and enemies alike” – Let’s spend the money on the
              poor. <br> <br> He gave a very colourful African story to support his message.  “WHY DO WHITE PEOPLE ALWAYS WANT TO RECEIVE”,
              said the primitive tribal head, and in my head it echoed: 30-60-100FOLD.<br> <br> STOP SEEDING TO RECEIVE MONEY FOR YOURSELF!!!! ENSURE THAT YOUR INVESTMENT IS
              USED TO BENEFIT THE POOR AND NEEDY! STOP GIVING MONEY TO A RICH CHURCH WHO DOES
              NOT SPEND IT ON THE NEEDY.<br> All loud and clear, yet I wonder if the CHC members understand what this means
              for their tithing practices.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Robi, Good job!!!</p>

              <p>So is atheism. People like Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris make lots of money writing against Christianity without any regard for truth. But such is the nature of their polemical writings. All they need to do is to publish their rantings rehashing old canards against the Christian faith that have long been refuted or addressed by Christian apologists. But then again, as long as there's money to be made out of attacking Christianity, who cares!</p>

              comes from the Greek á¼�κκλησÎ¯α

              to the teachings of Kong Hee, a church is not a building, a church is
              not a meeting place, a church is not an organization, a church is not
              a denomination. The totality of all believers in Christ are the “Body

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">A
              church must preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. A church must teach
              how to be good Christians. Thousand of books, blogs etc have been
              written on this topic but it essence it means: Following the example
              of Christ in ANY circumstances.<br></span></p>

              that every 4 seconds, adding up to 20,000 per day, children die of

              condo's, wears 500k SGD range watches, buys businesses, wears

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">CHC

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">CHC
              has has promoted “self” to play the lead role during services and
              church activities while God has been degraded to the bench and is
              only required on demand. “Let's give the Lord a clap!!!”</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">CHC
              paints a picture of God as loan shark requiring CHC members to pay
              money to Kong Hee and his pet projects or otherwise their lives will
              not be blessed with financial wealth or good health. Kong Hee seems
              to have forgotten <span lang="en-US">to
              care for the poor, the widows, the orphans, even within his own club,
              let alone the  outside community</span><span lang="en-US"><span style="background: transparent;">. </span></span><span lang="en-US">Living
              up to his reputation as business man, Kong Hee appears to be more
              like a CEO of a Top Fortune 100 company, including the benefit
              package any CEO is entitled to. </span>Meanwhile,
              many of the CHC members continue to struggle paying the bills. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Did
              Christ come, live, and die so that CHC members can buy a condo, drive
              a car, or have financial security? I don't think so!!! </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">What
              is happening in CHC is a repetition of the practices of the early
              Catholic clergy right before the protestant reformation. The money
              raised to provide for the poor and needy added only to the wealth of
              greedy Cardinals and Bishops, and build the great (today empty)
              cathedrals and churches in Europe.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I
              welcome Kong Hee to show us where it says in the scriptures a church
              should preach prosperity, wealth, health. I believe that Kong Hee is
              well aware that the gospel he is preaching has been invented in the
              US and is nothing more than a twisting of scriptures to meet the
              American Dream of <strong>individualism, materialism, </strong>and
              <strong>greed</strong>. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">God
              calls the faithful into a community not <strong>individualism</strong>, so THIS
              IS WHAT A CHURCH SHOULD DO.  Christ enjoins all humans to love one
              another (John 13:34). This includes all and not just CHC members. I
              keep hearing things like “CHC is the best church”, or “Only in
              CHC you will find ...” are only boosting “Self”. <br><br>Christ
              has shown us the path AWAY from <strong>materialism</strong>. “lay up for
              yourselves treasurers in heaven…” (Matthew 6:21). SO THIS IS WHAT
              A CHURCH SHOULD DO. 30-60-100 fold promises to gain worldly riches
              are not what the scriptures are telling us.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Jesus
              continuously warns us for <strong>Greed</strong>. Tells us to be content. “Take
              care! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; for one’s life
              does not consist in the abundance of possession (Luke 12:15, NRSV).”
              SO THIS IS WHAT A CHURCH SHOULD DO.<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">What
              is fundamentally wrong with the CHC teachings?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I
              have not been able to detect a gospel, only a lack of. CHC seems to
              preach a God who is either a “vending machine” or “extortionist,”
              requiring our faith and money as currency for a prosperous life. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">God
              is not worshipped out of love nor respect. God is praised only
              because CHC members expect something in return. “Give the Lord a
              clap!”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">WHAT
              A CHURCH SHOULD DO is to teach the immutability of God. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">In
              opposite, CHC teaches people that tithing and offering is the ONLY
              path in order to get something from God. CHC is making the bottom
              line all about money. This smothers any fruitful teaching or
              discussions with regards to Grace vs. Works, which is WHAT SHOULD BE
              DONE BY A CHURCH to strengthen the spiritual health of Christians.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">CHC
              equals being rich or having good health, to having great faith. The
              early church fathers, who laid the foundation of all Christian
              churches today, lived in poverty and died as slaves.  Did they lack
              great faith? Would they have escaped slavery if they had enough
              faith? If they had tithed and offered? Doesn't this desecrate the
              memory of our early church fathers?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Realistically,
              the CHC teachings are only targeting at increasing the wealth of Kong
              Hee and a selected few. In CHC the majority of the members are
              financially “less-fortunate” than the “fortunate” Kong Hee.
              Otherwise Kong Hee would not bother to emotionally claim that the
              unemployed, the pensioners, the students, ...all must give with tears
              running down face and all.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">We
              find the same situation in many societies where the wealth of
              selected “fortunate” few is built upon exploiting the majority of
              “less-fortunates”. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">In
              order to get even more “fortunate”, the “fortunates” must
              invite a scheme to take money from the “less-fortunates”. It is
              quite convenient to have a group of genuine yet “less-fortunate”
              Christian believers and manipulate or indoctrinate a methodology to
              take more money “In the name of Christ”. <br><br>Kong Hee repeats
              every week: “If you give me your money, I will invest it for you in
              “good works”, and if you are faithful enough, you will get a big
              reward.<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">To
              feed the greed of the “fortunates”, it is no surprise that
              pursuit of material gain “ARISE and BUILD” has become target
              number one in CHC. <br>I keep wondering where CHC members get the
              notion that they are “ENTITLED” to great wealth and good health. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">One
              could make a case for CHC if the majority of the income would be used
              to help the poor, to help the needy, to help the orphans, to help the
              sick. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Sadly
              this is not the case. CHC could have a huge positive impact on

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">“<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">What a church should do?” That's big question. Answer is not that difficult but little bit lengthy...</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Church” comes from the Greek á¼�κκλησÎ¯α (ekklÄ“siÄ�). In French a church is still called “l' Eglise” Basically it means “Assembly”.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">In the NT it is used in 2 different ways:</span></p>
              <ol>
              <li>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The Body of Christ. This is the global church made up of all Christians around the world</span></p>
              </li>
              </ol><ol>
              <li>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">A local group of believers: This is the local representation of the global church</span></p>
              </li>
              </ol>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">In accordance to God's plan, the purpose of the church can be summarized to 2 main objectives:</span></p>
              <ol>
              <li>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Spread Christianity to non-believers</span></p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Edify the members of the church</span></p>
              </li>
              </ol>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Opposite to the teachings of Kong Hee, a church is not a building, a church is not a meeting place, a church is not an organization, a church is not a denomination. The totality of all believers in Christ are the “Body of Christ”.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">So how to spread Christianity and edify (read “look after the SPIRITUAL health of...”) the Christians?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">A church must preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. A church must teach how to be good Christians. Thousand of books, blogs etc have been written on this topic but it essence it means: Following the example of Christ in ANY circumstances.<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">An easy cross check is to ask oneself the question:<br>What did Jesus do?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">What would Jesus do?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">What would Jesus say?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">What did Jesus do when he saw what the Pharisees did to the temple?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">What would Jesus do or say when he would join a CHC service?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">What would Jesus say about millions of dollars in the Church bank while the poor and needy are being short-changed?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">What would Jesus have to say about a church leader who calls himself a business man?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Knowing that every 4 seconds, adding up to 20,000 per day, children die of malnutrition, what would Jesus say about a leader who owns multiple condo's, wears 500k SGD range watches, buys businesses, wears designer clothes,...?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">What would Jesus have to say to a leader who claims “Jesus was financially rich”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Jesus Christ thought us charity, selflessness, liberation, and a focused attention on God.<br>THIS IS WHAT A CHURCH SHOULD TEACH.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">CHC is teaching a Gospel of greed, selfishness, oppression, ... a focused attention on the self.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">CHC has has promoted “self” to play the lead role during services and church activities while God has been degraded to the bench and is only required on demand. “Let's give the Lord a clap!!!”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">CHC paints a picture of God as loan shark requiring CHC members to pay money to Kong Hee and his pet projects or otherwise their lives will not be blessed with financial wealth or good health. Kong Hee seems to have forgotten <span>to care for the poor, the widows, the orphans, even within his own club, let alone the outside community</span><span><span style="background: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%;">.</span></span> <span>Living up to his reputation as business man, Kong Hee appears to be more like a CEO of a Top Fortune 100 company, including the benefit package any CEO is entitled to.</span> Meanwhile, many of the CHC members continue to struggle paying the bills.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Did Christ come, live, and die so that CHC members can buy a condo, drive a car, or have financial security? I don't think so!!!</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">What is happening in CHC is a repetition of the practices of the early Catholic clergy right before the protestant reformation. The money raised to provide for the poor and needy added only to the wealth of greedy Cardinals and Bishops, and build the great (today empty) cathedrals and churches in Europe.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I welcome Kong Hee to show us where it says in the scriptures a church should preach prosperity, wealth, health. I believe that Kong Hee is well aware that the gospel he is preaching has been invented in the US and is nothing more than a twisting of scriptures to meet the American Dream of <strong>individualism, materialism,</strong> and <strong>greed</strong>.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">God calls the faithful into a community not <strong>individualism</strong>, so THIS IS WHAT A CHURCH SHOULD DO. Christ enjoins all humans to love one another (John 13:34). This includes all and not just CHC members. I keep hearing things like “CHC is the best church”, or “Only in CHC you will find ...” are only boosting “Self”.<br><br>Christ has shown us the path AWAY from <strong>materialism</strong>. “lay up for yourselves treasurers in heaven…” (Matthew 6:21). SO THIS IS WHAT A CHURCH SHOULD DO. 30-60-100 fold promises to gain worldly riches are not what the scriptures are telling us.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Jesus continuously warns us for <strong>Greed</strong>. Tells us to be content. “Take care! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of possession (Luke 12:15, NRSV).” SO THIS IS WHAT A CHURCH SHOULD DO.<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">What is fundamentally wrong with the CHC teachings?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I have not been able to detect a gospel, only a lack of. CHC seems to preach a God who is either a “vending machine” or “extortionist,” requiring our faith and money as currency for a prosperous life.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">God is not worshipped out of love nor respect. God is praised only because CHC members expect something in return. “Give the Lord a clap!”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">WHAT A CHURCH SHOULD DO is to teach the immutability of God.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">In opposite, CHC teaches people that tithing and offering is the ONLY path in order to get something from God. CHC is making the bottom line all about money. This smothers any fruitful teaching or discussions with regards to Grace vs. Works, which is WHAT SHOULD BE DONE BY A CHURCH to strengthen the spiritual health of Christians.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">CHC equals being rich or having good health, to having great faith. The early church fathers, who laid the foundation of all Christian churches today, lived in poverty and died as slaves. Did they lack great faith? Would they have escaped slavery if they had enough faith? If they had tithed and offered? Doesn't this desecrate the memory of our early church fathers?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Realistically, the CHC teachings are only targeting at increasing the wealth of Kong Hee and a selected few. In CHC the majority of the members are financially “less-fortunate” than the “fortunate” Kong Hee. Otherwise Kong Hee would not bother to emotionally claim that the unemployed, the pensioners, the students, ...all must give with tears running down face and all.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">We find the same situation in many societies where the wealth of selected “fortunate” few is built upon exploiting the majority of “less-fortunates”.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">In order to get even more “fortunate”, the “fortunates” must invite a scheme to take money from the “less-fortunates”. It is quite convenient to have a group of genuine yet “less-fortunate” Christian believers and manipulate or indoctrinate a methodology to take more money “In the name of Christ”.<br><br>Kong Hee repeats every week: “If you give me your money, I will invest it for you in “good works”, and if you are faithful enough, you will get a big reward.<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">To feed the greed of the “fortunates”, it is no surprise that pursuit of material gain “ARISE and BUILD” has become target number one in CHC.<br>I keep wondering where CHC members get the notion that they are “ENTITLED” to great wealth and good health.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">One could make a case for CHC if the majority of the income would be used to help the poor, to help the needy, to help the orphans, to help the sick.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Sadly this is not the case. CHC could have a huge positive impact on society yet they choose not to</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Do CHC members realize that with all the money available, actually could make a huge difference in helping the poor and needy?

              <p>Should believers attend church?</p>
              <p>For Christians, in obedience to the scriptures, to it is important to attend Church with fellow Christians to strengthen the spiritual well-being. A relationship with God automatically includes the fellowship with other Christians. </p>
              <p>With reference to BroInChrist's comment, the institutional malaise in many churches does not make an assembly of genuine Christians easy. Many scriptures warn for false teachers. One of my favorite you find in Deuteronomy: <br><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Helvetica, serif; text-align: justify; text-indent: 39px;"><br>“If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you and gives you a sign or a wonder, 2 and the sign or the wonder comes true, concerning which he spoke to you, saying, ‘Let us go after other gods (whom you have not known) and let us serve them,’ 3 you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams; for the LORD your God is testing you to find out if you love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul. 4 You shall follow the LORD your God and fear Him; and you shall keep His commandments, listen to His voice, serve Him, and cling to Him.</span></p>
              <p>It is the false teachers, and "their fruits" which cause many people to turn away from Faith.</p>
              <p>Paul describes in various letters how a true church should act. His letters to the Corinthians, where Paul is addressing several moral issues as well as divisions that had formed, proclaiming themselves followers of Christ, very much apply to CHC, including the rebuking of speaking in tongues.</p>
              <p>With reference to today's Mega-churches. There is one common denominator. All Mega churches, without any exception, have a rich Pastor living la vida loco, and a flock poor in spirit and financials. Coincidence?</p>

              <p>That depends on what you mean by "churches". In the NT, churches refer to the people of God, so the question of whether there is a need to have churches (people of God) seems rather odd. Or perhaps you were referring to churches as buildings?

              <p>Yes, believers should never forsake the assembly of saints for mutual edification. The institutional malaise I was referring to was that many churches are being treated as organisations (even corporations!), and as such will suffer the faults of such entities. And the bigger they are, the more resources (money, time, staff) are needed to keep the institutional machinery going.</p>
              <p>But like I mentioned earlier, the mega churches differ from others only in terms of scale, but the mindsets are pretty much the same, if I may say so. With the large churches (and many small churches are trying to get large), pastors become detached from the people, and additional layers of staff are put between the pastors and the flock. I remember reading Lawrence Khong's book years ago on the Cell Church, where he says he has no time for the sheep so he only meets with zone pastors to get feedback about the sheep. No time for the sheep? It's sad to read that. He ends up becoming a GM or CEO so that people look to him for leadership and direction (shouldn't we be looking to Jesus as Chief Shepherd as in 1 Pet 5:4?). It's no wonder that some churches even use the familiar reasoning that we must pay pastors the kind of salaries that they forgone had they been working professionally as lawyers or businessmen etc etc. </p>

              <p>The NT teaches that believers are to meet regularly to break bread (in addition to prayer, devotion to apostles' teachings, fellowship as in Acts 2:42) and to meet would presuppose a requirement for a place for that. BUT again in the NT churches are NOT places of worship. In the early church there were no dedicated buildings called churches. In fact, there is no such thing as a "worship service" in the NT! There were no order of services but there were to be orderly meetings of believers everywhere, primarily in each other's homes. Of course, the Corinthian churches were a charismatic mess, which is why Paul had to tell them to take turns to speak, and that tongues followed by interpretations etc. For Paul, chaos and confusion is not the proper setting for the edification of the saints.</p>

              <p>I wouldn't say this is a conspiracy. There are historical reasons for church buildings, but this is not the same as saying that there are Biblical reasons for church buildings. The fact is that many Christians simply accept things the way they have been for generations. Pastors, no matter what theological seminary (some would call it theological cemetery), simply can think of no other way of "doing church" than that which they have been exposed to. The same with many Christians everywhere who who not question why things are done the way they are. It's has simply been accepted as the way to do things that was handed down by those who came before.</p>
