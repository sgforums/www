              <p>From what I see, you ditched Christianity not because you knew
              enough, but because you lacked the proper foundation to handle
              objections to the faith. You show me any so-called error and I am
              sure there is always a good rebuttal. And BTW, the answer that "God
              works in mysterious ways" can be a valid answer to some questions,
              but I wouldn't bank on that as an answer to every question. If you
              can cut some slack for scientists who don't know everything, why
              can't you do the same for Christians? Double standards?</p>

              <p>I used to rebut the "errors in the bible" like how you do it when I was a fundamentalist. I believed the earth was 6ooo years old and that the bible is perfect. I believed jesus was god and that atheists all hated god.</p>
              <p>That was what I believed. I was like you.</p>
              <p>So dont even for one second think that I wasnt a "real christian". lol. Just get a reality check dude.</p>

              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>You also asked this question in the locked topic, so let me respond here.</p>
              <p>There's a very interesting study that was conducted by Daniel Dennett and Linda LaScola that interviewed pastors who had stopped believing:</p>
              <p>http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/Non-Believing-Clergy.pdf</p>
              <p>I encourage you to at least scan through it. Here's a couple of excerpts, comprising quotes from a couple of these clergymen.</p>
              <p>Darryl, the Presbyterian:</p>
              <p>“I reject the virgin birth. I reject substitutionary atonement. I reject the divinity of <br>Jesus. I reject heaven and hell in the traditional sense, and I am not alone."<br> <br>“I am a ‘Jesus Follower’ for sure.  It is arguable whether I am also a ‘Christian.’   <br>I can't imagine continuing in this work if I did not have a strong personal faith of <br>some kind. My cognitive dissonance revolves around the urge to rescue others <br>who find themselves in the same boat - and who still strongly believe in God in <br>some sense, and find Jesus a compelling religious figure.” </p>
              <p>Adam, Church of Christ:</p>
              <p>“Probably one of the most mind-opening things was listening to all these debates <br>from top people of Christianity; or believers vs. non-believers.  And I tried to do <br>the same thing: be open and listen, and use my mind and reason, I guess.  And <br>almost undeniably, even being a believer and knowing the Christian claims and <br>scripture, you know what?  This guy won in the debate.  He’s a non-believer.  <br>Why?”</p>
              <p>“I’m where I am because I need the job still.  If I had an alternative, a comfortable <br>paying job, something I was interested in doing, and a move that wouldn’t destroy <br>my family, that’s where I’d go.  Because I do feel kind of hypocritical."</p>

              <p>1. You are the one being stubborn about this. I have made it clear that non-christians are also supposed to be good people. Yes I am supposed to be a good person too.</p>
              <p>2. But if christians make bigger claims about how their god can make them righteous and good, then of course they have to prove it with bigger actions. Look at mother theresa and buddhist monks who sincerely help people. They made big claims about their gods, they show it with big actions. Now what is so wrong about my statement?</p>
              <p>You are just being stubborn and prideful.</p>

              <p>1. I think you have bragged enough about why you left the faith. Yes, I only interacted with you for two days, but along with reading your past postings, I think any reasonable person can tell why you choose to abandon the faith.</p>
              <p>2. By trying to say you were like me, it seems that you are playing the sympathy game here. Well, sorry to say, I don't think you were like me. You may claim to believe the things I stand for, but I have good reason to think that you are again patronising me. It does not seem to me evident that you were capable of defending those beliefs, seeing how your objections are old canards and so easily refuted, and how you show little knowledge of the Bible. Were you a real Christian? Well, I don't read minds. God will be the judge of that. But I can tell you that my interaction with you so far does not incline me to agree with your self-assessment of your past. Perhaps you were genuine and sincere, I can grant that, but certainly you were not equipped to handle the usual garden-variety kind of objections to the faith often employed by the village atheists.</p>
              <p>3. Are there ex-Christians? What does the Bible say? The apostle John wrote about such people, and said that such people were never really with Christ. If they were, then they would have stayed on. 1 John 2:18 says <em>"Children, it is the last hour, and just as you heard that the antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have appeared. We know from this that it is the last hour. They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us, because if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us. But they went out from us to demonstrate that all of them do not belong to us."<br></em></p>

              <p>Yes, it is likely true that you were an atheist-hater, self-righteous, prideful, simple minded. But I think little of that has changed, except the target group of hatred. I am pretty sure I am not like you though. The thing is, atheists like to drop labels like that on Christians whenever they find that they aren't doing well defending their atheistic worldviews. It's a guilt trip tactic used to save face.</p>
              <p>I think you should stop patronising religions here. My quoting the Bible is to expose your shallow claim that you are somehow a jaded Christian who has been deep in the faith and knows a lot. I think it is clear that you know little about the faith. You did not leave the faith because you knew too much. You left because your roots were not deep and you were blown about and tossed about by every wind of human philosophy.</p>

              <p>1. I said it before and I said it again. I base my assessment on what you wrote here. I never said I know you best. But surely you have written enough for any reasonable person to form an opinion.</p>
              <p>2. It is probably true that 5 years ago you were worse than me. Remember you said you were an atheist-hater, self-righteous, prideful, simple minded? I don't see myself as that. Have you really studied the Bible objectively? How come it doesn't show in your posts? And what is a neutral POV? That there is no God, no miracles, etc etc? That is your idea of neutral POV?</p>
              <p>3. Yes, I quoted a Bible verse to show you that as far as the Bible is concerned, those who left the faith never belonged to it in the first place. I did not invent this verse, it's there for you to read. You mean in your study of the Bible you never come across this verse? And please don't hide behind other religions. You don't have to prove the contents of their Scriptures to me, you just need to tell me what they said. Likewise I do not have to prove the Bible to you (since you have already set your mind not to be convinced at all) but to tell you what it says concerning this or not.</p>

              <p>3. Yes, I quoted a Bible verse to show you that as far as
              the Bible is concerned, those who left the faith never belonged to
              it in the first place. I did not invent this verse, it's there for
              you to read. You mean in your study of the Bible you never come
              across this verse? And please don't hide behind other religions.
              You don't have to prove the contents of their Scriptures to me, you
              just need to tell me what they said. Likewise I do not have to
              prove the Bible to you (since you have already set your
              mind not to be convinced at all) but to tell you what it says
              concerning this or not.</p>

              <p>Tcmc,</p>
              <p>1. I already said that you have posted a lot of things here. Anyone can form an assessment of you from what you wrote, just like how you formed your assessment of me.</p>
              <p>2. I am a sinner saved by grace. The righteousness I have is not my own, but Christ's. I am mindful not to be simple-minded, but try to be Christ-minded in thinking. I am not perfect but I see no need to admit that I am like you if I don't think I am. You clearly think that you are now no more like what you were before, you now put yourself on some high moral pedestal and insist on saying that I am like what you were.</p>
              <p>3. Again you have FAILED to define what a neutral POV is. I said it before, there is no such thing as a neutral POV. An atheist who attempts to study the Bible is already biased from the start. So is a Christian. What is required is to read widely and be aware of both sides. I am a sucker for books, and believe me when I tell you that I even read the works of my "enemies" to know how they think and what they think.</p>
              <p>4. And I have answered many of your questions. It's not me going on a monologue, rather you are just going "la la la" at what I said. The issue is not whether I am convicted by what a sacred book says, but whether did the sacred book say this or not. I don't give a hoot if you think the Bible does not convict you. I can't make the Bible convict you. But I can pretty well tell you what the Bible says about you. You don't feel any sense of conviction also not my problem. God will do the work of convicting you, not me. I just need to tell you what He has said.</p>

              <p>1. I stand by earlier assessment of you. I think there are others who would agree with me too. Let's leave it at that if you insist on disagreeing with that.</p>
              <p>2. You said I was just like you 5 years ago, which means to imply that now you are above being self-righteous etc etc. How is that not being self-righteous also? You are talking down at me while putting yourself on some high moral ground.</p>
              <p>3. Until now you still have not articulate to me what in the world is a neutral POV. What does it entail? I have spent time studying the Word of God. The Word of God must be approached on its own terms. If you reject the presuppositions of the Bible, then you are not approaching the way it is meant to be, and it is no surprise that you would FAIL to understand it. How can you claim to understand it when you failed to put yourself in its shoes? You don't tell someone that you understand him when you don't even bother to try to see things from his point of view.</p>
              <p>4. I see no point in answering your question because it is IRRELEVANT, don't you get it? Why should I answer irrelevant questions? The issue is what the text says, not whether you are convicted of it or not. The Bible says that if you left the faith then you never belong to it in the first place. The Bible either says this or it does not. Whether you feel impacted by it or not is IRRELEVANT.</p>

              <p>2. You failed to understand that you cannot understand the Bible by refusing to adopt the worldview of the Bible. Your so-called neutral POV is impossible. You are deluding yourself.</p>
              <p>3. Dude, if I ask you to attend a church service, I will not ask you to set aside who you are or cast away your atheism. Do you stop being an atheist when you step inside a church building?</p>
