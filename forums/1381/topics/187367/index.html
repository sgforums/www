Belief in God is absolutely rational. There are plenty of rational evidences to believe in God. Even science can "prove" God indirectly. Even without so called rational evidences, one can still come to a knowledge of God based on belief.</div>

The theory of evolution cannot hold water. How can something come out of nothing unless it was created? What was in the beginning then? Also the second law of thermodynamics cannot support evolution bcos all things tend to chaos. So how can something more ordered &amp; complex evolved from something less ordered &amp; simple? According to the first law of thermodynamics, the total amt of energy is constant in a given universe. So energy needs to be imparted in this case to allow evolution to take place. But where the energy come from since this universe is constant according to evolutionists?<br><br>Scientists have never been able to prove evolution in the lab. Or even "create" a few complex proteins in a test tube using a primordial soup setup.<br><br>Strong evidence points to a worldwide flood when mass extinction occured in the layers of the earth underground. Even the ark is being unearthed somewhere on Ararat.<br><br>I urge everyone to pick up a book on creation science to read abt arguments for the creation of earth &amp; God.</div>

All scientific concepts started with a philosophical thot &amp; then they started analysing the proof for this concept.<br><br>For eg, they couldnt see atoms but very early in history of science, they imagine atoms or coined the term atoms as the smallest indivisible particle of matter. Now we have lots of proof thru particle physics etc. We can even see atoms! So most scientific ideas started with a philosophical idea.<br><br>Just my 2 cents.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Glad the rating is increased.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HmmÂ… can anybody do even an inch of science without first holding any philosophy?<br><br>And this philosophy has to be separate and above the conduct of this science, as it is the judge of how to treat this science. For example, a point of view that looks only at physical evidence and obvious proofs (aka. Casino King's style) constitutes a philosophy of treating the result of science itself. Many people claim that they are unbiased neutrals that follows what science saysÂ… but they say this on what grounds indeed? What do they mean by unbiased? And from where do they draw this inference of being 'unbiased'?<br><br>Very likely it comes straight from their very own philosophy, which has taught them to hold a certain notion of unbiased-ness. No matter what you can't approach science without a philosophy towards it, and you realize that the philosophy will determine what you get out of science. If you have no philosophy then science would be useless and you would get and do nothing with it.<br><br>A materialist or naturalistic philosophy will make you want to determine that humans are nothing more then randomly evolved animals that just happen to be here, and there's nothing more then that. And so on and so forth.<br><br>The battle then you realize, is often in the proof that a certain philosophy is better then another. And this battle can be supported by, but not won by science. This would then be a matter of logic and reason, which are things one cannot really put down to quarks and atoms (unless you are a materialist who believes that reason is nothing more then the motions of atoms in a brain, but then you destroy your own argument as this reason can't really be counted on to tell us anything, as it is in itself equally random and bankrupt of meaning beyond sheer matter. You would then be very nihilistic)<br><br>And are there compelling reasons to believe in God, logically and rationally thinking?<br><br>Certainly, the real question for me is not really if there is some God, but what kind of God is he.<br></div>
