The aim was to capture the sacred places in the Holy Land from the Muslims who lived there, so it was intended as a war to right wrongs done against Christianity.<br><br><strong>The first Crusade was started by Pope Urban II in 1095. He raged at the capture of the holy places and the treatment given to Christians, and ordered a war to restore Christianity. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He said that the war would have the support of God:<br><br>"Let this be your war-cry in combats, because this word is given to you by God. When an armed attack is made upon the enemy, let this one cry be raised by all the soldiers of God: It is the will of God! It is the will of God!"</span><br><br>"...Whoever shall determine upon this holy pilgrimage and shall make his vow to God to that effect and shall offer himself to Him as a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, shall wear the sign of the cross of the Lord on his forehead or on his breast."<br>The pope also absolved all who took part in the crusade of all their sins.</strong><br><br><strong>The first Crusade captured Jerusalem after bitter fighting, and the residents of the city were brutalised and slaughtered by the Christian invaders.

The concept derives from the popular hadith of the Prophet, in which he said to Muslims returning from a battle, "You have returned from the lesser struggle to the greater struggle." And he was asked, "What is the greater struggle?" He answered, "The struggle against one's self (nafs), which is between the two sides of your body." Needless to say, in Sufism these two struggles are mutually reinforcing and occur simultaneously. In particular, the practice of "engaged surrender" in the "greater" struggle with one's own nafs diminishes certain obstacles in the consciousness of the Sufi, obstacles that--if not stuggled against--will hinder the Sufi's capacity to engage in the "lesser" struggle in their life in the world.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="font-style: italic;">...the greater Jihad is the inner struggle against the inner enemies, the Seven Deadly Sins ( lust, greed, anger, jealousy, sloth, covetousness &amp; gluttony)...</span></div></blockquote>And not unexpectedly, Islamic Sufism mystical tradition is also well-known as 'The Path of LOVE'<br><br>Which again reinforces this statement - but this time, includes all the other religions' contemplatives and mystical traditions:<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><strong>No fanaticism</strong><br><br>Of Buddhism alone can it be affirmed it is free from all fanaticism.
