Whereas all Christians have Christ, call on Christ, and can (or should) know Christ, the goal for the Christian mystic is to become ChristÂ—to become as fully permeated with God as Christ is, thus becoming like him, fully human, and by the grace of God, also fully divine. In Christian teaching this doctrine is known by various namesÂ—theosis, divinization, deification, and transforming union.<br><br>A common misconception about mysticism is that it's about "mystical experiences," and there are many volumes on such experiences in religious literature. But true mysticism is not focussed on "experiences" (which come and go) but with the lasting experience of God, leading to the transformation of the believer into union with God.</blockquote>Pls dont confuse it as 'becoming God' but rather, fully submitting to God.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some interesting stuff abt mystics<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism</a><br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Mysticism from the Greek Ã¬ÃµÃ¹ (muo, "concealed") is the pursuit of achieving communion or identity with, or conscious awareness of, ultimate reality, the divine, spiritual truth, or God through direct experience, intuition, or insight; and the belief that such experience is an important source of knowledge or understanding. It may involve a belief in the existence of realities beyond immediate perceptual apprehension, or a belief that true perception of the world goes beyond intellectual apprehension, or that 'beingness' is central to all perception.<br><br>Mystics generally hold that there is a deeper, more fundamental state of existence hidden beneath the appearances of dayÂ–toÂ–day living (which may become, to the mystic, superficial or epiphenomenal). For the mystic, the hidden state is the focus, and may be perceived in any of various ways Â— as God, ultimate reality, a universal presence, a force or principle, psychological emancipation Â— and be experienced or realized directly. Such experiences are spoken of, variously, as ecstatic revelation, theosis, direct experience of the divine or of universal principles, nirvana, enlightenment, satori, samadhi, etc. They are sometimes characterized by a fading or loss of self, or a perceived interconnection with all existence, and are often accompanied by feelings of peace, joy or bliss.</span></strong><br><br>The funny thing is....they have a list of mystics for each faith, even Christianity.
