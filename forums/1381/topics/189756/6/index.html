And he found them gathered together, seated in pious observance. When he approached his disciples, offering a prayer of thanksgiving over the bread, he laughed.<br><br>Jesus comes upon the group of disciples, and they are celebrating together what looks to be a sacred meal, maybe it is kind of like the Eucharist. And theyÂ’re offering a prayer of thanksgiving over the bread, and Jesus laughs. In fact, in the Gospel of Judas, Jesus laughs a great deal.<br><br>HeÂ’s laughing because they think theyÂ’re worshipping the true God, but in fact they have it wrong. TheyÂ’re worshipping the God who created this world, not the true God. The only one who understands is Judas.<br><br>To the Gnostics, the God who created Earth wasnÂ’t worthy of worship. Only the true God, a being beyond comprehension, was sacred. Jesus laughs at what he sees as false piety. But the apostles donÂ’t understand and grow angry at him.<br><br>Jesus: Â“Why have you been provoked to anger? Let any one of you who is strong enough stand and reveal to me the true spiritual person within.Â”<br><br>Their spirits did not dare to stand before him. Except for Judas Escariot.<br><br>Judas: Â“I know who you are and where you came from. I am not worthy to utter the name of the one who has sent you.Â”<br><br>Jesus: Â“Step away from the others. And I shall tell you the mysteries of the kingdom. It is a great and boundless realm which no eye of an angel has ever seen, no thought of the heart has ever comprehended, and it was never called by name.Â”<br><br>Jesus issues a challenge to the disciples. He says, let the perfect person inside of you step forward and face me. And that perfect person within is the inner person, the spiritual person, that truly knows, the person that ought to have a knowledge of God and a knowledge of oneself.<br><br>And the disciples say, well we can do that. But they couldnÂ’t do it. And so Judas steps forward. And he was able to stand before Jesus.</span></div>

So what's the message u want to convey? Is it that all of us have a inner self that need to be awaken and then rejoin god/nature? Sound abit like Taoism leh? Mebbe u read gospel of judas in a different light than the gnostics?<br><br>Let me do a research for u:<br><br><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04707b.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04707b.htm</a><br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">"according to Greek philosophy the world-maker is not necessarily identical with God, as first and supreme source of all things; he may be distinct from and inferior to the supreme spirit, though he may also be the practical expression of the reason of God, the Logos as operative in the harmony of the universe. In this sense, i.e. that of a world-maker distinct from the Supreme God, [b]Demiurge became a common term in Gnosticism. The Gnostics, however, were not satisfied merely to emphasize the distinction between the Supreme God, or God the Father, and the Demiurge, but in many of their systems they conceived the relation of the Demiurge to the Supreme God as one of actual antagonism, and the Demiurge became the personification of the power of evil, the Satan of Gnosticism, with whom the faithful had to wage war to the end that they might be pleasing to the Good God. </span></strong>The Gnostic Demiurge then assumes a surprising likeness to Ahriman, the evil counter-creator of Ormuzd in Mazdean philosophy. The character of the Gnostic Demiurge became still more complicated when in some systems he was identified with Jehovah, the God of the Jews or of the Old Testament, and was brought in opposition to Christ of the New Testament, the Only-Begotten Son of the Supreme and Good God. The purpose of Christ's coming as Saviour and Redeemer was to rescue us from the power of the Demiurge, the lord of the world of this darkness, and bring us to the light of the Good God, His Father in heaven. The last development in the character of the Demiurge was due to Jehovah being primarily considered as he who gave the Law on Sinai, and hence as the originator of all restraint on the human will. As the Demiurge was essentially evil, all his work was such; in consequence all law was intrinsically evil and the duty of the children of the Good God was to transgress this law and to trample upon its precepts. This led to the wildest orgies of Antinomian Gnosticism"[/b]<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demiurge" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demiurge</a><br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Yahweh<br>Some Gnostic philosophers (notably Marcion of Sinope: [color=orange]this is disputed as some theologians believe there is a difference between Marcionites and gnostics</span>) [b]identify the Demiurge with Yahweh, the God of the Old Testament, in opposition and contrast to the God of the New Testament. Still others equated the being with Satan.</strong> Catharism apparently inherited their idea of Satan as the creator of the evil world directly or indirectly from Gnosticism. Or, they may well have gotten the idea directly from the New Testament, which refers to Satan as "The God ['ho theos'] of this age" in Second Corinthians 4:4. Also, the NT asserts that the "whole world lies in the power of the evil one" in 1 John 5:19. Though nowhere in the New Testament is the creator of the world or the universe identified as Satan, although Yahweh declares in Isaiah 45:7 that He "makes good and creates evil [Hebrew "ra"]. Nor in the old or New Testament is nature or earth created by the creator referred to as evil, unlike the so-called Gnostic "sectarians." (Unless one sees the attribute of Creatorship as inherent in the concept of "God," and therefore the title "The God of this Age" applied to Satan becomes a powerful indicator that Satan is indeed the creator. Other modern-day Cathars see a further indication of this in the epithet "Kosmokrator" [Koine Greek, kosmokratoras, which literally means cosmos-sovereign, or even cosmos-might] which is applied to Satan in Ephesian 6:12, as a further indication of the creatorship of Satan and his identity with the Demiurge)[/color][/b]<br><br></div>
