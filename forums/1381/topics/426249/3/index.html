              Hi TS
              
              It is unfortunate to hear of your experience with the church.
              
              I must emphasise that in Christianity, tithing is NOT compulsory, no where does the Bible say that. However, it is highly recommended. I will not duplicate what the pastors are saying here.
              
              Think of it this way, any organisation requires money to operate... run their buildings, pay their staff, run programmes.. mission trips to less fortunate countries... where does the money come from ? the members! Those who are really committed to the church will definitely come out with some money as contribution to defray the expenses.
              
              The Bible has two sayings, where your treasure is, your heart will be also. And God loves a cheerful giver.
              
              Cheers

              <p>The 10% is from the Hebrew text. Like, if you have 10 sheep, give one to the temple.</p>
              <p>So when modern day Christians ask, what is the amount to donate (tithe) the answer come up as 10%. Fanatics will swear by it, moderates will say it is only a guide.</p>
              <p>Giving is a test, can you let go of what you desire. Giving what you don't want or need is not giving, thats discarding.</p>

              <p>nothing wrong with giving, but be careful how you use the money. It is under charity act and money collected is considered public funds and is under very strigent scrutiny by the government and the public.</p>
              <p>so the heavy responsibility is on the users, not only are they responsible to the government and the public, they will be held accountable to God!</p>
              <p>As far as $ is concerned, excess will always cause trouble, lose control will always become temptation, and when others have it, there will always be jealousy.</p>

              <p><strong>it doesnt matter which church because the 10% thing is in the

              <p><strong> I was from a small church and the pastors are rich! They have

              <p>WHen did I say that ALL churches ask people to tithe? I didn't. If you read carefully, I said MOST. I know some churches do not require their members to tithe and that's good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However I've been to many churches (and heard from friends from other churches) that quite a number of the churches do require members to tithe and they do preach to their members to tithe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm just asking if it's correct for these churches to QUOTE verses in the bible to tell their members to tithe.</p>
