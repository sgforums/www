              <p>I would like to urge all brothers and sisters in Christ to refrain from getting into a mindless argument with the non believers in Eternal Hope.</p>
              <p>James 3:9-10 "With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God's likeness. Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My brothers, this should not be."</p>
              <p>I'm urging everyone, if we see a Christian or non Christian who asked a sensible question regarding Christianity, we should just share what we know and leave it at that, allowing God to speak to his/her heart through your sharing. If someone responds to your sharing with malicious remarks, we should just forgive them and not respond with another malicious remark.</p>
              <p>Matthew 5:43-45 "You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I tell you: Love your enemies<sup><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></sup>and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous."</p>
              <p>Our peace and joy is in the Lord, let's not allow little things like mudslingings to affect us! God bless everyone! =D</p>

              <p>Let me be honest that i'm a muslim. I just stumbled on this page by accident.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I agree with the TS statement because we should not really curse other religions. You see, whether you believe in one God or not, all of us are still human. We can express our views freely but you have to be careful of this line of tolerance; religion. If someone crosses it, there will sure be conflict because you see, each religion is like competing to be like the best religion but it all comes down to the person's choice on whether he wants to be a Christian, Muslim or an atheist. At the end of the day, it's his account that will be questioned by god on Judgement Day (Qiamat).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope that we all tolerate each other and pray for god's guidance. It's funny for me to have a comment on a Christian issue but i'll leave you all with a quote:</p>
              <p>''I won't worship what you worship, You won't worship what I worship. To you be your religion, and to me mine'' (Excerpt from Surah Al-Kafirrun)</p>

              <p>I would like to urge all brothers and sisters in Christ to refrain from getting into a mindless argument with the non believers in Eternal Hope.</p>
              <p>James 3:9-10 "With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God's likeness. Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My brothers, this should not be."</p>
              <p>I'm urging everyone, if we see a Christian or non Christian who asked a sensible question regarding Christianity, we should just share what we know and leave it at that, allowing God to speak to his/her heart through your sharing. If someone responds to your sharing with malicious remarks, we should just forgive them and not respond with another malicious remark.</p>
              <p>Matthew 5:43-45 "You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous."</p>
              <p>Our peace and joy is in the Lord, let's not allow little things like mudslingings to affect us! God bless everyone! =D</p>

              <p>there is nothing wrong with presenting an alternative
                                      viewpoint. To be fair, not everyone who has come
               to EH with an
                                      "alternative viewpoint" has good intentions. 
              Sometimes it's not
                                      even about their viewpoint but all about the 
              conflict in itself. We
                                      also have a few Christians (or that's what claim
               to be so we take
                                      at face value), who are more into the conflict 
              as well.</p>
              <p>It is sad, whether you are a Christian or not
               that you make
                                      posts and replies in good faith but the other 
              party is only seeking
                                      to cause trouble and incite conflict.</p>
              <p>This sub-forum has long ceased being a place 
              of genuine
                                      discussion and sharing of views. To blame any 
              one group would be
                                      wrong. Some people even knowingly add to it to 
              make it worse.</p>
              <p>There have been those of us who have admitted
               like you said that
                                      mistakes have been made by those who call 
              themselves Christians and
                                      we even agree if wrong-doing has been done. We 
              have also conceded
                                      since they have done wrong, and such people 
              should be told and
                                      dealt with accordingly.</p>
              <p>However, such comments are often largely 
              ignored, and this is
                                      not true of all non-Christians, but only certain
               anti-Christians,
                                      they insist on focusing on negative stereotypes 
              even when presented
                                      with clear examples of those who don't conform 
              or practice the
                                      negative stereotypes. Which brings in the irony 
              of being accused of
                                      not listening to alternative views.</p>
              <p>For example, there have been Christians who 
              have said they don't
                                      agree with how CHC gets money and how they use 
              it, not just now but
                                      even in the past years ago. But this is ignored 
              and sometimes
                                      blatantly even.</p>
              <p>Once again, I stress again I agree with you 
              that we should
                                      listen to alternative views. But not everyone 
              with an "alternative
                                      view" is the same. At the same time, Christians 
              at large should
                                      learn how to respond and handle these different 
              types of people
                                      with "alternative view". I also believe your 
              advice about listening
                                      to alternative views that any person can heed, 
              not just one
                                      specific group of people.</p>

              <p>Non-christians at large are not to blame for the problems in this sub forum.
