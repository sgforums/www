In this case, it seem that it is owned by ONE person - which in itself raise a yellow flag. One person opinion is dangerous.<br>2. If a church or organisation owns this site, check on the orthodoxy of this group.<br>3. Counter check with other sites to cross-reference the points.<br><br>In my experience, I've found that there are weird sites that has very very strange theology. I've even found one that says it is Biblical to demand sex from multiple sex partners.</div>
