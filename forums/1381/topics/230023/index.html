In fact it is the Sabellian heresy during the early years.<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.exchangedlife.com/Sermons/topical/trinity/heresies1.shtml/" rel="nofollow">http://www.exchangedlife.com/Sermons/topical/trinity/heresies1.shtml/</a><br><br><strong>Monarchianism</strong><br><br>This is also called Modalism or the Sabellian heresy. Noetus of Smyrna first proposed this doctrine at the end of the second century, beginning of the third century. Modalistic Monarchian doctrine was accepted and popularized by Sabellius at the beginning of the third century. Sabellius was excommunicated in Rome for this teaching. Modalism teaches that the Trinity is one God revealed in one person or mode. The Father is the Son, is the Holy Spirit. They are all different temporary modes of the same God. Modalism/Monarchian doctrine usually did not deny the deity of Christ; instead they claim that the Son is the Father, not the eternal Son as part of historic Christianity.<br><br>Many church fathers wrote detailed responses against this doctrine (as we saw in the previous section). One term coined for those who held this heresy was 'Patripassianists' because they taught that the Father suffered on the cross. Other sects teach that Jesus was only a man who received power from God. Noetus, Praxeas, and Sabellius were the prominent teachers of this heresy.<br><br><strong>The church responds:</strong><br><br>Tertullian criticized this view in his theological argument against Praxeas:<br><br>Â“We define that there are two, the Father and the Son, and three with the Holy Spirit, and this number is made by the pattern of salvation...[which] brings about unity in trinity, interrelating the three, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. They are of one substance and power, because there is one God from whom these degrees, forms and kinds devolve in the name of Father, Son and Holy Spirit.Â” (Against Praxeas p. 156-7).</blockquote></div>
