            <div class='col-md body'>After doing some research:<br><br>THE DA VINCI CODE By Dan Brown                                         Lecture by Fr. Gino Henriques (23/4/2006)<br><br>St. Peter said Â“Be alert, be on watch! Your enemy the Devil, roams around like  a roaring lion looking for someone to devour (1, Peter,4, <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. Pope John Paul II had  spoken about the Culture of Death, Relativism, the dictatorship of Negatism and a Godless world. Today many speak about Â“ DonÂ’t talk about God, about  religion  or about  ChristÂ”<br><br>The Da Vinci Code was written by Dan Brown as a fiction taking excerpts   from the book Â“The Holy GrailÂ”, a fiction story, but claiming that Jesus was married to  Mary Magdalene and offspring, Sarah, forms that genealogy line( see below). The Dan  Brown book has now been translated into 45 languages and the author has now changed  and believes that the information is now Â“factÂ” and not fiction<br><br>Today many peopleÂ’s lives have been changed by Dan Brown book.<br><br>Introduction<br>This was one of the many books which had come out in the last forty years  purporting to disprove Jesus as believed in the Catholic Faith.                    It began with Celsus in the 2 nd Century and continues to today.  The Â“Pass over  PortraitÂ” of a scheming false saviour in a Golgatha scenario in 1966, when Â“Jesus  pretended to be dead but had run away Nikos Kazantzakis Â“The last temptation of JesusÂ”  book and movie and S.G.F.Brandon Books Â“Jesus the Radical RevolutionaryÂ” of the  60s.The 1973 Â“The secret of the GospelÂ” where Jesus is depicted as a magician, who by  the sleight of his hand is a Master magician in the miracles.<br><br>In the book Â“The Holy Blood, the Holy GrailÂ”(Lincoln  and Leigh) Jesus is  supposed to have married Mary Magdalene and their children persisted in the  Merovingian dynasty of medieval France.  The theory line is the heart of the story line of the Da Vinci code and Dan Brown uses the  Holy Grail as the heart of his story line.    Why has the da Vinci code being sold millions of copies?    In todayÂ’s world:   (1) Weird stories sell (movies, books)    (2) Sensationalism (murder, mystery, intrigue involving the church(Lavender clergy with  impropriety), secret societies. These are perfect recipe for an interesting thriller,  especially if these are close to home, and receives a captive audience.  3) Doubts in Faith. These have been created by scandals in the Church in recent times  (theÂ‘ lavender clergy Â’of  priestly impropriety). Hence when one hears of something  wrong in the church, one has doubts that one is the right church, with right beliefs, and  with surety of oneÂ’s salvation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As the film, the Da VinciCode would be released on the 19 th May 2006 I have ventured to  speak on it tonight.<br><br>This book attacks our faith, this book attacks the Church and it attacks our Christian  Values. Hence it is dangerous. One cannot remain neutral as the spiritual stakes are  high We live in a world where naivete is a common attitude and discernment is a rare  commodity. So we must all the more not only beware of perpetrators of falsehood of  books like the Da Vinci code , but also in charity we  need  help to instruct the faithful  regarding them. So we have to spread the news against it. So when the picture is seen ,  many people will be confused, so I want to be clear today. The da Vinci code is a  dangerous hoax because it can grip you like a thriller.<br><br>The history of Hoaxes    1)  The Priory of Sion Hoax   The Priory of Sion was founded in Jerusalem in 1099 by a French crusader King  Geoffrey of Bouillion and his ancestors preserved a Â‘great secretÂ’ handed down from  generations to generations from the time of Christ alleging that Jesus and Magdalene  had a daughter Sarah. They continued to claim that JesusÂ’ bloodline continues  through Sarah in the Merovingian dynasty of French Kings even to this day  Dan Brown books calls out to watch out for this great revelation.<br><br>The Priory of Sion was found to be fraudulent in 1956 and traced to an origin from  a reactionary anti-Semitic Frenchman with a criminal record who invented the story  and registered these beliefs officially. The forger Pierre Plantard had made a list of  Â“Grand MastersÂ”, the document of these and their genealogy together with those of  the grandmasters, are in a cache found in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris. These  are all found to be false. PlantardÂ’s hoax was exposed in a series of French books  and BBC documentary in 1966    Hence the most important strand of the plot of the Da Vinci Code is a total hoax.  So we have to tell people who read the Da Vinci Code that it is a Hoax. DonÂ’t be  afraid.     2)  Constantine the Great  and  the Belief in Jesus   In the Da Vinci code, Dan Brown falsifies the historical characters of Jesus and  Constantine.  (a) From the earliest times Jesus was considered both God and Man in the  Christian belief. In the first three centuries the early Church first condemned  Docetism (2 nd century) that taught Jesus was only Divine, and not Man. Docetism is  like  Gnostics  which we are talking about today in the Â“Gospel of JudasÂ” It is really   a book and not a Gospel, as it was demolished   by St. Iraeneus in the early Church in  AD186.<br><br>Later at the Council of Nicea (AD 31<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> , the heresy of Arianism by Arius  was  condemned which said that Jesus was a creature and not God.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Early Christianity had many of the accounts of the life and teachings of Jesus  from and after the apostolic times. Not all were given the same acceptance and  belief. Few amongst them had a confirmed link to apostolic time. From the mid  second century Christian writers cited frequently the Gospels of Matthew, Mark,  Luke and John and the letters of Paul as reliable sources of JesusÂ’ life and the  Faith of the early Apostles.<br><br>The Christian writers do not quote books of Mary Magdalene, Barnabas, Philip  or  Thomas etc.<br><br>It was the Council of Laodicea in AD 363 which confirmed the centuries church  use of the Gospel books of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, the letters of St.Paul   and  the list of canonical books that we have in our bible today . To these were  added in AD 393, the book of the Revelation at the Council of Hippo( home of St.  Augustine), which also accepted these books.. Both of these dates were years after  ConstantineÂ’s rule , and his death in AD 339     (c ) As a consequence of their belief in the Divinity of Jesus and his resurrection  from the dead, the early Christians kept Sunday as the LordÂ’s Day ( Acts 20: 7; 1,  Cor 16,2; Rev 1:10) all preceding the first Council of Nicea (AD 325AD) . These  are seen in the writings of the early Church Fathers, such as St Ignatius of  Antioch( died AD 110), St Justin Martyr (died  AD160  ), Didache and even the  pagan writer Pliny     Dan Brown claims (223)  that  Emperor  Constantine was a patriarchal character   had forced the Bishops to have  a  Council of  Nicea to sanction the canon of  scripture . Dan Brown says that Jesus was viewed as mortal  prophet  and by a close  vote at the Council of Nicea was pronounced God at the pressure of Constantine.  This statement is completely false.  The truth is that by a vote of 300 to 2 in favor of Jesus  Divinity . Furthermore, it  was not Constantine who shifted Christian worship from Saturday to Sunday  to   coincide with the pagan veneration of the sun( as claimed by Dan Brown) but by  the Early Apostolic Church Fathers( Acts of Apostles), and confirmed by the Synod  of Loadicea in AD343- 381.    (d) Constantine while undeniably a flawed individual(  as any Emperor had), he  renounced paganism and became a genuine Christian convert. He repaid the  terrible losses to the Church by the early Roman persecutions, by building  Churches, favouring the  clergy  and convened the  Great Ecumenical Council of  Nicea, by underwriting the expenses of the clergy who attended. He was baptized on  his free will on his death bed, because of the belief, at that time amongst people   that baptism would absolve him from his previous sins.<br><br>However Dan Brown does Constantine no justice when he says Constantine was  forced to  be baptized on his bed too weak to protest (232). This is false.  Dan Brown also makes misleading claims that Constantine was responsible for the  collating the Canonical books of the Bible or Christianity  for his political gain. This is false because both Councils of Laodicea (AD 343-381), Constantinople (AD 381)  and Hippo (AD 419), gave us all , the Canonical Scriptures( Old and New  testaments) many years after the death of Constantine in AD 339. (b AD 285.)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jesus and Mary Magdalene<br><br>(a) The marriage of Jesus to Mary Magdalene is at the heart of the secret of the  Priory of Sion and the heart of the story line of the Da Vinci Code.  There is not a single shred of evidence in any of the early Church documents or  writings  to  support this. In the interaction in Jesus home town of Nazareth, this  fact would have been mentioned in the context of other relations( such as his wife)  but there is absolutely no mention of Jesus having a wife. There is a total absence  of a wife, because Jesus was not married.  Dan also says  that all Jewish men of that time were married . This is not true  because some Rabbi were not, because they were stuck with their teachings. They  were prophets .  These are false because certain branch of the Essenes, Egyptian  therapeutae(Philo) , many prophets like Jeremiah, Banus, Paul and John the Baptist  did not marry. More than likely historians say, that John the Baptist and Jesus were  from the Essene school, so that both  were  celibate.   How does Dan Brown get the idea that Jesus was married? He takes a book, the  Gospel of Mary Magdalene that has missing words, fills it the missing  words  and  reconstructs with his own words that would make it now to read that Jesus married  Mary Magdalene. He  supplies  his  own  words  to bring out his own pieces his  false thesis. He is  not  an archaeologist ,or philologist or bible scholar. So, he canÂ’t  reconstruct an ancient text .He however does it to prove his thesis  This book of Mary Magdalene is of the late  second centur y (two centuries after  Jesus) and was rejected by the early Church because it had Gnostic overtones. Even  scholars consider today this book as not genuine,  but spurious and counterfeit. It  is written too late in history to have credibility. It is not a gospel but a fiction book.    St Paul (1, Cor 9,5) is a grave  yard for his opinion. Why ?   Paul  states those   apostles  in the company of Jesus were married and if Jesus was married  Paul  would have mentioned that he was   married. But Paul  wanted  to be more like  Jesus, who was celibate.<br><br>(b) Taking material from the book of the Holy Grail, Dan Brown claims Mary  Magdalene was from the royal blood line of the tribe of Benjamin, and that Jesus had  intended his church to be in her hands. The Church would then be a reintegration of  theÂ”sacred feminineÂ” into human life and human consciousness. Her womb would be  the Â“Holy GrailÂ”. She belongs to the Priory of Sion and is worshipped by them as a  goddess and the divine mother. Some of her relics are placed in the pyramid entry at  the Louve in Paris. Dan Brown saw a plot in the early Church and in Constantine to  demonise this woman. So he developed a patriarchal   plot to dethrone the Â“Divine  MotherÂ”( Mother Mary of Magdala).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The truth  from the Gospel: Mary Magdalene is a historical figure. She played an  important role in the passion and the resurrection of Jesus. Luke mentions her as  being amongst those women whom Jesus healed of seven evil spirits (Luke 8:2-3)  These women cast their lot with Jesus by giving support through providing money  and food. She is the witness to the crucifixion, the burial and the resurrection of  Jesus in the four gospels and the first evangelizer of JesusÂ’ resurrection (Matthew  28,1-10). The Eastern Churches have long acknowledged her the Â“equal-to-theapostlesÂ”, the Â“ myrth- bearerÂ”(Mark 16,1-<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. Both in the West and the Eastern  Church Mary Magdalene is honoured as a saint. Churches are named after her.  Her relics are honoured as are miracles ascribed to her. The bible accounts and the  Church do not demonize her, but rather extol her for her repentance and as a  witness to the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.  Surely, if Peter wanted to demonize her would they have shown her in the Gospels  as the first witness and evangelizer to the risen Christ?  Some Gnostics sects, in the early first century gave Mary Magdalene a prime role by  suggesting intimacy between Jesus and Mary Magdalene. There were no traceable  elements to this to back to the first century. These were demolished as heresy by the  early Church Fathers, including St. Iraneus in AD 186.    What is  Dan BrownÂ’s   main aims in this book?<br><br>(i)  He sets out to destroy the credibility of Jesus Christ, the belief systems of the  Church, of Christianity and the Catholic Church,. He introduces a New Age  Religion to replace Christianity and Jesus.<br><br>(ii)  He wants to replace Christianity with the new age religion of the new blood  line of the Priory of Sion , and the blood line of Jesus and Mary Magdalene.  This is a cult and a sect and he brings in the rituals and whole lists of Â“Gods  he proposesÂ”. He is  thus  using  a thriller with brainwashing techniques to  demonize Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church, and all religions. It is a  plot at the climactic end to tear down age old beliefs.<br><br>(iii)  He is upset by the Pope and the Catholic Church and claims that the Catholic  Church demonize other religions, because the Church has power. This is  false. Pope John Paul II &amp; Pope Benedict XVI, have strongly promoted  Ecumenism with all religions of the world.             So who is behind Dan BrownÂ’s book?<br><br>Who was the first Liar in the Bible ?  Who is the great deceiver?             Answer: *Book of Genesis(Genesis 3,1-7) says the snake was the most cunning.                           Who is the snake? Satan or the Devil.( It tears down it destroys. So this  is  what Dan Brown has done. If he had  done this against the Moslems, or the Hindus, or the Buddhist, would he  gets  away with it? But the Catholics  are  quiescent )</div>
