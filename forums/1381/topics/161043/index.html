As fandango had stated, there are some who will adhere to the biblical teachings. Others will interpret it as a shift in cultural traditions whereby women are more and more given positions of authority. It is also right that women pastors can cater to certain aspects of church life where it might be inconvenient for a male to do. All said and done, I don't think we'd see a woman achieving the rank of bishop anywhere in the near future.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>priests r used in the context of RC n Anglican churches. These are ordained clergymen and are always males except for some deviant anglican dioceses that ordain female clergy.<br><br>Pastors in the strictest sense r pastoral workers who can be both male and female and are not ordained. They r simply trained in seminaries and equipped with some ministry skills.<br><br>Nowadays even those ordained call themselves Pastors..so there you go the double meaning of pastors.<br></div>
