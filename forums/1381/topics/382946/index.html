              <p>for the jews they dont contradict themselves because they wrote the book. so for them, the question is whether you believe the god of israel is the one and only god.</p>
              <p>but for the christians to have the cheek to say jews are at fault is totally laughable in retrospect as an ex-christian myself. The romans and greeks think they are smart with with their pagans trying to decive ppl for centuries but sori man now internet, every word is laid out for all to study and concur.</p>
              <p>Personally I believe God of israel is real and the creator. Jesus was a test to the Jews to see if they listen to god and not be con by JC magic show.</p>

              <p>Hi happyinfo2</p>
              <p>Let me clarify, Im neither jew nor chrisitian. I am a former christian for 15 years and my belief is that jesus and paul does not stand with god of israel as reference to old testament is full of contradictions and deception in certain instances.</p>
              <p>BUT, god of israel to me is real and is the true creator of this world. And there lies the sad irony. Let me explain.</p>
              <p>If you read the old testament carefully especially the laws god laid down for moses. It is very detailed and elaborate on not only what is proper behaviour, clean and good for humans but also it demostrates that He is the creator. example, fins and scales of sea creatures are clean to eat?! Which religion or god have this goodness and more importantly knowledge to decipher which is clean at that time?!!!!</p>
              <p>Doesnt that tell you the message is of Love and proving He is the creator at the same time? thats why the deuteronomy, numbers and leviticus is extremely important and always strongly avoided by church leaders to inform in detail to followers. And that's why jews are always targetted by different religion (including christianity and muslims leaders, not the common believers as most are unaware of these factual disscusion levels).</p>
              <p>I may be banned here bcos these are big secrets that will ruffle the money men. I dont care. At least some of you have read it, I have done my part.</p>

              <p>I dont agree with Herzog_Zwei. However, its ok. I am here to reclaim the understanding of God but to put a stop to christianity obvious tactical preaching to believers which naturally will make them alienate life further and ultimately dont belief in God like some here has rightfully voiced out. They are half right that christianity is full of lies and contradiction - they have done their research and common sense do prevail. But if they dont hold a grudge against god and persist further to read in detail the torah or what the christians try to make it insignificant as possible "OLD" testament (god say my LAW is FOREVER and they sneakily say old) - they will find that GOD of torah is the ultimate one and no other dared to declare so(im open to other religions discussion to post here if they have info on supremacy claims).</p>
              <p>BTW, i am open for opinions still cos I am humble enough to listen and discuss. This open mentality has not only freed me from christianity's vicious programming stronghold of verses on peoples reading and understanding, it has led me finally back to God.</p>
              <p>An an example of truth - do you know if you follow the dietary laws in the deuteronomy chapters, your health will improve trememdously? dont have to believe me. try it yourself.</p>
              <p>And when you realise its good for you, you wonder - why you anyhow eat what Apostle peter's strange say in a dream of animals dropping down from heaven verses? blindly eating pork and shell fish and all that is unclean. End up having a high chance of cancer and go to Jesus and pray for miracle. Do you get the flaw of christian's teachings? </p>

              <p>You are right that no Christains cares to debate with you because you made it clear that you are simply anti-Christians in support  for REASON and EVIDENCE. You have no reaon and evidence to support your claim.....</p>
              <p>You also made it clear to us that although you claimed to have studied the Bible, you conclusion is that one cannot

              <p>Hi happyinfo2</p>
              <p>Let me clarify, Im neither jew nor chrisitian. I am a former
              christian for 15 years and my belief is that jesus and paul does
              not stand with god of israel as reference to old testament is full
              of contradictions and deception in certain instances.</p>
              <p>BUT, god of israel to me is real and is the true creator of this
              world. And there lies the sad irony. Let me explain.</p>
              <p>If you read the old testament carefully especially the laws god
              laid down for moses. It is very detailed and elaborate on not only
              what is proper behaviour, clean and good for humans but also it
              demostrates that He is the creator. example, fins and scales of sea
              creatures are clean to eat?! Which religion or god have this
              goodness and more importantly knowledge to decipher which is clean
              at that time?!!!!</p>
              <p>Doesnt that tell you the message is of Love and proving He is
              the creator at the same time? thats why the deuteronomy, numbers
              and leviticus is extremely important and always strongly avoided by
              church leaders to inform in detail to followers. And that's why
              jews are always targetted by different religion (including
              christianity and muslims leaders, not the common believers as most
              are unaware of these factual disscusion levels).</p>
              <p>I may be banned here bcos these are big secrets that will ruffle
              the money men. I dont care. At least some of you have read it, I
              have done my part.</p>
