              <p>And to continue my true purpose here, the topic on BLOOD SACRIFICE. Was the messiah really required to die? Or more importantly, did God say require it. read on,</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;  ">
              </span></p><h1>Blood Sacrifice</h1>
              <span style="color: #00008b;"><strong>"Then the LORD said, 'I do forgive, just as you have asked.'"</strong><br>Numbers 14:20 (NRS)</span><br>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And so, we are to believe that Jesus dying on the cross fulfilled the requirements of a blood sacrifice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are a number of requirements for a sacrifice to be valid or it is completely disqualified and will be an abomination to G-d. These requirements are as follows:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>1. The sin offering must be brought forth by the person seeking atonement, and slaughtered either by the sinner or by the priest.<br>2. Death must be caused by a sharp, perfect blade cutting across the neck, resulting in blood loss and swift death. <br>3. The offering must be physically unblemished.<br>4. In the case of mammal offerings (bulls, lambs, etc.) the offering must be less than one year old.<br>5. In the case of mammal offerings, the mammal must have cloven hooves and chew cud.<br>6. The sacrifice must be brought at the Temple <br>7. The sacrifice must have its blood taken by a priest and sprinkled on the altar.<br>8. The sacrifice must be salted.</blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since Jesus did not fulfill even one of the eight precepts listed above, it's clear that his death could not be the atoning sacrifice Christians claim it is.</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Deuteronomy 4:2</strong> <span style="color: teal;">Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish [ought] from it,</span> that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your G-d which I command you. (KJV)<br><br><strong>Deuteronomy 12:32</strong> What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: <span style="color: teal;">thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.</span> (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>Twice we see a prohibition of going against the Torah’s precepts. This should tell you it’s an important law to follow. Does G-d desire human sacrifice?</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Deuteronomy 12:31</strong> Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy G-d: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods. (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>So, we see just how highly the Almighty thinks of human sacrifice.</p>
              <p>The New Testament quoted the following Psalm:</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Psalms 40:6</strong> Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; <span style="color: teal;">mine ears hast thou opened:</span> burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required. (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>This Psalm carries an important message. Coupled with other verses from throughout the Bible, we learn that while G-d does place an importance on blood sacrifice, He puts more importance on penitence and the resolve to do better. This Psalm presented a theological problem for the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews:</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Hebrews 10:5</strong> Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, <span style="color: teal;">but a body hast thou prepared me:</span> [6] In burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin thou hast had no pleasure. (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>How does "mine ears hast thou opened" change to "but a body hast thou prepared me?" This is not the only time one will come across this kind of behavior went into the penning of the Epistle to the Hebrews, and the entire New Testament for that matter. How are we to trust a document that exhibits this sort of behavior?</p>
              <p>Christian apologists will argue that Jesus was unblemished of sin. To be frank, this dogma genuinely frightens me. This is the logic that pagan societies used in offering up their children in human sacrifices -- they reasoned that their children were sinless.</p>
              <p>The Diaspora was prophesied, such as in this passage:</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Hosea 3:4</strong> For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and [without] teraphim: <strong>[5]</strong> Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their G-d, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days. (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>Now, when we see this, a Christian will try to fix this into a problem for the Jews, saying, "but without blood sacrifice, how do you receive atonement for your sins?" After all, you have this verse below:</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Hebrews 9:22</strong> And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; <span style="color: teal;">and without shedding of blood is no remission.</span> (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>With this verse, the author successfully placed the new Christian theology outside of Judaism, because this in no way is a Jewish concept. Nowhere in the Jewish Scriptures do you find the message that without blood there is no remission. Time and time again, the prophets preached repentence and obedience, placing these things above sacrifice.</p>
              <blockquote><strong>1 Samuel 15:22</strong> And Samuel said, Hath the LORD [as great] delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? <span style="color: teal;">Behold, to obey [is] better than sacrifice, [and] to hearken than the fat of rams. </span>(KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>Given how often this theme is given (such as in the Psalm quoted above) the Christian position of there being no atonement without blood becomes a little puzzling. Hosea also gave a startling message that prayer can take the place of sacrifices:</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Hosea 14:1</strong> O Israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.<strong>[2]</strong> Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive [us] graciously: <span style="color: teal;">so will we render the calves of our lips. </span>(KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>Now, given the language that KJV used in its translation, this is likely rather confusing. For that reason, let us use the American Standard Version's translation:</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Hosea 14:1</strong> O Israel, return unto J---vah thy G-d; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity. <strong>[2]</strong>Take with you words, and return unto J---vah: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and accept that which is good: <span style="color: teal;">so will we render [as] bullocks [the offering of] our lips.</span> (ASV)</blockquote>
              <p>So, the prophet is telling us that prayer can substitute for sacrifice. Surely, this creates a dilemma for Christian theology, so let's see how they deal with this:</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Hosea 14:1</strong> Return, O Israel, to the Lord your G-d, For you have stumbled because of your iniquity. <strong>[2]</strong> Take words with you and return to the Lord. Say to Him, "Take away all iniquity And receive us graciously, That we may present the <span style="color: teal;">fruit of our lips. </span>(NAS)</blockquote>
              <p>So, we see that Christian Bible translators will resort to word changing. Are we to trust a translation that exhibits this sort of behavior?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who still believe that without blood, there is no atonement, think about the Babylonian Exile. The Jews committed sins that caused the first Temple to be destroyed and the citizenry to be exiled from the land of Israel. Do you really think that G-d would punish us for our sins in such a manner as which we would be unable to atone for them? G-d wouldn't set us up to fall forever into a pit. The only response I've ever gotten for this problem is "Jesus was offered to the Babylonian Exiles and that's how they got their atonement." This has no textual corroboration.</p>
              <br>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <strong>One of Christianity's Compelling Prooftexts</strong>
              <p> </p>
              <br>
              <p>Now we come to what Christians feel is the number one Torah prooftext that blood is the only means of sin expiation.</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Leviticus 17:11</strong> For the life of the flesh [is] in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it [is] the blood [that] maketh an atonement for the soul. (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>Those who find this a compelling proof should examine the verse more carefully. Like just about every other Christian prooftext, this one is flawed, and taken completely out of context. While this verse does illustrate an aspect of importance in blood sacrifice, nowhere does it say that blood is the only means of expiation. Also, notice the first word in this verse, "for." In other translations, you'll also find this translated as "because." Verse 11 is an explanation, not an imperative.</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Leviticus 17:10</strong> And whatsoever man [there be] of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people. <strong>[11]</strong> For the life of the flesh [is] in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it [is] the blood [that] maketh an atonement for the soul. <strong>[12]</strong> Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood,neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood. (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>It's the blood that makes atonement, as opposed to using the intestines, the kidneys, the brains the muscle tissue. It's the blood. So don't consume it. That's all there is to it. Additionally, if Christians are going to be context to take verse 11 out of context the way in which they do, they must take all of it. Verse 11 specifically says "upon the altar." A sacrifice without the priest taking the blood and sprinkling it on the altar is completely pointless. It's like a movie with a beginning, middle, but no ending.</p>
              <br><strong></strong><strong>Do you really need blood sacrifice?</strong><br><blockquote><strong>Psalms 51:16</strong> For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give [it]: thou delightest not in burnt offering. <strong>[17]</strong> The sacrifices of G-d [are] a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O G-d, thou wilt not despise. (KJV)<br><br><strong>Psalms 69:30</strong> I will praise the name of G-d with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving. <strong>[31]</strong> [This] also shall please the LORD better than an ox [or] bullock that hath horns and hoofs. (KJV)<br><br><strong>Proverbs 15:8</strong> The sacrifice of the wicked [is] an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright [is] His delight. <strong>[9]</strong> The way of the wicked [is] an abomination unto the LORD: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness. (KJV)<br><br><strong>Proverbs 16:6</strong> By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil. (KJV) <br><br><strong>Isaiah 58:3</strong> Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours. (KJV) <br><br><strong>Isaiah 58:5</strong> Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD? (KJV)</blockquote><br>
              <p> </p>
              See also Jeremiah 4:1-2, 7:3, 7:22-23, 25:5, 26:3-6, 36:3, 36:7, and 50:20!
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote><strong>Micah 7:18</strong> Who is a G-d like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy. [19] He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. [20] Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old. (KJV) <br><br><strong>Daniel 4:27</strong> Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity. (KJV)<br><br><br><strong>Exodus 30:16</strong> And thou shalt take the <span style="color: teal;"><strong>atonement money</strong></span><strong></strong> of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls. (KJV)</blockquote><br>
              <p> </p>
              <strong>Atonement money? Monetary sacrifice serves for atonement?</strong>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote><strong>Numbers 14:20</strong> And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word. (KJV)</blockquote><br>
              <p><strong>This verse makes it plainly clear that the Lord accepts prayer for expiation of sin.</strong></p>
              <blockquote><strong>Jonah 3:5</strong> So the people of Nineveh believed G-d, and <span style="color: teal;"><strong>proclaimed a fast,</strong></span><strong></strong> and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. <strong>[6]</strong> For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. <strong>[7]</strong> And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water: <strong>[8]</strong> But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto G-d: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands. <strong>[9]</strong> Who can tell if G-d will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not? <strong>[10]</strong> <span style="color: teal;">And G-d saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and G-d repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not.</span> (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <strong>Nineveh was forgiven of their evil deeds by fasting and repentance, and without sacrifice.</strong>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote><strong>Jonah 4:10</strong> Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night: <strong>[11]</strong>And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle? (KJV) <br><br><strong>2 Chronicles 6:24</strong> And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house; <strong>[25]</strong> <span style="color: teal;">Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.</span> <strong>[26]</strong> When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them; <strong>[27]</strong> <span style="color: teal;">Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants,</span> and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance. <strong>[28]</strong> If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be: <strong>[29]</strong> Then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house: <strong>[30]</strong>Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou knowest the hearts of the children of men) <strong>[31]</strong> That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers. (KJV)</blockquote><br>
              <p> </p>
              <strong>Since the Bible clearly states that Solomon is the wisest man to ever live, logic should tell us that he would not be in error on such a fundamental issue like sin and atonement.</strong><strong></strong>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote><strong>2 Chronicles 6:36</strong> If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near; <strong>[37]</strong> Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly; <strong>[38]</strong> If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name: <strong>[39]</strong> Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee. <strong>[40]</strong> Now, my G-d, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place. (KJV)<br><br><strong>2 Chronicles 7:13</strong> If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people; <strong>[14]</strong> <span style="color: teal;">If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will <strong>I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin,</strong> and will heal their land.</span> (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <strong></strong><strong>And the Lord agreed.</strong><p></p>

              </span></p><h1>Blood Sacrifice</h1>
              <span style="color: #00008b;"><strong>"Then the LORD said, 'I do forgive, just as you have asked.'"</strong><br>Numbers 14:20 (NRS)</span><br>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And so, we are to believe that Jesus dying on the cross fulfilled the requirements of a blood sacrifice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are a number of requirements for a sacrifice to be valid or it is completely disqualified and will be an abomination to G-d. These requirements are as follows:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>1. The sin offering must be brought forth by the person seeking atonement, and slaughtered either by the sinner or by the priest.<br>2. Death must be caused by a sharp, perfect blade cutting across the neck, resulting in blood loss and swift death. <br>3. The offering must be physically unblemished.<br>4. In the case of mammal offerings (bulls, lambs, etc.) the offering must be less than one year old.<br>5. In the case of mammal offerings, the mammal must have cloven hooves and chew cud.<br>6. The sacrifice must be brought at the Temple <br>7. The sacrifice must have its blood taken by a priest and sprinkled on the altar.<br>8. The sacrifice must be salted.</blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since Jesus did not fulfill even one of the eight precepts listed above, it's clear that his death could not be the atoning sacrifice Christians claim it is.</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Deuteronomy 4:2</strong> <span style="color: teal;">Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish [ought] from it,</span> that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your G-d which I command you. (KJV)<br><br><strong>Deuteronomy 12:32</strong> What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: <span style="color: teal;">thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.</span> (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>Twice we see a prohibition of going against the Torah’s precepts. This should tell you it’s an important law to follow. Does G-d desire human sacrifice?</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Deuteronomy 12:31</strong> Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy G-d: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods. (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>So, we see just how highly the Almighty thinks of human sacrifice.</p>
              <p>The New Testament quoted the following Psalm:</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Psalms 40:6</strong> Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; <span style="color: teal;">mine ears hast thou opened:</span> burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required. (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>This Psalm carries an important message. Coupled with other verses from throughout the Bible, we learn that while G-d does place an importance on blood sacrifice, He puts more importance on penitence and the resolve to do better. This Psalm presented a theological problem for the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews:</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Hebrews 10:5</strong> Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, <span style="color: teal;">but a body hast thou prepared me:</span> [6] In burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin thou hast had no pleasure. (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>How does "mine ears hast thou opened" change to "but a body hast thou prepared me?" This is not the only time one will come across this kind of behavior went into the penning of the Epistle to the Hebrews, and the entire New Testament for that matter. How are we to trust a document that exhibits this sort of behavior?</p>
              <p>Christian apologists will argue that Jesus was unblemished of sin. To be frank, this dogma genuinely frightens me. This is the logic that pagan societies used in offering up their children in human sacrifices -- they reasoned that their children were sinless.</p>
              <p>The Diaspora was prophesied, such as in this passage:</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Hosea 3:4</strong> For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and [without] teraphim: <strong>[5]</strong> Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their G-d, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days. (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>Now, when we see this, a Christian will try to fix this into a problem for the Jews, saying, "but without blood sacrifice, how do you receive atonement for your sins?" After all, you have this verse below:</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Hebrews 9:22</strong> And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; <span style="color: teal;">and without shedding of blood is no remission.</span> (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>With this verse, the author successfully placed the new Christian theology outside of Judaism, because this in no way is a Jewish concept. Nowhere in the Jewish Scriptures do you find the message that without blood there is no remission. Time and time again, the prophets preached repentence and obedience, placing these things above sacrifice.</p>
              <blockquote><strong>1 Samuel 15:22</strong> And Samuel said, Hath the LORD [as great] delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? <span style="color: teal;">Behold, to obey [is] better than sacrifice, [and] to hearken than the fat of rams. </span>(KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>Given how often this theme is given (such as in the Psalm quoted above) the Christian position of there being no atonement without blood becomes a little puzzling. Hosea also gave a startling message that prayer can take the place of sacrifices:</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Hosea 14:1</strong> O Israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.<strong>[2]</strong> Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive [us] graciously: <span style="color: teal;">so will we render the calves of our lips. </span>(KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>Now, given the language that KJV used in its translation, this is likely rather confusing. For that reason, let us use the American Standard Version's translation:</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Hosea 14:1</strong> O Israel, return unto J---vah thy G-d; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity. <strong>[2]</strong>Take with you words, and return unto J---vah: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and accept that which is good: <span style="color: teal;">so will we render [as] bullocks [the offering of] our lips.</span> (ASV)</blockquote>
              <p>So, the prophet is telling us that prayer can substitute for sacrifice. Surely, this creates a dilemma for Christian theology, so let's see how they deal with this:</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Hosea 14:1</strong> Return, O Israel, to the Lord your G-d, For you have stumbled because of your iniquity. <strong>[2]</strong> Take words with you and return to the Lord. Say to Him, "Take away all iniquity And receive us graciously, That we may present the <span style="color: teal;">fruit of our lips. </span>(NAS)</blockquote>
              <p>So, we see that Christian Bible translators will resort to word changing. Are we to trust a translation that exhibits this sort of behavior?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who still believe that without blood, there is no atonement, think about the Babylonian Exile. The Jews committed sins that caused the first Temple to be destroyed and the citizenry to be exiled from the land of Israel. Do you really think that G-d would punish us for our sins in such a manner as which we would be unable to atone for them? G-d wouldn't set us up to fall forever into a pit. The only response I've ever gotten for this problem is "Jesus was offered to the Babylonian Exiles and that's how they got their atonement." This has no textual corroboration.</p>
              <br>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <strong>One of Christianity's Compelling Prooftexts</strong>
              <p> </p>
              <br>
              <p>Now we come to what Christians feel is the number one Torah prooftext that blood is the only means of sin expiation.</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Leviticus 17:11</strong> For the life of the flesh [is] in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it [is] the blood [that] maketh an atonement for the soul. (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>Those who find this a compelling proof should examine the verse more carefully. Like just about every other Christian prooftext, this one is flawed, and taken completely out of context. While this verse does illustrate an aspect of importance in blood sacrifice, nowhere does it say that blood is the only means of expiation. Also, notice the first word in this verse, "for." In other translations, you'll also find this translated as "because." Verse 11 is an explanation, not an imperative.</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Leviticus 17:10</strong> And whatsoever man [there be] of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people. <strong>[11]</strong> For the life of the flesh [is] in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it [is] the blood [that] maketh an atonement for the soul. <strong>[12]</strong> Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood,neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood. (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>It's the blood that makes atonement, as opposed to using the intestines, the kidneys, the brains the muscle tissue. It's the blood. So don't consume it. That's all there is to it. Additionally, if Christians are going to be context to take verse 11 out of context the way in which they do, they must take all of it. Verse 11 specifically says "upon the altar." A sacrifice without the priest taking the blood and sprinkling it on the altar is completely pointless. It's like a movie with a beginning, middle, but no ending.</p>
              <br><strong></strong><strong>Do you really need blood sacrifice?</strong><br><blockquote><strong>Psalms 51:16</strong> For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give [it]: thou delightest not in burnt offering. <strong>[17]</strong> The sacrifices of G-d [are] a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O G-d, thou wilt not despise. (KJV)<br><br><strong>Psalms 69:30</strong> I will praise the name of G-d with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving. <strong>[31]</strong> [This] also shall please the LORD better than an ox [or] bullock that hath horns and hoofs. (KJV)<br><br><strong>Proverbs 15:8</strong> The sacrifice of the wicked [is] an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright [is] His delight. <strong>[9]</strong> The way of the wicked [is] an abomination unto the LORD: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness. (KJV)<br><br><strong>Proverbs 16:6</strong> By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil. (KJV) <br><br><strong>Isaiah 58:3</strong> Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours. (KJV) <br><br><strong>Isaiah 58:5</strong> Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD? (KJV)</blockquote><br>
              <p> </p>
              See also Jeremiah 4:1-2, 7:3, 7:22-23, 25:5, 26:3-6, 36:3, 36:7, and 50:20!
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote><strong>Micah 7:18</strong> Who is a G-d like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy. [19] He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. [20] Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old. (KJV) <br><br><strong>Daniel 4:27</strong> Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity. (KJV)<br><br><br><strong>Exodus 30:16</strong> And thou shalt take the <span style="color: teal;"><strong>atonement money</strong></span><strong></strong> of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls. (KJV)</blockquote><br>
              <p> </p>
              <strong>Atonement money? Monetary sacrifice serves for atonement?</strong>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote><strong>Numbers 14:20</strong> And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word. (KJV)</blockquote><br>
              <p><strong>This verse makes it plainly clear that the Lord accepts prayer for expiation of sin.</strong></p>
              <blockquote><strong>Jonah 3:5</strong> So the people of Nineveh believed G-d, and <span style="color: teal;"><strong>proclaimed a fast,</strong></span><strong></strong> and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. <strong>[6]</strong> For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. <strong>[7]</strong> And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water: <strong>[8]</strong> But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto G-d: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands. <strong>[9]</strong> Who can tell if G-d will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not? <strong>[10]</strong> <span style="color: teal;">And G-d saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and G-d repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not.</span> (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <strong>Nineveh was forgiven of their evil deeds by fasting and repentance, and without sacrifice.</strong>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote><strong>Jonah 4:10</strong> Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night: <strong>[11]</strong>And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle? (KJV) <br><br><strong>2 Chronicles 6:24</strong> And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house; <strong>[25]</strong> <span style="color: teal;">Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.</span> <strong>[26]</strong> When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them; <strong>[27]</strong> <span style="color: teal;">Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants,</span> and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance. <strong>[28]</strong> If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be: <strong>[29]</strong> Then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house: <strong>[30]</strong>Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou knowest the hearts of the children of men) <strong>[31]</strong> That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers. (KJV)</blockquote><br>
              <p> </p>
              <strong>Since the Bible clearly states that Solomon is the wisest man to ever live, logic should tell us that he would not be in error on such a fundamental issue like sin and atonement.</strong><strong></strong>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote><strong>2 Chronicles 6:36</strong> If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near; <strong>[37]</strong> Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly; <strong>[38]</strong> If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name: <strong>[39]</strong> Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee. <strong>[40]</strong> Now, my G-d, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place. (KJV)<br><br><strong>2 Chronicles 7:13</strong> If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people; <strong>[14]</strong> <span style="color: teal;">If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will <strong>I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin,</strong> and will heal their land.</span> (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p><strong></strong></p>

              <p>Buddha said all Gods exist. There are many levels of heaven and many levels of hell. I believe what he said or else there will not be so many followers in all the religion. If their prayers are not answered by their God, do you think they will still stick to their faith ? Anyway, heaven is till within the 6 reincarnation path and that is not my ultimate place to go.</p>

              <p>buddha is not normal and shouldnt be in this thtread in the first place. he's not married and hence knows nothing of responsiblity. And he generalises everything, like a self help book. Life is definitely more than that brudder.</p>
              <p>might as well bring in sai baba. At least his afro looks trendy.</p>
