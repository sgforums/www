              <p>vulgarities? how do you define what is good and evil? does retorting a person sinful? Off course not? But if a person lies and not answer questions when posted, taunts and try to bring down another thread illogically. that is a sin too?</p>
              <p>You talk rubbish and questions what is rigtheousness (lawful)?</p>
              <p>then read the law and you know what is a nice person or not. In fact its Christianity that tries to hide the goodness of gods law to the world and thats why the world is full of bad people like yourself.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself. Why are people with this behaviour in this thread? you try to prove that god of israel doesnt exist yet, fro what i can see, you dont even bother to read the book or discuss to enquire. WHO IS THE WICKED (unlawful) one here. I am here to teach and you are here to disrupt.</p>
              <h1>Love Your Enemy?</h1>
              <span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>"You shall not take vengeance or bear
              a grudge against any of your people, but you shall love your neighbor
              as yourself: I am the LORD."</strong><br> Leviticus 19:18 (NRS)</span>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here we shall examine some of the ethics in the New Testament.</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Matthew 5:43</strong> Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. [44] But I say unto you, <span style="color: teal;">Love your enemies,</span> bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for
              them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>Who would follow this? Love your enemy? Sure, it's noble, but it's
              not practical. It's even more noble if the person who preaches it
              actually follows it. However, an examination of the Gospels will show
              this philosophy to be not only impractical, but also, in practice,
              makes Jesus into a hypocrite. Let's look at another excerpt from this
              chapter of Matthew:</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Matthew 5:21</strong> Ye have heard that it was said by them
              of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in
              danger of the judgment: [22] But I say unto you, That whosoever is
              angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the
              judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in
              danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, <span style="color: teal;">Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. </span>(KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>Conceptually, this portion which I highlighted, is basically good.
              Let's see if Jesus practiced what he preached when he spoke:</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Matthew 23:17</strong> <span style="color: teal;"><strong>[Ye] fools</strong></span> and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold? (KJV)<br><br> <strong>Luke 11:40</strong> <span style="color: teal;"><strong>[Ye] fools,</strong></span> did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also? (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>This is the same Jesus who called the Pharisees hypocrites. Did
              Jesus love his enemies? Did he love the Pharisees who are completely
              villified for not believing in Jesus?</p>
              <blockquote><strong>John 8:44</strong> <span style="color: teal;">Ye are of [your] father the devil, </span>and
              the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the
              beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in
              him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar,
              and the father of it. (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>Jesus loved his neighbors until they opposed him and became his
              enemies. And then he didn't even follow his own advice of loving them.</p>
              <p>And what of Paul? Did he follow Jesus' teachings? After all, he
              claimed to be closest to Jesus spiritually, even though he never met
              Jesus.</p>
              <blockquote><strong>1 Thessalonians 2:14</strong> For you, brethren, became
              imitators of the churches of G-d in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, for
              you also endured the same sufferings at the hands of your own
              countrymen, even as they did from the Jews, [15] who both killed the
              Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out. <span style="color: teal;">They are not pleasing to G-d, but hostile to all men, </span>(NAS)</blockquote>
              <p>KJV's rendering slightly different, saying "contrary to all men."
              NAS, on the other hand, is a bit more severe. Defaming the Jews,
              claiming we're "hostile to all men," is hardly the sign of a person who
              loves his enemies.</p>
              <p>"Love your enemy" is a completely impractical and foolish precept.
              Few Christians follow it, and the ones who do follow it are the ones
              who are unwilling to do anything when evil is confronting them. These
              are the ones who would rather sit back and hope for the best, instead
              of standing upright and righting the wrongs in society.</p>
              <blockquote><strong>John 8:7</strong> So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, <span style="color: teal;">He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. </span>(KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>If we were to implement this ethic, we would end up with a society
              full of people who when push comes to shove are unwilling to stand up
              and do what's right. How are to we to have punishment for crimes in
              this world if we bind ourselves like this? How are we to even try to
              achieve justice if we follow this ethic? What kind of world does it
              create?</p>

              <p>So you are not only a creep but also try to be cunning with your words? you should ask yourself instead of me. what is your purpose to enter into this religious forum first let alone into this thread. you are not contributing but trying to destroy the thread and topic.</p>
              <p>Actually, my curiosity is what do you stand to gain by doing this. Are you being paid to do this? The other option is that you are a very sad and bitter person.</p>

              <p>I am a very honest and fair person and let me tell those who are convinced in their minds that god of israel doesnt exist or spirits at large is this - I fully can emphatize and know your argument.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The reason is simple - if god doesnt appear infront of you and tell you he is the one showing wonders and prophecy to come true, who can have enough faith in this corrupt world we are living.</p>
              <p>I can only tell my story, that is I was once like that, a very skeptical and cynical person like yourself. But my life was very poor and I was lost and questioned life to the very core. I read the bible beyond the bullshit christian standard of understanding the scripture. And one day I encountered god's booming voice of prohpecy and it came true.</p>
              <p>If you want to mess with me its ok. But I tell you if you are good in your heart. and trully look for the meaning of life. God wont be far away. That is what I believe. I am aware enough this world have evil people who even if god were to appear in a fire and cloud and spoke to them they would still sin as how it happened in the book.</p>
              <p>So I say, choose your paths and move on. A human is gifted with the choice to make in the life given to him and everyone has a destiny.</p>

              <p>Youyayu,</p>
              <p>Btw, do yu know the State and Christianity are the same people? especially the catholics...its good that you don't like the PAP policy as I can see in your threads, I dont like them too especially the inflated housing prices pushing first timers us out of our need to have a family.</p>
              <p>Don't be conned by thinking the torah is part of the chrisitainity crap. In fact, its christianity that make normal people turn away from hope and good way of living.</p>
              <p>Chrisitianity, when all else fails - and they eventually do - ends up speaking in tongues like some tang ki. Why, because the pastor knows he cant keep up with the contradiction much longer and ends up with spiritual mumbo jumbo. </p>
              <p>Whenever, I was caught up in a prayer session in the past and end up being goaded by "leaders" to speak in tongues like the rest of the innoccent clueless, I end up getting pissed and wanted to bash everyone up. What fucking evil is this. Beware, those who are new to chrisitianity, stay away. Its truly a cult in disguise by borrowing some of the clear simple good laws of god and turning it confusing parables.</p>

              <p>BUt the point is have you read the bible or the website yet
              which is the decent proposal i made in the thread until the likes
              of you comes in and taunt ppl.</p>
              <p>So you are not only a creep but also try to be cunning with your
              words? you should ask yourself instead of me. what is your purpose
              to enter into this religious forum first let alone into this
              thread. you are not contributing but trying to destroy the thread
              and topic.</p>
              <p>Actually, my curiosity is what do you stand to gain by doing
              this. Are you being paid to do this? The other option is that you
              are a very sad and bitter person.</p>

              <p>Cunning with what words? You obviously agreed with Herzog_Zwei that "<strong>religion is
                                      nonsense</strong> to hoodwink the simple people" when you said "and they did it to millions....blah...blah...blah..."</p>
              <p>If not, can you explain? Why not admit that you made a mistake instead of accusing others for being "cunning with words" ?</p>
              <p>Isn't honesty what you said you are about?</p>
              <p>Ha....what kind of decency have you shown here? Seems like you are the only sore person around and your actions proved them to be so. You are a shame for Judaism...</p>

              <p>Are you retarded? your england F9? Firstly, Herzog_Zwei sentence structure is broken and thus has no meaning by its own. go read it again. or does your knee jerk faster than your soft brain</p>
              <p>who's the fool here?</p>
              <p>Me being kind enough NOT to point that out, proceed to agree with the crux of his intention meaning religion as in those that are devious thus hoodwink. BTW, judaism is not a religion, if you bothered, everything they do is in guided in the book. thats a way of like, not sunday talk cock sing song, old losers trying to flirt with young converts. yah, christianity. </p>

              <p>Are you retarded? your england F9? Firstly, Herzog_Zwei sentence
              structure is broken and thus has no meaning by its own. go read it
              again. or does your knee jerk faster than your soft brain</p>
              <p>who's the fool here?</p>
              <p>Me being kind enough NOT to point that out, proceed to agree
              with the crux of his intention meaning religion as in those that
              are devious thus hoodwink. BTW, judaism is not a religion, if you
              bothered, everything they do is in guided in the book. thats a way
              of like, not sunday talk cock sing song, old losers trying to flirt
              with young converts. yah, christianity. </p>

              <p>Herzog_Zwei said  "<strong>religion is nonsense</strong> to hoodwink the simple
                                      people" and you said "<strong>and they did it to
                                      millions</strong>." .....and then said you did not agree....Quite obvious ya?</p>
