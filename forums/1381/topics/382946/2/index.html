              <p>I dont agree with Herzog_Zwei. However, its ok. I am here to
              reclaim the understanding of God but to put a stop to christianity
              obvious tactical preaching to believers which naturally will make
              them alienate life further and ultimately dont belief in God like
              some here has rightfully voiced out. They are half right that
              christianity is full of lies and contradiction - they have done
              their research and common sense do prevail. But if they dont hold a
              grudge against god and persist further to read in detail the torah
              or what the christians try to make it insignificant as possible
              "OLD" testament (god say my LAW is FOREVER and they sneakily say
              old) - they will find that GOD of torah is the ultimate one and no
              other dared to declare so(im open to other religions discussion to
              post here if they have info on supremacy claims).</p>
              <p>BTW, i am open for opinions still cos I am humble enough to
              listen and discuss. This open mentality has not only freed me from
              christianity's vicious programming stronghold of verses on peoples
              reading and understanding, it has led me finally back to God.</p>
              <p>An an example of truth - do you know if you follow the dietary
              laws in the deuteronomy chapters, your health will improve
              trememdously? dont have to believe me. try it yourself.</p>
              <p>And when you realise its good for you, you wonder - why you
              anyhow eat what Apostle peter's strange say in a dream of animals
              dropping down from heaven verses? blindly eating pork and shell
              fish and all that is unclean. End up having a high chance of cancer
              and go to Jesus and pray for miracle. Do you get the flaw of
              christian's teachings? </p>

              <p>Herzog_Zwei made a simple statement : "<strong>Simply put, religion is nonsense to hoodwink the simple

              <p>And your response was : " and they did it to millions........."</p>

              <p>Second :</p>
              <p>either you join in and discuss or I have no choice to politely

              <p>It highly possible you guys are from that special club, you know
              the arrogant symbol in the back of the US one dollar bill ppl. If
              you are then I really cant imagine when judgement day comes.
              Because you are not the slightest curious about the english text
              cheating in the bible which showed that the jews are the final ppl
              to ask.</p>
              <p>Instead you jump to from</p>
              <p>point A: reject christianity</p>
              <p>to point C: god is not real.</p>
              <p>and conveniently side step the most important point B:  so
              what are the righteous jews finally telling us in their website.
              Hello? The jews wrote the book. the christian hijack it.</p>

              <p>Herzog_Zwei,</p>
              <p>Ahhh, slowly showing your horns eh.this will be the moment I will start ignore fools lest i be the fool.</p>
              <p>All of you either idiots or damn sinister, bcos none you even want to discuss so much evidence on messiahtruth.com which showed many brilliant exposing of christianity downright contradiction conveniently summarized for you in the first page. Not even one comment?eh brudders, too obvious la.</p>
              <p>Dont worry. I will start the ball rolling for those others who have bothered about the bible accuracy good for you. cos I am very sure www.messiahtruth.com is direct and cut to the chase...</p>
              <p>I will start with a brilliant topic on jesus genealogy</p>
              <h1>Jesus' Genealogy</h1>
              <span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>"And not to occupy themselves with
              myths and endless genealogies that promote speculations rather than the
              divine training that is known by faith."</strong><br> 1 Timothy 1:4 (NRS)</span>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most Christians are not learned in Jewish law, and are thus unaware
              of the triune (pardon the expression) nature of the genealogical
              problem associated with claiming Jesus as the Messiah. However, since
              the Christian claim is that Jesus is the JEWISH Messiah, then we must
              put the case under JEWISH scrutiny, and see if it fits under JEWISH
              law. The following is an examination of the genealogy of the man whom
              Christians call Lord and Savior.</p>
              <p>Messiah is an anglicized version of the Hebrew word "Moshiach,"
              which means "anointed." We call the future king the Messiah because all
              kings are anointed.</p>
              <p>One of the simplest requirements for being the Messiah is the
              lineage. In the Jewish scriptures we see prophecies of a king from
              David's line sitting on the throne of Israel once more:</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Jeremiah 30:7</strong> Alas! for that day [is] great, so that
              none [is] like it: it [is] even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he
              shall be saved out of it. [8] For it shall come to pass in that day,
              saith the LORD of hosts, [that] I will break his yoke from off thy
              neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve
              themselves of him: [9] But they shall serve the LORD their G-d, <span style="color: teal;">and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.</span> (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>David had been given an oath from the Almighty that the throne of
              Israel would always belong to his line, which we find in the Jewish
              Bible repeatedly:</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Jeremiah 33:17</strong> For thus said HASHEM: <span style="color: teal;">There shall not be cut off from David a man who sits on the throne</span> of the House of Israel. [18] And for the Kohanim, the Levites, there
              will never be cut off a man from before Me who offers
              elevation-offerings and burns meal-offerings and performs
              feast-offerings all the days. [19] The word of HASHEM came to Jeremiah,
              saying: [20] Thus said HASHEM: If you could annul My covenant with the
              day and My covenant with the night, so that day and night would not
              come in their proper times, [21] so too could My covenant be annulled
              with David, My servant, so that he would not have a descendant reigning
              on his throne, or [My covenant] with the Levites and the Kohanim, My
              attendants. (Artscroll)<br><br> <strong>Psalms 89:34</strong> <span style="color: teal;">My covenant will I not break,</span> nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. [35] Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David. [36] <span style="color: teal;">His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.</span> [37] It shall be established for ever as the moon, and [as] a faithful witness in heaven. Selah. (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>So, from here we see that G-d took an oath that the throne would
              always belong to David and his descendants. However, the oath was
              supplemented by another pledge:</p>
              <blockquote><strong>1 Chronicles 22:9</strong> Behold, a son shall be born to
              thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his
              enemies round about: for his name shall be <span style="color: teal;"><strong>Solomon,</strong></span> and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days. [10] He
              shall build a house for my name; and he shall be My son, and I [will
              be] his Father; and <span style="color: teal;">I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.</span> (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>So we see, any man who would sit on the throne must not only be a
              descendant of King David, but specifically a descendant of David’s son,
              Solomon. This requirement was made even more stringent in the days
              prior to the Babylonian exile. Jeconiah, King of Judah, was a wicked
              king, and his actions pushed G-d too far. G-d punished Jeconiah, also
              known as Jehoiachin or Coniah:</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Jeremiah 22:24</strong> [As] I live, saith the LORD, though
              Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right
              hand, yet would I pluck thee thence; [25] And I will give thee into the
              hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand [of them] whose face
              thou fearest, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and
              into the hand of the Chaldeans. [26] And I will cast thee out, and thy
              mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born;
              and there shall ye die. [27] But to the land whereunto they desire to
              return, thither shall they not return. [28] [Is] this man Coniah a
              despised broken idol? [is he] a vessel wherein [is] no pleasure?
              Wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land
              which they know not? [29] O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the
              LORD. [30] Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man
              [that] shall not prosper in his days: <span style="color: teal;">for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah. </span>(KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>This devastating curse effectively removes all descendants of
              Jeconiah from the royal line. So from the verses listed above we see
              that anyone who would sit as king must be descended from King Solomon
              but not descended from King Jeconiah. We see that this curse is
              binding, because after Jeconiah was deposed, instead of the throne
              being handed to his son, it passed to Zedekiah, his uncle. No
              descendant of Jeconiah ever held the throne, or ever can hold the
              throne. His grandson, Zerubbabel, held power granted by G-d, but was
              never king.</p>
              <p>The New Testament makes the messianic claim for Jesus, and as such,
              the New Testament gives a detailed genealogy in the first chapter of
              the very first book, the Gospel of Matthew:</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Matthew 1:1</strong> The book of the generation of Jesus
              Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. [2] Abraham begat Isaac;
              and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren; [3] And
              Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and
              Esrom begat Aram; [4] And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat
              Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon; [5] And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab;
              and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; [6] And Jesse begat
              David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her [that had been
              the wife] of Urias; [7] And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat
              Abia; and Abia begat Asa; [8] And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat
              begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias; [9] And Ozias begat Joatham; and
              Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias; [10] And Ezekias begat
              Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias; [11] And
              Josias begat <span style="color: teal;"><strong>Jechonias</strong></span> and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon: (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>Matthew defeated his own purpose by including Jeconiah (spelled
              Jechonias by the KJV) in his listing. Further complicating this matter
              is the virgin birth, which is claimed by Matthew 1:18-23. Because the
              virgin birth is substantiated by a misused excerpt of Isaiah (see <a href="http://messiahtruth.com/isaiah7.html">related essay</a>)
              there is no reason to believe that it was actually prophesied, and even
              less to believe it to be true. Furthermore, it defeats the claim that
              Jesus is the Messiah. In Jewish law, genealogy is traced specifically
              through the father, not the mother.</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Numbers 1:2</strong> Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, <span style="color: teal;">by the house of their fathers,</span> with the number of [their] names, every male by their polls; (KJV) <br><br> <strong>Numbers 1:18</strong> And they assembled all the congregation together on
              the first [day] of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees
              after their families, <span style="color: teal;">by the house of their fathers,</span> according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls. (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>With genealogies in the Bible, we see person A, son of person B, son
              of person C, etc. This is because Jewish descent is traced through our
              fathers. If a Levitical priest married a woman from the tribe of Judah,
              their children would be of the tribe of Levi.</p>
              <p>Not having a human father prevents anyone from claiming the throne.</p>
              <h2>The Christian Rebuttal</h2>
              <p>Different Christians have shown a great deal of savvy in trying to
              deflect attention away from the two gaping problems listed above. None
              of their solutions, however, hold water. Here are some samples:</p>
              <p><strong>1)</strong> The virgin birth prevents Joseph from passing on his
              cursed lineage to Jesus, thereby allowing Jesus to sit on the throne.
              This is the answer proposed by apologists like Josh McDowell. Because
              the virgin birth undermines the notion of Jesus being the Messiah, one
              is <strong>forced</strong> to consider this as if Joseph passed on the genealogy through rights of adoption, even though such rights do not exist. <br><br> <strong>2)</strong> The claim is made that the curse was not to be taken
              literally. The beginning of Jeremiah 22:30 reads "Write ye this man
              childless, a man [that] shall not prosper in his days..." From this
              they point to the fact that Jeconiah did know prosperity, and that he
              did indeed have children, so that means G-d didn’t mean the curse to be
              as devastating as it actually is. This is pointing away from the end of
              verse 30. "For no man of his seed shall prosper, <span style="color: teal;">sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more</span> in Judah." This portion of the verse makes it clear what was meant.
              Jeconiah did indeed have children, but those children would be
              forbidden from sitting on the throne. "Write ye this man childless" is
              simply a metaphor here. <br><br> <strong>3)</strong> The claim is made that the curse was annulled by G-d. Christians refer to the following passage:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote><strong>Haggai 2:23</strong> In that day, saith the LORD of
              hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of
              Shealtiel, saith the LORD, and will make thee as a signet: for I have
              chosen thee, saith the LORD of hosts. (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>G-d used the same term with Zerubbabel, a descendant of Jeconiah,
              that He used with Jeconiah, a "signet ring." Christians conclude from
              this that the curse was annulled. However, a closer examination will
              reveal that this is certainly not the case. The curse begins with an
              oath. "As I live, saith the LORD." How does the Lord live? He lives
              eternally. G-d did indeed show favor to Zerubbabel, and might even have
              instated Zerubbabel as king, <em>if not for the curse the Almighty placed on Jeconiah.</em> The Almighty took oaths. Are we to believe that the Almighty would revoke His oaths? The problem with this is twofold.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>a. If the virgin birth is true (which is less likely
              than I can adequately describe, given that a mistranslated prophecy was
              taken out of context to "prove" it) that would mean that G-d took the
              throne away from David’s house, which would mean G-d violated an oath. <br><br> b. The curse of Jeconiah taints Joseph’s line, so that if you theorize
              adoption (which is without scriptural backing or precedent) you trace
              Joseph back to Jeconiah, cursed by G-d under another of G-d’s oaths. </blockquote>
              <p><strong>4)</strong> Another Christian proposed a solution to this problem
              along the lines of "Don’t you think G-d would have it in His heart to
              show mercy to Jeconiah’s line?" My answer is two-fold: a) NO, it was a
              curse, and we see that it was eternal by the fact that none of
              Jeconiah’s descendants sat on the throne. b) If you theorize that G-d
              showed mercy provide your evidence within the text. <span style="color: teal;">The needs of Christian theology predicate this solution, rather than the facts. </span><br><br> <strong>5)</strong> Christians believe they have found the answer to this problem
              with the following: In chapter three of the Gospel of Luke, we see a
              genealogy of Jesus which lacks Jeconiah in the listing. Strangely
              enough, this genealogy is attributed to Joseph as well. Apologists have
              asserted that this is the genealogy of Mary. They claim that it is
              through Mary’s line that Jesus is linked to David, and thus the virgin
              birth problem and the Jeconiah problem are solved, right?</p>
              <p>Wrong. Let us explain why this is not a viable solution:</p>
              <blockquote>1) The genealogy in Luke’s Gospel specifically says Joseph, not Mary. <br><br> 2) The genealogy of Mary is completely irrelevant, as lineage is through the father, not the mother. <br><br> 3) Luke made a critical gaff in his genealogical listing. The listing doesn’t include King Solomon: </blockquote> <blockquote><strong>Luke 3:31</strong> Which was [the son] of Melea, which was [the son] of Menan, which was [the son] of Mattatha, which was [the son] of <span style="color: teal;"><strong>Nathan,</strong> which was [the son] of David,</span> (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>Luke’s listing proclaims Jesus the descendant of Nathan, not
              Solomon, making Luke’s genealogy a disqualifying factor as well. (See 1
              Chronicles 22 excerpt above) BOTH genealogies we find in the New
              Testament Jesus from being the Messiah.</p>
              <blockquote><strong>1 Timothy 1:4</strong> <span style="color: teal;">Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions,</span> rather than godly edifying which is in faith: [so do].  (KJV)</blockquote>
              <p>Why is this verse here, if not to get people to point away from the fairly obvious problems the gospels contain?</p>
              <h2>In Summation:</h2>
              <p>1) If the virgin birth is true (which is highly unlikely since it
              goes against the grain of supporting Jesus’ messianic claim) then Jesus
              cannot be the Messiah. <br><br> 2) If you trace Jesus' line through Joseph (by which you claim Jesus
              inherits the throne by adoption) in Matthew's genealogy, then you run
              into the curse of Jeconiah, and Jesus cannot be the Messiah. <br><br> 3) If you trace Jesus’ line through Luke's genealogy (regardless of
              whether you attribute it to Joseph or Mary) Jesus cannot be the Messiah
              because it doesn't include King Solomon; it includes his brother,
              Nathan, eliminating any legitimate claim to the throne.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <span style="color: teal;">Jesus' genealogy, as we have it in the Christian Scriptures, does not allow him to be the Messiah.  <strong>This point cannot be stressed strongly enough.</strong> No other "prophecies" one thinks Jesus fulfilled are relevant without this crucial brick in the wall.</span>

              <p>I will start with a brilliant topic on jesus genealogy</p>
              <h1>Jesus' Genealogy</h1>
              <p><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>"And not to occupy
              themselves with myths and endless genealogies that promote
              speculations rather than the divine training that is known by
              faith."</strong><br> 1 Timothy 1:4 (NRS)</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most Christians are not learned in Jewish law, and are thus
              unaware of the triune (pardon the expression) nature of the
              genealogical problem associated with claiming Jesus as the Messiah.
              However, since the Christian claim is that Jesus is the JEWISH
              Messiah, then we must put the case under JEWISH scrutiny, and see
              if it fits under JEWISH law. The following is an examination of the
              genealogy of the man whom Christians call Lord and Savior.</p>
              <p>Messiah is an anglicized version of the Hebrew word "Moshiach,"
              which means "anointed." We call the future king the Messiah because
              all kings are anointed.</p>
              <p>One of the simplest requirements for being the Messiah is the
              lineage. In the Jewish scriptures we see prophecies of a king from
              David's line sitting on the throne of Israel once more:</p>
              <p>David had been given an oath from the Almighty that the throne
              of Israel would always belong to his line, which we find in the
              Jewish Bible repeatedly:</p>
              <p>So, from here we see that G-d took an oath that the throne would
              always belong to David and his descendants. However, the oath was
              supplemented by another pledge:</p>
              <p>So we see, any man who would sit on the throne must not only be
              a descendant of King David, but specifically a descendant of
              David’s son, Solomon. This requirement was made even more stringent
              in the days prior to the Babylonian exile. Jeconiah, King of Judah,
              was a wicked king, and his actions pushed G-d too far. G-d punished
              Jeconiah, also known as Jehoiachin or Coniah:</p>
              <p>This devastating curse effectively removes all descendants of
              Jeconiah from the royal line. So from the verses listed above we
              see that anyone who would sit as king must be descended from King
              Solomon but not descended from King Jeconiah. We see that this
              curse is binding, because after Jeconiah was deposed, instead of
              the throne being handed to his son, it passed to Zedekiah, his
              uncle. No descendant of Jeconiah ever held the throne, or ever can
              hold the throne. His grandson, Zerubbabel, held power granted by
              G-d, but was never king.</p>
              <p>The New Testament makes the messianic claim for Jesus, and as
              such, the New Testament gives a detailed genealogy in the first
              chapter of the very first book, the Gospel of Matthew:</p>
              <p>Matthew defeated his own purpose by including Jeconiah (spelled
              Jechonias by the KJV) in his listing. Further complicating this
              matter is the virgin birth, which is claimed by Matthew 1:18-23.
              Because the virgin birth is substantiated by a misused excerpt of
              Isaiah (see <a rel="nofollow" href="http://messiahtruth.com/isaiah7.html">related essay</a>) there is no reason to believe that it
              was actually prophesied, and even less to believe it to be true.
              Furthermore, it defeats the claim that Jesus is the Messiah. In
              Jewish law, genealogy is traced specifically through the father,
              not the mother.</p>
              <p>With genealogies in the Bible, we see person A, son of person B,
              son of person C, etc. This is because Jewish descent is traced
              through our fathers. If a Levitical priest married a woman from the
              tribe of Judah, their children would be of the tribe of Levi.</p>
              <p>Not having a human father prevents anyone from claiming the
              throne.</p>
              <h2>The Christian Rebuttal</h2>
              <p>Different Christians have shown a great deal of savvy in trying
              to deflect attention away from the two gaping problems listed
              above. None of their solutions, however, hold water. Here are some
              samples:</p>
              <p><strong>1)</strong> The virgin birth prevents Joseph from
              passing on his cursed lineage to Jesus, thereby allowing Jesus to
              sit on the throne. This is the answer proposed by apologists like
              Josh McDowell. Because the virgin birth undermines the notion of
              Jesus being the Messiah, one is <strong>forced</strong> to consider
              this as if Joseph passed on the genealogy through rights of
              adoption, even though such rights do not exist.<br> <br> <strong>2)</strong> The claim is made that the curse was not to be
              taken literally. The beginning of Jeremiah 22:30 reads "Write ye
              this man childless, a man [that] shall not prosper in his days..."
              From this they point to the fact that Jeconiah did know prosperity,
              and that he did indeed have children, so that means G-d didn’t mean
              the curse to be as devastating as it actually is. This is pointing
              away from the end of verse 30. "For no man of his seed shall
              prosper, <span style="color: teal;">sitting upon the throne of
              David, and ruling any more</span> in Judah." This portion of the
              verse makes it clear what was meant. Jeconiah did indeed have
              children, but those children would be forbidden from sitting on the
              throne. "Write ye this man childless" is simply a metaphor
              here.<br> <br> <strong>3)</strong> The claim is made that the curse was annulled
              by G-d. Christians refer to the following passage:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>G-d used the same term with Zerubbabel, a descendant of
              Jeconiah, that He used with Jeconiah, a "signet ring." Christians
              conclude from this that the curse was annulled. However, a closer
              examination will reveal that this is certainly not the case. The
              curse begins with an oath. "As I live, saith the LORD." How does
              the Lord live? He lives eternally. G-d did indeed show favor to
              Zerubbabel, and might even have instated Zerubbabel as king, <em>if
              not for the curse the Almighty placed on Jeconiah.</em> The
              Almighty took oaths. Are we to believe that the Almighty would
              revoke His oaths? The problem with this is twofold.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>4)</strong> Another Christian proposed a solution to
              this problem along the lines of "Don’t you think G-d would have it
              in His heart to show mercy to Jeconiah’s line?" My answer is
              two-fold: a) NO, it was a curse, and we see that it was eternal by
              the fact that none of Jeconiah’s descendants sat on the throne. b)
              If you theorize that G-d showed mercy provide your evidence within
              the text. <span style="color: teal;">The needs of Christian
              theology predicate this solution, rather than the
              facts.</span><br> <br> <strong>5)</strong> Christians believe they have found the answer
              to this problem with the following: In chapter three of the Gospel
              of Luke, we see a genealogy of Jesus which lacks Jeconiah in the
              listing. Strangely enough, this genealogy is attributed to Joseph
              as well. Apologists have asserted that this is the genealogy of
              Mary. They claim that it is through Mary’s line that Jesus is
              linked to David, and thus the virgin birth problem and the Jeconiah
              problem are solved, right?</p>
              <p>Wrong. Let us explain why this is not a viable solution:</p>
              <p>Luke’s listing proclaims Jesus the descendant of Nathan, not
              Solomon, making Luke’s genealogy a disqualifying factor as well.
              (See 1 Chronicles 22 excerpt above) BOTH genealogies we find in the
              New Testament Jesus from being the Messiah.</p>
              <p>Why is this verse here, if not to get people to point away from
              the fairly obvious problems the gospels contain?</p>
              <h2>In Summation:</h2>
              <p>1) If the virgin birth is true (which is highly unlikely since
              it goes against the grain of supporting Jesus’ messianic claim)
              then Jesus cannot be the Messiah.<br> <br> 2) If you trace Jesus' line through Joseph (by which you claim
              Jesus inherits the throne by adoption) in Matthew's genealogy, then
              you run into the curse of Jeconiah, and Jesus cannot be the
              Messiah.<br> <br> 3) If you trace Jesus’ line through Luke's genealogy (regardless of
              whether you attribute it to Joseph or Mary) Jesus cannot be the
              Messiah because it doesn't include King Solomon; it includes his
              brother, Nathan, eliminating any legitimate claim to the
              throne.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: teal;">Jesus' genealogy, as we have it in
              the Christian Scriptures, does not allow him to be the Messiah.
              <strong>This point cannot be stressed strongly enough.</strong> No
              other "prophecies" one thinks Jesus fulfilled are relevant without
              this crucial brick in the wall.</span></p>

              <b>"And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus
              thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have
              talked with you from heaven."</b><br> Exodus 20:22 (KJV)<p>
              <br></p>
              
              
              
              <p>Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all make claims of miraculous
              events. Because all three religions are diametrically opposed to one
              another, we need to examine the fundamentals of all three, examine
              their differences, and determine what makes them different, and what
              makes the claims of one of the three the most likely to be true.
              Proving G-dâ€™s existence is not something that can be done objectively, but the <i>likelihood</i> of His existence can be.  Likewise, we can use similar logic and determine which of the three religions is most likely the truth. <br><br>
              You can divide all the religions this planet has ever known and put
              them into two categories: those that claim national revelation, and
              those that claim personal revelation. Obviously, national revelation is
              more convincing and more believable than personal revelation, or the
              claims of revelation made by a small group of people. <br><br>
              How many religions in the history of this planet make the claim of
              revelation based on one or a small group of people? If you study world
              religions carefully, youâ€™ll find that this category includes every
              religion except one. What is the one religion to make the claim of
              national revelation? </p><p>
              
              
              
              </p><h3>
              IT IS JUDAISM<br></h3>
              
              <p></p><p>Judaism is the only faith that comes from the line of "you all
              saw what happened here today, so tell your children, and their
              children." All the other religions are of the "I (or the few of us)
              know the good news, now we have to tell everyone else." This is not
              very convincing, especially when you try to take into account that it
              groups together with every other religion on the planet. Take a moment
              to absorb how powerful a fact that is. There are those who would say
              that this is not a big deal, that anyone could have faked a nation-wide
              revelation. This is simply not logical. If it were possible to fool an
              entire national population into believing they had witnessed something
              they had not in fact witnessed, surely other religions would claim such
              miracles. <br><br>
              Let us examine this from another angle. If the religion that later came
              to be called Judaism was based simply on the miracles recorded in the
              Book of Genesis (the flood which left only a handful of witnesses
              according to its own account, the destruction of Sodom and Gemorrah
              which was only witnessed by a few people according to that account as
              well) it would be no different than the other religions of this planet. Judaism simply would not have been founded on a basis of proof any more credible than others. <br><br>
              
              However, the events in the Book of Exodus successfully set Judaism apart from the rest. </p>
                
              
              <blockquote><b>Exodus 12:37</b> And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children. [38] And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle. (KJV)</blockquote>
              
              <p>We see that there were six hundred thousand Jewish men, not counting
              women, children, and the Egyptians who joined the people, described in
              verse 38 as a mixed multitude. Considering that having more than one
              wife was the norm of the time, and that each family likely had many
              children, we are easily talking about (in the least) over a million
              people. <br><br>
              Why is noting this so important? The answer is simple. Imagine youâ€™re
              sitting in school one day, and the kid sitting next to you tells you
              that your grandfather, and the grandfathers of all your friends saw
              great tremendous plagues in Egypt, and saw an entire sea split with
              walls on both side, the ground becoming dry, and all the people walking
              through it. The first thing that would come to mind is Thatâ€™s amazing!
              I wonder why my grandfather never told me that! Upon asking, your
              friend tells you his grandfather told him the story. When you go home
              and ask your parents about it, you find out that your friendâ€™s
              grandfather is a senile 90 year-old man. It
              is simply impossible for an entire national population to come up with
              a collective memory of an event like the exodus unless it had happened. <br><br>
              When the Lord spoke to Moses from amidst the burning bush, the
              Israelites only found reason to believe his claims once signs had been
              shown to them that they experienced it personally. Moreover, the events
              of the exodus, the splitting of the sea, the receiving of the Torah at
              Mount Sinai, were things the entire population collectively
              experienced, giving the proof to them firsthand, instead of having to
              rely on tales told to them by others. While the argument can be made
              that with the first generation dying in the desert with the demise of
              all first-hand witnesses the claim goes up in smoke, the entire next
              generation was given the testimony of those first hand witnesses, and
              that entire second generation believed because the entire first
              generation couldnâ€™t have conspired a story that big. The second
              generation itself was the proof that the witness of the first was
              reliable. </p>
                
              
              <blockquote><b>Exodus 14:30</b> Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out
              of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon
              the sea shore. [31] And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did
              upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses. (KJV)</blockquote>
              
              <p>Exodus 14:30-31 shows us that after the splitting of the Red Sea
              only then did the people believe in the Lord and believe that Moses
              spoke for Him. </p>
                
              
              <blockquote><b>Exodus 19:9</b> And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud,  that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD. (KJV)</blockquote>
              
              <p>This passage relates how the Lord instructed Moses on how the Lord
              would present the Torah so that the entire people would hear it, and
              that the entire people would know and believe that the Lord spoke to
              Moses, and they would believe it forever. </p>

              there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been

              Deuteronomy 4:32-36 issues an open challenge to
              the people who would start other religions to come up with a story this
              reliable.</h3><p></p>
              
              
              
              <p>No other entire nation has ever heard the voice of G-d from amidst
              the fire, meaning that G-d did this to prove to everyone that He is the
              One, and that the Torah is true. <br><br>
              G-d never did this for the New Testament, and He never did this for the
              Quâ€™ran. Furthermore, this passage of the Torah commands something that
              the New Testament and Qu'ran don't ever bother to ask. Verse 35 says,
              "Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he is G-d; there is none else beside him."  The Torah demands knowledge. The New Testament and the Qu'ran demand faith. <br><br>
              Think about it. Claiming that Jesus had appeared, risen from the dead,
              to the entire nation of Israel would have given Christianity a stable
              enough foundation to make it even somewhat credible. But the authors
              knew that such claims would immediately be taken for lies because there
              would be no corroborating evidence. <br><br>
              In other words, in the New Testament and Qu'ran we have two other
              documents, which are claimed as being Divine, but, plainly put, lack
              the Divine signature. <br><br>
              Secular bible critics have tried for years to come up with some
              rational explanation for the fact that Judaism is the only religion
              that is backed by such a reliable tale. The fact of the matter is that
              for all their efforts, the field has yet to come up with a unified
              opinion on the subject. It just stands as a physical impossibility to
              fool millions of people that their entire ancestry heard the Lord
              speak. </p>
