              <p><br>You mean Protestant and Catholic?</p>
              <p>The Catholic Church is the world's largest, and Christianity's oldest, religious body. Her more than 1 billion members inhabit the width and breadth of the earth and the number continues to grow.  Article dated April this year that the population has grown by another 12% <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0428/catholic.html">http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0428/catholic.html</a></p>
              <p>Catholics believe that theirs is the one true Church of Jesus Christ, firstly, because theirs is the only Christian Church that goes back in history to the time of Christ; secondly, because theirs is the only Christian Church which possesses the invincible unity, the intrinsic holiness, the continual universality and the indisputable apostolicity which Christ said would distinguish His true Church; and thirdly, because the Apostles and primitive Church Fathers, who certainly were members of Christ's true Church, all professed membership in the same Catholic Church (See Apostles' Creed and the Primitive Christian letters).</p>
              <p>Protestant Church (which commonly mistaken as The ONE Christianity) was only founded five hundred years ago when some members of the Catholic Church protested against the original teachings (that's how the name protestants came about). </p>

              <p>tks jwWorld. very well explained. you're very well versed in doctrines and teachings of the Catholic church.. are you a priest btw? or teaching  in seminary??</p>
              <p>It's good that you point out the misconceptions alleged by  the christians who confuse particulary the non christians esp those searching for the meaning of life in particular christianity or even to some extent, catholics ourselves which obviously isn't true.</p>
              <p>As catholics, we have to read and know  our faith.well (very impt!!) .otherwise we'll stuump for words when our protestant brethrens point out or attack us in our faith. To some extent, we have to be blamed for lack of knowledge on the catholic faith esp once we finish catechism class upon reaching sec 4, and thereafter the catechsim books is kept in lockers or drawers to collect dust. thus stopping to learn more abt the faith. Even converts of many years ago stop learning once they got baptised. That's sad! The moment you stop learning, it dies out! simple as that!</p>
              <p>To stay  in the faith.. we need to join in ministries. Choose any one which suits you. If you love singing, join choir, If reading, join lectors or animators.. Or better still join sponsor in RCIA. By joining, they will help you to grow and stay relevant in the faith..</p>
              <p>To chris .. thanks for bringing up this topic.. and also to others esp my fellow catholics, servant, fatum, JWWorld and many others who help to answer many questions posed by the forummers. Keep this thread going.. All of us are learning from each other.</p>

              <p>not a problem mate. I can be found at St Joseph's RCIA every monday at 8. There'll be people on hand to answer any queries as well. I think all catholics should attend RCIA at least once in their lives, even cradle catholics, it's different from catchechism classes for children, and it gives people a good grounding in the spiritual and theological aspects of our chosen faith.</p>
              <p>Of course, you can just look up father alex as well.</p>
              <p>Anyone else, non-christians or christians of other stripes are certainly welcome as well, of course. As I've pointed out, unlike other places, we'll NEVER tell you "ours is right and yours is wrong", nor would we condemn or rubbish other people's. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p><br>i do not know how old are you.. or what did not denomination are you from.. But if you read the history of the Catholic church  (def not form yr classes or materials) from an open mind.. opposite from what you have been taught or learn abt.  Even if you have use the CCC or the  papal encyclicals, have you reflected or at least ask yourself why it was written this way or so?? What is the  message that the writer trying to convey.. is there some truth in it?? etc..</p>
              <p>For a start, would you like to attend our mass and see if there's anything what the priest and the readers, choir etc. say or do or sing that is contrary to the church teachings or the gospels itself..See for yrself..</p>

              <p>No point reading up the CCC just to try finding holes in it. Just like the Bible, anyone can easily interpret it to suit his or her own ideas. Have you tried asking Catholics about why things are presented in the CCC the way they are?</p>
              <p>A few questions to ponder:</p>
              <p>How did Christianity begin and develop since the time of Jesus Christ? How did the early Christians worship and what did they believe in?</p>
              <p>Where did the Bible come from?</p>
              <p>If you seek the truth to these questions with an open and honest heart, I have no doubt that you will understand why the Catholic Church is the way it is.</p>
