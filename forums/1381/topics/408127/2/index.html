              <p><br>hi position..</p>
              <p>well i give you a shorter summary.. lest you get sleepy.. heheh zzzzzzzzzzz.....heh</p>
              <p>Catholic church..(RC)  founder: Jesus Christ.. 1st pope.. St peter.. current pope no: 265 (to be cfrm) Pope benedict 16th..</p>
              <p>Christian church:(CC) (mainly anglican, methodist, lutheran etc.) late 15th or early  16th century.. spilt from the catholic church due to diff in theology and bible interpretation. among others..</p>
              <p>beliefs: (RC) believe in One God.. the Holy trinity, i.e Father, Son (i.e Jesus)  and Holy spirit..i.e 3 person in one God..  (the Trinitarian) . Teachings of Jesus christ from his time with the apostles.. handed till today. from 10 commandments, sacred tradition (matters regarding faith not recorded in the bible handed from apostles' time or early church  till today). The magesterium is the official teachings of the catholic church.. Honor the saints. models of christian living.. eg.. st teresa of avila.. st pio.. just to name a few..</p>
              <p>CC: based on bible .. or sola scripture.. almost literally..</p>
              <p>Sacraments: they are of visible sign of God's grace on the person.. eg baptism..</p>
              <p>RC: has 7 sacraments: baptism, confirmation, Holy Eucharist, Holy orders (for becoming priest), Holy matrimony (marriage), confession of sins or reconciliation of sins, and anointing of the sick or extreme unction in old days.</p>
              <p>CC: mostly 2 .. namely baptism and matrimony..</p>
              <p>Holy communion: RC: real body and bread of Jesus christ when it is consecrated by the priest during mass i.e service.</p>
              <p>CC: holy communion is symbolic..</p>
              <p>hope that helps.. just a few .. there are a few others.. if you are keen to know the faith .. google : cathecism of the Catholic Church.. .</p>
              <p>blogs also can help.. google on faith issues: Fr Luke Fong, Fr aloysius Ong (life crosses) and Fr . stephen Yim .. all from singapore diocese.. will give you into insight of the faith..</p>

              <p><br>hi pepper,</p>
              <p>thanks for yr question..</p>
              <p>pls pose yr questions .. i try my best to answer.. to the best of my knowledge..</p>
              <p>first of all.. what is sacrament.. ?</p>
              <p> visible of God's grace on a person..</p>
              <p>7 "official" sacraments of the Catholic Church .the first 3 are . baptism, Confirmation, Holy Eucharist. known as sacrament of initiation.. Normally, when a person is received into catholic Church usually at easter saturday or sunday.. this sacrament of initiation is conferred on the person.. once a person is baptised, he is confirmed straight away, and after that  he or she can receive holy communion.in the form of a round  host..  </p>
              <p>the other 4 sacraments are.. Holy matrimony (marriage) in church..  btw  catholics.. Holy orders.. for males going to be ordained as priests .. ordained by bishop.. of the diocese. eg anyone who want to be ordained in singapore after spending abt 7-9 years studying in the seminary.. Confession of sins or reconciliation..usaully to a priest who has been given authority to forgive the sins of the one who confessed. Thereafter he or she make penance .... lastly, anointing of the sick.. or known as extreme unction or sacrament of the dead in old  days. when almost the person is dying .. now it is administered when one is going for op or in sick bed.. .</p>
              <p>There are other unofficial  sacraments eg christians  praying together etc..</p>
              <p>hope that helps..</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>The word "creed" comes from Latin "credo".. meaning "I believe".</p>
              <p>there are 2 creeds namely the nicene creeds and the  apostle creed..</p>
              <p>Nicene creed came to be known when it was adopted during the concil of nicea in ad 325. Because of the political situation in Europe was was less favorable eg division of Roman empire.. the creed was less acceptable by the people. However it was only the time of Constantinpole, the  creed triumphed and was widely accepted.</p>
              <p>apostles' creed usually said before the Rosary. as follows.. " I believe in  God the almighty....</p>
              <p>Nicene's  creed summarise our catholic beliefs in total. It is in a  long form.</p>

He suffered under pontius Pillate, was cucified, died and was buried. He descended to the dead. On the 3rd day, he rose again. He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the  right hand of the Father. He will come again to judge the  living and the dead. I believe in the Holy spirit, the holy catholic church. the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body and life everlasting.  Amen".</p>

              <p><br>hi pepper,</p>
              <p>good question.. but i do not really know the answer.. i was told the beads was created when the europeans (i think the portuguese)  went to asia (maybe china) during early 13th century? As a result of their contacts thru culture and trade, they saw the buddhist or muslims use beads to say prayers.. And they started from there..</p>
              <p>A bit of history..Rosary was started by by st dominic who founded the dominicans (know as the order of preachers or OP) in the late 13th century (to be cfrm) He has a great devotion to our Lady (Jesus's mother).</p>
              <p>hope that helps..</p>
              <p>If you are keen to know more abt catholicism.. pls visit <a href="http://www.catholic.com">www.catholic.com</a>  Great deal of info there or <a href="http://www.ewtn.com">www.ewtn.com</a>.. look under faith and Q n A..</p>
