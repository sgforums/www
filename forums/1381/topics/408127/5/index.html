              <p>no point arguing whether catholics are christians or not.. the fact is catholics are christians.... they are believers of christ..Period.  I can't blame you for saying we are not christians.. cos what you have been taught by yr elders or pastors or any church leaders on catholics  is not correct. To you i say rather than saying than catholics are not christians.. i would suggest you spread the gospel to non believers.. minus the part that catholics are not christians. Also,  to my fellow catholics..leave this public transport alone.. no point reason out with him or her since he or she has make up hisor her mind on what we are.. .. just pray for him or her..</p>
              <p> or are you trying to tell us to go to the catholic forum.. and not this forum?? The truth is we can go to both forums..</p>

              <p>Catholic Church is already the largest denomination in the world</p>
              <p>if one day Catholic Church is in communion with the Eastern Orthodox, as per Pope John Paul II's wishes</p>

              <p><br>we are not psychoed by or Priest or Father I ( is that what you refer to??) .. We were taught in catechism class on  God, Jesus Christ, salvation..Mary,  the saints and the teachings of the church.. eg sacraments ..</p>
              <p>If you have been to a catholic mass.. You would have seen the prayers in the mass. is always addressed to God either in the name  of Heavenly Father or Jesus or Lord most of the time..google yr search on the catholic mass on youtube.. and see for yrself.. the best is google Fr John Corapi .. one of the quite well known priest in US whose homily is often good and clear on the teachings of the church and on God..</p>

              <p><br>we are not psychoed by or Priest or Father I ( is that what you refer to??) .. We were taught in catechism class on  God, Jesus Christ, salvation..Mary,  the saints and the teachings of the church.. eg sacraments ..</p>
              <p>If you have been to a catholic mass.. You would have seen the prayers in the mass. is always addressed to God either in the name  of Heavenly Father or Jesus or Lord most of the time..google yr search on the catholic mass on youtube.. and see for yrself.. the best is google Fr John Corapi .. one of the quite well known priest in US whose homily is often good and clear on the teachings of the church and on God..</p>

              <p>Not necessarily so. We must be mindful that for many who may have learnt that Christianity is simply 'between God and me', Catholicism can be tough to understand at first.</p>
              <p>Important to explain and witness the faith in a gentle and charitable manner to our fellow Christian brothers and sisters out there :) </p>
