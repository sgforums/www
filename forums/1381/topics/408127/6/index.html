              <p><br>I am a born Catholic but parents stopped going to church.  But I somehow still have some spiritual connection with Jesus.  So when I was in Pri 2, my music teacher chio us to go Sunday School.  That's I started learning about bible. </p>
              <p>When I grew up, I moved to the neighbourhood that was so near to the Catholic church that I was baptised.  Every day I heard the church bell ring.  Really loved it.  Went to attend Mass to find out more.  That time, the priest was Fr Carlo Ly and the very sermon that he preached was about love and I was drawn to his sermon. </p>
              <p>Even though I had been trained by the Protestant Church to memorise bible verses, I somehow knew that the fundamental of Christian teaching is all about love, how God loves us, how Jesus teaches us about love and most importantly, the commandment that Jesus gave us "Love one another as I have loved you". </p>
              <p>I was to and fro the Catholic Church and Protestant Church, trying to learn more about God and God's love.  But somehow, my Protestant friends were condemning the Catholics and I was just wondering to myself "where is the love that Jesus preached in the bible and where is that love when this friend talks about Catholics and non Christians this way?"  On the other hand, often I heard Catholics referring Protestants as their separate brothers.  Even though it has been clearly recorded in history that they were the ones who broke away, the Catholics that I got to know never once belittled the Protestants. </p>
              <p>So, I see love among the Catholics.  I loved the charity works that the Catholic Church, and religious sisters do.  I read about how Catholic priests risked and even lost their lives trying to save souls (I went to Sarawak for holiday and learnt about how the descendents of the cannibal tribes converted to Catholics -- and yes, priests were killed by the cannibals at that time).  I volunteered my service in one of the Catholic old folks home.  I visited the sick with the Catholic volunteers.  In short, I very much saw God's love in action.  So, I decided that, after spending more than 10 years learning God's words, I should learn to live His words. </p>
              <p>That's my conversion story. </p>

              <p><br>I am a born Catholic but parents stopped going to church.  But I somehow still have some spiritual connection with Jesus.  So when I was in Pri 2, my music teacher chio us to go Sunday School.  That's I started learning about bible. </p>
              <p>When I grew up, I moved to the neighbourhood that was so near to the Catholic church that I was baptised.  Every day I heard the church bell ring.  Really loved it.  Went to attend Mass to find out more.  That time, the priest was Fr Carlo Ly and the very sermon that he preached was about love and I was drawn to his sermon. </p>
              <p>Even though I had been trained by the Protestant Church to memorise bible verses, I somehow knew that the fundamental of Christian teaching is all about love, how God loves us, how Jesus teaches us about love and most importantly, the commandment that Jesus gave us "Love one another as I have loved you". </p>
              <p>I was to and fro the Catholic Church and Protestant Church, trying to learn more about God and God's love.  But somehow, my Protestant friends were condemning the Catholics and I was just wondering to myself "where is the love that Jesus preached in the bible and where is that love when this friend talks about Catholics and non Christians this way?"  On the other hand, often I heard Catholics referring Protestants as their separate brothers.  Even though it has been clearly recorded in history that they were the ones who broke away, the Catholics that I got to know never once belittled the Protestants. </p>
              <p>So, I see love among the Catholics.  I loved the charity works that the Catholic Church, and religious sisters do.  I read about how Catholic priests risked and even lost their lives trying to save souls (I went to Sarawak for holiday and learnt about how the descendents of the cannibal tribes converted to Catholics -- and yes, priests were killed by the cannibals at that time).  I volunteered my service in one of the Catholic old folks home.  I visited the sick with the Catholic volunteers.  In short, I very much saw God's love in action.  So, I decided that, after spending more than 10 years learning God's words, I should learn to live His words. </p>
              <p>That's my conversion story. </p>
