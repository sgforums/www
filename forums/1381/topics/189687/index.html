As for the Gospel of Judas, I would have issued a bland analysis proclaiming that the early church was right to have rejected Gnosticism as heresy. And then I would have offered a prayer of thanks, as thousands of editors throughout the world deleted my press release from their e-mail, saying "no news here." '<br><br>-'As a nonbeliever, I am nevertheless certain that neither a new movie nor an old gospel will shake the faith of believing Christians in the biblical account of Jesus' life and death. The real story of the disproportionate official Christian outrage is that religious leaders do not like it when anyone Â— whether a Hollywood filmmaker or an anonymous voice from Christianity's own past Â— challenges their particular narrative of salvation, and by doing so raises the uncomfortable question of whether any religious narrative can reasonably be classified as nonfiction.

The expectations are there, unfortunately, in many ways I believe if someone subscribe to any faith strongly, he is expected to follow it strongly (note: not perfectly), in this case, the Ten Commandments or the Seven Fruits of the Spirit etc.<br><br>Yeah, we are not perfect, I am not perfect either, but I dont agree that that imperfectness should be a ready excuse. And nah, I made many more friends than I had enemies here, so I am not so quite bothered by friendships issues, and thats why despite the odds sometimes, you will prolly wonder why i am so bend on picking on the issues as they cropped up.
