But he is a headache to the coach because in a game [actual game not practice] he would deliberately intend to miss a shot for some crazy reason. This has been going on for many games and the coach is upset with him.<br><br>But one day Rain came to realize his mistake, he admmitted to his folly and would accept what the coach would sanction against him. Rain truly changed his attitude about his playing the game.<br><br>Now, he would really aim at the basket and go for the shot. Every shot is done with concentration and focus for the simple reason that he would make the shot.<br><br>His coach is now happy because Rain changed his attitude about playing the game. Even though Rain has changed his attitude now he cannot gurranttee that he would make every basket [that would be impossible not even the best players in the world could do that, occasionally he would miss the shot though not intentionally].<br><br>But his coach is happy with him because Rain has really changed his attitude about playing the game.<br><br>Repentance is a change of attitude. As a result it would change his behavior. No repentance in this side of glory is perfect. God is not calling us to be perfectly sinless in this world. No. he wants us to have a changed attitude about sin that would result in a consistent behavior against sin.<br><br></div>

(i was just pissed they did not recognise my baptism  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> ). that aside, i still see the need for consistency for the Protestant faith. It's hard to share your faith when different churches are telling you different things. it gets really confusing for the non believers</div>
