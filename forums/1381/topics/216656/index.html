For if you say say only and have no intention of repenting, even if God forgives you, the people on Earth may not be as forgiving.</div>

It is not repeated. It is positional. Positionally the repentant sinner who has trusted in Christ alone for salvation HAS BEEN FORGIVEN OF ALL SINS THROUGH THE DEATH AND RESURRECTION OF THE LORD JESUS [who died for his sins --&gt; PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE].<br><br>The latter is the forgivness of the saved sinner. One who through faith in the Lord Jesus alone has become a member of the family of God. This type of forgiveness is repeated all throughout our walk here on earth. We confess our sins and God through the DEPOSIT THAT THE LORD JESUS HAS MADE ON THE CROSS [WHO ANTICIPATED ALL OUR SINS FROM BIRTH TO DEATH] WILL FORGIVE US.<br><br>judgement?<br><br>the saved sinner has passed from that. All who have trusted in the Lord Jesus therefore have recieved salvation forgivenss and had their sins judged already for them when the Lord Jesus died on the cross. Judgement is past them. They have already been judged in the person of their substitute, the Lord Jesus Christ since they accepted Him as their substitute by placing their faith on Him.<br><br>Joh 5:24 "Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life.<br><br>those who have not trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ, their judgement is yet future. They will have no substitute since they rejected the Lord Jesus. They will have to suffer for their sins.<br><br>Think of salvation forgiveness as the forgivness of a criminal. Think of parental forgiveness as the forgiveness of a father to an erring child. The father will surely punish him but certainly  not as a criminal. His punishment [or more accurately his DISCIPLINE] is not penal but parental.<br><br>To obtain salvation forgiveness, you must trust [or believe] in the Lord Jesus Christ alone for salvation. To obtain parental forgiveness, one must confess his sins to His Father in heaven.<br><br><strong>Salvation forgivenss:</strong><br><br>Ac 16:30 And he brought them out and said, "<strong>Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"</strong><br>31 So they said, "<strong>Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved,</strong><strong><br><br>parental forgiveness:</strong><br><br>1Jo 1:9 <strong>If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins </strong>and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<br><br></div>

I view the Protestant way to be similar?<br><br>In this case, should not a repentant heart nudge the husband back to his original marriage with God as the witness? or is this too idealistic?</div></blockquote>yes, a repentant heart would result in repentant actions. The only grounds for divorce in the Bible is when one of the parties has committed immoralilty. The innocent is now at liberty to marry in that case. Or she can choose to remain unmarried and accept his husband again if the husband repents.<br><br>But if the wife has married already another [and she has not sinned because the husband has broken their marriage covenant through immorality], the now repentant husband is not return to his ex-wife anymore. She is not his wife anymore.<br><br>yes my friend, marriage is a covenant witnessed by God:<br><br>Mal 2:14 Yet you say, "For what reason?" Because the LORD has been witness Between you and the wife of your youth, With whom you have dealt treacherously; Yet she is your companion <strong>And your wife by covenant</strong>.<br><br></div>
