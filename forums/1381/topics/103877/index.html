            <div class='col-md body'>A sister in my church is in her preteens. it appears she joined some youth group called zodiacladies.<a href="http://www.zodiacladies.com" rel="nofollow">www.zodiacladies.com</a><br><br>i'm not sure what goes on in there, but it looks pretty clean. spiritually i don't know. but its a place for growing girls to make friends, have good clean fun like pot luck parties, teaching about hip hop dancing, life skills and stuff. (according to her)<br><br>was wondering, firstly, is there any christian here who joined this group before, would like some feedback.<br><br>2ndly, maybe we could have simple outings like these. so that christian teens can have a "safer" platform to mix around and make friends. just a suggestion.<br>[/url]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well. i'm not sure if its a valid reason. my YM is kinda inward looking, as most of them were kids who grown up together. everything they do is around the east. that makes people who lives in other places, like me kinda left out. travelling to church, or cell, or even just a movie is a huge chore. what, to others is just a 5 mins walk, is a 2 hours journey to people like me.<br><br>we only meet each other, in cell, or church, we don't really have a proper fellowship, just meeting for coffee, or hold a BBQ, or something. so far, i only feel close to 2 or 3 people in the YM. and its only because i spend time with them outside of church and cell, going for movies, go eat together, or just simple hanging out at each other's house. and they have become my closest friends.<br><br>shrugs. maybe i'm just being a moron. but these are what i feel anyway<br><br>what really annoyed me is that, once i suggested opening my house for cell, and i was written off as crazy, have to travel so far. but none of them realised i was travelling the crazy distance.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div>
