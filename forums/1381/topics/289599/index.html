            <div class='col-md body'>hMmm...I don't think ALL chc members wear very nice, and that if you wear plain, you can't go?<br><br>I've been there for the last 10 years...and I go in t-shirt and jeans...my members sometimes even more relaxed than me....its just dressing style. Of course there're those who dress up, and I'm glad they do, because they look nice.<br><br>But its alright, whatever you dress, its all ok. I think more than 50% of the pple are just in jeans and t-shirt....really. You don't believe you go see yourself on the web.<br><br><strong>Self Esteem</strong><br>I guess the reason you feel this way is due to some hurts and self-esteem issues, you'll have to sort that out inside you, and realise that it doesn't really matter the outward, its the inward.<br><br>How about taking a step to slowly build your confidence and self esteem?<br><br>Hiding and feeling sorry doesn't help, yea?<br><br><strong>Personal Experience</strong><br>When I first went to church, I was from a lower-class kinda family, I went to church in shorts and t-shirt, that was the "best" I had, its all okay, everyone is accepted.<br><br>Well...church doesn't really take much time... we easily spend half a day out shopping, what is 2 hours or abit more?<br><br><strong>Valueing time</strong><br>Its how you value time, whether you feel it is worth it. For 2 hours, you can fellowship of your friends and the you receive the Word of God and revelation/encouragement for your life....its much better than doing nothing, gaming or stoning , right?<br><br>[/b]</div>
