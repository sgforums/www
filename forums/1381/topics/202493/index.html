The source making the claim usually quotes Darwin saying that the evolution of the eye seems "absurd in the highest degree". However, Darwin follows that statement with a three-and-a-half-page proposal of intermediate stages through which eyes might have evolved via gradual steps (Darwin 1872).<br><br>photosensitive cell<br>aggregates of pigment cells without a nerve<br>an optic nerve surrounded by pigment cells and covered by translucent skin<br>pigment cells forming a small depression<br>pigment cells forming a deeper depression<br>the skin over the depression taking a lens shape<br>muscles allowing the lens to adjust<br><br>All of these steps are known to be viable because all exist in animals living today. The increments between these steps are slight and may be broken down into even smaller increments. Natural selection should, under many circumstances, favor the increments. Since eyes do not fossilize well, we do not know that the development of the eye followed exactly that path, but we certainly cannot claim that no path exists.<br><br>Evidence for one step in the evolution of the vertebrate eye comes from comparative anatomy and genetics. The vertebrate Ã¢Ã£-crystallin genes, which code for several proteins crucial for the lens, are very similar to the Ciona Ã¢Ã£-crystallin gene. Ciona is an urochordate, a distant relative of vertebrates. Ciona's single Ã¢Ã£-crystallin gene is expressed in its otolith, a pigmented sister cell of the light-sensing ocellus. The origin of the lens appears to be based on co-optation of previously existing elements in a lensless system.<br><br>Nilsson and Pelger (1994) calculated that if each step were a 1 percent change, the evolution of the eye would take 1,829 steps, which could happen in 364,000 generations</div></blockquote>There is no proof of evolution.

God is so wonderfully creative that He can create all sorts of eyes for all sorts of environments etc!</blockquote>Why not give credit to the flying speghetti mnster while u r at it since it is equally likely he is the one tat "creates" all sort of eyes<br><br><blockquote>Are u sure there were that many generations? Dont based your ideas on buddhism where there are millions of lifetimes or many universes. Pls give scientific proof that 364,000 generations have passed &amp; gone. &amp; how the evolution exactly took place like for eg the exact path of evolution etc. Mind u there were gaps here &amp; there so much as i know of. Perhaps u can elaborate. </blockquote>Com'on man... 364,000 geenrations only meant 3,640,000 years if the average age of giving birth is 10 years (tis is already very generous since many animals have the life span of only a few years). We have already found bones tat is more than 3 million years old (more than a few hundreds millions years old) Why is it difficult to say tat 364,000 generatin have not passed  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote>There is simply no proof like what u said above altho we can't claim the positive or negative. It's just conjecture or postulation.</blockquote>I think u need to know the original question. People claim tat the eye is too hard to be evolved out. The reply shows tat it is possible and in fact many living species now r still evolving their eye and many small steps toward the evolution of the eye we have is very possible and a mechanism is proposed. So wat is your question now ?<br><br><blockquote>There is no proof of evolution. It's just a theory</blockquote>I can't believe tis !!! I have probably answer tis a few hundred times and yet people still get tis mistaken concept !!!! I tell u in short. Scientific committee has deemed evolution as a FACT.<br><br></div>
