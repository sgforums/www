            <div class='col-md body'>Last Tuesday, I spoke to my dying dad on several issues regarding his need to accept Jesus as his personal savior before he passes on to the next world. No one knows what is in store for us in the next world. Susequently, several members of the church came to him, some old friends of him who enjoyed their youth days with him since the church's founding in 1965 in Kampungg Bahru also came to visit him and spoke to him about Christ. He received Christ the next day on the wednesday.<br><br>During these few days, he cried to the wife of his old friend that he hopes to have his family back. The very one he regretted to destroy. Divorced his wife, forced his son out of the family for money, made his daughter detest him. The wife he divorced went to visit him daily ever since. Witnessed him cry to her while my mum dried his tear for him. Until today at 1502H, my mother suddenly gave me the dreaded call. The doctors at the hospice were trying to save him. Just minutes ago, I called and found that my dad's body has been transported to the singapore casket palace.<br><br>Even though he passed away peacefully, but he has only his final week to go through physical reconciliation of his family even though we do not hold it against him anymore since a long time ago. Some men are so stubborn to live till the last moments before we start to regret our deeds and beg God for forgiveness &amp; help.<br><br>But we as fellow christians, on the other hand have no right to hurl the first stone at any fellow sinners. For Jesus made a very powerful statement "Those who are without sin may throw the 1st stone." The pharisees who brought the woman to Jesus demanded to stone her. Little did they know that they were pot calling a kettle black. I do not deny, even during my meeting with my dad last Tuesday, I felt a war going on inside me to taunt or not to taunt my dad. We need God all times to ensure that we stick to his ways.<br><br>Sorry, to hear me rant again. But I feel that it is very difficult to be a christian. But we're thankful that God is always there to remind us that we're still sinners to begin and end with.<br><br>Dear all, I am currently studying the book of James. It is a very practical book which applies to our daily lifestyle. Concentrate on the topic of maturity &amp; control of the tongue. It will help you greatly to understand how to be a mature christian. With maturity, you will be able to refrain from judging another fellow sinner more easily.<br><br>God spare &amp; bless us all.</div>
