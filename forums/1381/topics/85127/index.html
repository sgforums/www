            <div class='col-md body'>This is a common problem that I find which also frustrates new born Christians...for one...do they have the capacity even to think of such questions? If I talk about masturbation...what I need is solid words from the Bible that Masturbation is wrong and that's it... like in the 10 commandments Thou Shalt not Kill or Thou Shalt not Covet Thy Neighbour's wife. Answering in the form of rhetorical questions does not help the new born at all.

He is against "withdrawal" after having sex. Is Onan masturbating ? With Juda wife ? No. Then how come u can twist the words and say it is about masturbation ?<br><br>Second, even if u don't masturbate, the "seed" is still going to be wasted in wet dreams. So wat does tat means ? either God has committed a terrible sin by making all men having wet dreams or god want men to have sex with women before they have a wet dream, and they must ensure all the "seed" went into the women fully without a drop wasted.<br><br>Lastly, a cruel act is again display by god for killing onan without warning... poor onan, he don't even know why he die....<br><br></div>

That passage is quoted out of context in my view.</div></blockquote>The reason behind the unequally yoke verse is not a verse about caste or class or categories or anything.  It is a verse about priorities and values in life.<br><br>Imagine a very staunch christian getting married to a free thinker or any other person of any other beliefs. One day, when your child is born, you insist on getting ur child baptised, but your wife dun wan, what will you do? One day, when you wanna go church on Sunday, but your wife feels that it should be a day where u accompnay her, what will you do?  One day, when you suddenly feel the call of God to go to Africa as a missionary and leave your job, how do your wife will understand?<br><br>Remember here, GOD is not condemning people of other religions.  He is talking about the clashes that might happen if such an union happens.  In every God's commands and advices, there lies the issue of choice. You can choose to go the way God advises but you can choose not to.  Thus in every choice you made, you will reap the benefits but you should also suffer consequences if any. I think that is only fair.  Therefore, the issue now is no longer the verse, the issue here is what you wanna choose.  God says "hey I think you better not do such a thing, it may have such consequences." But now, if you think you can bear with the consequences and not take the advice, its your choice.<br><br>in every command that God gives, the reason is love not punishment.  He asked us not to murder not because so that he can throw us into the lake of fire but to spare us from the pain of thedeath penalty.  He commanded us to not store treasures on earth not because He wan us to be poor but He does not wan us to be caught up in the pain of the rat race.  God is love and if we believe that, then we believe His commands is because of love but alas, love also means giving us a choice.<br><br>So well my friend, its your choice in such matters but you already heard what God advises, the ball is in our courts now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><strong>MASTURBATION</strong><br><br>Masturbation is an interesting topic.<br><br>Lets look at this verse.<br><br>Matt 5:28<br>28 But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.<br><br>Now let us be frank here. I struggle with masturbation too.  When we masturbate, tell me what is our minds?  i dun think, while we are masturbating we are thinking about our reports, or our bank accounts or our homework or the KFC Chicken wings or anything. Most likely, while you are MASTURBATING, you are likely to be visualising a sexual act with a girl or you are looking at a porn pic or a pic and fantasising about it.  I say mostly becos I know of some weird things that people masturbate to but in most cases, I would say what I say its true. WE form images in our mind. And if we link back to the verse up there, we would understand why, indirectly, masturbation is not encouraged.<br></div>

And how do a person knows if he or she loves a person? Of course every Christian will desire to have a Christian spouse...but what if that is not possible i.e... he doesn't have much Christian friends to begin with and his viewpoints of life and prioirites are different? That can be abit hard. What I do not like about those so called staunch Christians is they use II Corinthians 6:14 to condemn a person who is in a relationship with a non believer. Love in the first place is not so simple. Can I just leave a person I love just because of that? I don't think so.<br><br>Gas... perhaps my interpretation of the bible is a little different from yours. Mine is a cause and effect thingy. If you do not do A then B will happen to you. This could be a wrong interpretation...but...I don't know.... I do not know what it is to love anymore...I don't even know who I am so how can I love another?<br>[/i]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Masturbation is an interesting topic.<br><br>Lets look at this verse.<br><br>Matt 5:28<br>28 But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.<br><br>Now let us be frank here. I struggle with masturbation too. When we masturbate, tell me what is our minds? i dun think, while we are masturbating we are thinking about our reports, or our bank accounts or our homework or the KFC Chicken wings or anything. Most likely, while you are MASTURBATING, you are likely to be visualising a sexual act with a girl or you are looking at a porn pic or a pic and fantasising about it. I say mostly becos I know of some weird things that people masturbate to but in most cases, I would say what I say its true. WE form images in our mind. And if we link back to the verse up there, we would understand why, indirectly, masturbation is not encouraged. </blockquote>Someone has used tat phrase on me too before.<br><br>I hope u realise tat thinking of lust and masturbation r again 2 different items. If u think tat we should stop people from lusting, it is impossible. When men see a women wears a sexy outfit, they will mentally think of lust even though they do not masturbate. When a guy see a beautiful girl, he will still think of the same thing too. How to prevent it ? Cover the women from head to toes or making men blind ? Do u think just by banning masturbation u do not commit this sin ? Sorry man, this sin has further impact than u think. Masturbation is just a subset of it. When men r having wet dreams, they too think of lust. How to prevent tat ? <strong>If u want to ban masturbation just because of the above statement, then it should be fair to force women to wear clothes tat only exposes their eyes too or make men blind</strong>. Will tat be rational ?<br><br>Wat has the thought of lust or desire for flesh wrong in anything ? Everyone thinks of "lust" since all men and women r built tis way. I believe all men, even the pope think lustfully at some point in time. <strong>Wat harm has it done ?</strong> If there is no lust in the world, do u think people will want to get marry or have kids ?<br><br>If u want to blame, blame the maker. He create lust so that relationship between men and women becomes more interesting. Yet u guys want to clamp it down and make people do the impossible.</div>

And how do a person knows if he or she loves a person? Of course every Christian will desire to have a Christian spouse...but what if that is not possible i.e... he doesn't have much Christian friends to begin with and his viewpoints of life and prioirites are different? That can be abit hard. What I do not like about those so called staunch Christians is they use II Corinthians 6:14 to condemn a person who is in a relationship with a non believer. Love in the first place is not so simple. Can I just leave a person I love just because of that? I don't think so.<br><br>Gas... perhaps my interpretation of the bible is a little different from yours. Mine is a cause and effect thingy. If you do not do A then B will happen to you.

As the man and the christian in the relationship, decisions u made will affect the gal a lot. Love is a funny thing. If u love the gal very much, would u believe that the 2nd verse will give u provisions with regards to anyone u married, be it christian or non-christian? Love is the greatest thing besides faith and hope as said by the Apostle Paul. Trust in the lord that ur relationship is good and nobody should condemn u. If any pastor or cell group leader will to come and meddle in my relationship, I would ask him/her to mind their own business. Any group that tries to take control of its members' lifestyle are cultic.<br><br>I once argued with my gf as to to what extent shall we take the 'unequally yoke' into consideration. From my understanding, if one really go into the extreme side believers should be cut-off from all non-believers, not just in a relationship.<br><br>Why dun u take ur questions to this message board: stephentong.org<br>I think the person in charge Elder Yong would be able to answer ur questions.</div>

It means tis is another bible contradiction. One phrase contradicts the result of the other. In the end wat to do ? Each party will choose the side which support their stand most and maintain they r right. Talking about clarity there seems to be none.
