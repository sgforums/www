Doesn't wat he do later contradict his actions before ? Why doesn't he just tell us the new laws in the first place ? Why make so many people suffer for so much time before telling them it is futile to follow the laws he set himself ? Wat is the rationale for doing tat ?<br><br><blockquote>Christians believed in one Triune God (GOD/Jesus/Holy Ghost); Jesus is GOD, GOD is Jesus. Very hard to explain to u this concept. Mebbe u try looking up while u surf? </blockquote>The trinity heh. Tat is something very contradictory among here too since they suggest god is one, then suggest it actually meant multiple objects (+holy spirits) then they say jesus is the son of god, which make it strange since no one can be a son of himself. Jesus is sacrfice because god want it to be so. So how can god sarifice god because god want it to be so ? When jesus is baptised , god is pleased of jesus actions. How can god be pleased of his own action to commemorate god himself ? Can't u see throughout NT they implied both god and jesus r different.<br><br><blockquote>When I was in sec sch, I also found parts of the bible contraditary.

Like the old laws and the concept of grace, without the laws there would not be grace; the laws made u understand why grace was given to people so that u can be saved. </blockquote>Lets simplify the scenario. Someone name god throw u into a dungeon tat is not possible for men to live well. After many years, they set u into a slightly better dungeon. So when u see an upgrade u actually praise god for showing grace ? Instead of condemning his action for giving darkness to men for many centuries by irresponsible and strict laws, u actually priase him for correction ? From my viewpoint, it just means tat he realise he made a mistake and try to rectify it. Wat perfectness can tat be ? People living centuries ago r also human, so we left use them as examples or guinea pigs for the later people ?<br><br><blockquote>U are right to have doubts in the bible as I have last time.

I thought u yourself give some example of conflict between the 2 ? OT says a woman who commit adultery has to be stoned while the NT says we do not have to. Isn't tat a conflict here ?<br>u yourself even write tis<br><br><blockquote>Old Covenant:<br>Placed upon stone<br>Based on the law<br>Must be taught<br>Legal relationship with GOD<br><br>New Covenant:<br>Placed upon people's heart<br>Based on desire to love and serve God<br>known by all<br>Personal relationship with GOD </blockquote>Isn't tat a difference of its own ?<br><br><blockquote>Â“By calling this covenant `new,' he has made the first one obsolete.... He sets aside the first to establish the secondÂ” (Heb. 8:13; 10:9).</blockquote>The second one just make OT "obsolete" isn't it ? I thought u already say they r obsolete thus irrelevant, and tat makes everythign under it not to be taken seriously. Does tis complement each other ? Nope ! From tat statement, it is meant to be a replacement ! OT tells u u must follow the rules seriously without question and without it possible of being changed. Now tis statement tell u to forget about everything written on it. How can tis ever be complementary ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When people study the Bible as if it is a Biology text and starts placing them in tables for comparison and not pondering over the whole picture, the main aim is to shoot the Bible of its credibility and perhaps give a hooray "They have got lopp holes..haha"<br><br>Well, the Bible is studied by several people and they call it the greatest Book with greatest degree of accuracy and by quoting some Verses vs. Verses thingy..one thinks God is jus being forgetful?<br><br>Everything revealed in Scriptures are infallible(not the Pope) and inerrant (not the Pope). The reason why it seems full of errors because the life of the one reading it contains error. The Bible talks about the Word of God being a mirror...when we see ourselves as being dirty in the mirror...some of us choose to have a bath..while some say ..no la...the mirror is unpolished and dirty in the first place.<br><br>"Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.  Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror  and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.  But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it--he will be blessed in what he does."<br><br>-James 1:22-25<br><br>The whole context of the Bible talks about a God, one who is the only true and living. The God here althoughs seemed full of wrath and demanding in the Old Testament do still have a caring and merciful heart. God spared the Egyptians' first born(those who obey His command to smear the lamb's blood on their doorposts during Passover) and He did not simply wipe out mankind like we wipe our dirty tables. In all of His doings, even when it comes to severe Judgments, God do remember mercy.<br><br>His primary job is not to exterminate mankind the moment they sin and turn from Him. His wraths and judgments are threats to make people repent. Before every time He sends His punishment....He will send a prophet to speak His words and plead with nthe people to repent. No fire come from heaven without prior warnings. Read for urself.<br><br>God will never change. yes...He is same yesterday, today and evermore. But that doesnt mean He is a piece of rock. His holiness, truth and righteous standards and love for justice NEVER change. But He changes His plans at times so that people will come to repentance...He wants as few people dead as much as possible.<br><br>So would we prefer Him to NOT CHANGE? even when we tidy up out messed up lives ....His wrath still comes anyway??? Sorry...God is not mad.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>When people study the Bible as if it is a Biology text and starts placing them in tables for comparison and not pondering over the whole picture, the main aim is to shoot the Bible of its credibility and perhaps give a hooray "They have got lopp holes..haha" </blockquote>Actually I have a question to ask, do u have a problem of reading the bible logically ? I mean should we use reasoning and logics when reading the scriptures or should we just read it, believe everything is true, not challenging or ponder over it, just swallowing the whole content ? If they have loop holes tat cannot be covered, then it just means it really have loop holes and u should then ponder why.<br><br><blockquote>Well, the Bible is studied by several people and they call it the greatest Book with greatest degree of accuracy and by quoting some Verses vs. Verses thingy..one thinks God is jus being forgetful? </blockquote>Sure... all religion says tat too. There r a lot of muslim scholars saying the same for their qurans and buddhist monks telling about their scripture too. But surely not more than one can be right isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>Everything revealed in Scriptures are infallible(not the Pope) and inerrant (not the Pope). The reason why it seems full of errors because the life of the one reading it contains error. The Bible talks about the Word of God being a mirror...when we see ourselves as being dirty in the mirror...some of us choose to have a bath..while some say ..no la...the mirror is unpolished and dirty in the first place. </blockquote>Yah right... I am sure some of the authors here do not just write rubbish base on their own "dirty inner self". They provide their reasoning for such a stand. If they provide their reasons to why they have doubts, I see no reason to throw it all off just because they r saying something tat is against the scripture. So all the people who says somethign is wrong with the scriptures must have dirty and unpolish side ? Aren't u acting like the emperor in the story of the emperor new clothes ? Claiming those people who says they can't see the clothes r deemed as stupid so no one dare to talk about it ?<br><br><blockquote>"Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it--he will be blessed in what he does."<br><br>-James 1:22-25 </blockquote>Anyway this statement is tellign people to perform the deeds as expected of them as christians instead of just knowing they should do it. It does not mean the same way as u describe, those who comment about the scripture r actually a reflection of their self being.<br><br><blockquote>The whole context of the Bible talks about a God, one who is the only true and living. The God here althoughs seemed full of wrath and demanding in the Old Testament do still have a caring and merciful heart. God spared the Egyptians' first born(those who obey His command to smear the lamb's blood on their doorposts during Passover) and He did not simply wipe out mankind like we wipe our dirty tables. In all of His doings, even when it comes to severe Judgments, God do remember mercy. </blockquote>I don't know about your mercy... he kill people who do not obey him, isn't tat bad enough. He surely kill off the egyptians first born who do not smear the blood isn't it ? Do they deserve death in the first place ? Wat sin have they commit tat deserve death ? Let me ask another question. Smearing the blood of lamb for a whole civilisation surely have cost the lives of many sheeps as well. Do they deserve death too ? He did not wipe out mankind like we wipe table ? then how do u explain noah's ark ? He really wipe off civilisation isn't it ? He surely do tat to dinosaurs in the past too. He don't even bother to explain why he wipe them off too. Does he show mercy ? No.<br><br><blockquote>His primary job is not to exterminate mankind the moment they sin and turn from Him. His wraths and judgments are threats to make people repent. Before every time He sends His punishment....He will send a prophet to speak His words and plead with nthe people to repent. No fire come from heaven without prior warnings. Read for urself. </blockquote>Did he give warning to Onan when he die ? Any prophet appear ? Does he warn the other people in Noah's ark ? When he kill Job family, does he give any warnings ? He keep it hush hush and tell noah only isn't it ? Does he warn the egytians when he close the read sea ? He just kill them when he feel like it too. There r many many example of god killing people without any warnings. read for yourself.<br><br><blockquote>God will never change. yes...He is same yesterday, today and evermore. But that doesnt mean He is a piece of rock. His holiness, truth and righteous standards and love for justice NEVER change. But He changes His plans at times so that people will come to repentance...He wants as few people dead as much as possible. </blockquote>Why do u say tat ? If he want as few people dead, don't start death ! He is the one tat invent death ! I thought he is all knowing and omnipotent ? With these 2 powers surely he can do a brillant plan and stick with it throughout.<br><br><blockquote>So would we prefer Him to NOT CHANGE? even when we tidy up out messed up lives ....His wrath still comes anyway??? Sorry...God is not mad. </blockquote>the thing I am saying is, if he is as powerful as the bible describe him, there shouldn't have a reason to change. If he had to change, it just means tat the bible claims of him being perfect, all-knowing and omnipotent is wrong and tat probably means everything u know about him is wrong. he is not human, he won't commit errors so he shouldn't have to do remedy actions or corrections like us tidying out our messed life. If he has to, as i said before, doesn't tat means he is limited like us.<br><br>god is not mad... but he is not one with love but one who is very egoistic, violent and love to be in control.</div>
