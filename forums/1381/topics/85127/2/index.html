If u think tat we should stop people from lusting, it is impossible. When men see a women wears a sexy outfit, they will mentally think of lust even though they do not masturbate. When a guy see a beautiful girl, he will still think of the same thing too. How to prevent it ? Cover the women from head to toes or making men blind ? Do u think just by banning masturbation u do not commit this sin ? Sorry man, this sin has further impact than u think. Masturbation is just a subset of it. When men r having wet dreams, they too think of lust. How to prevent tat ? [b]If u want to ban masturbation just because of the above statement, then it should be fair to force women to wear clothes tat only exposes their eyes too or make men blind</strong>. Will tat be rational ?<br><br>Wat has the thought of lust or desire for flesh wrong in anything ? Everyone thinks of "lust" since all men and women r built tis way. I believe all men, even the pope think lustfully at some point in time. <strong>Wat harm has it done ?</strong> If there is no lust in the world, do u think people will want to get marry or have kids ?<br><br>If u want to blame, blame the maker. He create lust so that relationship between men and women becomes more interesting. Yet u guys want to clamp it down and make people do the impossible. [/b]</blockquote>Firstly, yes I did mention that lust and masturbation is only indirectly linked. I never said they are ONE thing.<br><br>Secondly, I agree that LUST is ever present. I too succumb to LUST as a christian.<br><br>Thirdly, the question from greengoblin was that why masturbation is such an issue and my answer was that in order to masturbate, lust is present and lust to God is a sin. If you can masturbate without having any lust and without any lustful images in ur mind, then well go ahead.<br><br>Fourthly, it was God who says it is a sin to lust not me. However, He did say the moment you sin, He will strike me down or else I would have been struck down a few times every day. yes I lust every day but every day I learn more and more not to.  Christians never become sinless but they learn to sin less and less.<br><br>Fifthly, No one wants to ban masturbation.  yes without masturbation, lust is still present, but the question is about masturbation isnt it? And masturbation is most likely a result of lust. I am just trying to say that to get to masturbation, you likely would have to go thru the process of lusting.  It is not wrong to look at pretty girls. It is not wrong to admire God's creation. But to God, if we go on and continue to 'strip' them in our mind then well to God, it is a sin but again, I say, God is not seeking an opportunity to ZAP us from heaven.<br><br>Lastly, as I said, christians dun become sinless. So even in masturbation, I can say that at least for single guys, it is almost impossible to NOT MASTURBATE EVER IN THEIR WHOLE LIFE again.  Bt it is possible to masturbate lesser and lesser.  Anyway, I believe it is known to all of us that doctors advise masturbation to be kept in control as it may occupy our whole time and being and may result you to have a selfish sex life in future. They do not advise that you must totally stop masturbating but not to let it occupy your whole time and being.</div>

Of course every Christian will desire to have a Christian spouse...but what if that is not possible i.e... he doesn't have much Christian friends to begin with and his viewpoints of life and prioirites are different? That can be abit hard. What I do not like about those so called staunch Christians is they use II Corinthians 6:14 to condemn a person who is in a relationship with a non believer. Love in the first place is not so simple. Can I just leave a person I love just because of that? I don't think so.<br><br>Gas... perhaps my interpretation of the bible is a little different from yours. Mine is a cause and effect thingy. If you do not do A then B will happen to you. This could be a wrong interpretation...but...I don't know.... I do not know what it is to love anymore...I don't even know who I am so how can I love another?<br>[/i]</div></blockquote>Well bro, its hard to understand love just as we believe that love compelled Jesus to die for us. How could you understand that?  The way love is felt is different in every individual.  Some feels that God loves them because of the way dies for them. I personally feels God's love because He gave me the freedom to be who I really am.  So, until they day you really love a person, then you will know. If you try to get an explanation of how you know you love a person, i really dun noe.<br><br>To understand the scriptures, you must understand the person who inspires it, God himself.  I once have many questions about the bible.  But I came to understand is that beyond those words that are written, the person, God, who inspires it, is more crucial than anything else.<br><br>If God is love, would He be unloving in any circumstances? If God is all knowing, would He lose control in any situation? So, if God is freedom, would He not give us a choice?<br><br>My brother, God gives us a choice for everything. But we have to understans that in everything we do, there is either a benefit to us or consequence to bear. And God is just pointing out the possibilities to us.  It is just like my mother telling me the possible consequences of skipping school when I was in primary school and that is I might fail my exams. Was that a threat? I dun think it is but it is more a concern mother telling her child of what might happen. it is out of love rather than viciousness.  God is not in heaven right now, waiting for you to make a mistake and zap you but He, as a loving Father, has given us all the instructions as a loving Father should and it is up to us to listen or not.<br><br>If you listen all may be fine but if you do not, just remember that a broken spirit and a contrite heart, He will not despise.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Firstly, yes I did mention that lust and masturbation is only indirectly linked. I never said they are ONE thing. </blockquote>Firstly, u give a statement condening lusting for an answer to banning masturbation. And u really didn't explicitly say there r not one item nor say they r indirectly linked.<br><br><blockquote>Secondly, I agree that LUST is ever present. I too succumb to LUST as a christian. </blockquote>Then don't u find it wierd for tat someone to suggest we do something tat can never be achieved ? It is the same as breathing and eating. Why ban it ? As I said before, since everyone lust, why make it become a sin ? If tat is the case the biggest sinner is god since they force us to be so.<br><br><blockquote>Thirdly, the question from greengoblin was that why masturbation is such an issue and my answer was that in order to masturbate, lust is present and lust to God is a sin. If you can masturbate without having any lust and without any lustful images in ur mind, then well go ahead. </blockquote>The thing is, christian ban masturbation just because they occur the sin of lust. My question is, why not force women to cover themselves up except their eyes in order not to commit the sin of lust ? I am pretty sure if we cover up the girls, less "lust" sin will be committed. It will even be more effective than banning masturbation. Why only ban masturbation ?<br><br><blockquote>Fourthly, it was God who says it is a sin to lust not me. However, He did say the moment you sin, He will strike me down or else I would have been struck down a few times every day. yes I lust every day but every day I learn more and more not to. Christians never become sinless but they learn to sin less and less. </blockquote>Jesus says it is a sin to have lustful thoughts. However it is Human tat interpretes tis statement to banning masturbation. Again the scripture never explicitly say masturbation is disallow. They however do explicit says tat women who r not virgins when they r married have to be stoned to death. Why r u not following tis phrase of the scripture then ?<br><br><blockquote>Fifthly, No one wants to ban masturbation. yes without masturbation, lust is still present, but the question is about masturbation isnt it? And masturbation is most likely a result of lust. I am just trying to say that to get to masturbation, you likely would have to go thru the process of lusting.

But to God, if we go on and continue to 'strip' them in our mind then well to God, it is a sin but again, I say, God is not seeking an opportunity to ZAP us from heaven. </blockquote>The question is about masturbation, but u give me an answer which talk about lust. As said, masturbation is a result of lust. However lust may also have developed due to exposing women appearence to men. Christian try to stop lust by banning masturbation. Why not stop lusting by forcing women to wear clothings that cover everything as well ? Why the double standard ?<br><br>If u care to notice, god had placed eve as naked in the garden of eve. God have wanted men and women to go around naked. Why can't we picture them naked mentally ? Wat harm it cause ? I ask again, wat harm does it cause ?<br><br><blockquote>Lastly, as I said, christians dun become sinless. So even in masturbation, I can say that at least for single guys, it is almost impossible to NOT MASTURBATE EVER IN THEIR WHOLE LIFE again. Bt it is possible to masturbate lesser and lesser. Anyway, I believe it is known to all of us that doctors advise masturbation to be kept in control as it may occupy our whole time and being and may result you to have a selfish sex life in future. They do not advise that you must totally stop masturbating but not to let it occupy your whole time and being.</blockquote>Wat is the rationale for masturbating lesser and lesser ? Have u ever think about it, wat harm does it cause. The girl aren't going to get affected or really care wat u r doing. Why stop yourself from a normal health progression ?<br><br>Doctors has been telling people tat masturbation is good psychologically and physically. The best part is no one is gonna get hurt and it relieves sexual pressure. For your examples of masturbation gone bad, it is for people who r addicted to them. Unless u r a person who masturbate every hour, then u r not going to suffer the stated problems. Why put in the problem of addicts in this discussion ? Religion fanatic certainly have more serious problems than a masturbation addict.</div>

So the scriptures shouldn't be depended on ? Some peopel say tat priest should not be depended on either, even though somebody else say there will be some "holy spirit" guiding them. So in the end wat do u depend on ? God got lots of love for us ? Give me an example of the thing he had do tat had display his love. He killed people without reason and warnings. He started wars just for himself. He nearly killed off the whole species of all living things just because he want to press a reset button in controlling the world (noah ark).

Then how come he never predict adam will eat the apple eventually ? He knew about it and purposely let him eat it so he can have a reason to punish men ? God is freedom ? if he represents freedom, then why force us to pray to him, to believe in him ? Why set all the different priviledges believers will receive and condemn non believers to hell ?

A person wants u to start to worship him, to pray to him, to sing praises of him. If u do, u get to go to his house for a party. Otherwise he will ask his accomplice to torture u at a corner. Is tat a threat ? Yes it is ! In fact there is even an element of bribery ! Not zapping u ? Onan is zapped isn't it ? Job's family is zapped too.

But bear in mind, the Son of GOD also knew he has to die from the start, and his death was to complete what is to be given undeservely (grace) to us, the sinners. If Jesus really come to 'fulfill' (enforce) the laws, he would not have saved the woman's life from stoning would he? If he really come to 'fulfill' the laws, he would not have criticized the Pharisees who were self-righteous and thought they knew everything abt the laws.<br><br>Gentiles and Jews alike, the bible says those who believed in the Lord would be saved. Is there really a need to segregate between Jews and Gentiles? I have read a bible commentary which says that some early christians (Jews) tried to enforce Jewish customs on Gentiles and they were wrong in doing that. The bible also says whether u are circumcized or not, it is not as important as believing in the lord.<br><br>It is said in the bible that Jesus came to established a new convenant in place of the first (laws) (sorry  I have forgotten which verse). In the OT, The prophet Isiah prophesized abt the Messiah coming to bear man's sins. It was also mentioned that he would be beaten for our transgressions.<br><br>I think u do have some bible knowledge, and in fact better than me who has just began to start reading the bible seriously. I believed if u read more closely, it is clear that Jesus came to establish a new convenant for man with his father so that all of us can be saved. If the Lord has not established the new convenant, none of us could get saved as it is impossible for us to keep all the commandments.<br><br>There is also another good discussion board: stephentong.org<br>where u can participate in such discussions (I am not affiliated to them, just find that the person-charge Elder Yong would be in a better position to answer ur questions)</div>
