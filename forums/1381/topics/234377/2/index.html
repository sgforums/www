U don't send your children to hell simply becauce they do not listen to u fully as well. It is not about committing authrocities and sending to jail but something more abstract and perhaps ridiculous like making the right guess in the world of a few thousands religions. Buddhist who have been pious throughout his life still goes to hell.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>BTW I don't believe u can tempt a person who is and knows he is omnipotent.

If he have another belief, it may not means he is going down the wrong path.

            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder whether this quote may help.<br><br><blockquote>"At what point, then, does Eunomius assent to the truth? When he says that the Lord Himself, being the Son of the living God, not being ashamed of His birth from the Virgin, often named Himself, in His own sayings, 'the Son of Man'? For this phrase we also allege for proof of the community of essence, because the name of Son' shows the community of nature to be equal in both cases. For as He is called the <strong>Son of Man </strong>by reason of the kindred of His flesh to her of whom He was born, so also He is conceived, surely, as the Son of God, by reason of the connection of His essence with that from which He has His existence, and this argument is the greatest weapon of the truth. For nothing so clearly points to Him Who is the mediator between God and man' (as the great Apostle called Him), as the name of Son,' <strong>equally applicable to either nature, Divine or Human</strong>. For the same Person is Son of God, and was made, in the Incarnation, Son of Man, that, by His communion with each, He might link together by Himself what were divided by nature. <strong>Now if, in becoming Son of Man, he were without participation in human nature, it would be logical to say that neither does He share in the Divine essence, though He is Son of God</strong>. But if the whole compound nature of man was in Him (<strong>for He was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin), </strong>it is surely necessary to believe that every property of the transcendent essence is also in Him, as the Word Son' claims for Him both alike--<strong>the Human in the man, but in the God the Divine</strong>." Gregory of Nyssa, Against Eunomius, 3:4 (A.D. 384).</blockquote></div>
