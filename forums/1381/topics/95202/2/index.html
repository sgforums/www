And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'<br><br>Matthew 22:37-39<br><br>The Old Testament laws r there to show us our hopelessness to save ourselves and impossibilty to meet God's holy standards. In other words, the laws remind us of our sinfulness. The coming of the Saviour brings to past these commandments in that In Him all the laws and prophets are fufilled.<br><br>We do not obey and keep to rules so as to be deem accepted by God.

Jesus did not destroy but fulfill the Ten Commandments in the Old Testament.<br>Here an example why (John 8:1~11)<br><br>Group of Jewish Leaders wanted trap and force Jesus to sin, so they brought an adulterous couple to him and stated that the woman was caught in the act of adultery and should be stoned to death based on Moses Ten Commandment<br><br>So He wrote on the ground with his finger "If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her"<br><br>Of course, everyone has sinned before so they left.<br><br>Only Jesus and the woman were left alone.<br>Jesus then said "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?"<br>"No one, sir" she said<br>*"Then neither do I condemn you," Jesus declared "Go now and leave your life of sin"<br><br>*This means something which anti-christians distorted them.<br>or non-christians normally misintepreted.<br><br>Since God forgives us of their sins, so we can commit sin whatever we can. It's not. God forgives us for our sins when we beg for His forgiveness.<br><strong>But God never condone to them. That's why Jesus said "...leave your life of sin"</strong><br><br>When we committed sins among our fellow christians, we cover up sins of others as it is for God to judge us. We still don't condone to sins.<br><br>That's how I follows. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Hope that clear ur doubt.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Firstly you are less offensive than some of the other folks that appeared recently.<br><br>I don't think any Christian will say that we are enslaved to the ten commandments, or for that matter, any laws laid down in the OT. The OT, really is there for the purpose of the Hebrews (or Jews). There are many verses in the NT that actually helps to abolish the notion that OT laws are to be followed, one of them being the eating of pork.<br><br>The 10 commandments, per se, does no harm to any one wanting to follow them. I don't think you will disagree if I am to tell you to be filial, or tell you not to be greedy to want your neighbours' properties.  So I am guessing that the 10 commandments in itself is not the issue, but the large scope of the laws of the OT.<br><br>So the next question is, are we then enslaved to the NT? I am not sure if there are really any big "commandments" laid down other that the one about loving the Lord your God with all your hearts etc and loving your fellow men as you love yourselves.<br><br>Other "so-called" rules are probably more towards how we live our life morally, so the issue about having one wives, don't exasperate your children, give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar are really good life rules.<br><br>To side-track a little bit, it seems to me that all the arguments (not just in this forum) presented about Christianity stems from the fact that there is a total lack of understanding on how Christians work and may have been fanned by reading up of anti-Christian sources. I am not sure how much of this anti-Christian sentiments are the cause of an experiential process.<br><br></div>

U can say it in the bathroom, say it facing a condo, say it anywhere. but not to say is a must to say infront of Jesus statue. I almost forgot when i last did it.... But i just personally feel that is ok loh if i wan to say pray infront of the statue. I know that Christ is not in the statue. Some how is like..when this guy die...u talk to the tombstone...facing the tombstone..u know he died..but u still "talk" to him facing the tombstone and not ur butt facing to the tombstone loh.<br><br>Something like that.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>May I know why there seems to be different version of the Ten Commandments? </blockquote>Why ? Clearly from many of the responses here, people change the content of the bible from time to time to suit their agenda. Therefore, the bible tat we read now clearly can't be trusted anymore. Even something as big as the content of the 10 commandments had changed ! Wat else can't be changed ?<br><br><blockquote>Born again Christians cannot be sinless, but we must strive to sin less. </blockquote><blockquote>Cannot leh .. like SIS likes to complain (where is he btw?), the standards are so high nobody can comply. </blockquote>Since u want me to make a comment I will make one here... In christainity it appears to be fruitless. u cannot be sinless ! When u r borned u have already sinned, and accordingly no matter how small a sin u have created, u deserve eternal damnation. Obviously something is really wrong in god perception of sinning. Talking about the 10 commandments, isn't god the blatant breaker of these rules ? He killed tons of people isn't it ? In fact in the OT, they talked about tons of laws and their punishment ! U must follow all the rules or u faced eternal damantion ! So these r not to be followed anymore ? Some say tat jesus fulfilled the OT. Wat is your definition of "fulfilled" ? I thought it only say tat it fulfilled the OT messiah role. I never know it meant abolishing the whole OT... BTW jesus too supported slavery. It is in the NT. WHy do we not follow these words anymore ?<br><br>If u sin less or sin more, u still r unable to know if u r still good enough to be saved. Who know, it can be extremely gracious tat hitler is also saved or extremely unforgiving tat even mother teresa fails the test.<br><br><blockquote>While I look at women all the time, sometimes through the prompting of my wife. I don't necessarily sin. Sometimes it's because these women are downright ugly. Sin only comes in if you mentally undress the woman or imagine yourself to be having sex with her. </blockquote>Isn't tat wat god created us to do ? Men r constructed as such isn't it ? God create us to lust, then punish us for it. Sounds like throwing u into the river and punish u when u r wet.<br><br><blockquote>So He wrote on the ground with his finger "If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her" </blockquote>Then we shouldn't follow any of the laws set by both NT and OT isn't it ? We should go around behaving watever we want since no man can give judgement as they themselves have sinned too. We should not follow the 10 commandments too as it is in the OT. We can kill and have all the sex we want.<br><br><blockquote>There are many verses in the NT that actually helps to abolish the notion that OT laws are to be followed, one of them being the eating of pork. </blockquote>Isn't tat a contradiction ? OT says the scripture r ageless. They say u cannot eat pork. Then comes NT and he reverse the decision on eating pork. All these laws cannot be in effect isn't it ? Contradictions contradictions contradictions... BTW aren't god playing with human by not allowing them to eat pork for the past thousands of years ?<br><br><blockquote>God's forgiveness. i mentioned an example before about someone giving a gift. if you refuse the gift, then the gift is not yours.</blockquote>The gift is not a gift as there is a condition attached to it. It is like giving a begger a penny only after he has said u r the greatest being ever alive. To me tat sounds like ego.</div>

He want u to call him the greatest person alive, he is perfect, every decision he made is correct and u cannot accept money from anyone else. Worse still he only gives to people of Religion A. Tat sounds like tis guy has character flaws isn't it ?<br><br>There r other giver as well. Giver B give pennies to everyone whether he ask for it or not. Tat seems to be a better person to approach isn't it ?<br><br>In other religion, they treat sinning as part of their lives. The idea is not about sinning little little things, but about whether does the good deeds u had done balanced it out with the sins u had done. They treat the motive behind sinning as important considerations. For christianity, they only care if the act has been committed.<br><br>For christianity, they only care whether u r a believer or not first.</div>

He tells u u need a penny otherwise u will be cursed forever ! Without A, u will probably be going around with your life. When A comes, he curse u to a life of pain, force u to beg him and praise him, forbid u not to mingle with other people who might tell u a more realistic and better view before finally giving u a penny.</div>
