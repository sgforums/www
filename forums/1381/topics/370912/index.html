              <p>Satan knew he cannot overpower God in terms of well..power..martial strength..superiority...but..he thought he might have a chance on the decision on right to rule..sovereignty issues..you dont see satan challenge God on strength or 1 on 1 duels right??think of how he twists God's words to Eve...how he challenge God on Job's conditions..even tempting Jesus...</p>
              <p>all that satan did was to challenge the right to rule..he does stand a good chance that people will throw their lot behind him if he can distract them enough..why else do you need to work so many hours a day just to put food on your table..would you still have that much time and energy to learn about God's way??also the entertainment now..mostly talk about spiritism and things which are detestable to God...yet glorified now..lastly, the most import arsenal of satan is religion..all religions usually teach people to do good..seems harmless enough..in fact good..but it does not originate with the manufacturer..think how pirated stuff can ruin your systems in the long run theory..</p>
              <p>Satan's motivation is also simple to read..just wondering why your church never touch on all these??</p>
              <p>Satan was a beautiful cherub..i guess he must be only second to michael in terms of beauty and might..surely many angels look to him for many matters..and that bugger starts to grow vain and wants worship for himself only..hence started his nonsense..</p>

              <p>Yes, Satan was vain and rebelled.</p>
              <p>But what about now? This moment? Today? Why don't he repent now, at today, at this second? I mean, he tried for thousands of years to win God and fail, so why don't he try repenting and see if God will forgive him?</p>
              <p>He has free-will, don't he?</p>
              <p>I mean, if Satan repents, won't the universe be a happy place? He can get his 1/3 angels to fall on their knees and ask God for mercy. Then, if God forgives them, there will be no hell, no evil, no pains, no sufferings?</p>
              <p>Why will Satan fight on, today? Especially when he knows that if he don't repent, he will end up in hell one day.</p>

              <p>you do realize time meant nothing to beings who can live forever right?he does have free will..thats why he chose to fight on..to feed his vanity..he wants the worship directed to God to be directed to him instead...so thats why he is not interested to say sorry..why apologize when you know you might win??satan isnt dumb..the lowest demon is way too superior than the smartest human..even adam...</p>
              <p>he know he wont go hell..cuz he knew there is no hell too..hell is but a concept of satan to paint God as an unfair God...tormenting eternity for a few thousand years of trouble..</p>
