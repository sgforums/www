The Jewish religion today is not alike the one during the the time of Jesus and before. What we see today is mostly rabbinical judaism, not the religion of the priest and Temple. And rabbinical judaism was born around the time of Jesus (when you start to find synagogues being mentioned). Strictly speaking, rabbinical judaism started to take shape after the time of Jesus and the Pharisees can be considered the spiritual ancestors.<br><br>The point here is that I want you to know the Jewish religion is not as continuous as we think, from the time God declared the Hebrews to be the chosen race to the present.<br><br>Please correct me if there are any grave misconceptions on my part.

Their beliefs are fundamentally the same as Christians but they don't call themselves Christians partly because of the atrocities committed by Christians against the Jews in history. Furthermore, Christ is the Greek word for Messiah. Instead of using a foreign word to describe their religion which originate from their own race, they use "messianic".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First post here , to me , the bible is just another novel . If God was really that almighty , why did the people of the world still separate? He gave us freewill , but surely he can appear over national tv since he's so great , and influence us then . Maybe even solving all problems by his will alone . Yet he leaves it to people who are 'converts' to do the job . If I were God , I would have recreated this world , since it's so crappy . What is God waiting for ? If he exists , where is he? Okay ... He's everywhere , but does he really answer prayers ? I'm sure tons of tsunami victims out there are praying or prayed upon to either receive help or even revive the dead . Can't God do all that? Perhaps rain manna on the people , revive the dead(not as zombie though) and even personally escort bad leaders to hell . Apparently , he's just watching . He wants the best for us , but leaves us to solve our problems. So many religions out there , so many different things , and God created them. Why didn't God keep everything on track? Is he on a holiday since thousands of years ago ? Does God only do Genesis ? He shouldn't have sent his son , he can just send legions of angels to convert people , perhaps get the angels to counsol everybody. I'm apolegetic for the long post , God would want us to believe in ourselves , it doesn't really matter to him unless he's real vain. I've tried praying to God , even though I'm an atheist , surely he would show interest in all subjects? Yet I only heard myself , unless I'm God himself. I'm pratically begging God to show mankind the truth , show yourself and people will believe you!</div>
