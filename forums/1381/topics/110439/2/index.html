            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by one-niner:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi ppl, hope you ppl here can clear my doubts. just want to know the difference if any, or similarities if any.<br><br>Reason for this weird question being, if the Jews are the chosen ppl of God, why are the religion followed by the Jews different to the christians ?<br><br>Are the jews the more conservative christians as they don't eat pork, practice circumcisions etc ???<br><br>And this is not a thread to allow flame throwers to start torching this thread.<br><br>regards</div></blockquote>circumcision is actually for hygienic reasons and to differentiate themselves from the other populace.<br><br>I can confirm the part about the Jews who do not believe gentiles could be saved , after all what's the point if they are the chosen people. However christ said everyone who accepts god is saved.  They say a jew is not a jew unless he comes out from a jewish mother. Why? Because they know at least if a jew gave birth to a baby - doesn't matter whose it is , the baby is still at least a jew. They forbid those who are not borned of jewish mothers to be buried in a jewish cemetary - there was a case of a russian mom who converted to judaism and her son died in a bombing.. By right her son should be a jew but the mother was not recognised as a jew  (although she converted) therefore he  could not be buried there.  That story came from my colleague who happens to be a distant relative of the mother.<br><br>A guy I used to date is jewish - his parents were not too happy to see me , an asian girl. Shikse was the term they used for me. I figured it out after watching some tv show.  They spoke basically in yiddish in front of me punctuated with shikse....so that didn't work out too well. Not a single smile. Shikse is a degradatory name they call a non jewish girl. So go figure who is more racist - the ordinary caucasian or the jew.<br><br>Pork - it was because pigs were swimming in mud and swill in the good old ancient days. Symbolically pigs are dirty to them. Therefore they don't eat pigs. However I think the seventh adventists ( christians) don't eat pork either.</div>
