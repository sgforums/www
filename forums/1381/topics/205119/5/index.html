And from the way u say it, u r suggesting god is only almighty, not omnipotent. But from my understanding, god is omnipotent. Lets make it a true of false question. Is god omnipotent ? If he is, then your reply on almighty etc is meaningless because god is still omnipotent, even if he has the trait of almighty.</div>

Do the church go around and propagate tat god is illogical ? If it is illogical how do u seek trying to understanding it ? Even though there r some phenomenon that r hard to believe, people will still not abandon logic and try to explain it in a rational manner. Believe in something illogical really makes one an illogical person</div>
