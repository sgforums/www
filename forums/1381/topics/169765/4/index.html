They find it unusually hot at that depth (2,000 degrees F).  As a part of trying to listen to movement in the earth's crust, they drop a microphone into the drilled hole and are horrified when they realize they are hearing the voices of millions of people crying out in torment.  Terrified, they decide to abandon the project, but not before a bat-like apparition arises from the hole and gives them a message.<br><br>The Truth:<br>This is the combination of an urban legend and a hoax.  The original story of the deep hole drilling in Siberia made the rounds of tabloid newspapers in the early 1990's.  Some researchers have theorized that the story somehow got started from an authentic deep hole drilling project, but that has never been proven.  That original story included the account of breaking through the crust, hearing the voices from the hole, and shutting down the drilling operation.  The plot thickened when a Norwegian school teacher named Age Rendalen decided to embellish the story with the description of the bat-like creature coming out of the hole.  He did it purposely to see whether a religious television program would accept the story at face value without checking it out, and they did.  TruthOrFiction.com has first-hand information from Mr. Rendalen.</div></blockquote>What?! They actually had a sermon based on a Chick tract?!<br><br>Jail them now!!</div>

Satan? And where he get the notion of sins and evil? He was created by god rite?<br><br></div></blockquote>Hi Laurence. Just sharing here some of my thoughts as i have thought about it some time back.<br><br>Wouldnt think that Sin is "created". Rather to me, it is a consequence or act of disobedience from what is commanded by God and what is God.<br><br>When the Lord created beings - He gives them free will.  As we all know - Free Will is a double edge power. Keeping the options simple here - Either to submit or to deviate.  So if one is to deviate from what the Lord has for the beings brings forth sin.  Sinning brings forth death.<br><br>i do not know what occurred in satan's heart when he disobeyed God - but perhaps a simpler analogy would be that having meals to be kept alive is not sin - but gluttony is. We are not forced by the Lord to be or not to be a glutton - we chose to. Perhaps satan chose to / or desire to because even as an angel - he covet out of a freedom to do so?<br><br>Why does the Lord gives us free will then ? Perhaps If we do not have free will - most probably we also cannot enjoy the Good that the Lord has for us ? More for the children of Adam - we cannot know what Love is ?  We would be like robots....isnt it ?<br><br>That Evil is the absence of Good only begs the question further. That Evil is chosen by the will of Men and (Angels) brings forth much light of God's Love for Beings of Which He Created.  That is one of the major relevations that brings me to Christ as i was indeed a very bad person then.  It is not so much of the blessings that God can bring - but of His grace that i can choose to Live and Live truly.<br><br>Hope all is well with you.<br><br></div>

Rather to me, it is a consequence or act of disobedience from what is commanded by God and what is God.<br><br>When the Lord created beings - He gives them free will.  As we all know - Free Will is a double edge power. Keeping the options simple here - Either to submit or to deviate.  So if one is to deviate from what the Lord has for the beings brings forth sin.  Sinning brings forth death.<br><br>i do not know what occurred in satan's heart when he disobeyed God - but perhaps a simpler analogy would be that having meals to be kept alive is not sin - but gluttony is. We are not forced by the Lord to be or not to be a glutton - we chose to. Perhaps satan chose to / or desire to because even as an angel - he covet out of a freedom to do so?<br><br>Why does the Lord gives us free will then ? Perhaps If we do not have free will - most probably we also cannot enjoy the Good that the Lord has for us ? More for the children of Adam - we cannot know what Love is ?  We would be like robots....isnt it ?<br><br>That Evil is the absence of Good only begs the question further. That Evil is chosen by the will of Men and (Angels) brings forth much light of God's Love for Beings of Which He Created.  That is one of the major relevations that brings me to Christ as i was indeed a very bad person then.  It is not so much of the blessings that God can bring - but of His grace that i can choose to Live and Live truly.<br><br>Hope all is well with you.<br><br></div></blockquote>Hmm, kly presents a very strong case in his points abt free will. Finally somebody answer the question. But i understand from MC that there are many perspectives as well.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>According to this website, the story of Albert Einstein uttering those words are false. The quote is supposedly part of a dialogue between Einstein and an atheist professor, which is a version of the ubiquitous atheist professor vs smart student story Christians often used to bash atheists.<br><br><a href="http://www.snopes.com/religion/einstein.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.snopes.com/religion/einstein.asp</a><br><br>And this last para is a good point.<br><br>'Stories about atheist professors being bested by true believers who did have answers at the ready are both ventings of this frustration and expressions of delight in finally seeming to have been armed with deft responses to fling back. These are tales of affirmation, modern-day parables of trials overcome and fierce adversaries bested by those who held fast to what they believed in, even in the face of ridicule rained down by authority figures. Like parables, they are meant to inspire similar resolve in those with whom they are shared Â— should those members of the flock ever find themselves in like circumstances, they should feel moved to emulate the brave little students of legend who stood up to the big, bad atheist professors.
