They find it unusually hot at that depth (2,000 degrees F).  As a part of trying to listen to movement in the earth's crust, they drop a microphone into the drilled hole and are horrified when they realize they are hearing the voices of millions of people crying out in torment.  Terrified, they decide to abandon the project, but not before a bat-like apparition arises from the hole and gives them a message.<br><br>The Truth:<br>This is the combination of an urban legend and a hoax.  The original story of the deep hole drilling in Siberia made the rounds of tabloid newspapers in the early 1990's.  Some researchers have theorized that the story somehow got started from an authentic deep hole drilling project, but that has never been proven.  That original story included the account of breaking through the crust, hearing the voices from the hole, and shutting down the drilling operation.  The plot thickened when a Norwegian school teacher named Age Rendalen decided to embellish the story with the description of the bat-like creature coming out of the hole.  He did it purposely to see whether a religious television program would accept the story at face value without checking it out, and they did.  TruthOrFiction.com has first-hand information from Mr. Rendalen.</div>

Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.<br><br>2God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.<br><br>3Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.<br><br>Matthew 19:17 (King James Version) also Mark 10:18 &amp; Luke 18:19<br><br>17And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.<br><br>CE, of the whole passage only one verse talks about false prophets... read the passage carefully.</div>

Then there is issue of credibility. Everyone seems to quote any researcher favourable to their views, and we arent able to dig through the pile of information to assess its credibility. End up, the aforementioned forumer might seemingly put up a 'credible' front.<br><br>More importantly, the background of the person who made the quote has an impact to the meaning of the quote. Albert Einstein,, even if he is an atheist as some said, at the most is a Jew, or Jewish by faith. We wouldnt want to misconstrue his meaning to support a christian notion of a god, supported by the concept of a holy trinity.<br><br>Hence, my question then was, whose god? What is the definition of god here - a being, a concept, a personal thing, a term which actually means good, rather than a supernatural being etc etc etc..</div>
