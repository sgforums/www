Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.<br><br>7Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.<br><br>8He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.<br><br>9In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.<br><br>10Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.<br><br>11Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.<br><br>12No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.<br><br>13Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.<br><br>14And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.<br><br>15Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.<br><br>16And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. </span><br><br>3)What qualifies God's Love present in a man's heart?<br><br><span style="color: red;"><br>1 John 4:17-21<br>17Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.<br><br>18There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.<br><br>19We love him, because he first loved us.<br><br>20If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?<br><br>21And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.<br><br>1 John 2:5-6 (New International Version)<br><br>5But if anyone obeys his word, God's love[a] is truly made complete in him. This is how we know we are in him: 6Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did.<br><br></span><br>I suggest we'll get this clear before we move on.<br><br>Cheers<br><br></div></blockquote>Let me try to summarize your points. (Of which i think the verses are mis-quoted)<br><br>1) Apart from being a Believer. All things and actions are evil?<br><br>2) Apart of being accept by God, men have no way of knowing what love is.<br><br>3) Only a believer do not see or conduct evil since 'goodness of God is present, so evil is absent'<br>Only non believers experience evil doings and have evil conducts?<br><br>Am i right in clarifying the 3 points above?<br><br>The biblical quotes are quite off point, i do not have any interest to attack the word. I suggest that you answer in your own words.<br></div>

In light of that (and in Matt 19:17) then NONE is good, so can we safely conclude that nothing that you and I had ever done (before we accepted Christ) is good, or alternatively, everything we have done from that point of acceptance is good? So obviously, we may have talking about different definition of what "GOOD" is.<br><br><strong>Also in light of this definition, than can we safely conclude that we should all stop telling others to help the needy, support the poor and console the widows - unless these people has accepted Christ?</strong><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>CE, of the whole passage only one verse talks about false prophets... read the passage carefully. </strong></blockquote>On 1 Jn 4 - yes only a couple of verses talked about false prophets, the rest talks about love.<br><br>On Einstein -<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> We can all agree that none of the quotations are provable.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If none of the testimonies given are verifiable, it is better not to use them.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Does it matter? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My last post on this topic.<br><br>Yes anyone can use the internet to back up their claims... all of us do it. Lau, I don't see how I skirted the topic, I told you where I got my source from, I cannot do anymore or anyless than that. I do not see the need for you to get pissed off? What is the point? But if you want to be go ahead, be my guest, dosenÂ’t bother me.<br><br>If I have given Christians a bad name, then all I can say to my fellow bro and sis in Christ is sorry. I live by faith and not critical thinking. As a Christian that is what our walk with God is about. It is actually easier for a person to critical think than to live by faith. I have done enough critical thinking in my opinion to know that it serves no purpose, this forum shows that so well, you go round and round and round. MC, Icemoon, Laurence, where has all this critical thinking gotten you? Yes you have proven you can argue well and that you have a host of knowledge about theology. I confess, I donÂ’t. But Jesus was exactly against this, he rebuked the Pharisees time and time again for their legalism and theology. In the end, your theology is not going to save you, Faith is. So on this point consider it a win for you. It was never about winning or loosing but presenting a differing view point. The important thing to get is God's wisdom and get discernment.<br><br>Yes CE, about albert einstein.. .who gives a .... dosen't bother me either way, but i was just using that to show something else. Yes, a person outside of God can do good in his own sight, but may not do good in God's sight and that is the sad truth. If may can do good without God, then man does not need God. Even Jesus had the humility to say that no one is good but my father. So what makes us better than Jesus?<br><br>CE, everything from the point of acceptance may not be good because we may not have followed the prompting of the Lord. My definition of good has always been based on what God would consider good. Not menÂ’s definition of good. You should know your bible well, it says also that in that day many will come and say Lord, Lord, did we not do this and that in your nameÂ… but He will say away with you evil doers, I never knew you.<br>John 6:29 (Amplified Bible)<br>29Jesus replied, This is the work (service) that God asks of you: that you believe in the One Whom He has sent [that you cleave to, trust, rely on, and have faith in His Messenger].<br>MC,<br>1) Apart from being a Believer. All things and actions are evil?<br>Not true, a believer can still choose to do things that are evil.<br><br>2)Apart of being accept by God, men have no way of knowing what love is.<br>True. God is love, so if man does not know God how can he know what love is? Our human ideal of Â“loveÂ” is so far off what God is that you just cannot bridge the gap.<br><br>3) Only a believer do not see or conduct evil since 'goodness of God is present, so evil is absent' Only non believers experience evil doings and have evil conducts?<br>Not true, a believer can still choose to conduct evil. Being a believer also does not exempt you from evil doings, but we have the protection of the almighty and He will turn what was intended for evil to good. That is our assurance.<br><br>Disagree that the biblical quotes are off point, I suggest that you reflect on them in your free time. If you think they are, please post up some that you think are on point so I can meditate on them too!<br><br>In Christ.<br>Brey<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A few points emerged from this discussion so far:<br><strong>1. Internet resource</strong>: it is already established that the Internet is widely used as a rallying point to support one's claim, there are credible sources and there are bad ones. It is important to note that it is the responsibility of the writer to ensure that the sources quoted are credible. This is especially critical when Christians use unreliable sources (read Â– urban legends and myths) to support ones claims.<br><strong>2. Critical thinking</strong>, in itself is not wrong, otherwise why would Jesus admonish us to be as gentle as sheep and by cunning as the serpent (sorry, not sure if the correct animals are used here)? The fact that some folks (me inclusive) use critical thinking a lot does not mean that we do not embrace our faith. Otherwise, why would I advocate serious Christians to go look up the correct meaning of the various English words comparing against the original wording. It is extremely wrong to pronounce judgment on people who prefers to exercise more critically thinking than others. It is true that it is faith in God that brings us salvation, but may I add that it is through critical thinking that allows us to be better Christians because we are able to discern truth from fiction. Otherwise, we will be rejoicing over testimonies that never took place or are sadden by events that never happened. If within my powers, I will not allow that to happen because that would have cheapened the name of our Lord.<br></div>
