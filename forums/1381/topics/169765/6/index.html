Its the same as terorism, the intention is good, the method..then you go to go back to question the intention again...<br><br>Stop harping on this misquote alone, look at the bigger picture of what everyone has been saying. It annoying you dont see the point and pushing everything down in just pure defence of a guy.<br><br>And its stupid to say because you have good intention, that doesnt mean you do post anything to back you up, or when in doing so, injures somebody else views and reputation. Is the respect for another human being dismissed just like that? Gee</div>

Just sharing here some of my thoughts as i have thought about it some time back.<br><br>Wouldnt think that Sin is "created". Rather to me, it is a consequence or act of disobedience from what is commanded by God and what is God.<br><br>When the Lord created beings - He gives them free will.  As we all know - Free Will is a double edge power. Keeping the options simple here - Either to submit or to deviate.  So if one is to deviate from what the Lord has for the beings brings forth sin.  Sinning brings forth death.<br><br>i do not know what occurred in satan's heart when he disobeyed God - but perhaps a simpler analogy would be that having meals to be kept alive is not sin - but gluttony is. We are not forced by the Lord to be or not to be a glutton - we chose to. Perhaps satan chose to / or desire to because even as an angel - he covet out of a freedom to do so?<br><br>Why does the Lord gives us free will then ? Perhaps If we do not have free will - most probably we also cannot enjoy the Good that the Lord has for us ? More for the children of Adam - we cannot know what Love is ?  We would be like robots....isnt it ?<br><br>That Evil is the absence of Good only begs the question further. That Evil is chosen by the will of Men and (Angels) brings forth much light of God's Love for Beings of Which He Created.  That is one of the major relevations that brings me to Christ as i was indeed a very bad person then.  It is not so much of the blessings that God can bring - but of His grace that i can choose to Live and Live truly.<br><br>Hope all is well with you.<br><br></div></blockquote>This is the best post i have seen in this thread so far.</div>
