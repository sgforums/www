I wasnÂ’t entirely illiterate with respect to the Bible, but many verses were new to me. Whether familiar or not, the verses elicited no response from me, because I didnÂ’t know enough about the Bible to respond effectively.<br><br>Finally the missionary got to Matthew 16:18: "You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church."<br><br>"Hold it right there!" I said. "I know that verse. ThatÂ’s where Jesus appointed Simon the earthly head of the Church. ThatÂ’s where he appointed him the first pope." I paused and smiled broadly, knowing what the missionary would say in response.<br><br>I knew he usually didnÂ’t get any defense of the Catholic position at all as he went door to door, but sometimes a Catholic would speak up as I had. He had a reply, and I knew what it would be, and I was ready for it.<br><br>"I understand your thinking," he said, "but you Catholics misunderstand this verse because you donÂ’t know any Greek. ThatÂ’s the trouble with your Church and with your scholars. You people donÂ’t know the language in which the New Testament was written. To understand Matthew 16:18, we have to get behind the English to the Greek."<br><br>"Is that so?" I said, leading him on. I pretended to be ignorant of the trap being laid for me.<br><br>"Yes," he said. "In Greek, the word for rock is petra, which means a large, massive stone. The word used for SimonÂ’s new name is different; itÂ’s Petros, which means a little stone, a pebble."<br><br>In reality, what the missionary was telling me at this point was false. As Greek scholarsÂ—even non-Catholic onesÂ—admit, the words petros and petra were synonyms in first century Greek. They meant "small stone" and "large rock" in some ancient Greek poetry, centuries before the time of Christ, but that distinction had disappeared from the language by the time MatthewÂ’s Gospel was rendered in Greek. The difference in meaning can only be found in Attic Greek, but the New Testament was written in Koine GreekÂ—an entirely different dialect. In Koine Greek, both petros and petra simply meant "rock." If Jesus had wanted to call Simon a small stone, the Greek lithos would have been used. The missionaryÂ’s argument didnÂ’t work and showed a faulty knowledge of Greek. (For an Evangelical Protestant Greek scholarÂ’s admission of this, see D. A. Carson, The ExpositorÂ’s Bible Commentary [Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1984], Frank E. Gaebelein, ed., 8:36<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br>"You Catholics," the missionary continued, "because you donÂ’t know Greek, imagine that Jesus was equating Simon and the rock. Actually, of course, it was just the opposite. He was contrasting them. On the one side, the rock on which the Church would be built, Jesus himself; on the other, this mere pebble. Jesus was really saying that he himself would be the foundation, and he was emphasizing that Simon wasnÂ’t remotely qualified to be it."<br><br>"Case closed," he thought.<br><br>It was the missionaryÂ’s turn to pause and smile broadly. He had followed the training he had been given. He had been told that a rare Catholic might have heard of Matthew 16:18 and might argue that it proved the establishment of the papacy. He knew what he was supposed to say to prove otherwise, and he had said it.<br><br>"Well," I replied, beginning to use that nugget of information I had come across, "I agree with you that we must get behind the English to the Greek." He smiled some more and nodded. "But IÂ’m sure youÂ’ll agree with me that we must get behind the Greek to the Aramaic."<br><br>"The what?" he asked.<br><br>"The Aramaic," I said. "As you know, Aramaic was the language Jesus and the apostles and all the Jews in Palestine spoke. It was the common language of the place."<br><br>"I thought Greek was."<br><br>"No," I answered. "Many, if not most of them, knew Greek, of course, because Greek was the lingua franca of the Mediterranean world. It was the language of culture and commerce; and most of the books of the New Testament were written in it, because they were written not just for Christians in Palestine but also for Christians in places such as Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch, places where Aramaic wasnÂ’t the spoken language.<br><br>"I say most of the New Testament was written in Greek, but not all. Many hold that Matthew was written in AramaicÂ—we know this from records kept by Eusebius of CaesareaÂ—but it was translated into Greek early on, perhaps by Matthew himself. In any case the Aramaic original is lost (as are all the originals of the New Testament books), so all we have today is the Greek."<br><br>I stopped for a moment and looked at the missionary. He seemed a bit uncomfortable, perhaps doubting that I was a Catholic because I seemed to know what I was talking about. I continued.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;"><span class="large"><strong>Aramaic in the New Testament</strong></span></span><br><br>"We know that Jesus spoke Aramaic because some of his words are preserved for us in the Gospels. Look at Matthew 27:46, where he says from the cross, Â‘Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?Â’ That isnÂ’t Greek; itÂ’s Aramaic, and it means, Â‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?Â’<br><br>"WhatÂ’s more," I said, "in PaulÂ’s epistlesÂ—four times in Galatians and four times in 1 CorinthiansÂ—we have the Aramaic form of SimonÂ’s new name preserved for us. In our English Bibles it comes out as Cephas. That isnÂ’t Greek. ThatÂ’s a transliteration of the Aramaic word Kepha (rendered as Kephas in its Hellenistic form).<br><br>"And what does Kepha mean? It means a rock, the same as petra. (It doesnÂ’t mean a little stone or a pebble. What Jesus said to Simon in Matthew 16:18 was this: Â‘You are Kepha, and on this kepha I will build my Church.Â’<br><br>"When you understand what the Aramaic says, you see that Jesus was equating Simon and the rock; he wasnÂ’t contrasting them. We see this vividly in some modern English translations, which render the verse this way: Â‘You are Rock, and upon this rock I will build my church.Â’ In French one word, pierre, has always been used both for SimonÂ’s new name and for the rock."<br><br>For a few moments the missionary seemed stumped. It was obvious he had never heard such a rejoinder. His brow was knit in thought as he tried to come up with a counter. Then it occurred to him.<br><br>"Wait a second," he said. "If kepha means the same as petra, why donÂ’t we read in the Greek, Â‘You are Petra, and on this petra I will build my ChurchÂ’? Why, for SimonÂ’s new name, does Matthew use a Greek word, Petros, which means something quite different from petra?"<br><br>"Because he had no choice," I said. "Greek and Aramaic have different grammatical structures. In Aramaic you can use kepha in both places in Matthew 16:18. In Greek you encounter a problem arising from the fact that nouns take differing gender endings.<br><br>"You have masculine, feminine, and neuter nouns. The Greek word petra is feminine. You can use it in the second half of Matthew 16:18 without any trouble. But you canÂ’t use it as SimonÂ’s new name, because you canÂ’t give a man a feminine nameÂ—at least back then you couldnÂ’t. You have to change the ending of the noun to make it masculine. When you do that, you get Petros, which was an already-existing word meaning rock.<br><br>"I admit thatÂ’s an imperfect rendering of the Aramaic; you lose part of the play on words. In English, where we have Â‘PeterÂ’ and Â‘rock,Â’ you lose all of it. But thatÂ’s the best you can do in Greek."<br><br>Beyond the grammatical evidence, the structure of the narrative does not allow for a downplaying of PeterÂ’s role in the Church. Look at the way Matthew 16:15-19 is structured. After Peter gives a confession about the identity of Jesus, the Lord does the same in return for Peter. Jesus does not say, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jona! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. And I tell you, you are an insignificant pebble and on this rock I will build my Church. . . . I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven." Jesus is giving Peter a three-fold blessing, including the gift of the keys to the kingdom, not undermining his authority. To say that Jesus is downplaying Peter flies in the face of the context. Jesus is installing Peter as a form of chief steward or prime minister under the King of Kings by giving him the keys to the kingdom. As can be seen in Isaiah 22:22, kings in the Old Testament appointed a chief steward to serve under them in a position of great authority to rule over the inhabitants of the kingdom. Jesus quotes almost verbatum from this passage in Isaiah, and so it is clear what he has in mind. He is raising Peter up as a father figure to the household of faith (Is. 22:21), to lead them and guide the flock (John 21:15-17). This authority of the prime minister under the king was passed on from one man to another down through the ages by the giving of the keys, which were worn on the shoulder as a sign of authority. Likewise, the authority of Peter has been passed down for 2000 years by means of the papacy.<br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>My turn to pause</strong></span></span><br>I stopped and smiled. The missionary smiled back uncomfortably, but said nothing. We exchanged smiles for about thirty seconds. Then he looked at his watch, noticed how time had flown, and excused himself. I never saw him again.<br><br>So what came of this encounter? Two thingsÂ—one for me, one for him.<br><br>I began to develop a sense of confidence. I began to see that I could defend my faith if I engaged in a little homework. The more homework, the better the defense.<br><br>I realized that any literate CatholicÂ—including youÂ—could do the same. You donÂ’t have to suspect your faith might be untrue when you canÂ’t come up with an answer to a pointed question.<br><br>Once you develop a sense of confidence, you can say to yourself, "I may not know the answer to that, but I know I could find the answer if I hit the books. The answer is there, if only I spend the time to look for it."<br><br>And what about the missionary? Did he go away with anything? I think so. I think he went away with a doubt regarding his understanding (or lack of understanding) of Catholics and the Catholic faith. I hope his doubt has since matured into a sense that maybe, just maybe, Catholics have something to say on behalf of their religion and that he should look more carefully into the Faith he once so confidently opposed.<br><br>Â—Karl Keating<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Peter becomes Head of the Apostles.</strong> In especially solemn fashion Christ accentuated Peter's precedence among the Apostles, when, after Peter had recognized Him as the Messias, He promised that he would be head of His flock. Jesus was then dwelling with His Apostles in the vicinity of Caesarea Philippi, engaged on His work of salvation. As Christ's coming agreed so little in power and glory with the expectations of the Messias, many different views concerning Him were current. While journeying along with His Apostles, Jesus asks them: "Whom do men say that the Son of man is?" The Apostles answered: "Some John the Baptist, and other some Elias, and others Jeremias, or one of the prophets". Jesus said to them: "But whom do you say that I am?" Simon said: "Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God". And Jesus answering said to him: "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona: because flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in heaven. And I say to thee: That thou art Peter [Kipha, a rock], and upon this rock [Kipha] I will build my church [ekklesian], and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall be bound also in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, it shall be loosed also in heaven". Then he commanded his disciples, that they should tell no one that he was Jesus the Christ (Matthew 16:13-20; Mark 8:27-30; Luke 9:18-21).<br><br>By the word "rock" the Saviour cannot have meant Himself, but only Peter, as is so much more apparent in Aramaic in which the same word (Kipha) is used for "Peter" and "rock". His statement then admits of but one explanation, namely, that He wishes to make Peter the head of the whole community of those who believed in Him as the true Messias; that through this foundation (Peter) the Kingdom of Christ would be unconquerable; that the spiritual guidance of the faithful was placed in the hands of Peter, as the special representative of Christ. This meaning becomes so much the clearer when we remember that the words "bind" and "loose" are not metaphorical, but Jewish juridical terms. It is also clear that the position of Peter among the other Apostles and in the Christian community was the basis for the Kingdom of God on earth, that is, the Church of Christ. Peter was personally installed as Head of the Apostles by Christ Himself. This foundation created for the Church by its Founder could not disappear with the person of Peter, but was intended to continue and did continue (as actual history shows) in the primacy of the Roman Church and its bishops. Entirely inconsistent and in itself untenable is the position of Protestants who (like Schnitzer in recent times) assert that the primacy of the Roman bishops cannot be deduced from the precedence which Peter held among the Apostles. Just as the essential activity of the Twelve Apostles in building up and extending the Church did not entirely disappear with their deaths, so surely did the Apostolic Primacy of Peter not completely vanish. As intended by Christ, it must have continued its existence and development in a form appropriate to the ecclesiastical organism, just as the office of the Apostles continued in an appropriate form. Objections have been raised against the genuineness of the wording of the passage, but the unanimous testimony of the manuscripts, the parallel passages in the other Gospels, and the fixed belief of pre-Constantine literature furnish the surest proofs of the genuineness and untampered state of the text of Matthew (cf. "Stimmen aus MariaLaach", I, 1896,129 sqq.; "Theologie und Glaube", II, 1910,842 sqq.).<br><br></div>

One metaphor that has been disputed is Jesus ChristÂ’s calling the apostle Peter "rock": "You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it" (Matt. 16:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br>Some have tried to argue that Jesus did not mean that his Church would be built on Peter but on something else.<br><br>Some argue that in this passage there is a minor difference between the Greek term for Peter (Petros) and the term for rock (petra), yet they ignore the obvious explanation: petra, a feminine noun, has simply been modifed to have a masculine ending, since one would not refer to a man (Peter) as feminine. The change in the gender is purely for stylistic reasons.<br><br>These critics also neglect the fact that Jesus spoke Aramaic, and, as John 1:42 tells us, in everyday life he actually referred to Peter as Kepha or Cephas (depending on how it is transliterated). It is that term which is then translated into Greek as petros. Thus, what Jesus actually said to Peter in Aramaic was: "You are Kepha and on this very kepha I will build my Church."<br><br>The Church Fathers, those Christians closest to the apostles in time, culture, and theological background, clearly understood that Jesus promised to build the Church on Peter, as the following passages show.<br><br></div>

This tract highlights some of the implications of that fact.<br><br>Because Peter was made the foundation of the Church, there were practical implications: it gave him a special place or primacy among the apostles. As the passages below demonstrate, the early Church Fathers clearly recognized this.<br><br><strong>Clement of Alexandria</strong><br>"[T]he blessed Peter, the chosen, the preeminent, the first among the disciples, for whom alone with himself the Savior paid the tribute [Matt. 17:27], quickly grasped and understood their meaning. And what does he say? Â‘Behold, we have left all and have followed youÂ’ [Matt. 19:27; Mark 10:28]" (Who Is the Rich Man That Is Saved? 21:3Â–5 [A.D. 200]).<br><br><strong>Tertullian</strong><br>"For though you think that heaven is still shut up, remember that the Lord left the keys of it to Peter here, and through him to the Church, which keys everyone will carry with him if he has been questioned and made a confession [of faith]" (Antidote Against the Scorpion 10 [A.D. 211]).<br><br>"[T]he Lord said to Peter, Â‘On this rock I will build my Church, I have given you the keys of the kingdom of heaven [and] whatever you shall have bound or loosed on earth will be bound or loosed in heavenÂ’ [Matt. 16:18Â–19]. . . . Upon you, he says, I will build my Church; and I will give to you the keys, not to the Church" (Modesty 21:9Â–10 [A.D. 220]).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Letter of Clement to James</strong></span><br>"Be it known to you, my lord, that Simon [Peter], who, for the sake of the true faith, and the most sure foundation of his doctrine, was set apart to be the foundation of the Church, and for this end was by Jesus himself, with his truthful mouth, named Peter, the first fruits of our Lord, the first of the apostles; to whom first the Father revealed the Son; whom the Christ, with good reason, blessed; the called, and elect" (Letter of Clement to James 2 [A.D. 221]).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Origen</strong></span><br>"[I]f we were to attend carefully to the Gospels, we should also find, in relation to those things which seem to be common to Peter . . . a great difference and a preeminence in the things [Jesus] said to Peter, compared with the second class [of apostles]. For it is no small difference that Peter received the keys not of one heaven but of more, and in order that whatsoever things he binds on earth may be bound not in one heaven but in them all, as compared with the many who bind on earth and loose on earth, so that these things are bound and loosed not in [all] the heavens, as in the case of Peter, but in one only; for they do not reach so high a stage with power as Peter to bind and loose in all the heavens" (Commentary on Matthew 13:31 [A.D. 248]).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cyprian of Carthage</strong></span><br>"The Lord says to Peter: Â‘I say to you,Â’ he says, Â‘that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church.Â’ . . . On him [Peter] he builds the Church, and to him he gives the command to feed the sheep [John 21:17], and although he assigns a like power to all the apostles, yet he founded a single chair [cathedra], and he established by his own authority a source and an intrinsic reason for that unity. Indeed, the others were that also which Peter was [i.e., apostles], but a primacy is given to Peter, whereby it is made clear that there is but one Church and one chair. So too, all [the apostles] are shepherds, and the flock is shown to be one, fed by all the apostles in single-minded accord. If someone does not hold fast to this unity of Peter, can he imagine that he still holds the faith? If he [should] desert the chair of Peter upon whom the Church was built, can he still be confident that he is in the Church?" (The Unity of the Catholic Church 4; 1st edition [A.D. 251]).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cyril of Jerusalem</strong></span><br>"The Lord is loving toward men, swift to pardon but slow to punish. Let no man despair of his own salvation. Peter, the first and foremost of the apostles, denied the Lord three times before a little servant girl, but he repented and wept bitterly" (Catechetical Lectures 2:19 [A.D. 350]).<br><br>"[Simon Magus] so deceived the city of Rome that Claudius erected a statue of him. . . . While the error was extending itself, Peter and Paul arrived, a noble pair and the rulers of the Church, and they set the error aright. . . . [T]hey launched the weapon of their like-mindedness in prayer against the Magus, and struck him down to earth. It was marvelous enough, and yet no marvel at all, for Peter was thereÂ—he that carries about the keys of heaven [Matt. 16:19]" (ibid., 6:14).<br><br>"In the power of the same Holy Spirit, Peter, both the chief of the apostles and the keeper of the keys of the kingdom of heaven, in the name of Christ healed Aeneas the paralytic at Lydda, which is now called Diospolis [Acts 9:32Â–34]" (ibid., 17:27).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ephraim the Syrian</strong></span><br>[Jesus said:] Simon, my follower, I have made you the foundation of the holy Church. I betimes called you Peter, because you will support all its buildings. You are the inspector of those who will build on Earth a Church for me. If they should wish to build what is false, you, the foundation, will condemn them. You are the head of the fountain from which my teaching flows; you are the chief of my disciples. Through you I will give drink to all peoples. Yours is that life-giving sweetness which I dispense. I have chosen you to be, as it were, the firstborn in my institution so that, as the heir, you may be executor of my treasures. I have given you the keys of my kingdom. Behold, I have given you authority over all my treasures" (Homilies 4:1 [A.D. 351]).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ambrose of Milan</strong></span><br>"[Christ] made answer: Â‘You are Peter, and upon this rock will I build my Church. . . .Â’ Could he not, then, strengthen the faith of the man to whom, acting on his own authority, he gave the kingdom, whom he called the rock, thereby declaring him to be the foundation of the Church [Matt. 16:18]?" (The Faith 4:5 [A.D. 379]).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pope Damasus I</strong></span><br>"Likewise it is decreed . . . that it ought to be announced that . . . the holy Roman Church has been placed at the forefront not by the conciliar decisions of other churches, but has received the primacy by the evangelic voice of our Lord and Savior, who says: Â‘You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it; and I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven . . . Â’ [Matt. 16:18Â–19]. The first see, therefore, is that of Peter the apostle, that of the Roman Church, which has neither stain nor blemish nor anything like it" (Decree of Damasus 3 [A.D. 382]).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Jerome</strong></span><br>"Â‘But,Â’ you [Jovinian] will say, Â‘it was on Peter that the Church was foundedÂ’ [Matt. 16:18]. Well . . . one among the twelve is chosen to be their head in order to remove any occasion for division" (Against Jovinian 1:26 [A.D. 393]).<br><br>"Simon Peter, the son of John, from the village of Bethsaida in the province of Galilee, brother of Andrew the apostle, and himself chief of the apostles, after having been bishop of the church of Antioch and having preached to the Dispersion . . . pushed on to Rome in the second year of Claudius to overthrow Simon Magus, and held the sacerdotal chair there for twenty-five years until the last, that is the fourteenth, year of Nero. At his hands he received the crown of martyrdom being nailed to the cross with his head towards the ground and his feet raised on high, asserting that he was unworthy to be crucified in the same manner as his Lord" (Lives of Illustrious Men 1 [A.D. 396]).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pope Innocent I</strong></span><br>"In seeking the things of God . . . you have acknowledged that judgment is to be referred to us [the pope], and have shown that you know that is owed to the Apostolic See [Rome], if all of us placed in this position are to desire to follow the apostle himself [Peter] from whom the episcopate itself and the total authority of this name have emerged" (Letters 29:1 [A.D. 408]).<br><br></div>

Because of that representation of the Church, which only he bore, he deserved to hear Â‘I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heavenÂ’" (Sermons 295:2 [A.D. 411]).<br><br>"Some things are said which seem to relate especially to the apostle Peter, and yet are not clear in their meaning unless referred to the Church, which he is acknowledged to have represented in a figure on account of the primacy which he bore among the disciples. Such is Â‘I will give unto you the keys of the kingdom of heaven,Â’ and other similar passages. In the same way, Judas represents those Jews who were ChristÂ’s enemies" (Commentary on Psalm 108 1 [A.D. 415]).<br><br>"Who is ignorant that the first of the apostles is the most blessed Peter?" (Commentary on John 56:1 [A.D. 416]).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Council of Ephesus</strong></span><br>"Philip, presbyter and legate of [Pope Celestine I] said: Â‘We offer our thanks to the holy and venerable synod, that when the writings of our holy and blessed pope had been read to you . . . you joined yourselves to the holy head also by your holy acclamations. For your blessednesses is not ignorant that the head of the whole faith, the head of the apostles, is blessed Peter the apostleÂ’" (Acts of the Council, session 2 [A.D. 431]).<br><br>"Philip, the presbyter and legate of the Apostolic See [Rome] said: Â‘There is no doubt, and in fact it has been known in all ages, that the holy and most blessed Peter, prince and head of the apostles, pillar of the faith, and foundation of the Catholic Church, received the keys of the kingdom from our Lord Jesus Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of the human race, and that to him was given the power of loosing and binding sins: who down even to today and forever both lives and judges in his successorsÂ’" (ibid., session 3).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pope Leo I</strong></span><br>"Our Lord Jesus Christ . . . has placed the principal charge on the blessed Peter, chief of all the apostles, and from him as from the head wishes his gifts to flow to all the body, so that anyone who dares to secede from PeterÂ’s solid rock may understand that he has no part or lot in the divine mystery. He wished him who had been received into partnership in his undivided unity to be named what he himself was, when he said: Â‘You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my ChurchÂ’ [Matt. 16:18], that the building of the eternal temple might rest on PeterÂ’s solid rock, strengthening his Church so surely that neither could human rashness assail it nor the gates of hell prevail against it" (Letters 10:1 [A.D. 445).<br><br>"Our Lord Jesus Christ . . . established the worship belonging to the divine [Christian] religion. . . . But the Lord desired that the sacrament of this gift should pertain to all the apostles in such a way that it might be found principally in the most blessed Peter, the highest of all the apostles. And he wanted his gifts to flow into the entire body from Peter himself, as if from the head, in such a way that anyone who had dared to separate himself from the solidarity of Peter would realize that he was himself no longer a sharer in the divine mystery" (ibid., 10:2Â–3).<br><br>"Although bishops have a common dignity, they are not all of the same rank. Even among the most blessed apostles, though they were alike in honor, there was a certain distinction of power. All were equal in being chosen, but it was given to one to be preeminent over the others. . . . [So today through the bishops] the care of the universal Church would converge in the one See of Peter, and nothing should ever be at odds with this head" (ibid., 14:11).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;"><span class="large"><strong>Apostolic Succession</strong></span></span><br><br>The first Christians had no doubts about how to determine which was the true Church and which doctrines the true teachings of Christ. The test was simple: Just trace the apostolic succession of the claimants.<br><br>Apostolic succession is the line of bishops stretching back to the apostles. All over the world, all Catholic are part of a lineage that goes back to the time of the apostles, something that is impossible in Protestant denominations (most of which do not even claim to have bishops).<br><br>The role of apostolic succession in preserving true doctrine is illustrated in the Bible. To make sure that the apostlesÂ’ teachings would be passed down after the deaths of the apostles, Paul told Timothy, "[W]hat you have heard from me before many witnesses entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also" (2 Tim. 2:2). In this passage he refers to the first three generations of apostolic successionÂ—his own generation, TimothyÂ’s generation, and the generation Timothy will teach.<br><br>The Church Fathers, who were links in that chain of succession, regularly appealed to apostolic succession as a test for whether Catholics or heretics had correct doctrine. This was necessary because heretics simply put their own interpretations, even bizarre ones, on Scripture. Clearly, something other than Scripture had to be used as an ultimate test of doctrine in these cases.<br><br>Thus the early Church historian J. N. D. Kelly, a Protestant, writes, "[W]here in practice was [the] apostolic testimony or tradition to be found? . . . The most obvious answer was that the apostles had committed it orally to the Church, where it had been handed down from generation to generation. . . . Unlike the alleged secret tradition of the Gnostics, it was entirely public and open, having been entrusted by the apostles to their successors, and by these in turn to those who followed them, and was visible in the Church for all who cared to look for it" (Early Christian Doctrines, 37).<br><br>For the early Fathers, "the identity of the oral tradition with the original revelation is guaranteed by the unbroken succession of bishops in the great sees going back lineally to the apostles. . . . [A]n additional safeguard is supplied by the Holy Spirit, for the message committed was to the Church, and the Church is the home of the Spirit. Indeed, the ChurchÂ’s bishops are . . . Spirit-endowed men who have been vouchsafed Â‘an infallible charism of truthÂ’" (ibid.).<br><br>Thus on the basis of experience the Fathers could be "profoundly convinced of the futility of arguing with heretics merely on the basis of Scripture. The skill and success with which they twisted its plain meaning made it impossible to reach any decisive conclusion in that field" (ibid., 41).<br><br>Pope Clement I<br><br>"Through countryside and city [the apostles] preached, and they appointed their earliest converts, testing them by the Spirit, to be the bishops and deacons of future believers. Nor was this a novelty, for bishops and deacons had been written about a long time earlier. . . . Our apostles knew through our Lord Jesus Christ that there would be strife for the office of bishop. For this reason, therefore, having received perfect foreknowledge, they appointed those who have already been mentioned and afterwards added the further provision that, if they should die, other approved men should succeed to their ministry" (Letter to the Corinthians 42:4Â–5, 44:1Â–3 [A.D. 80]).<br><br>Hegesippus<br><br>"When I had come to Rome, I [visited] Anicetus, whose deacon was Eleutherus. And after Anicetus [died], Soter succeeded, and after him Eleutherus. In each succession and in each city there is a continuance of that which is proclaimed by the law, the prophets, and the Lord" (Memoirs, cited in Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History 4:22 [A.D. 180]).<br><br>Irenaeus<br><br>"It is possible, then, for everyone in every church, who may wish to know the truth, to contemplate the tradition of the apostles which has been made known to us throughout the whole world. And we are in a position to enumerate those who were instituted bishops by the apostles and their successors down to our own times, men who neither knew nor taught anything like what these heretics rave about" (Against Heresies 3:3:1 [A.D. 189]).<br><br>"But since it would be too long to enumerate in such a volume as this the successions of all the churches, we shall confound all those who, in whatever manner, whether through self-satisfaction or vainglory, or through blindness and wicked opinion, assemble other than where it is proper, by pointing out here the successions of the bishops of the greatest and most ancient church known to all, founded and organized at Rome by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and PaulÂ—that church which has the tradition and the faith with which comes down to us after having been announced to men by the apostles. For with this Church, because of its superior origin, all churches must agree, that is, all the faithful in the whole world. And it is in her that the faithful everywhere have maintained the apostolic tradition" (ibid., 3:3:2).<br><br>"Polycarp also was not only instructed by apostles, and conversed with many who had seen Christ, but was also, by apostles in Asia, appointed bishop of the church in Smyrna, whom I also saw in my early youth, for he tarried [on earth] a very long time, and, when a very old man, gloriously and most nobly suffering martyrdom, departed this life, having always taught the things which he had learned from the apostles, and which the Church has handed down, and which alone are true. To these things all the Asiatic churches testify, as do also those men who have succeeded Polycarp down to the present time" (ibid., 3:3:4).<br><br>"Since therefore we have such proofs, it is not necessary to seek the truth among others which it is easy to obtain from the Church; since the apostles, like a rich man [depositing his money] in a bank, lodged in her hands most copiously all things pertaining to the truth, so that every man, whosoever will, can draw from her the water of life. . . . For how stands the case? Suppose there arise a dispute relative to some important question among us, should we not have recourse to the most ancient churches with which the apostles held constant conversation, and learn from them what is certain and clear in regard to the present question?" (ibid., 3:4:1).<br><br>"[I]t is incumbent to obey the presbyters who are in the ChurchÂ—those who, as I have shown, possess the succession from the apostles; those who, together with the succession of the episcopate, have received the infallible charism of truth, according to the good pleasure of the Father. But [it is also incumbent] to hold in suspicion others who depart from the primitive succession, and assemble themselves together in any place whatsoever, either as heretics of perverse minds, or as schismatics puffed up and self-pleasing, or again as hypocrites, acting thus for the sake of lucre and vainglory. For all these have fallen from the truth" (ibid., 4:26:2).<br><br>"The true knowledge is the doctrine of the apostles, and the ancient organization of the Church throughout the whole world, and the manifestation of the body of Christ according to the succession of bishops, by which succession the bishops have handed down the Church which is found everywhere" (ibid., 4:33:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tertullian<br><br>"[The apostles] founded churches in every city, from which all the other churches, one after another, derived the tradition of the faith, and the seeds of doctrine, and are every day deriving them, that they may become churches. Indeed, it is on this account only that they will be able to deem themselves apostolic, as being the offspring of apostolic churches. Every sort of thing must necessarily revert to its original for its classification. Therefore the churches, although they are so many and so great, comprise but the one primitive Church, [founded] by the apostles, from which they all [spring]. In this way, all are primitive, and all are apostolic, while they are all proved to be one in unity" (Demurrer Against the Heretics 20 [A.D. 200]).<br><br>"[W]hat it was which Christ revealed to them [the apostles] can, as I must here likewise prescribe, properly be proved in no other way than by those very churches which the apostles founded in person, by declaring the gospel to them directly themselves . . . If then these things are so, it is in the same degree manifest that all doctrine which agrees with the apostolic churchesÂ—those molds and original sources of the faith must be reckoned for truth, as undoubtedly containing that which the churches received from the apostles, the apostles from Christ, [and] Christ from God. Whereas all doctrine must be prejudged as false which savors of contrariety to the truth of the churches and apostles of Christ and God. It remains, then, that we demonstrate whether this doctrine of ours, of which we have now given the rule, has its origin in the tradition of the apostles, and whether all other doctrines do not ipso facto proceed from falsehood" (ibid., 21).<br><br>"But if there be any [heresies] which are bold enough to plant [their origin] in the midst of the apostolic age, that they may thereby seem to have been handed down by the apostles, because they existed in the time of the apostles, we can say: Let them produce the original records of their churches; let them unfold the roll of their bishops, running down in due succession from the beginning in such a manner that [their first] bishop shall be able to show for his ordainer and predecessor some one of the apostles or of apostolic menÂ—a man, moreover, who continued steadfast with the apostles. For this is the manner in which the apostolic churches transmit their registers: as the church of Smyrna, which records that Polycarp was placed therein by John; as also the church of Rome, which makes Clement to have been ordained in like manner by Peter" (ibid., 32).<br><br>"But should they even effect the contrivance [of composing a succession list for themselves], they will not advance a step. For their very doctrine, after comparison with that of the apostles [as contained in other churches], will declare, by its own diversity and contrariety, that it had for its author neither an apostle nor an apostolic man; because, as the apostles would never have taught things which were self-contradictory" (ibid.).<br><br>"Then let all the heresies, when challenged to these two tests by our apostolic Church, offer their proof of how they deem themselves to be apostolic. But in truth they neither are so, nor are they able to prove themselves to be what they are not. Nor are they admitted to peaceful relations and communion by such churches as are in any way connected with apostles, inasmuch as they are in no sense themselves apostolic because of their diversity as to the mysteries of the faith" (ibid.).<br><br>Cyprian of Carthage<br><br>"[T]he Church is one, and as she is one, cannot be both within and without. For if she is with [the heretic] Novatian, she was not with [Pope] Cornelius. But if she was with Cornelius, who succeeded the bishop [of Rome], Fabian, by lawful ordination, and whom, beside the honor of the priesthood the Lord glorified also with martyrdom, Novatian is not in the Church; nor can he be reckoned as a bishop, who, succeeding to no one, and despising the evangelical and apostolic tradition, sprang from himself. For he who has not been ordained in the Church can neither have nor hold to the Church in any way" (Letters 69[75]:3 [A.D. 253]).<br><br>Jerome<br><br>"Far be it from me to speak adversely of any of these clergy who, in succession from the apostles, confect by their sacred word the Body of Christ and through whose efforts also it is that we are Christians" (Letters 14:8 [A.D. 396]).<br><br><strong>Augustine</strong><br>"[T]here are many other things which most properly can keep me in [the Catholic ChurchÂ’s] bosom. The unanimity of peoples and nations keeps me here. Her authority, inaugurated in miracles, nourished by hope, augmented by love, and confirmed by her age, keeps me here. The succession of priests, from the very see of the apostle Peter, to whom the Lord, after his resurrection, gave the charge of feeding his sheep [John 21:15Â–17], up to the present episcopate, keeps me here. And last, the very name Catholic, which, not without reason, belongs to this Church alone, in the face of so many heretics, so much so that, although all heretics want to be called Â‘Catholic,Â’ when a stranger inquires where the Catholic Church meets, none of the heretics would dare to point out his own basilica or house" (Against the Letter of Mani Called "The Foundation" 4:5 [A.D. 397]).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FrustMom: Thank you for the infomation given from - http://www.catholic.com<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Honeybunz:</div><div class="quote_body">Yes, Jesus did talk about him being the Cornerstone.  But they were parables for His other teachings.  He appointing Peter is not a teaching.  It was a command.  It is just like you can't put the story of Moses being told to write the 10 commandments with the story of Adam and Eve.<br><br>Also, based on "Peter is the stone, not the Rock" interpretion, the sentence will be:<br><br>"Simon Peter, you are the stone.  I will build my church onto me."<br>This sound completely meaningless and ambigious, regardless of what language you translate to.  The two sentences were totally not linked in any way.  Even if you read everything non literally, probably symbolically, there is no way that putting the two sentences together going to make any sense.  They are in fact about two issues, two different issues.  But why were they said in one line and not two different dialogue or written in two paragraphs.<br><br>Also what has the little stone got to do with the Rock?  The stone doesn't support the Rock and vice versa.  How does putting these two totally non related together, other than they are both from the nature.  But in the case, I don't think Jesus is talking about natures.<br><br>However, based on the "Peter is the Rock" version, the sentence means:<br>"Simon, you are the Rock.  And I will build my church on you the Rock."<br>Regardless of what language this is said in, it still means the same.<br><br>This is a very simple paragraph in the bible.  There is no need to go into solid bible study.  Going deeper into it will only lead to confusion and thus result in many different kinds of interpretions. Why go so deep to understand it, when the ppl of nearly two thousand years ago had already done so for you?<br><br>Do you know that it is because ppl today try to go too deep into bible study in hope of finding new teachings that have not been discovered by the Church, that they end up coming up with all sorts of teachings and even claim to be able to predict when the world is ending.<br><br>I am not telling you to be lazy.  But to let you know that this part of the bible has already been understood, interpreted and taught in the church for nearly two thousand years.  So why come up with a different meaning?<br><br>As you can see that the Catholic Church has been the original church.  Can they be wrong in this?  If they are wrong, then none of us will be right today, you &amp; I inclusive.<br><br>The reason why I stress so much on the history is to tell everyone that this is the original church.  So there is no need to come up with new teachings to counter them.<br><br>In case my reasoning of knowing church history is not enough or clear, following the original church's teaching will lead you no more wrong than reading the bible yourself, thinking that you're in the counsel of the Holy Spirit.  The early church has already been inspired by the Holy Spirit when they penned down the teachings and bible interpretion.  So it is unnecessary to get Holy Spirit to inspire us to come out with a different way of understanding bible, esp if it is going to differs from the early teachings.  Don't forget how the cult groups were formed.  Their founders all claimed to be inspired or have seen God or angels, after they pray.<br><br>And also by understanding what happened in the history, it further explains why some teachers taught this part the way they do.<br><br>Simple and straightforward reasons :<br>If Peter was not the Rock, they can further argue that Peter was not the first leader of the church.<br><br>If Peter was not the first leader or leader of the Apostles, then there is no way for the Catholics or any successors of Peter to claim that their church goes back to the time of Christ.  The Catholic Church will not be the original church in this case.<br><br>What if the Catholic Church is proven to be the original church?<br>Some believers will find their way to the Catholic Church because they want to find the root of the faith, be in the church that Christ Himself has founded or be in a church with a deeper and longer foundation.<br><br>This is something that many non Catholics do not want to see.  </div></blockquote>Honeybunz: Clearly there are differences in beliefs, between you and me.<br><br>I'll let it rest here and will still continue to stand on my claims.<br>We shall meet again in other threads.<br><br>Cheers</div>
