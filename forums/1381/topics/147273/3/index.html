            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fast Facts about the Old Testament</span><br><ul>1. The OT is almost identical to the Jewish Tanakh<br>2. The OT was originally written in Hebrew<br>3. The OT has 39 books (not counting the Apocrypha)<br>4. The names of OT books in <strong>Hebrew</strong> are based on the first prominent word or phrase in that book<br>5. The names of OT books in Greek (and English) are based on the general topic of the book<br>6. The books of the OT are: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 &amp; 2 Samuel, 1 &amp; 2 Kings, 1 &amp; 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.<br>7. The first five books of the OT (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy) are known as the Five Books of Moses, the Pentateuch, or the Torah. They are traditionally held to have been written by Moses, but modern scholars have proposed that there were four or five authors.<br>8. The book of Esther is the only book of the Bible that never mentions God  </ul><br></div>
