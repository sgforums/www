            <div class='col-md body'>Topic as above, getting confused since no one gave me any reasonable explanations. So, just curious, what are your views on this...???<br><br><blockquote>When Christianity spread throughout the West, the Ptolemaic system became widely accepted, and although the Church never issued any formal pronouncement on the question of alien life at least tacitly the idea was aberrant.<br><br>In 1277 the Bishop of Paris, Ã‰tienne Tempier, did overturn Aristotle on one point: God could have created more than one world (given His omnipotence) yet we know by revelation He only made one.<br><br>Taking a further step and arguing that aliens actually existed remained rare. Notably, Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa speculated about aliens on the moon and sun.</blockquote> Sourced From Wikipedia.</div>
