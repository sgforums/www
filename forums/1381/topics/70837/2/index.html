            <div class='col-md body'>A Prayer Against Temptation<br><br>"On reaching the place, He said to them, 'Pray that you will not fall into temptation'" (Luke 22:40)<br><br>Jesus said to me, "Temptation is a universal condition for humankind. The Spirit can help you avoid falling into temptation." Wouldn't we all love to avoid temptation? That would certainly have been true in January of 1951 for a little boy who lived in Glendale, California. Six-year-old Richard Bonham had been reading Superman comic books. He got caught up in the story of a man who "could fly faster than a speeding bullet, was more powerful than a locomotive, and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound." Superman's ability to fly was the superpower that Richard envied the most. Too young to distinguish reality from fantasy, Richard fashioned a "flying cape" from an old bath towel and ran to a twenty-foot cliff near his home. Richard boldly stepped off the cliff into the air. The newspapers reported that his mother found him and before Richard died, he whispered, "I really did fly, Mother, until I landed. Then it hurt."<br><br>How many times have you thought you could fashion your future and fly by your own power? How many times have you crashed and had to confess failure and hurt? It is little consolation to know that you are not alone. Since our first parents fell in the Garden of Eden, sin and Satan have convinced each of us that we are Super-people who can fly by our own power, independent of God. But all of us will eventually crash and die. We are not super people, but rather super sinners. Jesus entered this world to conquer temptation. In the wilderness He sent Satan scurrying, throughout His life He fulfilled the law, and on Easter Sunday He defeated death. By the power of the Spirit, we have hope to resist temptation. Then, on Judgment Day when Jesus asks me, "Did you pray to avoid temptation?" I can reply, "With Your help, dear Lord, I did."<br><br>Prayer:<br><br>Dear Jesus, by my own reason or strength I cannot resist temptation. Only the Holy Spirit enables me to be victorious. Help me do what you will. In Your Name. Amen.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Look<br><br>"The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter" (Luke 22:61)<br><br>Jesus didn't say anything to me. He just gave me a look. I understand the look Jesus gave to Peter because I have seen it on my father's face. A blacksmith by trade and a Christian throughout his life, he tried his best to be faithful and fair. Out of respect, we children tried to do right most of the time. When we messed up, we could judge the severity of our sin by his response. A loud voice meant it was a minor infraction. If he called us by our full names ("KENNETH RICHARD KLAUS") we were in deep trouble. But when he gave us the look, we knew we had royally goofed up. Anything-a spanking, getting grounded, losing privileges-was better than the look. The look said we had disappointed Dad, had hurt him so deeply that words could not express his sadness.<br><br>Peter got the look from his Savior. Jesus had many things on His mind in the final hours of His life. He was in the High Priest's house awaiting the trials that would lead to His death on the cross. Jesus should not have had to worry about a disciple who was denying Him out in the courtyard. But Jesus was concerned about that single, weak disciple. Jesus was carrying the sins of the entire world, but He was also thinking of Peter's sinsÂ….and yoursÂ….and mine. Peter got the look because Jesus cared, and it sent Peter out in tears. The look of the Savior also set Peter on the road to repentance, apostlehood, martyrdom and salvation. Jesus didn't say anything to me, but I pray that when He gives me the look, I will be as open to change and repentance as Peter was.<br><br>Prayer:<br><br>Dear Lord Jesus, You have done so much for me, that it is right that my life should always serve You. Grant me the grace to do so with faithfulness. In Your Name. Amen.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Deafening Silence<br><br>"Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, 'Are You not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against You?' But Jesus remained silent" (Matthew 26:62-63)<br><br>Although Jesus didn't say it to the high priests, He did say to me, "I'm innocent." That's more than any of us can say. If you doubt it, consider what would happen if Jesus knocked on the door of your home. Of course you'd invite Him in. You would let Him sleep on the best bed in the house. You would probably sound like a broken record telling Him repeatedly that you're glad He came. You would prepare the best food you could. But is it possible that you would change a few things before you let Him in the door? Would you change the TV shows you watch? Would you put away a few magazines and set out the Bible in their place? Would your table prayer suddenly be longer and more personal, not just a going-through-the-motions kind of thing? Would you want Jesus with you while you're talking on the phone with your closest friends? Would you breathe a sigh of relief when Jesus finally said that He had to go? Obviously, none of us can claim to be completely innocent.<br><br>Only Jesus is perfect. In today's passage, He was on trial for His physical, and our eternal, life. As the omnipotent Son of God, he could have ordered the false witnesses to be silent. He could have softened the hearts of His judges. He could have said, "I am innocent," and forced everyone to accept His Word. But Jesus kept His silence so that on Judgment Day we could be declared innocent. He died so that we can live forever. It was the greatest travesty of justice the world has ever seen and the greatest act of grace. Nevertheless, when Jesus says to me, "I'm innocent," I can only thank Him for His silence before the high priest. That silence speaks volumes about His love.<br><br>Prayer:<br><br>Dear Lord Jesus, I can never honestly say, "I'm innocent." Forgive me for my sins and empower me to live for Your glory. In Your Name. Amen.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Born For Truth<br><br>"Jesus answered, 'You are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.' 'What is truth?' Pilate asked" (John 18:37-3<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Jesus said to me, "It's hard for some people to believe, but I always tell the truth." That's one thing that sets Jesus apart. Even when we try to tell the truth, we often don't. For example, here are statements from newspapers, magazines, and official documents that were widely read and believed during their day. In 1840, an expert said, "Anyone traveling at the speed of thirty miles per hour would surely suffocate." In 1878, an editorial asserted, "electric lights are unworthy of serious attention." An expert in 1901 said "no possible combination can be united into a practical machine by which men shall fly." It was a scientist who said, in 1926, "This foolish idea of shooting at the moon is basically impossible." In 1930 another scientist said "to harness the energy locked up in matter is impossible."<br><br>In a world filled with lies, Pilate was wise to ask his skeptical question, "What is truth?" He was wrong to assume that the truth could not exist. It would be easy to follow in Pilate's skepticism, because we are also surrounded by politicians who break promises and friends who are false. Like Pilate, we can become great doubters. But Jesus' promises are guaranteed with His life. When He says, "I am with you," He is there. When He says, "Call upon Me," He will listen. When Jesus says, "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life," it is so. Through His death and resurrection, Jesus gives us God's truth to cling to. When Jesus says to me, "Everyone on the side of truth listens to Me," I know I'm glad to listen.<br><br>Prayer:<br><br>Dear Lord Jesus, let Your truth fill my heart with gratitude and trust. Send Your Spirit so the world may see what truth is. In Your Name. Amen.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A New Start<br><br>"This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem" (Luke 24:46-47)<br><br>Jesus said to me, "My suffering and resurrection should bring people to repentance and salvation." Two men on a business trip had committed just about every sin they could think of. On the way to the airport they drove by a church and one man challenged, "I'll bet $100 you won't go into that church and confess everything you did last night to the pastor." The second fellow said, "Easy money." He went inside, found the pastor, and related the previous night's escapades. Discerning the man's insincerity, the pastor said, "Go to the front of the church, kneel before the statue of Jesus, look into the Savior's suffering face and say, 'Jesus, all this you did for me, and I couldn't care less.'" The man went to the altar, stood in front of the crucifix, and flippantly began, "Jesus all this You did for me and I . . ." Everything he'd ever learned about Jesus' sacrifice came flooding over him. Still, he had a bet to win, so he cleared his throat and began again, "Jesus, all this You did for me . . ." and then he burst into tears. The Spirit rekindled repentance and faith in his heart.<br><br>Jesus' death and resurrection show that God values people who we might consider worthless. The Lord looks beyond the wreckage of sin and sees a person of great worth in the most hopeless transgressor. The Lord saved the demoniac who lived among the tombs, the sinful woman at the well, the Ethiopian eunuch in his chariot, Saul on a journey to arrest and persecute Christians. You probably know someone who needs to hear about the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ. Today is the perfect time to invite someone to hear the joyful Easter proclamation tomorrow.<br><br>Prayer:<br><br>Dear Lord Jesus, all this You have done for me, and I am thankful. Grant me grace to reach out in Your Name. Amen.<br><br></div>
