I can't resolve this dilemma and the pre-tribbers are so happy and they never thot about this. I also never thot about this. Yes, it's sort of unfair but God will make it fair somehow. Maybe the full number of gentiles will come in no matter what and those who haven't heard will not accept the gospel even if they heard? I don't know. Maybe a better scenario will be mid-trib, post-trib or pre-wrath rapture. There are strong evidences of post-trib rapture in the bible.</div>

We are now living in the internet age where everywhere can be reached by internet so many would have heard or at least read about it. Millions are coming to Christ even muslims. Also I heard last time Pastor Prince says the Jews will finish evangelising the world by the 144,000 Jewish evangelists who are sealed by God. But still not fair. Can't resolve. Has anybody thot about this? Many people say pre-tribbers are selfish and mad. They just want to escape and not endure the tribulation. Maybe it's post-trib?</div>

Also Jesus will come like a thief in the night to snatch away His bride. We are not appointed for wrath so we won't go thru the tribulation which is God's wrath upon an unbelieving world.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>"When he [Jesus] had said this, as they were watching, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. While he was going and they were gazing up towards heaven, suddenly two men in white robes stood by them. They said, 'Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up towards heaven? This <strong>Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven</strong>.'" Acts 1:9-11</blockquote>Christians will meet Christ on Earth in the final judgement. Before the Judgement, we will not meet Christ so the Rapture cannot be true.  The angel said Christ would return the same way: he will appear from a cloud, descend to the ground, and place his feet on the earth. From this it would appear likely that Christ will return just as the angel foretold, and that the tribulation believers remaining alive will see him as he comes.<br><br>[quote]<span class="large">Many do not accept the pre-Tribulation rapture interpretation because they believe that it is not clearly expressed in the Bible, but instead relies on extrapolations and inferences made from unconnected verses[citation needed]. Many further believe that if anything this significant were intended to be a major part of Christian teaching, then surely Christ would have made a plain reference to it in his own sermons as recorded in the Gospel, and not buried such a major prophecy in a few verses of the Apostle Paul[citation needed]. Many times the New Testament describes when something will happen "before" another event. Indeed, three times the idea of "before an event" is used with reference to the coming of Christ. The first of these is Acts 2:20 where it refers to events that will happen "before" the coming of ChristÂ—in this case his first coming. In the second, 1 Corinthians 4:5, Paul warns his readers against pronouncing judgments "before" the Lord returns. The third is in the heart of the primary passage that is used to support the idea of a pre-tribulation rapture. At 1 Thessalonians 4:15 it says that those who are living will not precede or go "before" those who have died at the coming of the Lord. And as noted in 2 Thessalonians 2:3 it says that the Antichrist will occur before the coming of Christ.<br><br>The New Testament even discusses the tribulationÂ’s chronological relationship to other events related to the second coming using the concept of "before". At Matthew 24:29 it says, "Immediately after the tribulation of those days". But it never says that "before the tribulation" Christians will be taken away as Darby asserts[citation needed].<br><br>Thus if the New Testament writers desire to connect two events in terms of time Â— even in relation to ChristÂ’s coming or the tribulation Â— it has the language and grammar to do it. But no passage in the New Testament directly describes any coming of Christ as happening "before the tribulation"[[/</span>quote]</div>
