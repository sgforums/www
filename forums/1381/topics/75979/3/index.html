The basis of my faith is to love God with all my heart, soul and mind and also to love people sincerely.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by NeonTetra:</div><div class="quote_body">Do they focus on a charismatic speaker? Do they go after some nice looking church buildings? Do they see church as another social gathering?<br></div></blockquote>I do not focus on any speaker. I just greatly respect leaders, pastors, etc who are 'appointed' by God. Church is the gate of heaven. It has got to be clean, tidy, excellent and beautiful. I can't imagine going into a dark, shabby, sloppy, dirty place to worship God.<br></div>
