It's a matter of attitude and who we consider God at the end of the day. Pointing fingers is wrong..we r not to judge, but Christian edification i believe is very important. See something wrong and going wrong, its our duty to rebuke in love and not in condemnation. If every Christians says 'we should not point finger' and keep their mouths shut over such issues..one day...the church will become something disgusting.<br><br>Jesus in His holy anger, chased the traders out of the Temple with a whip. His zealous love for God resulted in such actions. Likewise, we cannot condone such lukewarmness any longer..but always remember, do it in love and not in condemnation. Take a stand...there is no fence to sit upon.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to put it simply....<br><br>this thread is not aimed to pour boiling oil on anybody but rather a wake-up call?<br><br>When we say we are Christians..many people are in disbeliefs not because the Bible is wrong..but the person bearing that name has erred and thus disfiguring the glory of the gospel.<br><br>When we say we are Christians, is it only on Sundays? Is God the only anchor of our lives..without whom we can surely say we die? Is our faith manisfested in our lives? Do we need to engage in religious activities only to be seen 'holy'...holiness can be seen everywhere...and doing simple things.<br><br>When we say we are Christian. By name or my who we are? Is it merely a word 'Christianity' to fill up forms or tell ppl. Or is it a conviction that even when whole world does not know u r one..u r still one?<br><br>i emphasis again...i say this to myself also.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Men would always be hypocrites no matter whether they are believers or non-believers. In the charismatic church I went last time, I once had the infamous XXXX family members sitting beside me. They answered enthusiastically to every 'AMEN' and 'Hallelujah' the pastor asked for.<br><br>My gf is leaving the church with me to a denominational church. However,<br>there is once my gf told me that, even if we were to leave her Charismatic Church, all she would lose would be 'earthly blessings' (WHAT???)  I have asked her what she meant by 'earthly blessings', and she rephrased it by saying 'positive outlook'. I told her that no matter which church we go, we just need to have faith that GOD will provide for us, not Pastor XXX.<br><br>My gf was initially from a denominational church and she is a devout christian. But I think the problem with her is that she believed strongly in those prosperity and hope messages preached in the charismatic church. She claimed that what the denominational churchs preached did not tell her abt the grace message of our Lord. I think she is seriously brain-washed. We are reading the bible more each day. Hope she will one day realise that a lot of things she had believed before were unbiblical.<br><br></div>
