Think: those that have huge 'gawdy' structures (even crosses, most in neon lighting), whose leaders have middle to upper-middle class incomes, whose community work tend to portray themselves as unique among neighbouring churches, whose members (mainly youth) tend to dress over-the-top for service, with elitism in the way they carry themselves, whose programs subtly push themselves into the limelight....<br><br>The crux of my thread, in somewhat agreement with yours, is to point out that these 'modern' Christians have forgotten how to be meek and lowly in the eyes of men, yet be mounted up with surmounting power to live victoriously as children of God in this world of sin and death.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yea. i feel its not easy to just label someone as a hypocrite. what is a hypocrite?<br><br>like i said in my previous post. a smoker knows that smoking is wrong, but is unable to quit YET, but he HAS to tell someone not to get into smoking habit. does that make him a hypocrite?<br><br>and just because someone is unable to commit as much as a "good christian" can to the Lord, doesn't make him a "lousy christian" or a hypocrite? i don't know why lots of christians have this horrible mindset.<br><br>i feel whatever that goes on between a person and God, should stay between him and God.<br><br>but we're all human.. judging one another in comparison to our standard is part of that human nature i guess..<br><br>i've seen alot of rubbish people butting in and comparing my christian life and theirs, saying i should do this, i should do that.<br><br>point is, not everyone has enough faith to perform certain roles. for example. while one christian may have the faith to goto china and be a missionary, another might not have. but that "weaker christian" has the faith to do other task. does it make him lesser a christian than the other?<br></div>
