              <p>hahaha....I didn't say I know the Bible, and definitely wouldn't quote the Bible if I don't know.</p>
              <p>Can you tell me what is the relevance of the quote to stoning Christians?</p>
              <p>If you don't believe in the Bible, why do you bother what the Bible says? Yes, the Bible tells us that God the creator had sent His son Jesus Christ to earth, and those who accept Him will have salvation to return to God in heaven in eternity. There is no other way! The Bible doesn't say anything about other religion. You want to know about other religion, then go read their books.</p>
              <p>In the end, it is up to you to decide which book do you want to believe.</p>

              <p>1.  You ask "how?", I give an answer.    To say "shoot them", "fuck them" or anything else is also an answer,  but I pick some answer from the bible.</p>
              <p>2.  As non-Christians they can choose to stone or not to stone Christians and it is based on one's decision and one's act and the outcome is to be bore by ownself.

              <p>3.  As Christians it is totally another thing.  As the Bible is the infallible word of GxD, whatever written in the Bible is true as claimed by Christians.  So the act of stoning a Christian to strengthen a Christian's faith as written in the Bible is TRUE to a Christian.</p>
              <p>4.  If Christians believe wholly in the book of GxD, and meets with practices of the contemporary time that contradicts that in the book of GxD, what do some of the Christians do?   Say "must not take the word literally".  This is the the time when the trouble of you people practising the "pick and choose" to suit oneself starts.  This isn't a problem, until when you people starts to enforce what you all "pick and choose" onto people who are not in the same faith as you people.</p>
              <p>5.  So certain times when happy, Christians say certain parts of the book of GxD is to be followed, so certain times when not happy, Christians say certain parts of the book of GxD is not to be taken literally.  So I asked them, are you GxD?  Then how do you know which parts are to be taken literally and which parts aren't?</p>
              <p>6.  So some Christians say GxD give you the wisdom to "follow your own heart and eyes".   See the cyclical problem now???  (a thousand people will give a thousand different interpretation on what ought to be done and what ought not to be done, then) so I think I do not need to elaborate as i have made my point very clear</p>

              <p>aiya, I never say anything about myself. Now I tell you. I am a Christian because I accept Jesus as my savior to save me from all the wrong things and most importantly to help me not do all the things I shouldn't do. having said that, I am still a human being, like all other Christians and non Christians, so I made mistakes,  let my desire runs wild, my temper got out of control, .....  I can only say that you read the Bible and learn what the Bible tells you to do, and don't follow or get offended by the things that some Christians do.</p>
              <p>If Christians are happy in giving their money to their churches, why are non Christians unhappy. Nobody is asking you to give. Put it another way, we give to church and are happy, it is just like you paying for an ipad, you happy?</p>

              <p>That is for non-Christians, of course, since it was the non-Christians (the Jews) who stoned Paul, and since the non-Christians do not believe in the words of the Bible, whether they do throw stones or not, the consequences itself does not have whatever association with the Bible.</p>
              <p>Now for the Christians, of course, since the Christians believe in the words of the GxD and obey the Bible, does Christians (including you maybe) believe in being stoned makes you a stronger Christian?</p>
              <p>1.  If yes, should the act of throwing stones at Christians be encouraged so that it makes you people a stronger Christian?</p>

              <p>hahaha....I didn't say I know the Bible, and definitely wouldn't quote the Bible if I don't know.</p>
              <p>Can you tell me what is the relevance of the quote to stoning Christians?</p>
              <p>If you don't believe in the Bible, why do you bother what the Bible says? Yes, the Bible tells us that God the creator had sent His son Jesus Christ to earth, and those who accept Him will have salvation to return to God in heaven in eternity. There is no other way! The Bible doesn't say anything about other religion. You want to know about other religion, then go read their books.</p>
              <p>In the end, it is up to you to decide which book do you want to believe.</p>

              <p>That is for non-Christians, of course, since it was the non-Christians (the Jews) who stoned Paul, and since the non-Christians do not believe in the words of the Bible, whether they do throw stones or not, the consequences itself does not have whatever association with the Bible.</p>
              <p>Now for the Christians, of course, since the Christians believe in the words of the GxD and obey the Bible, does Christians (including you maybe) believe in being stoned makes you a stronger Christian?</p>
              <p>1.  If yes, should the act of throwing stones at Christians be encouraged so that it makes you people a stronger Christian?</p>
              <p>2.  If no, why no follow the word of GxD?</p>
              <p>3.  Any other answers are welcome.</p>
