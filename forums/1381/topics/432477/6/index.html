              <p>If China rules Taiwan? This is politics already. China is ruling HK and Macao now, and churches in both places are more active than ever before.</p>

There is no need to use thumb drives.</p>

              <p>A non-registered church is not a political church. Firstly, if the church bring up social issues like helping poor people, it embarrasses the city or provincial government. This is not political. Even if you are not from a church, if you are a charitable organisation or if you travel to Beijing to complain about corruption, your local government will suppress the news, or may even kidnap you and bring you back.</p>
              <p>Secondly, a non-political issue such as God being the ultimate authority to Christians, is of concern to the government.</p>
              <p>Basically the registered church is pro-government just like the government dalai lama. It won't bring up such issues even if they are non-political.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, there are so many passages on unjust rulers in the Bible. They will "take care" in their interpretations.</p>
              <p>Fourth, a church's dealings with foreign pastors is naturally a cause for concern, more so than the internet because faith is involved and because the church can reach even illiterate people.</p>
              <p>Fifth, Christianity has different reach within China. The Govt tolerates official churches in areas with existing congregations but is trying to restrict Christianity's spread to other areas it is not common in.</p>

              <p>They accept the prosperity theory from Kong Hee.     Kong Hee makes christianity sounds and looks real bad.    Kong Hee believes christians need to be rich to reach out to people on christianity.   This is wrong christian teaching.     Jesus was poor when he was on earth .   He went on preaching.    I suppose Kong Yee does not condone poor Jesus preaching.    </p>

              <p>Hey, dude before you wrote this I was replying to a christian friend who keep preaching to me that a christian is always a christian.  Once one accepted God he is a christian forever.  It is so crappy!   That is to say one cannot leave christianity and convert to other religions.  </p>

              <p>One day while the pastor was there, a Public Security man came to the church to talk big and disturb the local Christians. He saw the pastor was looking very shocked and asked who he was. When the local told him, he was equally shocked and left the church. The local told him he is welcome to come more often because they don't do these things in front of foreigners.</p>
