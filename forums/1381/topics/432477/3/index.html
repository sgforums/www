              <p>almond cookies,</p>
              <p>after reviewing all your postings, i must say that you are really a bigot.</p>
              <p>a bigot that is generated by a religion that is intolerant of other religions.</p>
              <p>i have many friends from city harvest and from the other churches.</p>
              <p>they have LEFT the church.</p>
              <p>Why? because the modern church focus on money.</p>
              <p>so the church seeks to expand and absorbs more people into it.</p>
              <p>it is sucking the congregation dry .</p>
              <p>that is why people left</p>
              <p>one friend of mine was sucked dry. did not even have money to buy food.</p>
              <p>i am so disgusted.</p>
              <p>why did the money go to?</p>
              <p>kong hee and his wife , sun ho, lived in an expensive condo.</p>
              <p>Not satisfied, they rented an expensive landed property in the  united states.</p>
              <p>currently under police investigations.</p>
              <p>kong hee knew no shame and stayed on in city harvest.</p>
              <p>after all, city harvest is his cash cow.</p>
              <p>he gets to milk the money every weekend.</p>
              <p>university graduates with high earning power are targeted.</p>
              <p>why, first, because the university graduates are idealistic</p>
              <p>second, the uni grad can pour in the money.</p>
              <p>But , the uni grad will not stay for long.</p>
              <p>why? because they are smart enough to see that city harvest is bullshitting them.</p>
              <p>prayers go unanswered. they leave. as simple as that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Next to the other point of contention. Almond cookie, u praise your god.</p>
              <p>I would like to ask you on WHERE is your god when the catholic clergy sodomise the</p>
              <p>poor orphans for the past fifty years. For fifty years, innocent young orphans were</p>
              <p>subjected to sexual abuse( sodomy) at the hands of the clergyman whom are</p>
              <p>suppose to the men of god. Men of god sexually abusing young children in the house</p>
              <p>of god for FIFTY YEARS. Where is your god, may i ask?</p>
              <p>on one hand , we have kong hee who sucks people dry like a leech and on the other</p>
              <p>hand, we have catholic priest that screwed little orphan boys.</p>
              <p>People lose faith in the religion.</p>
              <p>So , almond cookie, be more humble next time.</p>

              <p>almond cookies,</p>
              <p>after reviewing all your postings, i must say that you are really a bigot.</p>
              <p>a bigot that is generated by a religion that is intolerant of other religions.</p>
              <p>i have many friends from city harvest and from the other churches.</p>
              <p>they have LEFT the church.</p>
              <p>Why? because the modern church focus on money.</p>
              <p>so the church seeks to expand and absorbs more people into it.</p>
              <p>it is sucking the congregation dry .</p>
              <p>that is why people left</p>
              <p>one friend of mine was sucked dry. did not even have money to buy food.</p>
              <p>i am so disgusted.</p>
              <p>why did the money go to?</p>
              <p>kong hee and his wife , sun ho, lived in an expensive condo.</p>
              <p>Not satisfied, they rented an expensive landed property in the  united states.</p>
              <p>currently under police investigations.</p>
              <p>kong hee knew no shame and stayed on in city harvest.</p>
              <p>after all, city harvest is his cash cow.</p>
              <p>he gets to milk the money every weekend.</p>
              <p>university graduates with high earning power are targeted.</p>
              <p>why, first, because the university graduates are idealistic</p>
              <p>second, the uni grad can pour in the money.</p>
              <p>But , the uni grad will not stay for long.</p>
              <p>why? because they are smart enough to see that city harvest is bullshitting them.</p>
              <p>prayers go unanswered. they leave. as simple as that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Next to the other point of contention. Almond cookie, u praise your god.</p>
              <p>I would like to ask you on WHERE is your god when the catholic clergy sodomise the</p>
              <p>poor orphans for the past fifty years. For fifty years, innocent young orphans were</p>
              <p>subjected to sexual abuse( sodomy) at the hands of the clergyman whom are</p>
              <p>suppose to the men of god. Men of god sexually abusing young children in the house</p>
              <p>of god for FIFTY YEARS. Where is your god, may i ask?</p>
              <p>on one hand , we have kong hee who sucks people dry like a leech and on the other</p>
              <p>hand, we have catholic priest that screwed little orphan boys.</p>
              <p>People lose faith in the religion.</p>
              <p>So , almond cookie, be more humble next time.</p>

              <p>To Servant: i must say this.  what is different between the priest or other well paid professionals is this : the priest is suppose to be the servant of god.</p>
              <p>he is suppose to be a tool of god and he abuse little boys' anus</p>
              <p>Excuse me but this is inexcusable.</p>
              <p>if christians come and tell me how "pure" their religion is, i must certainly remind them that their god and church kept the sexual abuse of little orphan boys carry on for 50 years .</p>
              <p>did their god not teach them not to bear false witness?</p>
              <p>then why did the vatican cover up the tracks of the paedophilic priest and not deflock them?</p>
              <p>the vatican knew the abuse and cover them up.</p>
              <p>the pope knew and kept quiet and perverted the truth.</p>
              <p>these are the jokers that god boast will bring glory to him.</p>
              <p>yeah, glory all right, right on the first page of the newspaper</p>
              <p>on ireland, the american continent, the public is disgusted by the conduct of the vatican.</p>
              <p>not only has the church condone the sexual abuse of the young deaf orphans, it has covered up the tracks .</p>
              <p>Used INSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION to PERVERT THE TRUTH.</p>
              <p>the victims.....</p>
              <p>those deaf orphans</p>
              <p>they grew up and expose the church of its sin.</p>
              <p>so u think a deaf orphan can be bullied?</p>

              <p>To Servant: i must say this.  what is different between the
              priest or other well paid professionals is this : the priest is
              suppose to be the servant of god.</p>
              <p>he is suppose to be a tool of god and he abuse little boys'
              anus</p>
              <p>Excuse me but this is inexcusable.</p>
              <p>if christians come and tell me how "pure" their religion is, i
              must certainly remind them that their god and church kept the
              sexual abuse of little orphan boys carry on for 50 years .</p>
              <p>did their god not teach them not to bear false witness?</p>
              <p>then why did the vatican cover up the tracks of the paedophilic
              priest and not deflock them?</p>
              <p>the vatican knew the abuse and cover them up.</p>
              <p>the pope knew and kept quiet and perverted the truth.</p>
              <p>these are the jokers that god boast will bring glory to him.</p>
              <p>yeah, glory all right, right on the first page of the
              newspaper</p>
              <p>on ireland, the american continent, the public is disgusted by
              the conduct of the vatican.</p>
              <p>not only has the church condone the sexual abuse of the young
              deaf orphans, it has covered up the tracks .</p>
              <p>Used INSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION to PERVERT THE TRUTH.</p>
              <p>the victims.....</p>
              <p>those deaf orphans</p>
              <p>they grew up and expose the church of its sin.</p>
              <p>so u think a deaf orphan can be bullied?</p>
              <p>think again.</p>

              <p>Doctors bring bodily, mental and emotional healing to people through their expert knowledge, which requires the patients' trust. Teachers shape and nurture the minds and personalities of our young ones, especially when they are so impressionable. Parents, above all, have the highest calling to support, protect and love their children as much as humanely possible. </p>
              <p>So when any of these people inflict sexual harm on the vulnerable chidren in their care, how is this more excusable than what the guilty priests did? </p>
              <p>Again, it is important to emphasise that there is no excuse whatsoever for what the guilty priests did, but unfortunately, this issue has sometimes been blown out of proportion, especially by those who have their own personal agenda against the Catholic Church. </p>
              <p>Just to remind that the vast majority of priests - like the vast majority of teachers and parents, work for the well-being of others and have never engaged in abuse of any kind. It is unacceptable to single out and stereotype Catholic clergy as a depraved or perverted group. Although a small number of priests have indeed been guilty of the sexual abuse, the vast majority of them are innocent of these crimes. </p>
              <p>Certainly, the Catholic clergy has made mistakes in handling the cases. Nevertheless, media reports frequently painted the bishops' (the priests' bosses) actions and motives in the worst possible light. Eg, it was reported that some priests were transferred around to deliberately cover up the abuse. In fact, in many such cases, psychological 'experts' had assured the bishops that the priests in question had been treated successfully and presented no further danger. Also, it is inherent in Christianity to try to forgive and give someone a second chance as we all imperfect and fail sometimes, whether Christian or not. </p>
              <p>Again, everything mentioned here is not meant to excuse what the guilty priests did, but to give a sense of perspective. The Catholic Church has already embarked on a process of healing and change to minimise such issues in the future. </p>
