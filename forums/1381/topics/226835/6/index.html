This does not negate the need for pastors/teachers ...etc and their teaching, but it does provide a platform for the believers to be able to spot out errant teachings (when it occurs), instead of following blindly.<br><br>I believed that Christ had promised the Holy Spirit to all believers both as our Counselor and also as a seal of His ownership on us (as recorded in the Scripture), to think otherwise is to call him a liar.<br><br>John 14:25-26<br>"All this I have spoken while still with you.

And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>Acts 8:14-17<br>When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them. When they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit, because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them; they had simply been baptized into[c] the name of the Lord Jesus. Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.<br><br>Acts 5:32<br>We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him."<br><br>Romans 5:5<br>And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us.<br><br>Galatians 4:6<br>Because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, "Abba, Father."<br><br>Roman 8:15-16<br>For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship.[a] And by him we cry, "Abba, Father."
