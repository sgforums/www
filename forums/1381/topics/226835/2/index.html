            <div class='col-md body'>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Taken from Wikipedia...<br><br>The apocryphal Acts of Peter gives a legendary tale of Simon Magus' death. Simon is performing magic in the forum, and in order to prove himself to be a god, he flies up into the air. The apostle Peter prays to God to stop his flying, and he stops mid-air and falls, breaking his legs, whereupon the crowd, previously non-hostile, stones him to death. The church of Santa Francesca Romana claims to have been built on the spot in question (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">thus claiming that Simon Magus could indeed fly</span></strong>), claims that Saint Paul was also present, and that a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">dented slab of marble that it contains bears the imprints of the knees of Peter and Paul during their prayer</span></strong>.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>In the bible, miracles done by Jesus was always done without any fanfare.  A simple word of command is using the name of Jesus is enough.  There is no need for the two disciples to supposedly pray so hard until the marble floor gets dented and contains the imprints of their knees - refer to OT pagan tradition where the priests of Baal danced and prayed with increasing fanfare to get their god to hear them vs Elijah the Prophet.<br><br>Btw the idea the Simon can fly seems far-fetched.  Even Jesus did not fly during his ministry.</div>

For example, according to Roman Catholic dogma, Pope Pius IX's teaching regarding the Immaculate Conception was infallible; it is grammatically incorrect to say "the pope is [sometimes] infallible" or to say "the Immaculate Conception is infallible". Nonetheless, these phrases are frequently used in conversations or Catholic writings<br><br>Statements by a pope that exercise papal infallibility are referred to as solemn papal definitions or ex cathedra teachings. These should not be confused with teachings that are infallible because of a solemn definition by an ecumenical council, or with teachings that are infallible in virtue of being taught by the ordinary and universal magisterium. For details on these other kinds of infallible teachings, see Infallibility of the Church.<br><br>According to the teaching of the First Vatican Council and Catholic tradition, the conditions required for ex cathedra teaching are as follows:<br><br>1. "the Roman Pontiff"<br>2. "speaks ex cathedra" ("that is, when in the discharge of his office as shepherd and teacher of all Christians, and by virtue of his supreme apostolic authorityÂ….")<br>3. "he defines"<br>4. "that a doctrine concerning faith or morals"<br>5. "must be held by the whole Church" (Pastor Aeternus, chap. 4)<br><br>Infallibility does not refer to the inability to sin (impeccability), or to the personal holiness of a person, although it is occasionally misunderstood in that sense.<br><br><strong>List of Papal Infalliblity</strong><br><br>Tome to Flavian", Pope Leo I, 449, on the two natures in Christ, received by the Council of Chalcedon;<br>Letter of Pope Agatho, 680, on the two wills of Christ, received by the Third Council of Constantinople;<br>Benedictus Deus, Pope Benedict XII, 1336, on the beatific vision of the just prior to final judgment;<br>Cum occasione, Pope Innocent X, 1653, condemning five propositions of Jansen as heretical;<br>Auctorem fidei, Pope Pius VI, 1794, condemning seven Jansenist propositions of the Synod of Pistoia as heretical;<br>Ineffabilis Deus, Pope Pius IX, 1854, defining the immaculate conception; and<br>Munificentissimus Deus, Pope Pius XII, 1950, defining the assumption of Mary.<br></div>

Pity we don't have them in EH.<br><br>Papal infallibility is a mystery, just like the Catholic version of the eucharist. Whereas the Dalai Lama is chosen from birth or very young, the Pope is chosen from the cardinals. As to why the cardinal-turned-pope can suddenly become infallible in ex cathedra, it remains a mystery to me. It is easier to believe in an infallible Dalai Lama than infallible Pope.</div>

The Catholic Church position on Tradition and Scripture.<br><br>Difficult for a protestant to win a sola scriptura debate....not seen any Church Father that mentioned it. Most importantly, irnoically it is not even in scripture haha.<br><br>Papal infallibility is simple. Because the office of Peter contains the KEYS which allows binding and loosing. Christ cannot allow Peter or his successors to bind or loose error in heven hence he is protected with the gift of infallibility. Generally there has been very few instances of papal infallibility...i think less than 10.<br><br>Hmm...Hebrew Scripture vs Septugaint.</div>
