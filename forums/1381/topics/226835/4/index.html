Nor was this any new thing, since indeed many ages before it was written concerning bishops and deacons. For thus saith the Scripture a certain place, 'I will appoint their bishops s in righteousness, and their deacons in faith.'... <strong>Our apostles also knew, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and there would be strife on account of the office of the episcopate. For this reason, therefore, inasmuch as they had obtained a perfect fore-knowledge of this, they appointed those [ministers] already mentioned, and afterwards gave instructions, that when these should fall asleep, other approved men should succeed them in their ministry</strong>...For our sin will not be small, if we eject from the episcopate those who have blamelessly and holily fulfilled its duties."

The powers is not reallie granted to the Apostles but rather to the office or ministry set up by the Apostiles. Thier successors occupy this office and hence possese this powers as well. Every Bishop todae can trace themselves to the 12 Apostles.<br><br>Another argument could be, why was it necessay to replace Judas then?</div>
