And I will lay the <strong>KEY of the House of David  </strong>upon his shoulder; and<strong> he shall open and none shall shut; and he shall shut and none shall open.</strong> And I will fasten him as a peg in a Sure Place, and he shall be for a <strong>Throne of glory to the house of his Father</strong>. And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his Fathers house, diverse kinds of vessels, every little vessel, from the vessels of cups even to every instrument of music." Isaiah 22:20-24<br><br>"And I say to thee, thou art <strong>Peter</strong>, and upon this Rock I will build My Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give THEE the <strong>KEYS of the Kingdom of Heaven</strong>; and whatever thou <strong>shalt bind on earth shall be bound in Heaven, and whatever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in Heaven." </strong>Matt 16:18-19<br><br>Notice similarites? This is just the very few times when KEYS are mentioned and the onli times when KEYS and the POwers of binding and loosing is mentioned.<br><br>So what do we have here? We have an OFFICE, a SASH, a ROBE, a THRONE, a KEY, a PEG, and a SURE PLACE.<br><br>The House of David is the Davidic Kingdom. David is a figure of Christ<br><br>The office mentioned in OT is like a prime minister role to rule Isreal when there is no King. Elikiam ruled Israel. Similiarly in NT, Christ institued a prime minister role for Peter by giving him the KEYS. The KEYS also represent dynastic Sucession as Elikiam succeeded Shebna in Isaiah 22:20. Similiarly this new Office Christ institued must have successors and they are our modern day popes. This was the case in the Old Covenant kingdom, and it is the case in the New Covenant kingdom which fulfills the Old Covenant. Christ our king is now in heaven is not wif us physically hence he gives us a prime minister to guide us. This is further strengthened when he ordered Peter to feed his flocks. In greek feed means to RULE. He also tells him to strenghten the fellow APOSTLES.<br><br>Eliakim is called Â“fatherÂ” or Â“papa/popeÂ” of God's people. This is why Catholics call the leader of the Church "Pope." The Pope is the father of God's people, the chief steward of the earthly kingdom and Christ's representative on earth.<br><br>Interesting bible verses:<br><br>"As an olive tree budding forth, and a cypress tree rearing itself on high, when he put on the ROBE of Glory, and was clothed with the perfection of POWER. When he went up to the Holy Altar, he honored the vesture of Holiness. And when he took the portions out of the hands of the priests, he himself stood by the Altar. And about him was the ring of his brethren: and as the cedar planted in mount Libanus, and as branches of palm trees, they stood round about him, and all the sons of Aaron in their glory. And the Oblation of the Lord (the Holy Eucharist) was in their hands before all the Congregation (Church) of Israel. And finishing his service on the Altar, to honor the offering of the Most High King, he stretched forth his hand to make a libation, and offered the Blood of the grape (wine transformed into the Blood of Christ)." Sir 50:11-16<br><br>"Now therefore we make thee this day High Priest (Vicar of Christ) of thy nation, and that thou be called the King's friend (and he sent them a Purple ROBE, and a CROWN OF GOLD (Miter)), and that thou be of one mind with us in our affairs, and keep friendship with us." 1Macc 10:20<br><br>The THRONE is the Chair (Seat) of Saint Peter from which the Vicar of Christ prolcaims to the whole world, infallilbe statements on faith and morals. Moses, the Leader of GOD's chosen people had a Seat of Authority.<br><br>"The Scribes and the Pharisees have sat on the Chair of Moses." Matt 23:2<br><br>"This Propitiatory (Mercy Seat) you shall then place on top of the Ark. In the Ark itself you are to put the Commandments which I will give you. There I will meet you and there, from above the Propitiatory, between the two cherubim on the Ark of the Commandments, I will tell you all of the commands that I wish you to give the Israelites (Ex-Cathedra)." Ex 25:20-22<br><br>The next day Moses sat in judgment for the people, who waited about him from morning until evening. When his father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he inquired, "What sort of thing is this that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone while all the people have to stand about you from morning till evening?" <strong>Moses answered his father-in-law, "The people come to me to consult God. Whenever they have a disagreement, they come to me to have me settle the matter between them and make known to them God's decisions and regulations."</strong> <strong>(NT papal authority of supremacy)</strong> "You are not acting wisely," his father-in-law replied. "You will surely wear yourself out, and not only yourself but also these people with you. The task is too heavy for you; you cannot do it alone. Now, listen to me, and I will give you some advice, that God may be with you. <strong>Act as the people's representative before God, bringing to him whatever they have to say. Enlighten them in regard to the decisions and regulations, showing them how they are to live and what they are to do. But you should also look among all the people for able and God-fearing men, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain, and set them as officers over groups of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens. Let these men render decisions for the people in all ordinary cases. More important cases they should refer to you, <span style="color: red;">(PAPAL AUTHORITY. ROME HAS SPOKEN, THE ISSUE IS SETTLED</span>) but all the lesser cases they can settle themselves</strong>. Thus, your burden will be lightened, since they will bear it with you. If you do this, when God gives you orders you will be able to stand the strain, and all these people will go home satisfied."<br><br>Moses followed the advice of his father-in-law and did all that he had suggested.<strong> He picked out able men from all Israel and put them in charge of the people as officers over groups of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens <span style="color: darkred;">(CARDINALS, ARCHBISHOPS, AND BISHOPS, AS WE HAVE IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH TODAY</span>). They rendered decisions for the people in all ordinary cases. The more difficult cases they referred to Moses, but all the lesser cases they settled themselves. </strong><br>Exodus: 18:13-26<br><br>I hope this few verses can convince u in the biblical nature of the papacy. Rememebr every organization has the Power of Administration. If a Democracy has a Parliamemt, an elected President, if a company has a CEO, board of directors and stakeholders....what more of a 2000yr old institution wif a Magisteruim (filled with her Bishops) and the Papacy all filled in the Spirit of Truth? Is that wrong?[/b]</blockquote></div>

A man's free-will, indeed, avails for nothing except to sin, if he knows not the way of truth; and even after his duty and his proper aim shall begin to become known to him, unless he also take delight in and feel a love for it, he neither does his duty, nor sets about it, nor lives rightly. Now, in order that such a course may engage our affections, God's" love is shed abroad in our hearts," not through the free-will which arises from ourselves, but "through the Holy Ghost, which is given to us."

Even Calvin owes part of his theology to Augustine but Protestants nowadays see Calvin but not Augustine.<br><br>Thomas Aquinas might have some substance but he based his summa on the Latin bible, which is a regret.
