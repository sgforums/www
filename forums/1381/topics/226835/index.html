            <div class='col-md body'>We know from the bible that the apostle Peter could not have founded the church of Rome. There are many proofs to substantiate this. I will just name one or two.<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Galatians 2:7 NIV<br>On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, just as Peter had been to the Jews.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Peter was entrusted with preaching to Jews not Gentiles.<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>2 Timothy 4:16 NIV<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>At my first defense</strong></span>, no one came to my support, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>everyone deserted me</strong></span>. May it not be held against them.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paul wrote this when he was on trial in Rome. If we believe the Catholics, then Peter has betrayed Paul, for they tell us Peter was present at Rome during this time</span></strong>.

            <div class='col-md body'>The real person that founded the Catholic Church was not Simon Peter but another Simon.  Simon Magnus.<br><br><blockquote>Acts 8:9-13 NIV<br>Now for some time <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria</span></strong>. He boasted that he was someone great, and all the people, both high and low, gave him their attention and exclaimed, "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This man is the divine power known as the Great Power</span></strong>." They followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his magic. But when they believed Philip as he preached the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Simon himself believed and was baptized.</strong></span> And he followed Philip everywhere, astonished by the great signs and miracles he saw. </blockquote><blockquote>Acts 8:18-23 NIV<br>When Simon saw that the Spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles' hands, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">he offered them money and said, "Give me also this ability so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit</span></strong>."<br><br>Peter answered: "May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money!  You have no part or share in this ministry, because your heart is not right before God.  Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord. Perhaps he will forgive you for having such a thought in your heart.  For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin." </blockquote>Simon is clearly stated as being one who practiced magic and paganism. One also needs to note that he is not just a pagan but also a leader of the pagan church, since he has misled and bewitched many people with sorcery. Simon most likely heard the news about the risen Christ directly from the apostles and possibly from Jesus himself..  Instead of accepting the message of salvation as a gift, he desired to buy this power for his own use.  Simon wanted to use the power of the Holy Spirit, most probably for personal gain and profit thus taking the LordÂ’s name in vain.<br><br>Did Simon go his way after his strong rebuke for Peter? No, he did not.  In fact, he considered himself to be a Christian.<br><br>Even though there is only one event that was recorded by Luke, it would not be unreasonable to assume that Simon had heard the apostle on several occasions.  He likely also spoke with many of the new converts of the new church. It could be said that  Simon Magus had great interest in spiritual matters and most likely was very well versed in both Jewish teaching and that of the new Christian church.  Simon mixed Judaism, early Christianity and Babylonian, Greek. Paganism into one religion and appointed himself as the leader.  Here we see the well documented mixing of religions from several historical sources and The Bible itself.<br><br>One point that should be noted is there is a mixing of several religious ideas. This is one of the identifying characteristics of the beast of Rev. 13 that is identified as the Roman Catholic Church. Revelation 13:2 Â“Now the beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion.Â”<br><br>The four beasts used to make up the beast are the same four beasts, Daniel saw in vision in Daniel 7.  As a matter of fact, papal Rome inherited from each of these pagan empires some of their basic identifying traits that we still see practiced in this modern day false system of religion, the Roman Catholic Church.  From Babylon, the lion the papacy inherited a pagan priesthood; from Medo-Persia, the bear sun worship; from Greece, the leopard human philosophies; and from the dragon, Pagan Rome, its power, seat and great authority. As stated in Rev. 13:2 the mixing of these pagan ideas of the Roman catholic church had its onset from the very beginning. From this Simon Magnus who was well versed in all of these abominable doctrines and false system of worship created the early Catholic Church. These abominably doctrines can be traced back to the very beginning thru Simon Magnus.<br><br>Ref:<br>(The Encyclopaedia Britannica 11th ed - The Triumph of Christendom in the Roman Empire, p. 15).<br>(Apostolic Christianity), Vol. 2, p. 566).<br>(HastingÂ’s Dictionary of the Apostolic Church, Vol. 2, p. 497)<br>(Eerdman's Handbook to the History of Christianity, p. 100)<br>(Harnack Vol. 1, p. 244).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Did Simon stay in Jerusalem as the head of his own little cult?  What were his plans for this new mixing of religions?  History shows that Simon Magus did not stay in Jerusalem but moved to Rome.   It is also well recognized that the religions of Asia, by Greek and Roman times, had also passed to the West.  By the first century, the mystery religions of the Babylonians were centered primarily in Rome. At that time, Rome was the chief city of the world. With Rome as the center of the world it would only make sense that Simon Magus would move to Rome to spread his new religion a mixture of pagan beliefs and Christian doctrine.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Simon MagusÂ’ move to Rome is noted in several historical writings.  His goal as stated by historical records was to create a universal church</span></strong>, Â“ReligionÂ”. A little side note that many are aware of is the meaning of the word catholic. The word catholic means universal. The word Catholic (katholikos from katholou -- throughout the whole, i.e., universal) occurs in the Greek classics.  Yes, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the correct meaning of the Catholic Church is the Universal Church.</strong></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When Justin Martyr wrote [152 A.D.] his Apology, the sect of the Simonians appears to have been formidable, for he speaks four times of their founder, Simon; and we need not doubt that he identified him with the Simon of the Acts. He states that he was a Samaritan, adding that his birthplace was a village called Gitta; he describes him as a formidable magician, and tells that he came to ROME in the days of Claudius Caesar (45 A.D.), and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>made such an impression by his magical powers, that he was honoured as a God</strong></span>, a statue being erected to him on the Tiber, between the two bridges, bearing the inscription Â‘Simoni deo SanctoÂ’ (i.e., the holy god Simon)" (Dictionary of Christian Biography, Vol. 4, p. 682).<br><br>HastingÂ’s Dictionary of the Apostolic Church, Vol 2, p. 496, states that there is "very slight evidence on which to reject so precise a statement as Justin makes; a statement he would scarcely have hazarded in an apology addressed to Rome, where every person had the means of ascertaining its accuracy. If he made a mistake, it must have been at once exposed, and other writers would not have frequently repeated the story as they have done.<br><br>We see this quote from Justin Martyr and from HastingÂ’s Â“Dictionary of the apostolic churchÂ” that Simon Magus was in Rome about the year 45A.D., this is further stated by his birthplace, a village called Gitta.  It is also stated that Simon Magus was honored as a God, due to his magical Â“demonic powers that were witnessedÂ”.<br><br>Simon only used the name of Christianity to bring about his own desired ends. The Dictionary of Religion and Ethics says that Simon was "a false Messiah, who practiced magical arts and subsequently attempted, by the aid and with the sanction of Christianity, to set up a rival UNIVERSAL [Catholic] RELIGION" ((Apostolic Christianity )Vol. 11, p. 514).<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">From these historical accounts we see that indeed Simon Magnus was in Rome and was the head of his own church Â“Universal catholic</span></strong>Â”.  In many of these accounts we also see that Simon Magnus was also consider by many to be God. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Does that not fall in to place that the first pope aka Simon Magus was considered to be God.</strong></span> There are several places in The Bible that show that the Church of Rome would committee the sin of blasphemy and demand worship from men.  (Rev,13:1),(Dan,7:11)(Rev14:11)Â…<br><br><blockquote>Â“<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The pope is not only the representative of Jesus Christ, but he is Jesus Christ himself, hidden under a veil of flesh.Â” The Catholic National, July 1895</span></strong></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My fellow brethen, do not be held swayed by the words of heretics and schismatics who wish to profane the throne of Peter.<br><br>"<strong>See that ye all follow the bishop, even as Christ Jesus does the Father</strong>, and the presbytery as ye would the apostles. Do ye also reverence the deacons, as those that carry out the appointment of God. Let no man do anything connected with the Church without the bishop. Let that be deemed a proper Eucharist, which is [administered] either by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude also be; by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude also be; even as, <strong>wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church." </strong>Ignatius of Antioch, Epistle to the Smyrneans, 8:2 (c. A.D. 110).<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">St Ignatius was a disciple of Peter and John, surely he knew what the apostles taught. He mentions the Catholic Church.

Martyrdom of Polycarp, 16:2 (A.D. 155).<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Polycarp was a student of John and he is a bishop of the Catholic Church.

According to history he was genius and a very charismatic individual that impressed many with his magical powers such that he was hailed as a God.

            <div class='col-md body'>I know already.  Wikipedia can find one.<br><br><blockquote>Taken from Wikipedia...<br><br>The apocryphal Acts of Peter gives a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">legendary tale</span></strong> of Simon Magus' death. Simon is performing magic in the forum, and in order to prove himself to be a god, he flies up into the air. The apostle Peter prays to God to stop his flying, and he stops mid-air and falls, breaking his legs, whereupon the crowd, previously non-hostile, stones him to death. The church of Santa Francesca Romana claims to have been built on the spot in question (thus claiming that Simon Magus could indeed fly), claims that Saint Paul was also present, and that a dented slab of marble that it contains bears the imprints of the knees of Peter and Paul during their prayer.</blockquote>Already proved that Peter not in Rome, so false story.  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note it says legendary tale...not historical fact.</span></strong></div>
