How do Popes make use of ex cathedra?<br><br>2. How did Peter make use of ex cathedra?<br><br>Sola Scriptura cannot stand up to historical scrutiny .. haha.</div></blockquote>1) According to the teaching of the First Vatican Council and Catholic tradition, the conditions required for ex cathedra teaching are as follows:<br><br>1. "the Roman Pontiff"<br>2. "speaks ex cathedra" ("that is, when in the discharge of his office as shepherd and teacher of all Christians, and by virtue of his supreme apostolic authorityÂ….")<br>3. "he defines"<br>4. "that a doctrine concerning faith or morals"<br>5. "must be held by the whole Church" (Pastor Aeternus, chap. 4)<br><br>For a teaching by a pope or ecumenical council to be recognized as infallible, the teaching must make it clear that it is definitive and binding. There is not any specific phrasing required for this, but it is usually indicated by one or both of the following: (1) a verbal formula indicating that this teaching is definitive (such as "We declare, decree and define..."), or (2) an accompanying anathema stating that anyone who deliberately dissents is outside the Catholic Church. For example, in Munificentissimus Deus, Pope Pius XII's infallible definition regarding the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, there are attached these words: "Hence if anyone, which God forbid, should dare willfully to deny or to call into doubt that which We have defined, let him know that he has fallen away completely from the divine and Catholic Faith."<br><br>2) In Acts 15:7<br><br>After much debate had taken place, Peter got up and said to them, "My brothers, you are well aware that from early days God made his choice among you that <strong>through my mouth </strong>the Gentiles would hear the word of the gospel<br><br>IN Mat 16:17, the Father reveals things to Peter.
