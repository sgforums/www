No rebuttal is as good as admitting defeat. Suffice to say, the argument was over the [sole] authority of Scripture. Luther, in fact, still clung to the half-fark version of the eucharist.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>We should read Luther and his powerful ideas, not Luther and his act of tearing up the bible.

The Tradition of the Apostles, manifested 'on the contrary' in the whole world, is open in every Church to all who see the truth...And, since it is a long matter in a work like this to enumerate these successions, <strong>we will confute them by pointing to the Tradition of that greatest and most ancient and universally known Church, founded and constituted at Rome </strong>by the two most glorious Apostles, Peter and Paul, a tradition which she has had and a faith which she proclaims to all men from those Apostles.'

Who would they depend on to intepretate Scripture? Naturally the Church. Sola scriptura is onli possible if everyone had a Bible in the first place remember....<br><br>Btw he was against sola scriptura as well haha. U find rebuttals to soal scriptura in 180AD...can u beat that.<br><br>"Through none others know we the disposition of our salvation, than those through whom the gospel came to us, first heralding it, then by the will of God delivering to us the Scriptures, which were to be the foundation and pillar of our faith...[b]But when, the heretics are Scriptures, as if they were wrong, and unauthoritative, and were variable, and the truth could not be extracted from them by those who were ignorant of Tradition</strong>...And when we challenge them in turn what that tradition, which is from the Apostles, which is <strong>guarded by the succession of elders </strong>in the churches, <strong>they oppose themselves to Tradition, saying that they are wiser, not only than those elders, but even than the Apostles</strong>. The Tradition of the Apostles, manifested 'on the contrary' in the whole world, is open in every Church to all who see the truth...And, since it is a long matter in a work like this to enumerate these successions, <strong>we will confute them by pointing to the Tradition of that greatest and most ancient and universally known Church, founded and constituted at Rome </strong>by the two most glorious Apostles, Peter and Paul, a tradition which she has had and a faith which she proclaims to all men from those Apostles.' Irenaeus, Against Heresies 3,1-3 (inter A.D. 180/199).[/b]</blockquote>can you go read my definition (summarised somewhere here) on Sola Scriptura and what it is about and also what it is not.<br><br>and on your quote in your own words<br><blockquote>Sola scriptura is onli possible if everyone had a Bible in the first place remember....</blockquote>most of us now have a Bible (some have more copies than others) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
