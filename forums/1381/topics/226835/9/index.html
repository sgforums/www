Irenaeus, Against Heresies 3,1-3 (inter A.D. 180/199).<br><br>"Heretics assent neither to Scripture nor to Tradition." Irenaeus, Against Heresies, 3,2,1 (inter A.D. 180/199).<br><br><strong>They say:</strong><br><br>This seal have thou ever on thy mind; which now by way of summary has been touched on in its heads, and if the Lord grant, shall hereafter be set forth according to our power, with Scripture proofs. For concerning the divine and sacred Mysteries of the Faith, we ought not to deliver even the most casual remark without the Holy Scriptures: nor be drawn aside by mere probabilities and the artifices of argument. Do not then believe me because I tell thee these things, unless thou receive from the Holy Scriptures the proof of what is set forth: for this salvation, which is of our faith, is not by ingenious reasonings, but by proof from the Holy Scriptures."  - Cyril of Juersalem<br><br><strong>I say:</strong><br><br>Option One: If Cyril was in fact<br>teaching sola scriptura, Protestants have a big problem. Cyril's<br>Catechetical Lectures are filled with his forceful teachings on<br>the infallible teaching office of the Catholic Church (18:23), the<br>Mass as a sacrifice (23:6-<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, the concept of purgatory and the<br>efficacy of expiatory prayers for the dead (23:10), the Real<br>Presence of Christ in the Eucharist (19:7; 21:3; 22:1-9), the<br>theology of sacraments (1:3), the intercession of the saints<br>(23:9), holy orders (23:2), the importance of frequent Communion<br>(23:23), baptismal regeneration (1:1-3; 3:10-12; 21:3-4), indeed a<br>staggering array of specifically "Catholic" doctrines.<br><br>These are the same Catholic doctrines that Protestants claim are<br>not found in Scripture. So, if Cyril really held to the notion of<br>sola scriptura, he certainly believed he had found those<br>Catholic doctrines in Scripture. One would then have to posit that<br>Cyril was badly mistaken in his exegesis of Scripture, but this<br>tack, of course, leads nowhere for Protestants, for it would of<br>necessity impugn Cyril's exegetical credibility as well as his<br>claim to find sola scriptura in Scripture.<br><br>Option Two: Cyril did not teach sola scriptura; the Protestant<br>understanding of this passage is incorrect. That means an attempt<br>to hijack this quote to support sola scriptura is futile (if not<br>dishonest), since it would require a hopelessly incorrect<br>understanding of Cyril's method of systematic theology, the<br>doctrinal schema he sets forth in Catechetical Lectures, and his<br>view of the authority of Scripture. Obviously, neither of these<br>options is palatable to the Protestant apologist.<br><br>(Source:http://www.ewtn.com/library/SCRIPTUR/SOLASCRI.TXT)<br><br><strong>And btw Cyril said this: </strong><br><br>"But in learning the Faith and in professing it, acquire and keep that only, which is now delivered to thee by the Church, and which has been built up strongly out of all the Scriptures....<strong>Take heed then, brethren, and hold fast the traditions which ye now receive, and write them and the table of your heart."</strong> Cyril of Jerusalem, Catechetical Lectures, 5:12 (A.D. 350).<br><br><strong>They say:</strong><br><br>Origen, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria support them<br><br><strong>I say:</strong><br><br>"We do not take our scriptural teaching from the parables but<strong> we interpret the parables according to our teaching</strong>." Tertullian, Purity 9,1 (c. A.D. 200).<br><br>'Let them show the origins of their churches, let them unroll the list of their bishops, through a succession coming down from the very beginning that their first bishop had his authority and predecessor someone from among the number of Apostles or apostolic men and, further, that he did not stray from the Apostles. In this way the apostolic churches present their earliest records. The church of Smyrna, for example, records that Polycarp was named by John; the Romans, that Clement was ordained by Peter<strong>. In just the same way, the other churches show who were made bishops by the Apostles and who transmitted the apostolic seed to them.</strong> Let the heretics invent something like that. ' Tertullian, The Prescription Against Heretics 32 (c. A.D. 200).<br><br>'But they, <strong>safeguarding the true tradition of the blessed teaching</strong>, which comes straight from the Apostles Peter, James, John and Paul and transmitted from father to son have come down to us with the help of God to <strong>deposit in us those ancestral and apostolic seeds' </strong>Clement of Alexandria, Stromata 1,11 (c. A.D. 205).<br><br>'For us...having <strong>grown old in the Scriptures, preserving the Apostolic and ecclesiastical correctness of doctrine</strong>, living a life according to the Gospel, is led by the Lord to discover the proofs from the Law and the prophets which he seeks.' Clement of Alexandria, Stromata 7,104 (c. A.D. 205).<br><br>"For those are slothful who, having it in their power to provide themselves with proper proofs for the divine Scriptures from the Scriptures themselves, select only what contributes to their own pleasures. And those have a craving for glory who voluntarily evade, by arguments of a diverse sort, the things delivered by the blessed apostles and teachers, which are wedded to inspired words; <strong>opposing the divine tradition by human teachings, in order to establish the heresy</strong>." Clement of Alexandria, Stromata, 7:16 (post A.D. 202).<br><br>"The Church's preaching has been handed down through an orderly succession from the Apostles and remains in the Church until the present. That alone is to be believed as the truth which in no way departs from <strong>ecclesiastical and apostolic tradition</strong>." Origen, First Principles 1,2 (c. A.D. 230).<br><br>"When heretics show us the canonical Scriptures, in which every Christian believes and trusts, they seem to be saying: 'Lo, he is in the inner rooms [the word of truth] ' (Matt 24.6). <strong>But we must not believe them, nor leave the original tradition of the Church, nor believe otherwise than we have been taught by the succession in the Church of God</strong>." Origen, Homilies on Matthew, Homily 46, PG 13:1667 (ante A.D. 254).<br><br>[<span class="large">size=normal]I am left to contend the Church fathers did not teach Sola Scriptura but rather Catholic Teachings that Tradition is to be used by the Church to intepretate Scriptures.</span>[/size]</div>

How do i put it....<br><br>The Apostles have the power of binding and loosing in doctrinal issues. To ensure they dont bind error in heaven, God sent them the Spirit to guide them in all Truth. Thats why Eucnimcal Councils can issue infallible doctrines. There is a mjor difference in teaching without error and living without error.<br><br>As a catholic, i will use Luther as an example. Luther acts were at best anti-christish in tearing off 7 books and almost tearing of James and Revelations. But his teachings (if i am a protestant) can be infallible if i believe the Spirit guided him). Similiarly, doctrine issued in a Council is infallible.<br><br>Im not sure abt the protestant pt of view. But Catholicism teaches that this gift of truth (as Irenaus puts it) is onli exercised by the Church in teaching doctrines. This is done in Councils haha. Other that that, this Bishops are not infallible.<br><br>"Wherefore it is incumbent to obey the presbyters who are in the Church...those who, together with the succession of the episcopate, have <strong>received the certain gift of truth</strong>..." Irenaeus, Against Heresies 26:2 (inter A.D. 180/199).<br><br></div>

It is within the power of all, therefore, in every Church, who may wish to see the truth, <strong>to contemplate clearly the tradition of the apostles manifested throughout the whole world</strong>; and we are in a position to reckon up those who were by the <strong>apostles instituted bishops </strong>in the Churches, and [to demonstrate] the succession of these men to our own times; those who neither taught nor knew of anything like what these [heretics] rave about. For if the apostles had known hidden mysteries, which they were in the habit of imparting to "the perfect" apart and privily from the rest, they would have delivered them especially to those to whom they were also committing the Churches themselves. For they were desirous that these men should be very perfect and blameless in all things, whom also they were leaving behind as their successors, delivering up their own place of government to these men; which men, if they discharged their functions honestly, would be a great boon [to the Church], but if they should fall away, the direst calamity.<br><br>2. Since, however, it would be very tedious, in such a volume as this, to reckon up the successions of all the Churches, we do put to confusion all those who, in whatever manner, whether by an evil self-pleasing, by vainglory, or by blindness and perverse opinion, assemble in unauthorized meetings; [we do this, I say,] <strong>by indicating that tradition derived from the apostles, of the very great, the very ancient, and universally known Church founded and organized at Rome </strong>by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul; as also [by pointing out] the faith preached to men, which comes down to our time by means of the successions of the bishops.<strong> For it is a matter of necessity that every Church should agree with this Church, on account of its pre- eminent authority</strong>,(3) that is, the faithful everywhere, inasmuch as the <strong>apostolical tradition </strong>has been preserved continuously by those [faithful men] who exist everywhere.<br><br>And the other Church Father....especially cyril of juerasalem...how can they quote from him....shooting themselves in the foot IMO.<br><br></div>
