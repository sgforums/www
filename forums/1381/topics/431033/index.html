              <p>there are so many inconsistencies and paradoxes in the concept of god. one of it is, if god created us, who created god, and they will tell you god existed by its own. see the paradox here as in god existed by its own.</p>
              <p>another is if god is almighty and omnipotence, can u ask god to create something he cant lift? if he can create, he is not all powerful, but if he cant, then he isnt all powerful either.</p>

              <p>Sadly...most people renounce their religions (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism etc) based on ill-informed knowledge they got though life. </p>
              <p>I would recommend anybody seeking to renounce their religions to firstly, ask ourselves and list at least 10 reasons why it is not working out. Study the list and ask ourselves are the reasons listed good enough reasons?</p>
              <p>Then, read up their holy scriptures and see whether the sciptures contain fact (especially scientific facts) or fiction (tall-tales exposed through research of history and advancing science).</p>
              <p>I for one, do not believe things happen without reason and we just happen to be here. All things in this universe function and are designed in perfect harmony and in their own prefect way. Just take a look at the things around us and start to ask questions on them...maybe that will also help</p>
              <p>Lastly, i would recomment reading up all other religions' scriptures to see whether any of it make sense both to our mind and heart. </p>
              <p>If all else fails, then may you find peace whichever path you choose.</p>

In the present epoch, we may understand this fact but still believe in a certain god- why? I think it is because having something to believe in gives us a kind of security and comfort. Either way, it doesn't really matter which god you believe in or whether you even believe in any god, as long as everyone respects each other's religion and not have any conflicts because of it. If ppl were to fight because of their belief in different gods, they should ask themselves: is it worthwhile to fight over something that is essentially a fabrication?</p></div>

              <p>Exactly!! </p>
              <p>Majority of Malay-Muslim I’ve known/met are ignorant in general.  Don’t get
               me wrong, I am currently a Liberal Muslim.  I, for 
              one, don't go all ignorance towards other’s belief, I respect people’s 
              beliefs; open to their belief, as well as their opinion towards one’s 
              religion.  The main concept about this is: MAJORITY of us, what they/we 
              call it "Our Brothers" are rather quite ignorant in today’s society. 
              Why? They ought to think/proclaim that Islam IS THE BEST RELIGION IN THE
               WORLD and be a total ignorance of other’s belief, hence has zero 
              respect for anyone who has different belief/religion other than their 
              own.</p>
              <p>I mean c’mon, people of the different religion think the same way as 
              we do too.  Those Muslims that I’ve known ought to think that Islam is 
              the right one and others’ beliefs are "bs".  Islam has taught me, we, to
               NOT be ignorant to other’s belief and has even taught us to RESPECT 
              people’s belief/religion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One more thing I’d like to pin out about Muslim is their anger/rage 
              issues.  I’ve seen Christian, Jewish and etcetera being the victim of 
              being affronted at with racial and/or bigotry slur and still, amongst 
              the majority of them (in term of today’s society) so far I’ve yet not 
              seen a violence act/response towards their reaction.  Most of the Muslim
               probably would engage to raging and then threaten at to 
              whoever says “something” negative about their beliefs.  And here I 
              thought Muslim is prone to be a peaceful type of person…  Yes, Islam is 
              the religion of peace, whilst majority of its follower, Muslim, isn’t.  
              In conclusion, the Muslim that I’ve encountered/met are probably the 
              MOST sensitive type of person I’ve ever seen -- they would threaten 
              anybody who even remotely insulted them a bit, and thus that’s probably 
              why they’re prone to terrorism.  I, for one, believe that the key to 
              being a true Muslim is: The virtue of Patience.  A true Muslim would 
              ignore any racial/bigotry slurs; to acquire the will to ignore any of 
              the insults towards one and NOT to go all berserk when someone insulted 
              our religion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How can we represent “peace” if one acted like a raging terrorist? In 
              another aspect, a Muslim should forgive more rather than anger/rage. 
               Due to their level of ignorance, I for one, believe those kind/type of 
              Muslims is the reason why Islam was hated.  To put things in my 
              perspective, I described those ignorant Muslims as a 
              Corrupted-Muslim; misguided-Muslim.</p>

              <p>I am a proud Muslim although i must admit to not being at a level where i wanna be. </p>
              <p>I do have clarify that in our Holy Quran, God states that Islam is not a religion of force. Thus, no Muslims should ever force a person from another religion to become Muslims unless he wants to disobey God. </p>
              <p>I view all religions as bringing God's message in some way which is good thus i take it upon myself to also look at other religions in a positive light. </p>
              <p>As stated, if a person, be it Muslim, Christian or whoever, wants to renounce his/her religion, then i would recommend taking a step back and do as i have previously recommended. Sometimes, we need to see ourselves and the world from a different perspective to realise what we have been seeing wrongly or not seen all this while. We also need to widen our perspective thus  to read up and research (find answers to unanswered questions) not only from our own religion but others as well. This way, we will, by God's will, find peace with ourselves importantly.</p>
              <p>Thus, whatever decisions we make after all that, will be made with an open heart and open mind.</p>

              <p>This is also true of other religions. Let's put it this way, most of us are born into a religions thus hold atag as Muslims or Christians etc since birth. </p>
              <p>For those who are Muslims but does not know much about why they are Muslims and what being Muslim is about, then that is an issue between them and God. </p>
              <p>Islam teaches peace. Sadly, there are a lot of so-called Muslims who will go berserk and fanatical when they feel slightly insulted. </p>
              <p>Sadly also, this is what medias around the world potrays Muslims to be. And what has been potrayed are the reactions of the minority. There are many Muslims who feel angered when Islam is being dragged trough the dirt by fellow Muslims eg terrorism in the name of Jihad (which has been manipulated and misinterpreted for political reasons by terrorist groups claiming to fight for all Muslims). I would suggest that if any of u wants to know how Muslims in general feel, act, do and think..to do more research on your own and to mingle with Muslims. And when i say Muslims, do note to mingle with Muslims who knows what Islam is eg regular mosque go-ing pakciks etc.</p>

              <p>Exactly!! </p>
              <p>Majority of Malay-Muslim I’ve known/met are ignorant in
              general.  Don’t get me wrong, I am currently a Liberal
              Muslim.  I, for one, don't go all ignorance towards other’s
              belief, I respect people’s beliefs; open to their belief, as well
              as their opinion towards one’s religion.  The main concept
              about this is: MAJORITY of us, what they/we call it "Our Brothers"
              are rather quite ignorant in today’s society. Why? They ought to
              think/proclaim that Islam IS THE BEST RELIGION IN THE WORLD and be
              a total ignorance of other’s belief, hence has zero respect for
              anyone who has different belief/religion other than their own.</p>
              <p>I mean c’mon, people of the different religion think the same
              way as we do too.  Those Muslims that I’ve known ought to
              think that Islam is the right one and others’ beliefs are
              "bs".  Islam has taught me, we, to NOT be ignorant to other’s
              belief and has even taught us to RESPECT people’s
              belief/religion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One more thing I’d like to pin out about Muslim is their
              anger/rage issues.  I’ve seen Christian, Jewish and etcetera
              being the victim of being affronted at with racial and/or bigotry
              slur and still, amongst the majority of them (in term of today’s
              society) so far I’ve yet not seen a violence act/response towards
              their reaction.  Most of the Muslim probably would engage to
              raging and then threaten at to whoever says “something” negative
              about their beliefs.  And here I thought Muslim is prone to be
              a peaceful type of person…  Yes, Islam is the religion of
              peace, whilst majority of its follower, Muslim, isn’t.  In
              conclusion, the Muslim that I’ve encountered/met are probably the
              MOST sensitive type of person I’ve ever seen -- they would threaten
              anybody who even remotely insulted them a bit, and thus that’s

               A true Muslim would ignore any racial/bigotry slurs; to
              acquire the will to ignore any of the insults towards one and NOT
              to go all berserk when someone insulted our religion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How can we represent “peace” if one acted like a raging
              terrorist? In another aspect, a Muslim should forgive more rather
              than anger/rage.  Due to their level of ignorance, I for one,

              <p>Well said bro.....these so-called Muslims are only Muslims by name and not Muslims by action or words. They have distorted the true teachings of Prophet Muhammad saw and create bad impression of Islam.</p>
              <p>Let us all start with ourselves to set a good example to people around us by being a true Muslim. This way, hopefully, we can set the example for more and more mis-guided Muslims that we encountered in our daily lifes and change them. </p>

              <p>a/n/ gentleman,</p>
              <p>i faced the same issues you have when ur age at one time (why muslims act like shitheads but religion teaches otherwise) , im now 37 years old. im not the pious type who preach religion all day long...  i managed to find some answers to solve the  problem and am in peace now . so what am sharing with you is not to convince you to remain muslim or otherwise..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Not only muslims treat others of different religion like shit,,christians do it, buddhists do it, jews do it,,,agreed?</p>
              <p>2. Look up  the Quran and  verify this,,,from  any Quran copy all over ther world , any  languauge,,  in the Quran..</p>
              <p> Look up Verse 49:13 “O mankind, we have created you from a male and a female, and made you into races and tribes, so that you may <strong>identify one another (and not despise each other)</strong>. Surely the <strong>noblest of you</strong>, in Allah‘s sight, is the one who is most <strong>righteous </strong>of you. Surely Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware. (49:13)</p>
              <p>3. I found my answers there..for me it means</p>
              <p>a. God intended to create us all in many colours and races and faiths so life would not be boring..if everyone look chinese or malay or indian all over the world,,have same kind of food all over the world,,how interesting would that be?</p>
              <p>b. greatness is not from what race , religion, family ancestry you are from...but your rightneousness i,e your Iman ( relationship with God) and Amal (your relationship with other human beings) ..some people pray 5 times a day but treat other people like shit,,some people get along, very popular ,even gets elected to become Presidents, Prime Ministers etc but cheat, corrupted, robs, rapes ,,( diregard God)...</p>
              <p>see...its all up to you..as an individual ,,what level of rightneousness you can practise</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i have many more brilliant solutions to lifes problems that theQuran have provided me,,coincidence that the Quran is touted as the Miracle from Prophet Mohamed................</p>

              <p><br>Almond, it is NOT a must for the non-Muslim to convert. I would say it's more of a societal/cultural pressure(the Muslims', that is) to convert.</p>
              <p>In India and Indonesia(not so sure now, they've become more 'hardliner'), Muslims can marry a non-Muslim without that person having to convert. Yes, in Singapore too. Just register for a civil marriage.</p>
              <p>I'm not a Muslim myself, but I personally believe that if the couple are not actively harming anyone, then it's their own business.</p>
              <p>Most important are their character and how they treat others regardless of their religion.</p>
              <p>I believe most of the major religions in general preach something similar-to do unto others as you would them do unto you etc. Not much difference there.</p>
              <p>Sometimes it's humans ourselves who make things difficult, not religion.</p>
              <p>Best is to educate ourselves and not just simply believe any hullaballo we are told by others.</p>
              <p> And act with a clear conscience.</p>

              <p>I am just so glad that we in Singapore can live together in harmony regardless of race. And i have to agree with all the posts here so far. It shows that all of us can think in a logical and rational manner. </p>
              <p>Religions are supposed to be logical and rational. Once it does not make sense, then something could be wrong either in the way we interpret it or the way we are taught. So it is always best to do our own research to find answers rather than rely on a single person. Then we can analyse better.</p>
              <p>Anyway, like i said, i am just so glad that we can all talk in a respectful manner here rather than start flaming each other or eah other's religious beliefs. Hope everybody in this world can live harmoniously. For a fact, history shows that that previously, there was an era, i believe Spain, where Muslims were in power but Christians and Jews lived among them with equality and harmony. Long to see the whole world lived like that rather than all these stupid endless fighting and wars.</p>
              <p>imagine if all the world's wealth is equally distributed among all people on Earth, we will not be having homeless, starving people and all will be equal in every sense of the word.</p>
              <p>It is good to ask questions. It is by asking them that we will strengthen our faith and will not just blindly follow the path that has been choosen for us since birth.</p>
