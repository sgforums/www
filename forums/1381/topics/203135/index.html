            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I think the most misunderstood statement about the Christian faith is the phrase 'if you don't believe in Jesus, you go to hell.' Somehow a Christian can explain most of the gospel without much provocation, but once he murmurs this phrase, the other party instinctively rejects it immediately. My question is, do you reject it because it is false, or because you don't like that statement? If you had lied and a friend of you pointed you out, you react immediately in anger, not because he had said something false, but because you don't like what he said.<br><br>So I figured it is the latter. It makes Christianity sound offensive and extremely arrogant. It makes Jesus look like an evil man who say 'Believe me, or DIE!' I do not disagree with that statement in any sense. Now <strong>withhold your judgement</strong>, and let me explain. I believe the statement is true. But I don't believe it represents the Christian faith anymore than 'Christians are those who go to church every sunday'. Going to hell is not the main point of the gospel, yet it offends people the most.<br><br>Let's go back to Jesus. I know even people of other faiths and even atheists readily agree he is a good teacher, at the very least. Some even had a certain expectation of him - he preaches love, thus he must be loving, and to send humans to hell is very unloving. Hereby I urge you to consider the other side of God - His unquestionable Justice. You have heard God is Love, you have known his unconditional love. Here is one whose justice is also unquestionable.<br><br>In fact, the few verses directly after that famous John 3:16 verse goes like this: Jesus did not come to condemn anyone but to save. Listen carefully, <strong>he comes to save</strong>. Not to make bad people good, but to make dead people alive. Any objections about 'What about those good people? God send them to hell too?' is immediately refuted by Jesus. There are no good people. The only good is God alone, and all men has fallen short of God's standards. The next verse is then 'those who do not believe has already been condemned'. Christians themselves stand condemned before they believe in Jesus, just like anyone else because they too, have sinned and deserve their due punishment. Now, instead of demanding from God 'Why should we be punished?' God has instead offered a solution through His Son Jesus.<br><br>I only find it ridiculous that anyone should dismiss Christianity just because it says 'you will go to hell/be condemned', because it actually offers a solution, yet one keeps looking at his problem and refuse to accept it, and instead refuses that solution.<br><br>Can I urge those who are sceptics to consider Christianity for what it really is? Rather than see Christianity is a shallow angle? Christianity is not just about a loving God who loves everybody. It is also about a righteous God who will bring punishment to sinners. And if you see this today, do not harden your hearts, and repent, for the kingdom of God is at hand.</div>
