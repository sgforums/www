There are zillions of people who are kind-hearted done tons of good deeds but just becoz they didnt believe in Him they have to suffer in eternity - that is the ULTIMATE in arrogance and unfairness. U can't beat that.<br><br>2. He is ambiguious.<br>Like the above example, He says CHOSE out of ur own *freewill*, and punishes us if we chose something he dont like. He says he loves us, but look what He has done? He says he is good but he creates evil. He says he is perfect but he is jealous. He just can't decide what he is.<br><br>3. We can't do anything anyway.<br>Yup.<br><br>Everything is ALREADY decided by God anyway. Doesn't matter what you do, becoz He has already decided. If we should become Christians, we would. If not, its all fixed by Him anyway. So does it matter?<br><br>In fact, this can also count under the ambiguious part. Is there really freewill if everything is fixed?<br><br>So finally, even if God exists (which i certainly doubt so), I wouldnt want to submit to Him, becoz He isn't honest (point 2), he punishes as He pleases (point 1), He is not really all-goodie good guy (becoz He is a Angry and Jealous God), He plays around with life.<br><br>Would u submit to a tyrant?<br><br>With so many bad characteristics (many i did not mention), why would u wanna submit to an Entity such as the Christian God anyway? Out of fear for suffering in Eternity? (ok one more bad characteristic - He threatens...)<br><br>Bottomline: Are u the one who submits to questionable authority becoz u fear for urself?<br><br>I chose no.<br><br></div></blockquote>I think there is only one problem - with your understanding of Christianity and the God of the bible, not problems lying with God. I have said, that many people hates what they <span style="font-style: italic;">think</span> is Christianity, and what they <span style="font-style: italic;">think</span> is God. I'm stating from what I know of Christianity, and as a Christian I believe I have the right to say this (whether you call me arrogant or not....well....) just like if I enter a Buddhist forum and screamed, 'You buddhists are idolaters and worship idols!' I will immediately be criticized of my wrong understanding of Buddhism.<br><br>So, to answer your questions:<br><br>1) God is arrogant and unjust. Sounds ironic to me, and since when has Man judged God? Nevermind, you are using a moral presupposition to judge God, the giver of moral laws. I think you have answered the question yourself. 'Good' is only truly good in God's eyes. Man has many definitions of 'goodness', but none of which truly meets the absolute goodness of God, by which all goodness must be measured against. I can praise my good friend for being 'good' with helping me with not exposing my lies. Such a good friend! Can you disagree with my definition of 'good' now? Or is there an Absolute Goodness by which I can say whether something or someone is really 'good'? In Christianity, no one is good, only God alone. Not Mother Theresa. Not even Mohamed Gandhi, since they have sinned also. If one understands the sinfulness of sin, then they will never say he had done a <span style="font-style: italic;">single</span> good deed, much less proudly proclaim they have done 'tons of good deeds' as you have done! And only when one realizes the effects of his sinfulness as a direct transgression of God's character, can one truly understand why in not believing in Jesus results in the wrath of God. Other than that, you will only see God with myopic eyes, as with many other accusations made.<br><br>2) The ambiguity of God. Again the lack of understanding of the character of God. God gives us freewill, but allows us to make choices only within His moral boundary. You assume that God has given us even the right to do evil. Will you like such a God? I think you will like. But not me. God is righteous. Secondly, why is God a jealous God? You understand 'jealous' only in the negative sense, as in casual talk. When the bible speaks of God as 'jealous', it is not in the negative sense. Far from it. If God is God, He must be jealous! A God who shares his glory with other things is not a true God. Glory must be His alone if He is the Creator, if not God might as well don't exist, and then Christians should worship no one.<br><br>3) We can't do anything anyway? Even calvinists believe in human responsibility, so I do not know where you are coming from. Man is responsible for his actions. Man is a free agent. God does not act with what you call a 'now'. God is not restricted by time, as you and I are. God is in the past, in the present, in the future. God is eternal. How you want to even grasp, much less defeat this concept with that argument of yours is beyond me.<br><br>4) God is not honest. I think you are the one not being honest. God punishes as he pleases. No, he punishes sinners for a good reason, and I agree with his punishment. For your information, I am, too, a sinner myself. God is not the goody good guy. You are right; He is not<span style="font-style: italic;"> just that</span>. Such a god is only a figment of your imagination. You want a god who forgives all sins, and overlooks all that, saves all the 'good' people according to your own definition, and crucify His Son Jesus for nothing. This is a god you have imagined. God is a righteous and holy God, not just a loving one.</div>

Do you agree that even without God (let's just assume ..), we still have a viable secular moral and ethical system? Do you regard an agnostic who acts according to, let's say, Kant's categorical imperative, as less moral and ethical or more "lost" than the Christian?<br><br>Thank you.</div>

Frowning is a good reason to go to hell ? And the punishment is eternal life in hell ? Wow man, tat is good reason to u, not me and probably not many logical people. God is not goody goody good guy ? U r right. He practise double standard, kill and torture his own son, kill anyone who doesn't listen to him, intend to make everyone slaves for his own, create evil, sins and devil, nearly wipe out all living things because he just felt they r too evil, enforce harsh impossible rules and many other traits and examples of his "non goodness".
