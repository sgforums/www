            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, stupidissmart.<br><br>1) I do not believe, like you, that God's actions are inconsistent with His claims. I do not agree that God 'anyhow punish sinners'. But I can understand why you said that. It is simple to just read some parts of the bible and see some nasty stuff God did, and then exclaim how evil He is. I tell you now, if I pick up a Koran, or Buddhist scriptures, or even Shakespeare, and just read in parts I will get the wrong idea too. But does it make Shakespeare a literary idiot if I cannot appreciate his works? Thus, I believe you have a misconception of the Tower of Babel, God's character of justice and so on. Ironically, the reason why this thread was set up is to show how people have misconceptions of the Christian faith.<br><br>2) Killing is definitely not part of his moral boundary. It is a choice that men has the power and ability to make, but he made it outside God's moral boundary, and is what you can call 'sin'. Regarding why God would forgive murderers who repent, it is because, unlike you, the murderers truly believe (note: truly) that he has sinned and thus needs justification from his sins. God therefore would forgive those who repent. However, it is wrong to assume that a Christian can therefore commit as many sins as he wants, then say a prayer 'God forgive me' and he will be forgiven. You have misunderstood how God works. God definitely can see through what is true or pretentious repentance, and if you are truly sorry, you will be forgiven on account of faith in Christ. If one however, continues to sin deliberately after professing to believe, the bible warns, that he is really not a Christian at all.<br><br>3) Frowning will not send you to hell. A lifetime of sins will. How can a loving God enforce unfair and infinitely cruel punishments? First, I do not believe it is unfair. You have not shown how punishing sin is an unfair affair (and I don't believe you can). Second, is God is a holy God who can stand no sin, yet day after day our very existence is to go and sin against Him, shall He reward us? It is ironic when non-believers who love this life on earth without a God in their lives should find it so ridiculous if they have not the same God in the afterlife. Afterall, shouldn't you be happy that finally, the presence of God is utterly taken away from you?</div>

Do you agree that even without God (let's just assume ..), we still have a viable secular moral and ethical system?

If there is no God, the direct implication is that we should be free to do whatever we want, since morality is a man-made system. An agnostic who lives according to Kant's reasoned morality, thus has no regard for God, and his 'goodness' (in his definition) with no regards to God's goodness is hardly 'moral'.</div>

Lets start with "loving". God nearly wipe out the whole earth just because they r too evil, he curse mankind to always have wars just because they wanna build a tower, he bring death to everybeing just because a few individual eat a fruit, he kill innocent egytian civilian in a fail attempt to persuade the pharoah, he wipe and elimnate out midianites and many other tribes and he torture and punish jesus to forgive men when he can just forgive without killing jesus.

You assume that God has given us even the right to do evil. Will you like such a God?</strong><br><br>Please elaborate wat do u mean here. If I am not wrong u say tat free will only allow us to make choice within god moral boundary. However when I say tat killing and other sin exists, u say tat men has the power and ability to make the choice. Isn't tat already free will ? Wat is your stand on free will ?<br><br>And talking about sinning of christians, theoretically they can perform all the evil acts in the world and get away with it scot free.

However it is stated as IMPOSSIBLE. Furthermore when u r borned u have sinned enough to hell. Can u dispute tat ? Frowning is an act suggested by another suppose to be christian tat claim it is deadly enough for hell. Even singaporetyrannosaur also do not dispute tis fact tat frowning is a deadly sin, as deadly as killing someone. So who is right or wrong ? As said, the diea of sinning has become so trivial and silly tat it become a laughing stock.<br><br>GTG to be continued...</div>
