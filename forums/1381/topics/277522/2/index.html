            <div class='col-md body'><a href="http://www.inthenameofpurpose.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.inthenameofpurpose.org/</a><br><br>In The Name of Purpose:<br>Sacrificing Truth on the Altar of Unity<br><br>by Tamara Hartzell, 2006<br><br>"Today's Christianity may be having a lot of fun in its new way of thinking and behaving, but this isn't a game. Eternal souls are at stake, and the departure from the faith is real. Jesus Christ is being presented as a way of relativism rather than as the way and the truth, and the faith is being presented as an ever-changing method or experience that can be inserted into any faith." (In the Name of Purpose, p. 385)<br><br>Simply being a Christian does not automatically immunize us from deception. Scripture's numerous warnings are meant to be heeded. If Christians couldn't be deceived, then the Holy Spirit would be wrong about those who will "depart from the faith" (see 1 Timothy 4:1).<br><br>Sadly, this departure from the faith will be so great that the Lord Jesus Christ asks us to consider whether He will actually find faith on the earth when He returns (see Luke 18:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. Since Christians today are trading in the truth of the faith for interfaith unity and are falling for the false gospel of the (New Age) New Spirituality that says all religions are equally valid paths to God, it's no wonder the Lord Jesus Christ asked this.<br><br>The universal religion with its spiritual transformation is not coming; it is here. The Angel of light's kingdom is gathering together "all men of peace" from "every world religion" "as the embodiment of the emerging Kingdom of God on earth."* In this emerging interfaith kingdom there is:<br><br>"One Truth," yet many theologies;<br>"One God," yet many paths;<br>"One Church," yet many expressions; and<br>"One Divine Life," yet many 'little Christs.'<br>Despite its deceived claims that its message hasn't changed, today's Christianity is embracing the teachings of the counterfeit kingdom. As a result, it is being steadily transitioned away from Jesus Christ, the Rock of Offence, to the universal "Christ" who broadly accepts people within all religions/faiths. Its purposeful pursuit of unity with the world truly is uniting today's Christianity with the world.<br><br>"The religion of the future will be a general converging of religions in a universal Christ that will satisfy all ... In the end, it is hoped that the Christian will become a better Christian and each Hindu a better Hindu." Â—Jesuit theologian Father Jacques Dupuis, at the 2003 interfaith congress "The Future of God"*<br><br>"The Christ has no religious barriers in His consciousness. It matters not to Him of what faith a man may call himself." Â—Alice Bailey &amp; Djwhal Khul*<br><br>"I happen to know people who are followers of Christ in other religions." Â—Rick Warren*<br><br>"He ['the Christ'] inaugurated the new era and ... the new world religion began to take form. The word 'religion' concerns relationship ..." Â—Alice Bailey &amp; Djwhal Khul*<br><br>"I have known many people who believe in the Messiah of Jesus, regardless of what religion they are, because they believe in him. It's about a relationship, not a religion." Â—Rick Warren*<br><br>"The day is dawning when all religions win [sic] be regarded as emanating from one great spiritual source; all will be seen as unitedly providing the one root out of which the universal world religion will inevitably emerge. Then there will be neither Christian nor heathen, neither Jew nor Gentile, but simply one great body of believers, gathered out of all the current religions." Â—Alice Bailey &amp; Djwhal Khul*<br><br>"I thought, you know where people are moving in they probably need new houses of worships, temples, and synagogues, and churches, and stuff like that." Â—Rick Warren*<br><br>"The church is bigger than any organization in the world. Then you add in Muslims, you add in Hindus, you add in all the different religions, and you use those houses of worship as distribution centers, not just for spiritual care but health care." Â—Rick Warren*<br><br>"I could take you today to a million villages ... they got a church. Or they got a synagogue. They got something. They got a house of worship. The church is the biggest organization in the world.... And I came up with a thing called the P.E.A.C.E. Plan. When Jesus sent the disciples out, he said, 'When you go into a village, you find the man of peace.' Now this person doesn't have to be a Christian.... You find the person of peace, and then you begin to do the P.E.A.C.E. Plan ... Now why am I telling this to you? Because we're going public with it this next year in 2006.... And I believe it will change the world." Â—Rick Warren*<br><br>Yes, change is the order of the day.<br><br>Truth becomes the sacrifice:<br><br>when absolutism is out, and relativism is in;<br>when obedience is out, and pragmatism is in;<br>when teaching is out, and dialogue is in;<br>when thus saith the Lord is out, and consensus of opinion is in;<br>when using Scripture to judge right and wrong is out, and unity with tolerance at all costs is in;<br>when the narrow way is out, and the broad way is in.<br>While Christians have slumbered, the new way of thinking and acting has been built up underneath the old, leaving the old to crumble virtually without notice.<br><br></div>
