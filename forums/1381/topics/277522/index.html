U said I haven post anything yet.....<br><br>Are u getting defensive even before I said anything?<br><br>Or unker vince, u know that prosperity churches are going the wrong way, but decided to remain blind anyway, becoz u are convinced God wants to bless every Christian and that is also the way u want it. In this way, it is worse than bashing into wall....u are bashing ur way all the way to the wrong side! This is not the gospel preached by Christ when he 1st came to us!<br><br>I have always hold u in respect together with Unker Chin Eng. The previous Elder who took me for Bible Study class I respected him a lot too, but now he has moved on to a Charismatic Church (he claimed to be a life-long Charismatic). What I do not understand is, u and him has seen a lot of wrong things in the healing and prosperity church scenes, are sensible people, well read, believe in sound doctrine and have good Christian values, but when it comes to the prosperity gospel refused to admit that there is something wrong with it! Why? Is the truth too difficult to swallow, or simply becoz the prosperity gospel is too attractive?<br><br>My BS leader has said that he moved to another church becoz he needs to know God is still working actively in his life. I presume he is saying that he is not getting this in my church, tat's why he moved on. BUT......IS GOD REALLY NOT WORKING IN OUR LIVES? On the contrary, every little thing is God's work in our lives. To claim that you can "feel" God in one church and not another is seriously wrong. God has revealed to us in his Word and we need to countercheck what we encounter in life to his Word. If it is a "feel-good" thingy believers wanted, mebbe those MLM meetings or motivation talks is more rewarding than attending a Church. Mebbe these things can satisfy your needs more than what the gospel can offer.<br><br>CHRIST DIED FOR US NOT TO GIVE US A LIFE FREE FROM ALL PROBLEMS.

STOP PREACHING SUGAR-COATED HERESIES WHICH BRING CHRISTIANS ASTRAY.<br><br>2 Timothy 4<br><br>1In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge: 2Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourageÂ—with great patience and careful instruction. <span style="color: red;">3For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. 4They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. </span>5But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry.</div>

So you have motivational talks under the guise of 'biblical sermons'.<br><br>Contrast with the Homily they have in Catholic churches. The Scripture, Ordinary or Mass is the focus and the speaker will be doing an exposition on them.</div>
