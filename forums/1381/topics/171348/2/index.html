Can u imagine how He will take care of you, especially if let's say your father has already gone home to the Lord? Won't u meet both of them there? God the Father &amp; your father! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I am not afraid of death. I am just afraid that i cant finish what i am doing on this earth &amp; i cant accomplish my dreams. I have a gay problem &amp; i am still sorting out how to resolve this. What if before i sort it out i go home? what will happen to my eternal state? I am not homo btw.<br><br>Can u all imagine how other believers in persecution &amp; facing executions feel? What will they feel if they see their family being executed first then them? I pray for peace to come to earth but will peace ever come if men still dont want to repent? Must they be so stubborn as to fight God teeth to teeth when they know it's futile &amp; egg vs stone? Why cant they wake up a bit? Why must they cause so much suffering to themselves &amp; others? Theirs might just be eternal suffering if one believes in eternal hell fire?<br><br>Just my humble opinion.</div></blockquote>Yes, brother............we will have struggles in this life. i'm glad you hopped in the Hall.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I'm hoping to have a good fellowship with you. feel free to talk about your struggles here.</div>

All the pain, tubes, medicines, etc. But what if one dies in sleep or dies peacefully at ripe old age? Are they still afraid? That's why i want to live a good old life. I pray for that also.</div>

He calmly gave his final instructions to his sons, lied  back to bed and then breathed his last.<br><br>i always pray that God would not take me away in the midst of my days that He would give me a long and a godly life. That He would give me a chance to experience long what it is to obey fully his precepts, rely on His promises and apply His principles and be able to teach it to the next generation.<br><br>Just like David i pray that He would not take me in the midst of my days.<br><br>Ps 102:24 I said, "O my God, Do not take me away in the midst of my days; Your years are throughout all generations.<br><br>Just like David i am also afraid of death.<br><br>Ps 55:4 My heart is severely pained within me, And the terrors of death have fallen upon me.<br><br>I wonder why David was so terrorized with death unlike Paul:<br><br>Php 1:21  For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.<br><br>For I am hard pressed between the two, having a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.<br><br>maybe this was because of their limited knowledge back then since the resurrection was not so explicitly layed out back then. Maybe. But why is it i am still afraid of it. even if i have the full-orbed revelation about the resurrection from the completed Scriptures.<br><br>maybe because of the 'unnaturalness' of death. Originally man was not created to die. Death and pain are intruders when sin came in and spoiled all the fun.<br><br>I just hope that the Rapture would come in my lifetime.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah about the Rapture. I just really hope that it's around the corner already.<br><br>The stage is set and the actors are on the stage for the Great Tribulation.<br><br>The Bible predicts that there will be a revivial of the Roman Empire. Now, in our time the nations in Europe are uniting [European Union, Euro and etc.]<br><br>The Bible predicts that in the Great Tribulation Israel will have a major part in it. Scoffers of the Bible 100 years ago would jeer and ridicule the prophecy of the Bible about Israel taking part once again in the world scene since the nation of Israel in their times was no where to be found. But in 1948 Israel came back as a nation duly recognized by the U.N. Look who's laughing now.<br><br>The Bible predicts a coming one world religion headed by the false prophet. Scoffers again would say: 'Ha........that's impossible religions all over the world merging to form one religion!!!.. nonsense!!!'<br><br>But again in 1948 for the first time in world history the World Council of Churches came to the fore. It's aim is to unite all religions.<br><br>The Bible predicts one united world under the AntiChrist giving false  peace to the world. Scoffers would again jeer: 'impossible.' But then again, many years ago in this century the United Nations was formed. One of it's aims is world peace.<br><br>The Bible predicts a one world ruler. Scoffers many years ago: "Nonsense......it's impossible for one man to control the world with limited resources." But look at our technology now. Our technology now can afford a world dictator to rule the world. In just 30 minutets , he could be in Japan from Singapore via Supersonic flight.<br><br>With a flick of a finger he could deploy forces in the other part of the world using his cellfone.<br><br>With just a push of a  button a trans-continental missile could be heading there in America. With the internet he could gather his henchmen and discuss plans and strategies [using Sg forums.com <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> ]<br><br>The stage is set. The actors are on the stage. What's lacking? The Rapture.<br></div>
