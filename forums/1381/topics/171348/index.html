            <div class='col-md body'>Let me start:<br><br>I know that this was discussed before already. But let us discuss this OPENLY  HONESTLY AND PERSONALLY no holds barred.<br><br>Do you fear death? Have you conqured this fear already? What happens if you die next year...........as a Christian do the fear of dying still haunt you or are you like our beloved Paul who knows FOR SURE that his death would be an entrance to glory?<br><br>Micheal Bronson states three reasons why people are scared of death:<br><br>1) They are afraid to meet God and account for all the sins they made.<br>2) When you pass through death, you are all alone even though many people sorround you.........this 'aloneness' makes us scared.<br>3) The 'unknownness' of death. People are scared of the unkown. People dont know what lies ahead. To atheists they get all scared with the thought: what if God is after all true?"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Ironside.<br><br>Its always been edifying reading your posts.<br><br>personally, the time when i was very close to the notion of death is when i was forced to witness my friend's body lying on the floor as he fell from the 7th floor.<br><br>There and then, dark thoughts came to my mind - why ? why ? why this now ? so much grief !  so much sorrow ! i weeped.<br><br>A verse came to me in the midst of the wake:<br><br>"Unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds." John 12:24<br><br>And indeed, from his death till today, we have witnessed the production of many many seeds. To name but one, his father is saved after many years of denial and pride.<br><br>This experience gave me some courage to face death and to witness the Glory of God at work.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I envy the apostle Paul and the other apostles............i mean they don't have to battle against the doubt if whether they are saved or not. They have seen the Lord....................Paul was accosted by the Lord Jesus on the way to Damascus....John recieved revelations.........i mean how could they doubt their salvation? When death comes they are 100% sure that they will go to heaven.<br><br>However, in my case, doubts assail me if whether i really saved or not sometimes.........Yes, i have the Word of God, the Bible and i know that all it says is true but the problem is how could i know if my faith in it is true.<br><br>I have no doubts about Jesus being the SAvior.............but sometimes i have doubts regarding my faith........if this is really the faith of the elect.<br><br>I have no doubts about the blessed and glorious Person, i have doubts about my connnection [to him].<br><br></div>

And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God's love. Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither our fears for today nor our worries for tomorrow - not even the power of hell can separate us from God's love.<br><br>I decide that I should stop flattering myself.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Can u imagine how He will take care of you, especially if let's say your father has already gone home to the Lord? Won't u meet both of them there? God the Father &amp; your father! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I am not afraid of death. I am just afraid that i cant finish what i am doing on this earth &amp; i cant accomplish my dreams. I have a gay problem &amp; i am still sorting out how to resolve this. What if before i sort it out i go home? what will happen to my eternal state? I am not homo btw.<br><br>Can u all imagine how other believers in persecution &amp; facing executions feel? What will they feel if they see their family being executed first then them? I pray for peace to come to earth but will peace ever come if men still dont want to repent? Must they be so stubborn as to fight God teeth to teeth when they know it's futile &amp; egg vs stone? Why cant they wake up a bit? Why must they cause so much suffering to themselves &amp; others? Theirs might just be eternal suffering if one believes in eternal hell fire?<br><br>Just my humble opinion.</div>
