If Saddam said the sinner's prayer with utmost willingness to repent from his sins, then he will be able to meet God in heaven once everything is over for him. But whether or not a Christian goes to heaven. it's still up to God's judgement.<br><br>2. Jesus is our brother, our Lord and Saviour. Someone who bridged the gap of sin that seperated us from fellowshipping with God. Through His death on the cross, we believers have gained access to a relationship with God.</div>

Yes, he will go to heaven.<br><br>Even the people who voted for His execution found forgiveness when they repented of their sins and trusted in Him alone for salvation [compare Ac 2:23 and Acts 2:37-41]<br><br>it was in answer to the Lords prayer on the cross: "forgive them for they know not what they are doing."<br><br>Even the apostle Paul who blasphemed the Lord Jesus and persecuted His Church found forgiveness upon repentance and faith in Him.<br><br>Be sure though that sin will not decieve you. There are those who mistake ATTRITION FOR REPENTANCE. Attrition is 'repenting' from their sins to escape hell and that only.<br><br>Contrition [an element of true repentance] is going beyond attrition. it is forsaking sin BECAUSE IT IS A SIN AGAINST GOD WHETHER HELL OR HEAVEN  EXIST or not. To be sure, it begins with attrition then matures into contrition. Sadly many do not go beyond this stage.<br><br>2) there is a sense that God the Father is our Father. But it pertains only because He created us:<br><br>Ac 17:28 "for in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, '<strong>For we are also His offspring</strong>.'<br><br>Ac 17:29 "Therefore, <strong>since we are the offspring of God</strong>, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, something shaped by art and man's devising.<br><br>These guys whom Paul is speaking are not saved people. The context of these words speaks of God's creatorhood. These guys if they do not repent and trust in Christ alone for salvation will go to hell.<br><br>But God indeed has His sons, adoptedl sons that is because they have repented and trusted in Christ alone for salvation and therefore are in Christ, God's beloved Son:<br><br>Ga 3:26 For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.<br><br>those who have trusted in Him are His brothers yes:<br><br>Heb 2:11 For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one, for which reason He [Christ] is not ashamed to call them brethren,<br><br>P.s. please don't hesitate to aks questions.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

The Church is constituted by all those who repent and trust in Christ alone for salvation.<br><br>2) By God's wisdom and sovereign will He deemed it that we will not have godly powers [what do you mean by this?] We [who have trusted in Christ] have  divine natures when the Holy Spirit came to indwelt us.<br><br>[having divne nature does not mean we are God]. This nature speaks about moral nature. the holiness and righteous nature of God.<br><br>3) No Jesus and God the Father is not the same. They are distinct persons.<br><br>This will be confusing my friend but this is what the Bible teach:<br><br>One God existing in three persons.<br><br>I would like to post what i posted in the corner here if you don't mind:<br><br>The Trinity<br><br>[Sorry its quite long. Necessary points need to be stressed. So hard to make a very important doctrine short]<br><br>The God revealed in the Bible is a God that is triune. That is, God is three persons yet only one. Remember that. God is not three persons and three gods. No. That is tritheism or polytheism. That is heretical and scripturally unsound. If you seem puzzled and find it enigmatic. If it seems logically irreconcilable to you. You got it. The Trinity is a mystery to us finite and limited human beings. But thatÂ’s who God is as revealed in the Bible. John Wesley, the founder of Methodism once said: Â“Bring me a worm that can comprehend a man and I will show you a man that can comprehend the Trinity.Â”<br><br>God is infinite. Our minds are not. This is where our humility is called. We know, as a Christian, that the Bible is GodÂ’s revelation to us. Everything in it is inspired down to the last jot and title. We know that in it God is speaking to us in written form. Whenever logic and GodÂ’s revelation seems to collide. It is GodÂ’s revelation that should prevail in our hearts and minds.<br><br>Now, the Trinity. Some contend that this is not found in the Bible. So they say that this doctrine is unbiblical [as if to say that everything must appear in word in the Bible for it to be biblical]. The word is not found in the Bible but the idea is there. Â“IronsideÂ” does not appear in word in the Bible but Ironside was in the mind of God when He said that He wants all men to be saved.<br><br>Those who are in the oneness group could easily write off the Tri-unity of God in the episode of the baptism of our Lord by appealing to GodÂ’s omnipresence by saying: Â“There is not three distinct persons here but only one in three manifestations. God can be everywhere, He is the same person who is in the water, yet because He can be everywhere, He is also the same person speaking from heaven and descending like a dove. No Trinity.Â”<br><br>But they cannot circumvent the doctrine of the Trinity so clearly laid out in Matthew 28:19:<br><br>"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of <strong>the</strong> Father and of<strong> the</strong> Son and of<strong> the</strong> Holy Spirit,Â”<br><br>Here we see the distinctiveness of persons. The verse has the definite article Â‘THEÂ’ before every person named. Â‘THE Father, THE Son, THE Holy SpiritÂ’ The presence of the definite articles mean the Father is not the Son, the Son is not the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is not the Father.<br><br>So there is not one person but three. But notice this distinct persons take up one name.<br><br>"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,Â”<br><br>Â‘NameÂ’ is in the singular. Name in the Bible is the expression of what the person named is in being. His name describes His nature or essence and character. These distinct persons take up one nature or essence and character. So if the Father is God, the Son is also God and also the Holy Spirit. If the Father is Lord, the Son is also Lord and also the Holy Spirit. If the Father is Holy, the Son is also Holy as well as the Spirit and etc.<br><br>Everything seems logical right at this point. But wait till you see another revelation from the Bible:<br><br>De 6:4 "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one!<br><br>ThatÂ’s the Â“NiceanÂ” Creed of the Israelites. Â“LordÂ” here is the name of God given to Moses: YHWH. Â“YHWH is oneÂ” the text saysÂ…Â…. one yet three [Matthew 28:19]. DonÂ’t try to figure it out youÂ’ll lose your mind. Accept it by faith. St. Augustine once said: Â“to not believe in the Trinity is in danger of losing his salvation. To those who try to understand completely the Trinity is in danger of losing his mind.Â”<br><br></div>
