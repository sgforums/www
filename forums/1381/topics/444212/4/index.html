              <p>Knowledge does not transform, only knowing transforms. One has to understand that most people live in their ’’heads’’; they are not living. To live in the head means, missing what is obvious, missing the isness of existence. How can one not miss? One is either wallowing in the past, or one is escaping into the future. The past the and future or not existential in nature, psycholigically they exist! Hence, I remarked knowing; knowing cannot happen in the past nor in the future.</p>

              Parking one's mind no-where, one is in the process of knowing! It has nothing to do with knowledge. 
              Does one need to have a belief that one has hands? One simply knows, cos one is experiencing it, one does not need a belief. Does one have to beleive in the sun? One simply knows it.
              If my grandfather eg, had told me that love is nothing but hurting oneself and without exploring it, without experiencing it - i am simply imbibing what could be true or untrue.
              The problem with oneself (in most instances) is that the lack of inner courage to admit that one does not know. One who admits that one does not know and is still open to exploring, to esquire with an ''open'' heart, there is a possibility of realizing what is existentially true or simply a psychological placebo
              Truth (what is true) can never be interpreted - truth can only be experienced. Instead of creating a possibility for for people to experience the ''truth', many started interpreting the truth. 
              It is fine to have beliefs, but beliefs that allows for 'unlimiting' oneself makes all the difference. The former is a pond! , The latter is a river - flowing and ''alive'' 
              
              Truth in quotes cos there is no absolute truth, it is always relative to the isness of living.

              <p>Truth can be known and be lived out. So I don't see why you need to dichotomise them as if they are somehow mutually exclusive. Jesus said, "I am the Truth..." In short, when we see Jesus we are looking at all that is true, for He is the Creator who made the universe. For Christians, not only can we know the truth, we are also to walk in the truth. And when we are in Christ, we are also in the Truth.</p>
              <p>BTW, your last statement is self-refuting, which means it is a FALSE statement. To say there is NO absolute truth is already to make an absolute statement. And if you say that truth is relative, then you are also making an absolute statement here, that truth is relative. But this notion of relative truth is also self-refuting and self-defeating. Perhaps you are used to experiencing self-refuting truths???</p>

              <p>Anyway, your take on what Jesus meant is pretty bizarre and involves heavy metaphorising of what Jesus taught. But then again, that characterises much of your postings.</p>
              <p>Yes, Jesus died for the whole world. In that sense He did not include. All humans are called to salvation. But Jesus does exclude also. He will separate the sheep from the goats, those who believe in Him from those who do not.</p>

              to partake of the eternal truth – and as it being eternal – how can
              it be absolute for ordinary human beings (for Jesus it was, cos he
              had ’’dissappeared’’ as a human form, he was emptiness), it can
              only be relative to another human being’s perception, given his/her
              conditioning. When Jesus uttered this – blessed are the poor in
              spirit, for ….... of heaven – by that he was implying that one who
              does not accumulate or becomes identified with the the past
              (psychological baggage).<br> Clouds come and go in the sky, Jesus was asking … that one
              transcend these clouds to see the ‘Truth”. Clouds are temporal
              (conditioning, tradition, beliefs, religion,- psychological and
              social and limiting) whereas the sky is permanent (which transcend
              all religions, conditioning beleifs and even it is not transcended
              one is open to the possibility of recognizing that which has always
              been in one’s being and unlimiting and open to what may ….) hence
              spiritual. religion is a mere spotlite – it narrows, it
              concentrates and it has to exclude Spirituality is flood lite, ti
              widens, it is all embracing and it is inclusive – <span>BIG</span> difference. Till this is not understood or
              experienced one is a squirrel in a cage</p>
              <p>Jesus did not exclude. Do Christians include others who are not
              Christians? It presuppose one who ethical as opposed to being
              principled to derive at an ans. Ethics is inner, intuitive,
              Principles are outer – commandments given by someone else to
              follow.</p>
              <p>Muse over this – can two emptiness(es) have a distance? What is
              the distance between the two?</p>

              You can say more, but say in such a way that people won't have problem understanding you. Even if you want to show how deep and profound you are also do it using simple to understand words mah.

                  Sure one can taste wine for himself. But how does one hold to self-refuting statements and still claim to be rational or know the truth? You said truth is relative and not absolute. Well, are you absolutely sure of that?

              What is permanent is truth (not dictionary meaning but existential truth). One is only experiencing relative truth and it will remain so  as long as one is IDENTIFIED with one's  mind and body.  It has been erroneously  assumed to be the absolute truth, there is no truth, only truth that is relative to what is perceived,. why so? When one walks on the road, and falls down on the pavement, only then is the pavement a reality to him/her. Before that. it did not exist. It was always there but only became a reality when it was perceived by the one who fell down. The pavement does not call out to say I exist. The one who fell down thru his/her perception gave it existence. 
                Eg, stock market crashes, it has only relevance for someone in the banking or .. Would it have relevance for a village peasant? Will the mountain goats be affected by the stock market crash?
               As such, 'reality' remains a mere psychological experience for many, it is only existential when it really happens to that person in a given situation and is always relative to one's conditioning and so on so forth. One has to reconcile or at least understand that one could be confused or simply not know.
              
              
              Also, many assume that they  exist in the mind or the body. The mind and the body exist in the source.
              The source cannot be found outside of onself. It is an inward journey and as long as there is no longing in one's heart (love) to merge with the source (eg God, jesus, Mohd, Buddha heart soul or  ..) one has settled for mediocrity.  The mind cannot use logic to get inside - cos the mind is a limitation, it does not exist. it is a bundle of thoughts. can one find one's mind?  
              
              To know God, to know Jesus to know Krishna - one has to 'die' - by that is meant die to the roles and be empty of .... By that 'dying' to roles, it is not meant that someone has to reject roles; accept and fulfil the roles but dont bring it home. By home is meant source (aka God, Jesus, Mohd, Buddha  heart, soul or ...) and one is always a clean slate. It is always open to possibilities. However, the human mind cannot accept uncertainty and hence it is content with certainty and thus unwilling to risk enquiring, exploring.

              So the door does not exist until you run into it or the cars on the
              highway do not exist until you got run over by them and become road
              kill? Seems like you have serious problem with reality that is
              existing right now.</p>

              U are free to spout all that comes to you - it is you and u are being u what u type here. To reject outrightly, what one knows not or lacks insight is the highest form of ignorance. I only sense fear and doubts - i m guessing, i could be wrong, i could be rite, but it is for u to know or not know. 
              
              By judging - u are not defining what another is (in this instance, me) or . .. but defining what you are.
              
              
              When one's mirror that is thick with the dust of the past,  onecannot see clearly what is. One only sees what one wants to see, hence one misses! One cannot respond to what is. One merely reacts and all one does is use the past. Of course, the past is dead, it is only alive in the mind. The wise knows and accepts that the illusion of certainty cannot co-exist with existential uncertainty. At the most, one is clutching at straws of certainty!
              
               
               My labelling or making another wrong does not make me rite. What I am not is what I am - that is the same for u.  Like i mentioned before, i offer my views, opinions n what have u. u are free to be u just as others are. If it does not resonate of u or does not with u - lump it.

              You talked about perception, so in what way are you perceiving reality such that you are not subject to the same perception errors that you think we are bound to? Your views certainly do not resonate with me, and I suspect it do not resonate with many here too. I have pointed out the flaws in your worldview and how it is self refuting. If you think logic and reason does not resonate with you then you can also lump it.

              <p>The belief that science can explain and prove everything is itself a religion, known as scientism, or scientific materialism, or naturalism.</p>
              <p>Science itself cannot prove a worldview because a worldview is required in order to interpret science.</p>
