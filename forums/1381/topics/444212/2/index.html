              When one wears a Badge (organized religion) - be it Islam (Muslim), Hinduism(Hindu), Buddhism(Buddhist), Christianity (Christian) - one is merely a prisoner- one is bound by so many tenents/???. It limits one in many ways. It is an unfreeing experience, one is in bondage.
              
              However, when one is BEING Mohd, Being Krishna(?), Being Buddha or Being Christ - one is flowing and one is relating to oneself and vice versa. The first ripple of being ...??? emanates from what one is being. One embodies (Buddha-consciousness, Christ-consciousness or ...) consciousness of being eg Christ or .... one is free and one is longer bound to ....
              
              Sadly, in today's organized religion it is more of rituals and dogmas and doctrines. One is no longer flowing one is merely trapped. I say trapped cos how can beliefs (inherently binding) allow one to expereince or partake of another existentially! The seekers of truth unlearn and discover what comes as it is. Beliefs are an invention. 
              
              Real religion (religiouness) is one who is being loving, being kind, being grateful and I m sure many of us have across such a person. He or she has arrived. He/she has not alienated the ''God'' within him/herself. Many today are so alienated they go around searching looking for ''God'' (call whatever it may suit u) in a church , temple, mosque or ...
              
              When one cannot find ''God'' (the name does not matter) within him/herself one cannot find it in a church, temple , mosque or ... even in scriptures, sutras or texts.
              One is already enlightened, it is awaiting recognition. How can recognition happen when one is leaning on somehting outside of one''self"' and hope to be ... (enlightened not in the sense of Buddhism or Christianity or ...)
              
              This is the predicament of many. It is a squirrel in a cage - just going around and around. An inward journey is the essence of being religious. What is true liberates, what is a belief binds! The former is a discovery (recoginising of ) and the latter an invention.
              All human beings long to be free. I would surmise and dare say that only love frees and of course it presupposes the one who purports to love is him/herself free on the inside. Love that is being kind, love that is being emphathetic.
              
              One can go on n spread one's ''worldly'' riches more and more and
              more, one can spread one's empire of political domination, another can (and may) spread one's religious empire - but it is all the same! The desire is to manipulate, to dominate more and more people. Is not this politics behind the cloak of religiosity? One who understands is conscious has no need for a power trip! Beware the pious egoism.
              
              PS - Has anyone questioned or even wondered how come there is a Christian God, A Hindu God or ... ? Existence is non-dual. Human mind is so divided and hence the utter confusion.' One who is being religious is godliness - a fragrance of being ....??? 
              .................
              
              As for being in Heaven and Hell - it is a myth! .It is not geographical and it never was. It is within one and a reflection of one's state of being. Being eg, negative, loving, accepting, grateful, kind or ...
              Two prisoners were holed up in a cell and one night there was moonlight outside of the prison. One looked at it and partook of and deligted in the moon. The other cursed cos all he could see were the prison bars on the cell's windows.
              Same situation but two existential expereinces!

                              <p>When one wears a Badge (organized religion) â€“ be it Islam
              (Muslim), Hinduism(Hindu), Buddhism(Buddhist), Christianity
              (Christian) â€“ one is merely a prisoner- one is bound by so many
              tenents/???. It limits one in many ways. It is an unfreeing
              experience, one is in bondage.</p>
              <p>However, when one is <span class="">BEING</span> Mohd, Being
              Krishna(?), Being Buddha or Being Christ â€“ one is flowing and one
              is relating to oneself and vice versa. The first ripple of being
              â€¦??? emanates from what one is being. One embodies
              (Buddha-consciousness, Christ-consciousness or
              &amp;#8230<img title="Wink" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink">
              consciousness of being eg Christ or â€¦. one is free and one is
              longer bound to â€¦.</p>
              <p>Sadly, in todayâ€™s organized religion it is more of rituals and
              dogmas and doctrines. One is no longer flowing one is merely
              trapped. I say trapped cos how can beliefs (inherently binding)
              allow one to expereince or partake of another existentially! The
              seekers of truth unlearn and discover what comes as it is. Beliefs
              are an invention.</p>
              <p>Real religion (religiouness) is one who is being loving, being
              kind, being grateful and I m sure many of us have across such a
              person. He or she has arrived. He/she has not alienated the â€™â€™Godâ€™â€™
              within him/herself. Many today are so alienated they go around
              searching looking for â€™â€™Godâ€™â€™ (call whatever it may suit u) in a
              church , temple, mosque or â€¦</p>
              <p>When one cannot find â€™â€™Godâ€™â€™ (the name does not matter) within
              him/herself one cannot find it in a church, temple , mosque or â€¦
              even in scriptures, sutras or texts.<br>
              One is already enlightened, it is awaiting recognition. How can
              recognition happen when one is leaning on somehting outside of
              oneâ€™â€˜selfâ€�â€™ and hope to be â€¦ (enlightened not in the sense of
              Buddhism or Christianity or &amp;#8230<img title="Wink" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink"></p>
              <p>This is the predicament of many. It is a squirrel in a cage â€“
              just going around and around. An inward journey is the essence of
              being religious. What is true liberates, what is a belief binds!
              The former is a discovery (recoginising of ) and the latter an
              invention.<br>
              All human beings long to be free. I would surmise and dare say that
              only love frees and of course it presupposes the one who purports
              to love is him/herself free on the inside. Love that is being kind,
              love that is being emphathetic.</p>
              <p>One can go on n spread oneâ€™s â€™â€™worldlyâ€™â€™ riches more and more
              and<br>
              more, one can spread oneâ€™s empire of political domination, another
              can (and may) spread oneâ€™s religious empire â€“ but it is all the
              same! The desire is to manipulate, to dominate more and more
              people. Is not this politics behind the cloak of religiosity? One
              who understands is conscious has no need for a power trip! Beware
              the pious egoism.</p>
              <p>PS â€“ Has anyone questioned or even wondered how come there is a
              Christian God, A Hindu God or â€¦ ? Existence is non-dual. Human mind
              is so divided and hence the utter confusion.â€™ One who is being
              religious is godliness â€“ a fragrance of being â€¦.???<br>
              .................</p>
              <p>As for being in Heaven and Hell â€“ it is a myth! .It is not
              geographical and it never was. It is within one and a reflection of
              oneâ€™s state of being. Being eg, negative, loving, accepting,
              grateful, kind or â€¦<br>
              Two prisoners were holed up in a cell and one night there was
              moonlight outside of the prison. One looked at it and partook of
              and deligted in the moon. The other cursed cos all he could see
              were the prison bars on the cellâ€™s windows.<br>
              Same situation but two existential expereinces!</p>
                            </div>

              On what basis do you say heaven and he'll is myth? Jesus certainly did not teach that. As for the two prisoners, regardless of what they perceive the moon or how they perceive it to be, the objective reality is that they are both in a cell. Question for you, are you caught in bondage to your moralising posts here that does not seem grounded in any objective truth?

              Muse over this â€“ A pickpocket was trailing a gem merchant and wanted very much to get hold of this gem â€“ he tried all means and ways and to no avail and in spite of that was still trying; all this time the merchant knew what he was up to and allowed the thief to be and when an opportunity rose he dropped the precious gem into the pocket of the thief. After a lapse of some moments, the pickpocket out frustration blurted out to the merchant that he was a professional in pickpocketing and queried as to where is the gem as it could not even find it in the merchantâ€™s [person]!
               To that the merchant replied â€“ I put it where u would least look for it â€“ IN your pocket! This allegory illustrates the predicament of searching in the â€™â€™wrongâ€™â€™ places and hoping to find â€¦.  
              
              Eg :When I practice a particular â€¦. thinking that I am a particular â€¦. looking for a particular â€¦ eg merits or to arrive someday somewhere I m merely spinning on my fictional â€™â€™selfâ€™â€™ â€“ I am playing mind games. As long as one has an image of what God, Buddha or englightenment, awakening or ... is or should be it is already a concept and when it is premised on a concept one is simply going to be like a squirrel in a cage!
              
              AS LONG AS ANYONE IS LOOKING OUTSIDE OF OF ONESELF FOR THIS ''GOD'' OR ..... BE IT CHRISTIANITY, BE IT ISLAM, BE IT HINDUISM - IT DOES NOT MATTER.
              THE JOURNEY inwards makes all the difference. It is fine to use the bible, koran or ... the latter are mere devices pointing to what is true (not truth) and one may partake of Jesus or Krhisna or Buddha - cos they all were spiritual expressions in different forms. They were formlessness in a human body. And they were all an invitation to partake of the well of Being! Of course, the thirst has to be there for one to risk it all in spite of the fears, doubts and ....  
              
              
              How to know which is true or who is misleading or who is being truly a  ... priest or pastor or ..... he/she sees,( in this instance, Jesus) in all forms and in the formless. A Christian who goes to an Imam( Muslin) and is accepted despite him not being a Muslim is inclusive, there is no discrimination. Same goes for pastor (or ....) who is inclusive of anyone in spite of his cirumstances, creed or .....  this is the essence of being religious. 
              
              Of course, there are many who would disagree but it is ok to disagree. I am not asking anyone to subcrribe or embrace, it is merely to introspect n ...

              <p>I think the sober truth behind that is that the creator sets the rules. Henry Ford made his cars the way he wants it. It's his prerogative since he is the creator. The choice is either to buy or not to buy his car. That choice is the buyer's freedom.</p>
              <p>The same with God. He is the Creator so He sets the moral rules and criteria. The freedom of choice for man is whether he would choose to obey God or continue in sin. The Bible does not teach that man gets to choose heaven or hell. The Bible teaches that man is already dead in Adam and bound for hell UNLESS he repents and believes and cross over from death to life.</p>

              <p>the joke is on who, you or henry ford?</p>
              <p>you want a ford car and you want to choose your own color, don't joke.</p>
              <p>you want to sell me your car and you want me to accept black, don't joke.</p>
