              I uttered floodlites - i meant spirituality (which cannot be in any way conceptualised nor be grasped by the human mind cos it transcends all concepts and idelology, tradition, beliefs lah. It is all-embracing and inclusive. 
              By torch lite (aka spotlite) I meant that one choooses to concentrate on only one thing to the exclusion of others. 
              When I refer to Christianity - i m refering to the spotlite. Jesus was not - he being a floodlite!
              
              Ideology means one has made oneâ€™s summary of life. And when the latter can be summed up, how is one to ever know lah. I m not in any way trying to make u/anyone wrong nor make u/anyone rite here.
              In all my postings here and in other forums, i say what i feel, of course, there are bound to be differences lah. My intention if there is any is simply to provoke thinking and arriving at one's conclusion when it resonates with him or her. Of course, not necessarily that it must be so.

              The Gospels recorded many exclusive claims made by Jesus. In what sense is Jesus floodlight while Christianity is spotlight?

              <p>That's where you are mistaken. Logic undergirds ALL arguments for anything. You need to use logic to even say "logic has never proved anything". Not only that, there are logical proofs, mathematical proofs, scientific proofs etc all which uses logic. Having an experience is of course not the same as having an argument. When you have experienced something it is personal to holder. But even when you wish to communicate the experience to others you have to employ logic if you wish people to believe you.</p>
              <p>You said that one is conditioned to be a Christian. Interesting. Is one also conditioned NOT to be a Christian too? You said Jesus did not discriminate, but what is the context? When Jesus comes again to judge the living and the dead, do you think He will discriminate between those who love Him and those who hate Him?</p>
              <p>Yes, the rain or sun falls on the righteous and the wicked, and this is what the Bible teaches too. This is the common grace that theologians speak of, it also shows the uniformity of nature that God upholds by the power of His word. Times and seasons are set by God and He upholds them. This is also the general revelation that God has given to man so that we are without excuse that there is a Creator.</p>

              <p>Logic is the science of the relations between <em>propositions</em>. Logic can tell
                      us what can be inferred from a given proposition, but it cannot tell us whether
                      the given proposition is true in the first place. All philosophical systems rely

              <p>We all have to live our lives according to certain "codes" or authority. The issue is rather WHAT is this code or authority we live by, and whether it is true, good, livable, and adequate to answer the ultimate questions of life.</p>

                  Our human dignity is to be made in the image of God, and to serve God is man's rightful response to God. Jesus came as a humble servant to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many. Paul called himself a slave of Christ. So servitude depends on who your master is.
