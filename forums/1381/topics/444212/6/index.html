              That is being wise, everybody is thinking of the moon and the stars and death and afterlife but they cannot even appreciate what is rite in front of them. 
              So, I can only assume that they are trying to live as opposed to living.

              <p>If you are contradicting yourself, that is hardly the mark of intelligence. It is irrationality confused as intelligence! It is rational people that fear and avoid contradictions, not stupid people. People who lack critical thinking? They embrace contradictions.</p>

              <p>Muse over this more: Humans are intelligent beings because we are made in God's image. So I agree with you, intelligence cannot be learned. It is something we are wired with. But intellectual prowess can be honed by training in critical thinking. But you seemed to be one who frowns upon logical thinking.</p>

              <p>But in holding on to self-refuting statements and other contradictory beliefs, how can you now be said to be embracing logic? The heart cannot rejoice with what the mind rejects. Knowledge precedes doing. But the book of James say, be doers of the Word and not mere listeners.</p>
              <p>BTW, if nothing you said is the truth, then what's the point of asking us to find it out? It's like saying "All I have written is fiction. Whether it is fact or not is for you to find out." But why should anyone be bothered to do that after hearing what you admitted?</p>

              One who has no fears will listen to the heart . (uncertainty)

              What is rationale - If god created human beings in his OWN image, why the prayer of supplication? Why must he save ....? Is this rationale?
              If God created the universe- who created god? Is this a contradiction or a rationality?

              <p>Jesus quoted Scriptures in responding to His critics and enemies. It was the authoritative Word of God that Jesus quoted to His hearers. My point in that verse is that the Bible has its "existentialist" part, where it calls us to BE DOERS, not merely hearers. Apparently you missed that, amusing as it is to me, since you talked so much about being this and being that!</p>
              <p>Your definition of belief does not resonate with me nor with what the Bible teaches. Belief in the Biblical sense is based on God's revelation to us. I do not know all things but certainly I can put my trust in God who does!</p>
              <p>And who taught you that no fear means that one listens to the heart? What's your authority? Or is this your own musings you invent to make yourself look wise? God gave us brains so that we can use it to think and reason through things. Yet here you are telling people to ditch the mind.</p>
              <p>Your questions betray the superficiality of your thinking. How is praying not rational? And asking who created God is like asking who is the bachelor's wife. But since you are not trained or given to logical thinking you would erroneously think that your questions are reasonable stumpers for me.</p>
              <p>Yes, it is rather a waste of time responding to your nonsensical musings because you refuse to engage in rational reflection at all. But I do not fret, I merely wish to point out to readers (and to your stubborn self) that your worldview is rationally flawed and plagued by contradictions and totally unlivable. It is your own delusion.</p>

              Ps - Does one go to work and say that one's heart feels like not doing one's work and say that it ok. Of course not, This is beyond one's control- one has to play by the rules set in the office. This is without 
               However, one can go into a chruch or temple and not pray (when others are doing it) cos one does not feel it in one's heart do so - nothing wrong. this is within
