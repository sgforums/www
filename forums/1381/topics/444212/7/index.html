              <p>If one has to drag himself to work or has the Monday blues, then he has a choice to make. Either he take leave, or he bites the bullet and just go to work, or he awol and then face the consequences. The decision is his, and the consequences are also his to bear. As for prayer, it is also your choice to pray or not. There is no compulsion. So what's your point really?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>People, there is an afterlife. We are made up of three elements - body, soul and spirit. The soul gives life to the body. It is the soul that we use to communicate to one another. I am writing to u know thru my soul. For unbelievers in Christ, the spirit is dead. Once a person repents of his sins and accepts Christ, his spirit is made alive. It is the spirit that currently goes to hell or death when a person dies. In the future, the resurrection of believers will unite all body, soul and spirit without corruption, then we will be like Jesus bec we shall see him as he is.</p></div>

                              <p>ya so becos no1 would be alive to tell it mah... so whether
              there really is afterlife anot to me is just a question mark. No
              one knows and cant be proven mah... then why bother focus so much
              on it. Focus on current life is better.</p>

              No one...except Jesus who taught about heaven and hell, who backed up His words by His resurrection from the dead.
