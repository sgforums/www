            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Question: "What does it mean that Jesus died for our sins?"<br><br>Answer: </strong>Simply put, without Jesus’ death on the cross for our sins, no one would have eternal life. Jesus Himself said: "<a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1381/topics/way-truth-life.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">I am the way and the truth and the life</span></span></a>. No one comes to the Father except through me” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%2014.6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">John 14:6</span></span></a>). In this statement, Jesus declares the reason for His birth, death and resurrection—to provide the way to heaven for sinful mankind, who could never get there on their own.<br><br>When God created Adam and Eve, they were perfect in every way and lived in a virtual paradise, the Garden of Eden (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Genesis%202.15"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Genesis 2:15</span></span></a>). God created man in His image, meaning they also had the freedom to make decisions and choices of their own free will. Genesis 3 goes on to describe how Adam and Eve succumbed to Satan’s temptations and lies. In doing so, they disobeyed the will of God by eating of the tree of knowledge from which they were forbidden: “And the LORD God commanded the man, ‘You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die’” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Genesis%202.16-17"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Genesis 2:16-17</span></span></a>). This was the first sin committed by man and, as a result, all mankind is subject to both physical and eternal death by virtue of our <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1381/topics/inherit-sin.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">sinful nature inherited</span></span></a> from Adam. <br><br>God declared that all who sin will die, both physically and spiritually. This is the fate of all mankind. But God, in His grace and mercy, provided a way out of this dilemma, the shed blood of His perfect Son on the cross. God declared that “without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Hebrews%209.22"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Hebrews 9:22</span></span></a>), but through the shedding of blood, redemption is provided. The Law of Moses (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Exodus%2020.2-17"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Exodus 20:2-17</span></span></a>) provided a way for the people to be considered “sinless” or “right” in God’s eyes—the offering of animals sacrificed for every sin they committed. These sacrifices were only temporary, though, and were really a foreshadowing of the perfect, once-for-all sacrifice of Christ on the cross (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Hebrews%2010.10"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Hebrews 10:10</span></span></a>). <br><br>This is why Jesus came and why He died, to become the ultimate and the final sacrifice, the perfect (without blemish) sacrifice for our sins (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Colossians%201.22"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Colossians 1:22</span></span></a>; <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20Peter%201.19"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">1 Peter 1:19</span></span></a>). Through Him, the promise of life eternal with God becomes effective through faith to those who believe in Jesus. “So that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Galatians%203.22"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Galatians 3:22</span></span></a>). These two words “faith” and “believing” are critical to our salvation. It is through our believing in the shed blood of Christ for our sins that we receive eternal life. “For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ephesians%202.8-9"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Ephesians 2:8-9</span></span></a>).</p></div>

              <p>Firstly, God should not create the tree of the knowledge of good and evil because Adam and Eve would die if they ate them. So what is the point of creating that tree.</p>
              <p>Secondly, if God really needed to create the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he should take precaution not to let Adam and Eve ate it. Human parents will put away the medicine out of reach of their children or if possible will not even keep anything that will harm their children at home.</p>
