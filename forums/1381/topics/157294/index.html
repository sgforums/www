The first kind is a manipulative group who controls its members completely and demands complete commitment and loyalty. The second kind of cult is one who deviates from biblical Christianity.<br><br>1 John 4:1-3 instructs us: "Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world."<br></div>

I just want to clarify that these judgements r not for us Christians. In fact, it will help us to show care &amp; concern to those who r poor or facing trouble w/c i thot was what Rick Joyner was saying w/o knowing fully what was his backgrd. I thot the gospel could be advanced by these disasters but i din't know there r different views among Christians here w/c stick to peace time evangelism. Bcos got really confused when some of u asked in your posts why God didn't strike S'pore with disaster. I believe God has blessed S'pore very much bcos of our evangelism &amp; bcos of praying ppl &amp; bcos society tolerates Christian worship &amp; evangelism &amp; allows churches to flourish w/o much interference. So i thot some of u r complaining that disaster didn't strike S'pore. Sorry for the misunderstanding. I sincerely apologise. God bless you all!<br><br>I know what some of you will again protest what judgements &amp; claim that i m being holy. I am not claiming to be a prophet or holy man. As i said i dont represent all Christians in S'pore. I am not against you personally bcos i felt that u were attacking me personally &amp; not my ideas. Ok, enough said.</div>
