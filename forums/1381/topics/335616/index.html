              <p>Let's testify and glorify God</p>
              <p>By writing what God has done for each one of us, small or big, but it has got to be genuine of course.Don't quote from the bible we all could read from the bible but write from what you know by your own experience of being Christian. There is no need to be detailed but please be sincere and truthful. And I've been accused of some sort of bragging in other forum when I didn't even try. I mean why would I want to brag while everyone doesn't know me. Just be sincere and I hope this could strengthened your faith. I go first I hpe this thread will never end. God bless.</p>
              <p>The God whom I worship set me free from the bondage of evil(spirit). My cry of help from the heart was not in vain.</p>
              <p>The God whom I worship knows what lies in the heart of men.</p>
              <p>The God whom I worship could change the hearts of men in an instant. Giving love of Jesus, changing anger and hate to love and changing the decision of men that was thought to be final</p>
              <p>The God whom I worship hears my silent prayer and could give me what I asked in an instant. He showed me the glory of Jesus and He moved the pillars of the earth just to answer you are my chosen. And He freed me from evil because I cried out to Him.</p>
              <p>The God whom I worship isn't bound by time. He knows what is going to happen to anyone or to any nation. He knows my future like it already happened.</p>
              <p>The God whom I worship makes plans before doing anything and executes them in detail. His plans are well thought of and even considerate to humans and that shows that  He cares and loves us.</p>
              <p>The God whom I worship could tell the secret of this life. Secret of life that no man could ever know by himself. Secrets that could not be revealed by our effort alone. He let me know because He wanted His people to know the truth and be wiser in life.</p>
              <p>God whom I worship could give [and take away] a sense of overwhelming peace that put a smile on your face every second of it and makes you heart so gentle.</p>

              <p>Hmm of course because God is a living God. A living God is a God who is alive and who is working.</p>
              <p>Besides you cannot possible hope for people from other religions to believe in Christ unless you give them your testimony. Bible is just for the believers to unbelievers it meant nothing because all the witnesses in the bible are all gone.</p>
              <p>For other believers it helps to strenghtened their faith to know that God is God.</p>
              <p>That's the same reason I like to read religious testimonial books. Imo they are the most important book to read. Of course there are many false testimonies. . .</p>
              <p>Frankly speaking even merely reading or hearing testimony may not be enough but seeing what you testify cannot be denied.</p>

              <p>Of course not. You think that God hates you.</p>
              <p>There are many successful grave sinners in the world. If God hated them they would have perished long time ago. <strong>We are too insignificant to be hated</strong> yet we are precious to Him to be loved and saved out of compassion. Because death will soon imprison us all. And God will have His day in the end.</p>

              <p>2. do you believe in Darwin's evolution theory?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. did the God you worship create dinosaurs as well?</p>

              <p>1. Because He is a compassionate and merciful God who wants everyone to enjoy life and not to perish. Because He is a Holy God.</p>
              <p>2. Darwin's evolution theory? Well for one it's just a theory and it stays that way. Whether it is true or not doesn't bother me at all. Because I know God is alive. God is real.</p>
              <p>3. Dinosaurs? Why would that be asked. God is the creator of all things. Everything whether alive or not, seen or unseen, comes from Him.</p>

              <p>Thank you for this thread, Miracles. I think it's sad that most people here are non-believers. I have seen God work miracles into people's lifes, mine included. I'm a fairly new Christian though, so I'll admit I don't know that much about God yet. What I do believe is that God is a wonderful and loving God, and right now my life isn't going all that great, but I pray every day that I will have the strength and faith to keep holding on even when things aren't that good, and I believe that my prayers are heard by God. :)</p>

              <p>Thank you for your kind words hunn. being a Christian is a long term process imo. When things are going from bad to worse to hopeless do not give up on your faith. When things are going well people rarely see any kind of miracles(if you want to call them that) but when things gets bad to worse people either started to cry to and search for God or abandon thier faith altogether. It's when things are bad or so bad that anyone could ever hope to see some sort of God's work in his life.</p>
              <p>Believing in Christ needs preserverance. God is not a far away God but God who lives among His people. He is inside you and inside the people you meet. You CAN make Him smile everyday. Jesus didn't lie when He said whatever you do to any of these smallest person you do it to me. So be careful the next time before you decide to sin against any of your fellow man.</p>
