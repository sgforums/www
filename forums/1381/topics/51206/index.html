            <div class='col-md body'>Freedom Through Restriction<br><br>2 Kings 15:19-38; 2 Chronicles 27; Isaiah 5, 6<br>"Having been freed from sin, you became slaves of righteousness. . . . Now having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you derive your benefit. . .the outcome, eternal life" (Romans 6:18, 22).<br><br>As the directors of a child care center watched the children playing outside, they noticed them staying quite close to the building, even though the yard itself was quite large. It was evident that the busy intersection and passing cars had frightened the children into huddling together in one spot.<br><br>One of the directors suggested putting up a fence, and the day after it was erected the children were seen playing happily all over the yard. The fence represented security and, consequently, freedom. Knowing their limits expanded the children's sense of freedom and their capacity to enjoy it.<br><br>If God's love did not provide fences in our lives, the result would be chaos, disorder, and unhappiness. God's restraints produce freedom, which brings satis faction and fulfillment.<br><br>What fences do you think God has provided for you in order to avoid unhappiness?<br><br>Job, during his predicament said, "He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass; and He has put darkness on my paths" (Job 91:8 ). But we read later in Job: "And the Lord restored the fortunes of Job when he prayed for his friends" (Job 42:10).<br><br>So, no matter what your situation is now, no matter how many "fences" you think there are in your way, trust the Lord to remove them at the right time.</div>

Our God is the same God who parted the Red Sea and fed 5,000 on a green hillside with only a couple of sardine sandwiches.

Then hang on!<br><br>Prayer:<br><br>Almighty and awesome God, do in our day what you did in past days. Give us faith to believe and then amaze us at the smallness of our faith. Give us vision to see your plan and do greater things. We ask this, not for ourselves or our experience, but for your glory and the salvation of our world. In Jesus name. Amen.</div>

It does not imply total isolation from all unbelievers and live in a world of ours. Holiness as our Lord Jesus demonstrated is to sit and dine with tax collectors and harlots but Himself remains changless. True holiness is contagious and is able to influence the people surrounding it.  Make it your prayer today to be set apart for God's holy service...you cannot cling on to the righteous robe of Christ and at the same time wallow in the filthy mud.....come out now.</div>

As much we enjoy to be called a child of God, we need to consider ourselves whether do we live like one? Like Father like son as often we hear is very applicable in this case. We need to imitate what our Abba Father say, do and think. We imitate God not in the same wickedness of Lucifer, but rather we follow His good examples and holiness because we belong to Him. A sacrifice in the Old Testament days are carefully selected, animals without blemish and whole. Every details of the sacrifice has to be perfect and looks good....when we say we offer to God our lives as a fragrant offering to God, are we in that condition of perfection? In our own ways its impossible, but with Jesus Christ we who are sinful and full of defects can be made whole and presented to Him in holiness and righteousness!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>James 1:21<br>Get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you.<br><br>Thoughts on today's verse<br><br>Isn't it true! When we find ourselves caught in the clutches of the moral filth of our culture, we find the word of God boring and irrelevant. Yet even in those moments when Satan uses sin to harden our hearts, God's Spirit calls us to change at a level deeper than just the mere understanding of the words of Scripture. Thank God for his Spirit, which can use his word like a surgeons scalpel on our hearts.<br><br>Prayer:<br><br>Holy God, I pledge to you today to willingly and decisively give up the immoral habits in my life. I recognize that these not only offend your holiness and grace, but also harden me to your will, pull me away from your character, and blunt my witness to others. Please forgive me and then sustain me as I seek to live a life wholly pleasing to you. In Jesus I pray. Amen.</div>

For us as believers, the action that most shows our love for Jesus is for us to be obedient to his words and his example.<br><br>Prayer:<br><br>Father, thank you for showing your love in Jesus.

            <div class='col-md body'>"Faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself" (James 2:17).<br><br>I heard a Christian teacher one time say that he wished the book of James had never been written. He felt the book emphasized works and not faith. I don't agree with his conclusion at all.<br><br>If you'll read James, you'll see that the point he was making is that if you are saved you have made Jesus the Lord of your life; therefore, you will have works in your life.<br><br>After saying that faith without works is useless, James uses the example of Abraham, who was "justified by works, when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar" (James 2:21). Abraham's faith "was working with his work, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected" (verse 22).<br><br>We are not saved by our works. The apostle Paul tells us in Ephesians 2:8-9 that we are saved by grace, through faith, and it is not a results of works.<br><br>Then in 2 Timothy 1:9 Paul says that the power of God has saved us and called us, "not acc ording to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was granted us in Christ Jesus."<br><br>I believe that James was saying that if we are saved, our lives will show it by our works. The works are evidence that the Holy Spirit is residing within us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One God<br><br>2 Kings 18:1-8; 2 Chronicles 29, 30, 31<br>"One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all" (Ephesians 4:5-6).<br><br>God is sovereign. He is the omnipotent (all powerful), omniscient (all wise), omnipresent (present everywhere at once) creator of all things and the absolute authority.<br><br>Sometimes we live our lives as if God were a genie in a bottle. We go about doing what we please until we need help. Then we uncork the bottle and ask the "genie" to come out and solve our problems. Then when things are running smoothly, we just put Him back into the bottle and put the cork back in.<br><br>Unfortunately, that's not the way it works. Our responsibility as followers of the sovereign God is to obey His instructions on a day-by-day basis, knowing that He will guide us.<br><br>"You will call, and the Lord will answer; . . . 'Here I am.' . . . The Lord will continually guide you" (Isaiah 58:9, 11).<br><br>The great joy we have is that God is also a loving, caring, comforting Father. All He wants is our fellowship with Him. He likes doing good things for us.<br><br>With our finite thinking, it is hard for us to grasp the immensity of a sovereign God. When we pass from this life into the next life, we will understand the sovereignty of God and His love, because He is waiting with open arms to welcome us.<br><br>How much fellowship with the Lord do you experience? What can you do to make it better?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He said, "Who are You, Lord?<br>Â—Acts 9:5<br><br>Through the miracle of redemption, Saul of Tarsus was instantly changed from a strong-willed and forceful Pharisee into a humble and devoted bondservant of the Lord Jesus.<br><br>There is nothing miraculous or mysterious about the things we can explain. We control what we are able to explain, consequently it is only natural to seek an explanation for everything. It is not natural to obey, yet it is not necessarily sinful to disobey. There can be no real disobedience, nor any moral virtue in obedience, unless a person recognizes the higher authority of the one giving the orders. If this recognition does not exist, even the one giving the orders may view the other personÂ’s disobedience as freedom. If one rules another by saying, "You must do this," and, "You will do that," he breaks the human spirit, making it unfit for God. A person is simply a slave for obeying, unless behind his obedience is the recognition of a holy God.<br><br>Many people begin coming to God once they stop being religious, because there is only one master of the human heartÂ—Jesus Christ, not religion. But "Woe is me" if after seeing Him I still will not obey ( Isaiah 6:5 , also see Isaiah 6:1 ). Jesus will never insist that I obey, but if I donÂ’t,I have already begun to sign the death certificate of the Son of God in my soul. When I stand face to face with Jesus Christ and say, "I will not obey," He will never insist. But when I do this, I am backing away from the recreating power of His redemption. It makes no difference to GodÂ’s grace what an abomination I am, if I will only come to the light. But "Woe is me" if I refuse the light (see John 3:19-21 ).<br></div>

Yet very few of us have ever experienced a defeat so complete and bitter as the one God's people faced when Isaiah shared this message of hope. The preservation of Israel to the time of Jesus, the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, the triumph of the Church through centuries of persecution and opposition are powerful reminders that underneath us are the everlasting arms of a mighty and loving God.<br><br>Prayer:<br>Almighty and Eternal Father, it is such sweet comfort to know that you are always there.

Little did he know that the shoe clerk, an antagonistic unbeliever, had been in his meeting the night before.<br><br>She recognized the evangelist and did everything she could to be rude to him, to see how he would react. She even insulted him, but he responded politely. He thought to himself, She must be having a rough day.<br><br>He bought a pair of shoes and that evening, when he started to put them on, he discovered that one was two sizes smaller than the other. He knew the ones he tried on were the same size, so he was sure she had switched the shoe deliberately.<br><br>When he returned to the store, the woman argued with him and was insulting , but again he was polite.<br><br>That evening when the evangelist gave the invitation, the first person down the aisle to accept Jesus was the shoe clerk. You see, his witness to her was not what he had said from the pulpit; it was said by his actions at the store.
