I think the answer to that question must be this: to stand is more important than to understand.<br><br>We said a few days ago that the psalmist took his stand at a very low level on the scale of spiritual values. The principle he followed was this: "If I spread my doubts, I will harm my brethren." I am sure you and I could think of much higher spiritual principles with which to confront ourselves when tempted. What about the principle of reminding ourselves of the blessings of God in times past? Or actually talking to ourselves in the way the psalmist did in Psalm 42:5: "Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God '" . The psalmist employed none of these, but the one he did employ, low as it was on the scale of spiritual values, worked. And that is the point - use everything you can to stop yourself from falling, however small or insignificant it might appear to be.<br><br>We are involved in spiritual mountaineering, where sometimes the slopes are like glass. When your feet slip you must reach out and hold on to anything that will stop you in your slide even though it be only a small branch. Stop and steady yourself.

Listen to what he says: "But when I considered how to understand this, it was too great an effort for me and too painful" (Psa. 73:16, Amplified Bible). It is clear that although he has stopped himself from falling, he is still in great anguish of heart and mind; he is still perplexed over the issue of why the ungodly are prospering while he, a child of God, has to face all kinds of difficulties. He cannot bear the thought of scandalising the family of God, and yet his confusion continues.<br><br>Have you ever been in this position in your spiritual life - saved from slipping and sliding but still harassed by a giant-sized spiritual problem? You know enough to stop you falling, but not enough to start you climbing. It is a strange position to be in but one, I must confess, in which I have found myself on many occasions. Perhaps you are there right now - your feet have stopped slipping, but strong emotions continue to rage inside you. This is a very critical position to be in - critical because the temptation at this point is to quieten the raging emotions within by settling for answers that are less than the real ones. I know many Christians who have been in this position, and because their goal has been to alleviate the pain in their heart rather than find the real solutions to their problem, they have grasped at superficial answers that do nothing more than provide temporary relief.<br><br><strong>For further study:</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=2+Peter+3%3A9&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=1pe&amp;NavGo=1&amp;NavCurrentChapter=1" rel="nofollow">2 Peter 3:9</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Job+13%3A1-16&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=2pe&amp;NavGo=3&amp;NavCurrentChapter=3" rel="nofollow">Job 13:1-16</a>;<br>1.

Why critical? Because, as we said, the desire to relieve the pain that is going on inside us can sometimes lead us to settle for answers that are less than the best. We feel better when we can make sense of the ways of God - even a little sense.<br><br>When we are confronted by a spiritual problem that appears to have no immediate resolution and causes strong emotions to rage within us, there are, as far as I can see, just two options: either to live with the troublesome emotions, as Job did, and wait patiently for God to give a clear answer, in His time; or to replace the confusion with some form of understanding. The first option is often difficult, for it demands something which, especially when we are confused, we find hard to do - trust. The second is a lot easier, but potentially more dangerous, for unless we are careful, it can lead us into accepting solutions that are not solutions. The pressure to move confidently in the midst of ambiguity and uncertainty and come up with "clear" answers is a strong one. But we must be careful that we dont settle for an answer that, although it helps to reduce the level of confusion, is not a real solution. Better to stay with the pain of confusion and uncertainty than to grasp at answers that are not answers because they evade the real problem.<br><br><strong>For further study:</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Proverbs+3%3A1-6&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=job&amp;NavGo=13&amp;NavCurrentChapter=13" rel="nofollow">Proverbs 3:1-6</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Psalms+37%3A5&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=pr&amp;NavGo=3&amp;NavCurrentChapter=3" rel="nofollow">Psalms 37:5</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Isaiah+26%3A4&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=ps&amp;NavGo=37&amp;NavCurrentChapter=37" rel="nofollow">Isaiah 26:4</a>;<br>1.

(v.32)</span><br><br>You have probably sensed that the issue we have been dealing with is extremely important. In fact, I know of nothing of greater consequence for the Christian Church than the need to resolve the issue of why it is, when facing the tough questions of life, we settle for answers that are not answers.<br><br>Let me illustrate what I mean. Many years ago a woman approached me at the end of a prayer meeting and said: "Why is it that I cry so much over nothing?" I replied that there could be a number of reasons and I recommended that if this situation continued she should seek the help of a Christian counsellor. My own feeling was that the problem arose from some unresolved conflicts in her life that needed identifying. Some time later I met the woman again and she said to me: "I still have the problem, but I know now why it happens to me - it is an attack of the devil." I felt deeply saddened by her conclusion for I sensed that she had settled for an answer that helped to reduce her confusion but was not a real solution. Yes, the devil does attack and harass, but in my opinion something else was going on inside her which needed attention. I gently suggested this to her, but she was adamant that the devil was responsible and that the problem would eventually go. I prayed much for that woman because I saw in her what I see in many parts of the Christian Church - a tendency to reach out and settle for "answers" that help reduce the confusion but do nothing to stimulate spiritual growth and understanding.<br><br><strong>For further study:</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Psalms+51%3A1-6&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=joh&amp;NavGo=8&amp;NavCurrentChapter=8" rel="nofollow">Psalms 51:1-6</a>;<br>1.

(v.27)</span><br><br>There is a price to pay for our desire to grab at easy answers and that price is "trivialisation". Trivialisation is the acceptance of explanations that ignore the difficult questions of life in order to experience relief from confusion. I have no hesitation in saying that this is a curse of the modern Church.<br><br>One way trivialisation reveals itself is in the acceptance, by so many, of the view that the major cause of Christians' problems is demonic activity. Demonic activity can be a cause of problems (especially in those who have dabbled in the occult) but it is not the chief cause. The New Testament teaches us the importance of spiritual warfare, but it has much more to say about the influence of our carnal nature on the rise and development of problems.<br><br>In the early days of my ministry, when people came to me with problems I would frequently engage in the practice of rebuking the devil, and those prayers often brought great relief. But the mistake I made was not to sit down with the people who came to me and deal with the beneath-the-surface problems which had given Satan a foothold in their lives. By making it appear that Satan was the only problem I trivialised the issue. It's a lot easier (and less confusing) to sit down with a person and "take authority" over Satan than it is to think through together the tough and perplexing issues that lie beneath the surface, and then work towards giving some Biblical perspectives. But that is demanded of us if we are to help each other towards maturity.<br><br><strong>For further study:</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Hebrews+5%3A14&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=eph&amp;NavGo=4&amp;NavCurrentChapter=4" rel="nofollow">Hebrews 5:14</a>;<br>1.

This, we said, is a very critical time - critical because it makes us inclined to accept easy answers. The perplexity did not end when the psalmist stopped himself from slipping. His thoughts still went around in circles and he continued to have great anguish of heart and mind.<br><br>How, then, were his thoughts concerning the prosperity of the ungodly resolved? Not by grabbing at superficial answers, but by going into the sanctuary of God, where he could begin to see the whole situation from God's point of view. Listen to how he puts it: "When I tried to understand all this, it was oppressive to me till I entered the sanctuary of God; then I understood their final destiny"(Psa. 73:16-17). The word "sanctuary" here literally means the physical house of God. Some translations use the phrase, "till I entered the secret of God", but that is incorrect. Read Psalm 74 and read Psalm 76 and you will find that they both refer to the material building where God was worshipped. Had the psalmist, I wonder, like so many of us when we are filled with doubt and uncertainty, stayed away from the sanctuary of God? How strange that the last thing we want to do when our hearts are filled with doubts and misunderstandings is meet with our fellow believers in the house of God.

The psalmist has been prevented from falling by considering the consequences of his actions upon his brethren, so now his next step is to go and meet with them in the sanctuary. Whether it be in a cathedral or a cottage, how wonderful it is to join with Christian brothers and sisters. It is not so much the place that is important as the redeeming and healing fellowship we find there. Oftentimes people find release just by sitting down among their brothers and sisters and feeling the healing power of their warmth and love.<br><br>One famous preacher said: "The house of God has delivered me from 'the mumps and measles of the soul' a thousand times and more - merely by entering its doors." What is it about being among our fellow believers that is so helpful and encouraging? One thing is the very fact that our fellow believers are there. You see, in our private misery and perplexity we could easily run away with the idea that there is nothing very much in the Christian faith after all, and that it is not worth our going on. But when we enter into the Lord's house and see our fellow believers coming together, often our doubts disappear. We say to ourselves, albeit unconsciously: "Here are people who think the Christian life is worth continuing with. My uncertainties must be wrong - there must be something in it after all."<br><br><strong>For further study:</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Acts+12%3A12-17&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=heb&amp;NavGo=10&amp;NavCurrentChapter=10" rel="nofollow">Acts 12:12-17</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Psalms+84%3A10&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=ac&amp;NavGo=12&amp;NavCurrentChapter=12" rel="nofollow">Psalms 84:10</a>;<br>1.What was the pattern of the early Church?<br>2.

Some commentators say he is referring here to the time when his flesh will decay through old age, while others say he was experiencing some physical problems at that very time. Both may be right. When he looks into the future he knows a time will come when he will be an old man when his heart and flesh will fail. He will be unable to look after himself but it will still be all right, says this man, "For whatever may happen, God will still be the strength of my heart."<br><br>A commentator who feels the psalmist's words have a direct bearing on his physical condition at that time says this: "You cannot pass through a spiritual experience such as this man passed through without your physical body suffering. His nerves would be in a bad state and his heart would have been affected by the strain. Nevertheless he still affirms that God is his strength." It is generally agreed that the word which is translated "strength" is the word for "rock", and so the verse may justifiably be translated: "God is the rock of my heart and my portion for ever." What a thrilling thought this is - God is my Rock. As one Welsh preacher put it: "There are many occasions when I tremble as I stand upon the Rock, but there are never any occasions when the Rock trembles under me."<br><br><strong>For further study:</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Isaiah+40%3A21-31&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=ps&amp;NavGo=28&amp;NavCurrentChapter=28" rel="nofollow">Isaiah 40:21-31</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Ephesians+3%3A16-17&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=isa&amp;NavGo=40&amp;NavCurrentChapter=40" rel="nofollow">Ephesians 3:16-17</a>;<br>1.

Listen to them once again: "Those who are far from you will perish; you destroy all who are unfaithful to you. But as for me, it is good to be near God. I have made the Sovereign Lord my refuge; I will tell of all your deeds" (vv.27-28 ).<br><br>The psalmist has finished his review of the past and is now hammering out a philosophy with which to face the future. He is resolved that no matter what anyone else may do, he is going to live in close companionship with God. He helps us to see the importance of this resolution by putting it in the form of a contrast: "Those who are far from you will perish ' but as for me, it is good to be near God." Really, when it comes down to it, there are only two positions in life - close to God or far away from Him.<br><br>I wonder, as the psalmist penned these words was something like this going through his mind: "What caused me so much trouble in recent days and accounted for all my difficulties was the fact that I did not keep close to God. I erroneously believed that the cause of my problems was the prosperity of the ungodly, but having entered into the sanctuary of God I see that this was not the cause of my problems at all. My problems came because I had chosen not to remain close to Him. For me there is now only one thing that matters - staying close to God."<br><br>How are things with you at this moment? Do you feel close to God?

The person who keeps close to God is the one who is always talking to God. Many definitions of prayer have been given; I add another: prayer is co-operation with God. In prayer you align your desires, your will, your life to God. You and God become agreed on life desires, life purposes, life plans, and you work them out together. Secondly, we do it by constant study of the Scriptures. God's Word is alive with meaning, and when you read it something will happen to you, for "the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword" (Heb.4:12, NKJ). Expect it to speak to you - and it will. Faith is expectancy: "According to your faith will it be done to you" (Matt. 9:29).<br><br>Remember also to surrender to the truth that is revealed: "If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know '" (John 7:17, NKJ). In a moral universe the key to knowledge is moral response. The moment we cease to obey, that moment the revelation ceases to reveal. We do it, thirdly, by sharing with others. Remember, nothing is ours if we do not share it. When we share, the things go deeper inside us. We must share what God is doing, both with our fellow Christians and with non-Christians also. The psalmist's last words are these: "I will tell of all your deeds." We take and we tell - we take and we tell; these, we must never forget, are the two heartbeats of the Christian experience.<br><br><strong>For further study:</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Jeremiah+20%3A1-9&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=joh&amp;NavGo=20&amp;NavCurrentChapter=20" rel="nofollow">Jeremiah 20:1-9</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Psalms+66%3A16&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=jer&amp;NavGo=20&amp;NavCurrentChapter=20" rel="nofollow">Psalms 66:16</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Isaiah+63%3A7&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=ps&amp;NavGo=66&amp;NavCurrentChapter=66" rel="nofollow">Isaiah 63:7</a>;<br>1.

In all my years of writing, never can I remember being so personally blessed. The truth this psalm conveys has gripped my own heart and life in a most unusual way.<br><br>Let's remind ourselves of what the psalmist has taught us. Life is filled with many painful and perplexing problems which at times cause us to cry out: "Lord, why don't You intervene?" Yet just as our feet are about to slide, something always comes to us - an idea or a thought, which, if we hold on to it, serves to halt our downward progress. We discover that when we act responsibly and do what is right, even though we do not feel like it, we put ourselves in the way of experiencing inward change. But it is not God's purpose to bring about only a little change - He desires to bring about a lot of change.<br><br>How does He achieve this? He does it by bringing us into His presence and revealing to us His Word. There we discover that our greatest problems are not the ones that are outside us but the ones that are inside us - our perspectives are wrong. Real change comes about not when our feelings are soothed but when our thinking is changed. Changed thinking leads to changed desires. When our perspectives are controlled by the Word rather than by the world, then we will experience inner peace. The psalmist resolved to draw near to God and stay close to Him so that he could "see life steadily, and see it whole". Let's make that our resolution too.<br><br><strong>For further study:</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Psalms+57%3A1-7&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=ps&amp;NavGo=73&amp;NavCurrentChapter=73" rel="nofollow">Psalms 57:1-7</a>;<br>1.

What was true of the Virgin Mary in the history of the Son of God's birth on earth is true of every saint. God's Son is born into me through the direct act of God; then I as His child must exercise the right of a child the right of always being face to face with my Father through prayer. Do I find myself continually saying in amazement to the commonsense part of my life, "Why did you want me to turn here or to go over there? Did you not know that I must be about My Father's business?" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Luke+2:49" rel="nofollow">Luke 2:49</a> ). Whatever our circumstances may be, that holy, innocent, and eternal Child must be in contact with His Father.<br><br>Am I simple enough to identify myself with my Lord in this way? Is He having His wonderful way with me? Is God's will being fulfilled in that His Son has been formed in me (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Galatians+4:19" rel="nofollow">Galatians 4:19</a> ), or have I carefully pushed Him to one side? Oh, the noisy outcry of today! Why does everyone seem to be crying out so loudly? People today are crying out for the Son of God to be put to death. There is no room here for God's Son right now, no room for quiet, holy fellowship and oneness with the Father.<br><br>Is the Son of God praying in me, bringing honor to the Father, or am I dictating my demands to Him? Is He ministering in me as He did in the time of His manhood here on earth? Is God's Son in me going through His passion, suffering so that His own purposes might be fulfilled? The more a person knows of the inner life of God's most mature saints, the more he sees what God's purpose really is: to ". . . fill up in my flesh what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Colossians+1:24" rel="nofollow">Colossians 1:24</a> ).

A saint does not think clearly until a long time passes, but a saint ought to see clearly without any difficulty. You cannot think through spiritual confusion to make things clear; to make things clear, you must obey. In intellectual matters you can think things out, but in spiritual matters you will only think yourself into further wandering thoughts and more confusion. If there is something in your life upon which God has put His pressure, then obey Him in that matter. Bring all your "arguments and . . . every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ" regarding the matter, and everything will become as clear as daylight to you ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=2+Corinthians+10:5" rel="nofollow">2 Corinthians 10:5</a> ). Your reasoning capacity will come later, but reasoning is not how we see. We see like children, and when we try to be wise we see nothing (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matthew+11:25" rel="nofollow">Matthew 11:25</a> ).<br><br>Even the very smallest thing that we allow in our lives that is not under the control of the Holy Spirit is completely sufficient to account for spiritual confusion, and spending all of our time thinking about it will still never make it clear. Spiritual confusion can only be conquered through obedience. As soon as we obey, we have discernment. This is humiliating, because when we are confused we know that the reason lies in the state of our mind. But when our natural power of sight is devoted and submitted in obedience to the Holy Spirit, it becomes the very power by which we perceive God's will, and our entire life is kept in simplicity.</div>

Such a man will not be required to wait for the rest of the church to come alive. He will not be penalized for the failures of his fellow Christians, nor be asked to forego the blessing till his sleepy brethren catch up. God deals with the individual heart as exclusively as if only one existed.... Every prophet, every reformer, every revivalist had to meet God alone before he could help the multitudes.

Then He gives us a tremendous, riveting pain to fasten our attention on something that we never even dreamed could be His call for us. And for one radiant, flashing moment we see His purpose, and we say, "Here am I! Send me" ( Isaiah 6:8 ).<br><br>This call has nothing to do with personal sanctification, but with being made broken bread and poured-out wine. Yet God can never make us into wine if we object to the fingers He chooses to use to crush us. We say, "If God would only use His own fingers, and make me broken bread and poured-out wine in a special way, then I wouldn't object!" But when He uses someone we dislike, or some set of circumstances to which we said we would never submit, to crush us, then we object. Yet we must never try to choose the place of our own martyrdom. If we are ever going to be made into wine, we will have to be crushed; you cannot drink grapes. Grapes become wine only when they have been squeezed.<br><br>I wonder what finger and thumb God has been using to squeeze you? Have you been as hard as a marble and escaped? If you are not ripe yet, and if God had squeezed you anyway, the wine produced would have been remarkably bitter. To be a holy person means that the elements of our natural life experience the very presence of God as they are providentially broken in His service. We have to be placed into God and brought into agreement with Him before we can be broken bread in His hands. Stay right with God and let Him do as He likes, and you will find that He is producing the kind of bread and wine that will benefit His other children.</div>

It is simply this-- I have a heredity in which I had no say or decision; I am not holy, nor am I likely to be; and if all Jesus Christ can do is tell me that I must be holy, His teaching only causes me to despair. But if Jesus Christ is truly a regenerator, someone who can put His own heredity of holiness into me, then I can begin to see what He means when He says that I have to be holy. Redemption means that Jesus Christ can put into anyone the hereditary nature that was in Himself, and all the standards He gives us are based on that nature-- <span style="font-style: italic;">His teaching is meant to be applied to the life which He puts within us</span>. The proper action on my part is simply to agree with God's verdict on sin as judged on the Cross of Christ.<br><br>The New Testament teaching about regeneration is that when a person is hit by his own sense of need, God will put the Holy Spirit into his spirit, and his personal spirit will be energized by the Spirit of the Son of God-- ". . . until Christ is formed in you" ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Galatians+4:19" rel="nofollow">Galatians 4:19</a> ). The moral miracle of redemption is that God can put a new nature into me through which I can live a totally new life. When I finally reach the edge of my need and know my own limitations, then Jesus says, "Blessed are you . . ." ( <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Matthew+5:11" rel="nofollow">Matthew 5:11</a> ). But I must get to that point. God cannot put into me, the responsible moral person that I am, the nature that was in Jesus Christ unless I am aware of my need for it.<br><br>Just as the nature of sin entered into the human race through one man, the Holy Spirit entered into the human race through another Man (see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Romans+5:12-19" rel="nofollow">Romans 5:12-19</a> ). And redemption means that I can be delivered from the heredity of sin, and that through Jesus Christ I can receive a pure and spotless heredity, namely, the Holy Spirit.</div>

Actually, he did not just wonder, but he got wrapped up with that goal "to see the end". The Holy Spirit recorded his story for our benefit.<br><br>His loving Master was arrested. Under the instant shock and grief, his focus shifted away from Jesus to "see the end". The moment Peter closed his eyes of faith, he forgot the "end" that Jesus already prophesied: Jesus must die and then triumphantly rise from the dead and conquer death. Secondly, He was subdued to the burden of what the world calls "reality". Consequently, Peter became easy prey for the spirit of fear. Afraid of being identified with Jesus, he detached himself from Him, following Him "at a distance". The next thing he knew, "he sat with the servants" and feared their comments. What a change! Just several minutes prior, he had been sitting with the King of Kings. Verse 75, records the outcome: Peter disowned his Master.<br><br>Happily enough, that was not the end of the story. It was not only that Peter repented; most importantly, it was because Jesus had established the end early on, even before the betrayal, when He proclaimed, "And I tell you that you are Peter and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it." (Matthew 16:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Jesus revived that promise in Peter's heart, at his weakest moment, to save him and affirm the "plan of peace and prosper" He had promised.<br><br>Friend, if your eyes are peering at current situations or wrapped up in goals that drift you away from God, it is time to get your eyes back on Jesus. When you do, He will make sure to "see the end" of all your life affairs. "He is faithful in all he does" (Psalm 33:4) He has established and sealed by His Blood a wonderful plan for your life and even "the gates of Hades will not overcome it". Take Jesus' promise in (Matthew 16:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> to be the answer to every "What is the end?" question you may have... and rejoice!</div>
