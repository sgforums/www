(v. 10)</span><br><br>In the quiet time the soul is stilled so that it concentrates on God, and it is through this concentration that the spiritual life is deepened. The great French Christian Blaise Pascal once declared that "nearly all the ills of life spring from this simple source, that we are unable to sit still for long in a quiet room." In this modern age people seem to find it difficult to sit quietly for long. They must have a radio blaring or something else to drown the silence. Sitting still can be therapeutic, but what if in the stillness we meet with God? We then receive spiritual therapy. God waits to offer us infinite resources -- for the asking and the taking.<br><br>The quiet time is where the soul grows receptive, where prayer becomes, as a poet put it, "the organ of spiritual touch," where the touch becomes, as effective and as healing as the touch of the woman on the hem of Jesus' garment, where peace flows into our turbulence, where love absorbs our resentments, where joy heals our griefs, and where we enter into the process of being known. The quiet time shuts us in with God, the door closes upon us, and then infinite resources flood into our soul. The door opens and we move out, with an increased awareness of God, ready to face a world that knows so little about Him. There is, as we have said, great benefit in stillness, but when we meet with God in the stillness -- ah, what then?<br><br><strong>For Further Study</strong><br><a href="http://=http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NKJV&amp;passage=Ps.+33%3A17--22" rel="nofollow">Ps. 33:17--22</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NKJV&amp;passage=Ps.+62%3A1--2" rel="nofollow">62:1--2</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NKJV&amp;passage=Ps.+130%3A5--6" rel="nofollow">130:5--6</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NKJV&amp;passage=Ps.+40%3A1" rel="nofollow">40:1</a><br>1.

(v. 7)</span><br><br>We consider now another matter that is essential if we are to go deeper with God -- confidence in His character. Is God good and can He be trusted? The manner in which we answer this question is crucial to our ongoing relationship with Him. If we have doubts about His character -- His justice for example -- it will most certainly affect the way we view Him and approach Him.<br><br>You may have heard the story of the farmer whose one and only tractor failed. So he decided to walk across the fields to a neighboring farmer whom he knew had three. As he strode to the neighbor's farmhouse, he reflected on what he knew about his fellow farmer. He remembered that he never appeared at any of the village's social events, and he had heard somewhere that he had a reputation as a skinflint. More negative thoughts about the farmer entered his head, but by this time he found himself at the door of the farmhouse. The farmer, who had seen him coming across the fields, appeared at the doorway and asked: "What's the problem?" "I've come to tell you," said the man, "that you can keep your jolly old tractor!"<br><br>Many do not realize how profoundly the way we think about God and His, character influences the way we worship Him, the way we work for Him, and the way we witness to Him. Any doubts about the goodness of God will result in our souls keeping their distance from Him. If we do not have complete confidence in Him, we will not desire a close relationship with Him.<br><br><strong>For Further Study</strong><br><a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NKJV&amp;passage=Neh.+9%3A19--25" rel="nofollow">Neh. 9:19--25</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NKJV&amp;passage=Ps.+23%3A6" rel="nofollow">Ps. 23:6</a><br>1.

(v. 1)</span><br><br>We continue discussing the point that unless we have a strong conviction that God is entirely trustworthy, we will not desire a deep and ongoing relationship with Him.<br><br>Yesterday we spoke of the distance from God our souls experience when we entertain doubts about His goodness. Do you realize that the reason for the distance between God and the first human couple in the Garden of Eden was doubt about God's goodness? Doubt about God soon leads to dislike of God, and dislike of God soon leads to disobedience. When Eve responded to the Tempter's insinuation that God did not have her best interests at heart (by withholding something from her), the doubt she entertained soon led to dislike of God, and then it was relatively easy to take the next step and disobey Him. The moment her doubt about God's goodness expressed itself in taking the forbidden fruit, the foundation on which her relationship with God was established -- trust -- crumbled beneath her feet. Adam rapidly followed her in committing the same kind of sin (doubt about God's goodness) and then, inevitably, distance replaced closeness. Since the Fall, every child born into this world has within its nature a basic distrust of God.<br><br>Paul puts it like this: "The sinful mind is hostile to God" (<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NKJV&amp;passage=Rom.+8%3A7" rel="nofollow">Rom. 8:7</a>). The word hostility can be translated "enmity." No one trusts someone they regard as an enemy. Distance between humankind and God arose when the first human couple doubted His goodness. Closeness between human beings and God comes when we have confidence in His goodness. As we said yesterday, no confidence -- no relationship.<br><br><strong>For Further Study</strong><br><a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NKJV&amp;passage=Ps.+145%3A1--13" rel="nofollow">Ps. 145:1--13</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NKJV&amp;passage=ps+31%3A19" rel="nofollow">31:19</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NKJV&amp;passage=ps+16%3A2" rel="nofollow">16:2</a><br>1.

(v. 26)<br><br>"The biggest problem we face in the Christian life," said Dr. Cynddylan Jones, a famous Welsh preacher, "is distance." He continued: "The only way that distance can be overcome is by having the perspective of Job who said: 'Though He slay me yet will I trust Him.'"<br><br>When I talk to counselors in training I tell them that what they should be listening for as a counselee tells his or her story is distance. That's what underlies most problems that bring people into counseling. This does not mean we should ignore or make light of the surface problems with which people may be struggling. But the plain fact is this -- when we are close to God and have a deep and intimate relationship with Him, we may feel downcast but not destroyed. Therefore, every Christian counselor's ultimate goal should be to close any distance there may be between the person and God, and to develop spiritual oneness. Counseling is not effective or complete until this is accomplished.<br><br>How does distance come between ourselves and God? There are many causes -- bitterness and resentment against another, persistent sin, failure to establish a devotional life -- but largely it arises through a lack of trust. If you cut your way through the maze of human problems that's what you find -- an inability to trust. That's what happened in the Garden of Eden, and that's what happens in our personal Garden of Eden also. To try to develop a close relationship with God and fail to deal with this most basic issue is about as effective as building a skyscraper on an acre of sand.<br><br><strong>For Further Study</strong><br><a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NKJV&amp;passage=James+4%3A7--11" rel="nofollow">James 4:7--11</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NKJV&amp;passage=Prov.+3%3A5--6" rel="nofollow">Prov. 3:5--6</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NKJV&amp;passage=Prov.+29%3A25" rel="nofollow">29:25</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NKJV&amp;passage=Heb.+10%3A22" rel="nofollow">Heb. 10:22</a><br>1.

Scott Peck opens his book The Road Less Travelled with these words: "Life is difficult. This is a great truth because once we truly see this truth, we transcend it."<br><br>I have great difficulty with some of Dr. Scott Peck's statements, but I fully endorse these remarks. Once we accept the fact that life is difficult -- that the mystery of why calamities and suffering occur will never be fully solved while we are here on earth -- then we will stop demanding that a satisfactory answer be found and begin to get on with life. Christians go down different routes regarding this matter of calamities and suffering. One is to close their eyes and pretend the tremendous problems are not there. But integrity requires that we face whatever is true.<br><br>Reality is grim -- innocent children are abused, starved, massacred -- and countless other forms of atrocity are carried out around the world daily. We must not blind our eyes to these facts and pretend they are untrue because they appear to contradict the concept of God's goodness. Pretense must never be our refuge. We must be willing to look at these things, unpleasant and horrible though they be, and allow ourselves to be jarred by them.

(v. 5)</span><br><br>The Book of Job records the story of a godly man who underwent some of the most bitter experiences it is possible to meet with in this life. At first Job says very little about his difficulties, but later in the book he begins to face the reality of what has happened to him and declares that if he could have an interview with God he would tell Him exactly what he thought of Him (<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NKJV&amp;passage=Job+23%3A1--17" rel="nofollow">Job 23:1--17</a>). It was when he faced his hardships, recognized how he really felt and admitted it that God came to him and answered him (<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NKJV&amp;passage=Job+38%3A1--41%3A34" rel="nofollow">Job 38:1--41:34</a>).<br><br>We must never be afraid of admitting that what we see around us doesn't match up with what we know about the character of God. To blind our eyes to the realities of life for fear that what we observe might turn us against God is utterly foolish. We must face difficult issues, for it is only when we do so that we are ready to hear God speak. If we refuse to face reality, then our souls are not alert to hear His voice. We fear that we might hear something to make us even more uncertain of God, and thus prefer to take refuge in illusion. When Job faced the reality of his situation and how he really felt, then he was ready for God to speak. But notice God didn't give any answers to Job's questions. He gave Himself. Job had an encounter with God that more than satisfied him. He could live without answers when he knew that God was there.<br><br><strong>For Further Study</strong><br><a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NKJV&amp;passage=Isa.+40%3A1--31" rel="nofollow">Isa. 40:1--31</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NKJV&amp;passage=Ps.+89%3A6" rel="nofollow">Ps. 89:6</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NKJV&amp;passage=1+Chron.+17%3A20" rel="nofollow">1 Chron. 17:20</a><br>1.

(v. 15)</span><br><br>Oswald Chambers said: "Life is more tragic than orderly." Chambers knew that unless Christians are willing to grapple with this truth and accept it, they will be plagued by inner oughts and shoulds that lead them down the road of illusion. They will find themselves saying, "It ought not to be like this" or "Things should be different" -- and the only thing this kind of demandingness produces is frustration and anger.<br><br>The Fall has turned this fair universe of God's into a shambles, and though much about the world is still beautiful, accidents, calamities, and suffering prevail. And these will continue until the time when God brings all things to a conclusion. There is nothing wrong with wishing that things were not so, but when we demand that they be different, when we say the effects of the Fall must be reversed and reversed now, we will end up feeling terribly frustrated. Life is difficult, as Scott Peck stated, and though prayer does move God to work supernaturally in some situations, life will go on being more "tragic than orderly" until Christ returns and finalizes His plans for this fallen planet.<br><br>This is reality -- and the sooner we face it the better. True faith is not built upon illusion but upon reality. We may not like things the way they are in this world, but to avoid facing them because they don't match up with what we know about God is foolish.

"You didn't pray in faith," replied the student. That's the kind of glib answer many people would give to that question. Such people can't sit quietly in the presence of mystery and say: "I don't understand why this is so but nevertheless I still believe God is good." They must have some kind of answer that they can hold on to because when they have no answers they have no faith.<br><br>Faith is Job saying: "Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him." Anyone can believe when there are explanations and answers. The person who goes on to know God in a deep and intimate way is the one who can affirm that God is good even though there may be a thousand appearances to the contrary. Pray for me and I will pray for you that together we might come to the place of trusting God even when we cannot trace Him.<br><br><strong>For Further Study</strong><br><a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NKJV&amp;passage=Dan.+3%3A13--30" rel="nofollow">Dan. 3:13--30</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NKJV&amp;passage=Hab.+3%3A16--18" rel="nofollow">Hab. 3:16--18</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NKJV&amp;passage=Ps.+46%3A2" rel="nofollow">Ps. 46:2</a><br>1.

If this is so then I would like to make a further suggestion: the answer to the mystery of Christ is to be found in His sacrificial spirit, the supreme evidence of which is the cross.<br><br>We will never in our mortal state be able to grasp the full meaning of the cross. But what we do grasp gives us a clue to what lies in the heart of the Infinite. Theologians often discuss the various theories of the atonement. Personally, I find myself accepting any theory of the atonement that makes the meaning of the cross more vital and clear. No theory seems to me big enough to fit the facts. As Jesus broke the bars of the tomb and stepped out beyond them, so the fact of Jesus dying seems to transcend our most careful statements or form of words.<br><br>To really understand the cross one must have an attitude of mind and heart that responds to its meaning. I came across this: "To understand art one must have art within one; to understand music one must have music within one." I thought to myself, to understand the cross one must have a sacrificial spirit within one. Those who profess to know Christ but live only for self will know something of the cross but will miss its real meaning. The cross is best understood not by an argument but by an attitude.<br><br><strong>For further study:</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=John+15%3A13&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=ro&amp;NavGo=5&amp;NavCurrentChapter=5" rel="nofollow">John 15:13</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Galatians+1%3A4&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=joh&amp;NavGo=15&amp;NavCurrentChapter=15" rel="nofollow">Galatians 1:4</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Ephesians+5%3A2&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=ga&amp;NavGo=1&amp;NavCurrentChapter=1" rel="nofollow">Ephesians 5:2</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=1+Peter+2%3A24&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=eph&amp;NavGo=5&amp;NavCurrentChapter=5" rel="nofollow">1 Peter 2:24</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Titus+2%3A1-14&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=1pe&amp;NavGo=2&amp;NavCurrentChapter=2" rel="nofollow">Titus 2:1-14</a>;<br>1.

Herbert Spencer in Natural Law in the Spiritual World defines physical life as "inward correspondence with outward environment." When we take in food, air and water, we live. When we don't, we die. There must be a response to our environment. But there is also a spiritual environment to which we must respond, and when we are in correspondence with God we live spiritually.<br><br>The facts of life fairly faced proclaim with heart-breaking obviousness that human beings are out of touch with their spiritual environment. To be out of touch with God means, inevitably, that we will be out of touch with ourselves and with others. But the history of humanity is, as one historian put it, "one long search for God." We stand beside our altars, we breathe our prayers, we make our vows, we repeat our ceremonies, we crave with inexpressible yearnings of the inmost heart, we long for fellowship with God. Yet something dark, dreadful, and sinister stands between us and God. We realize God is pure, and because we are conscious of our impurity we hardly dare ask for fellowship with Him. We are separated and guilty.<br><br>The object of all religions is to bring those who long for fellowship with God into correspondence with Him. But how is that achieved? Christianity says it can be done only through the cross. Other religions point to other ways, and claim their way is as valid as the Christian way.

The clanging can intensified Maggie's terror, and she tried frantically to outrun it. But the faster Maggie ran, the louder the garbage can clanged and banged from driveway to sidewalk to street.

Its ritual may be beautiful, its sanctions may be ancient, its precepts may be good, but if it fails to bring men and women into correspondence with God it fails vitally and irretrievably. All else is useless, for if the problem of evil is ignored or passed over, we are like the person who dreams about and plans next year's happiness while an incurable disease is eating at his vitals.<br><br>The wonderful distinctive of Christianity is this - Jesus Christ has done something about the problem of being out of correspondence with God. He puts the hand of a penitent sinner into the hand of a pardoning God. Because of the nature of the problem - the problem of evil - no other solution is possible. Salvation is a task which only God could engineer. As one theologian puts it: "It is a task worthy of God."<br><br>The ancient Greek playwrights used to warn their students that when writing a tragedy they should not bring a god onto the stage unless there was an entanglement worthy of a god. The presence of evil in this world, I suggest, presents an entanglement worthy of God. But it is no mere stage affair. It is a tragic fact. To deliver men and women from evil was a problem that challenged God's power and made the deepest claim upon His love. The cross is the answer.

Cicero, a Roman philosopher, said of crucifixion: "Far be the very name of a cross not only from the bodies of Roman citizens, but from their imaginations, eyes and ears." But He, our Lord, though sinless, was crucified on a cross. Although His blood was flowing freely from wounds inflicted by the crown of thorns on His head, from His back that had been lacerated by cruel thongs, from His hands and feet through which He was skewered to the tree, yet He refused the deadening drug offered Him. He underwent the ordeal with brain unclouded and with nerves unsoothed. The crowd who watched Him cried: "He saved others, but he can't save himself!" But strange as it seems, that mocking phrase became the central truth of the gospel. He was saving others and therefore He could not save Himself. That is one of the greatest truths of life - if we are to save others we cannot save ourselves.<br><br>To quote Spencer again: "It is a great mystery," he says, "yet an everlasting fact, that goodness in all moral natures has the doom of bleeding upon it, allowing it to conquer only as it bleeds. All goodness conquers by a cross." This law of saving by self-giving runs through life. Those who save themselves cannot save others, and those who save others cannot save themselves - cannot save themselves trouble, sorrow, hurts, disappointments, pain, and sometimes even death. This is a law of the universe, and it applies to God as much as it does to us.<br><br>For further study:<br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Galatians+1%3A1-5&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=mt&amp;NavGo=27&amp;NavCurrentChapter=27" rel="nofollow">Galatians 1:1-5</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=1+Timothy+2%3A6&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=ga&amp;NavGo=1&amp;NavCurrentChapter=1" rel="nofollow">1 Timothy 2:6</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Titus+2%3A14&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=1ti&amp;NavGo=2&amp;NavCurrentChapter=2" rel="nofollow">Titus 2:14</a>;<br>1.

(Ps. 94:9). And Browning said: "He that created love, shall He not love?" We might add: "He that created sacrificial love, shall He not sacrifice"? The old Chinese scholar was right who, after listening for the first time to a missionary telling the story of the loving sacrifice of God through His Son on the cross, turned to one of his pupils and said: "Didnt I tell you there ought to be a God like that?"<br><br>The leaders of the world's religions stumble over this. A leading Muslim said recently during a television debate: "A God who would stoop and suffer is not perfect." And a Hindu commented: "If Brahman would suffer He would be unhappy, and if He were unhappy He would be imperfect, and if He were imperfect He would not be God."<br><br>The cross spells out the message that God is prepared to take into Himself the suffering caused by sin and, indeed, to take on Himself the very sins of the ones He created. No other religion can conceive of such a thing. The cross raised on Calvary is but a reflection of an inner cross lying in the heart of God. Through it we see that at the center of the universe is redeeming love. No greater discovery could be made or will be made than that - in earth or in heaven.

When the child becomes ill, a loving mother forgets herself and spends her strength to give everything she has to the child.<br><br>The spirit of self-giving is the most beautiful thing in life. Through it life rises to the highest level. "The extent of the elevation of an animal and of course any free moral agent," said Pascal, the great French Christian and philosopher, "can be infallibly measured"by the degree to which sacrificial love for others controls that being." Here is a law by which life may be evaluated and judged. When the sacrificial spirit is absent from life, that life is of the lowest kind; where it is perfectly embodied, that life is highest on the scale of being. Is this law to be found in God also? I believe it is. If this law holds true on earth but is reversed in relation to God, then laws are meaningless and the universe is without a Head. Then the highest in mankind would be better than God. But such is not the case. God is not a disappointment. The cross shouts out to all who will hear that the universe has a sacrificial Head.<br><br><strong>For further study:</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=John+12%3A17-26&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=lu&amp;NavGo=9&amp;NavCurrentChapter=9" rel="nofollow">John 12:17-26</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Romans+5%3A6&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=joh&amp;NavGo=12&amp;NavCurrentChapter=12" rel="nofollow">Romans 5:6</a>;<br>1.

(v. 9)</span><br><br>The late Bishop John Robinson stated: "The resurrection of the body of Christ is no essential belief for Christian people, and it would make no difference to their faith if the Lord's body had been flung into the Valley of Hinnom, like those of the malefactors, to disintegrate among the rotting corpses." Such a statement flies in the very face of Scripture. Paul wrote: "If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe ... that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved" (Rom. 10:9, italics added). Here Paul makes it crystal clear that acceptance of the fact that Christ rose from the dead is a basic precondition for being a Christian. But what exactly do we mean by resurrection?<br><br>"Spiritual survival" is how the liberals in the church define it. But it was not just the spiritual part of Jesus that continued after the tomb - it was the total Christ. True, His body possessed additional powers and properties, but the physical frame which housed His spirit after He left the tomb was the same one that was nailed to the cross. "See my hands," He said to doubting Thomas, "put [your hand] into my side ... and believe" (John 20:27). Eric Sauer, a writer and Bible teacher, makes the point: "Just as our Lord's body was capable of transfiguration without losing its identity, so it was capable of disfiguration without losing its identity." Make no mistake about it, our Lord's resurrection was a physical one. If it wasn't, then there is no salvation.<br><br><strong>For further study:</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=John+20%3A19-31&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=joh&amp;NavGo=20&amp;NavCurrentChapter=20" rel="nofollow">John 20:19-31</a><br>1.

Some try to explain the resurrection as resuscitation - the return to life from apparent death. Those holding this view subscribe to what is called "The Swoon Theory."<br><br>There are two forms of this theory. One maintains that Jesus did not die but fainted on the cross and returned to consciousness when He was laid on the cold rock of the tomb. The other claims that after drinking the wine vinegar that was given to Him when He cried "I am thirsty," He fell into a stupor so deep that it was mistaken for death. But clearly our Lord actually died. The Gospels provide us with medical evidence for the fact. One of the soldiers pierced His side and there came forth "blood and water" (John 19:34). A doctor commenting on this says: "The pericardium (the sac around the heart) was punctured and the colorless fluid flowing from the wound proves that life would have been extinct."<br><br>Was it really a convalescent Christ the disciples encountered on that first Easter Day? Could such a pathetic and powerless figure have convinced them that He had conquered death and was alive forevermore? No, the Master, as it were, had flung from His face the mask of death, and laid down in the hearts and minds of His disciples an impression that stayed with them throughout the whole of their ministry.

A proponent of one of the Eastern religions says: "Christ's resurrection was really a reincarnation - another soul in another body." I once heard a Christian minister declare that Paul's reference to Christ as the firstborn from among the dead (Col. 1:18 ) was a clear allusion to reincarnation. There is no doubt that our Lord came from a virgin womb and a virgin tomb, but the body that emerged from the sepulchre was not fashioned in the tomb as it had been when He was an infant in Mary's womb. The body was the same one as before.<br><br>Others try to explain Christ's resurrection as living on in the recollection of others. "To live in the minds and hearts of those we love," goes a well-known saying often heard at funerals, "is not to die." It has to be acknowledged that some live so vibrantly that it is hard to think of them as dead even after one has attended their funeral. But when we talk about Christ's resurrection, we are not saying He survives in our memories. Recollection is not resurrection.<br><br>The body which died upon the cross and was laid in the cool tomb on the evening of the first Good Friday was miraculously infused with life once again early in the morning of the first Easter Day. It is as literal and as factual as that.

One is that no longer can death be an intimidator.<br><br>"Death," said someone, "is the great enigma of life; humanly speaking, it is the one secret of the universe which is kept, the silence of which is never broken." To the weary and despairing, death may come as a friend; the cynical and disillusioned may meet it with indifference; to the healthy and the happy it may appear as a foe; but it comes to all. Death is like a great stone that blocks the path of human aspiration. How certain can we be of the continuity of life beyond death? What modest person would find in himself anything worthy to endure for all eternity?<br><br>Such questions have been asked down the centuries. Death is a mystery - "the undiscovered country from which no traveler returns." Then came the first Easter Day, and the stone was rolled away. One Traveler did return. Death is an abysmal cavern no longer but a tunnel with light at the farther end. If people have seen it as a blind alley, then they need think no longer in those terms. It is now a thoroughfare, a highway. "'Tis death is dead, not He," said the hymnist. The mystery is a mystery no more. The stone that was rolled away the first Easter morn was not just the rock that sealed the tomb. Our Lord rolled back for us the mystery of death also.<br><br><strong>For further study:</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=1+Corinthians+15%3A50+-+58&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=1co&amp;NavGo=15&amp;NavCurrentChapter=15" rel="nofollow">John 11:1-44</a>; <a href="http://Matthew%2016:21" rel="nofollow">Matthew 16:21</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Mark+9%3A9&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=mt&amp;NavGo=16&amp;NavCurrentChapter=16" rel="nofollow">Mark 9:9</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=John+2%3A19&amp;section=0&amp;version=nkj&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=mr&amp;NavGo=9&amp;NavCurrentChapter=9" rel="nofollow">John 2:19</a>;<br>1.

Christ's resurrection body was able to pass easily through doors, for He came to His disciples when the doors were shut. The stone was rolled away not that our Lord might come out but that the disciples might go in. It was intended not as a means of exit but as a means of entrance.<br><br>One preacher put it like this: "God rolled away the stone not that His Son might rise, but that we might know He had risen; that we might steal into the empty tomb and see only the place where they laid Him." My pastor when I was a young Christian said: "Suppose we live in a home that has no electricity and a young nephew comes to stay with us for a weekend. Suppose also when we put the child to bed there is in the corner of the room a dark curtain which hides such things as traveling cases. And suppose further, when we are about to leave the room taking the light with us, the child falteringly confesses to a fear that on the other side of the dark curtain is someone that might harm him. What do we do? We go to the curtain, fling it aside, flood the gloomy recess with light and say: 'Look, there is nothing to fear.'"<br><br>To remove the curtain is to remove the dread.

What did that rolled-away stone reveal?<br><br>Well, follow the women into the tomb. Its just a large hole hewn in a rock. What do you see? Just "the place where they laid him" (Mark 16:6). All that was left were the graveclothes. Note that Peter saw "the strips of linen lying there, as well as the burial cloth that had been around Jesus' head" (John 20:6-7). Some scholars say that the Greek words used to describe the head-cloth signify that it still had an annular shape - that it still indicated the outline of His head. Can you see what this suggests? He passed through it without it being unwound. This was no laborious unwinding! This was a glorious uprising! There was no possibility that the graveclothes could have looked the way they did without a resurrection. Had the head-cloth been torn apart, the impression gained would have been quite different.<br><br>It was probably this simple but tremendous fact - the fact that Jesus had clearly passed through the shroud without it being unwound - that convinced the first observers they had witnessed the miracle of resurrection.

(v. 20)</span><br><br>Young Christians who have just come into the faith often ask: Why is the resurrection so important? How can an event which took place 2,000 years ago have any relevance for us today? Three very simple statements (not original to me) will bring us to the heart of the matter.<br><br>First, the resurrection of Christ assures us of God's forgiveness. Forgiveness is one of humanity's greatest needs. Jack Winslow, in his book Confession and Absolution, says that the head of a large English mental hospital remarked that he could dismiss half of his patients immediately if they could be assured of forgiveness. The resurrection is convincing proof that Christ's sacrifice on the cross was accepted, and thus gives us the assurance that all our sins can be forgiven.<br><br>Second, the resurrection of Christ assures us of God's power. It is one thing to be forgiven; it is another to live above the power of sin. "Men may change their ways," say some writers (as we saw) from non-Christian religions, "but they can't change their character." Well, God can change people's character. He did so with the apostle Paul, with Peter, and with countless others. Paul's prayer in the passage before us today focuses on this - that we might comprehend something of the power released in the world through the resurrection.<br><br>Third, the resurrection assures us of God's ultimate triumph. Other religions and ideologies have very vague ideas about the future. Some believe in endless cycles of reincarnations; others nirvana. Christians, however, have a hope that is different. Death for a believer is nothing more than the anteroom to glory.<br><br><strong>For further study:</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=eph+2:1-10" rel="nofollow">Ephesians 2:1-10</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=eph+2:1-10" rel="nofollow">Romans 8:11</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=col+3:1" rel="nofollow">Colossians 3:1</a>;<br>1.

(v. 9)</span><br><br>Before we conclude our meditations on the uniqueness of Christianity, we must mention our Lord's ascension. I much prefer the word exaltation to ascension to describe Christ's return to the throne of God, for that is what it really was - an exaltation. Paul, in some verses in the passage we looked at yesterday (Eph. 1:20-21), points out that following His resurrection our Lord was elevated above all possible rivals: "far [note the word far] above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every title that can be given, not only in the present age but also in the one to come." Jesus has been exalted to the highest place, and it is this "supremacy" which His Father wants Him to enjoy forever.<br><br>This thrilling truth puts into proper perspective the use of the word superiority which is a word commonly used by Christians when comparing the faith to others. We must be careful how we use the word. Adopting an air of superiority toward people of other faiths displays nothing more than discourtesy and arrogance. John Stott comments: "It is not 'Christianity' as an empirical institution or system for which Christians should claim superiority. It is Christ, and only Christ.<br><br>We should not be afraid to affirm without embarrassment that Christ is superior to all other religious leaders, precisely because He alone humbled Himself in love even to the cross and therefore God has raised Him 'above' every other person, rank, or title." If God has given this supreme position to Jesus and so honored Him, then we should give Him the same honor also.<br><br><strong>For further study:</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=mr+16:9-19" rel="nofollow">Mark 16:9-19</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=ps+68:18" rel="nofollow">Psalms 68:18</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=lu+24:50-51" rel="nofollow">Luke 24:50-51</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=php+2:9" rel="nofollow">Philippians 2:9</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=1pe+3:22" rel="nofollow">1 Peter 3:22</a>;<br>1.

(v. 10)</span><br><br>In his autobiography, A King's Story, the Duke of Windsor told of a strange thing that happened at the funeral of his father, King George V. He described how, as his father's body was being conveyed on a draped gun carriage through the crowded streets of London, a mishap occurred which only those closest to the scene witnessed. The imperial crown, removed from the Tower of London, had been placed over the Royal Standard and secured to the lid of the coffin. However, the jolting of the vehicle caused the Maltese Cross, which surmounts the crown, to fall. "Suddenly," said the Duke, "out of the corner of my eye, I caught a flash of light dancing along the pavement. One of the sailors, marching behind the gun carriage, picked it up, took it to his commanding officer, and said, 'This cross fell off, Sir. It must be replaced.' The officer was a little bewildered by the untoward happening and said: 'Must it be replaced now?' 'Yes Sir,' replied the sailor, 'The crown is never complete without the cross.' "<br><br>In Christian terms the converse is also true - the cross is not complete without the crown. The ascension inevitably followed the atonement; the coronation the crucifixion. One writer says: "One senses a certain embarrassment in some ministers where the subject of the ascension is concerned. They tend to shy clear of the topic or dismiss it lightly as no more than a graphic myth or triumphalist parable." But if there had been no ascension there would be no gospel. The cross would not be complete without the crown.<br><br><strong>For further study:</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=heb+1:1-9" rel="nofollow">Hebrews 1:1-9</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=lu+22:69" rel="nofollow">Luke 22:69</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=col+1:18" rel="nofollow">Colossians 1:18</a>;<br>1.
