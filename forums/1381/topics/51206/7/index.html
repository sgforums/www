(v.6)<br><br>Nothing else we do can atone for a lack of kindness. Many people excuse themselves for a lack of kindness by pointing to the things they do for someone -- "I am working my fingers to the bone for him." Yes, but the fleshless fingers will not atone for unkind words and attitudes.<br><br>Even ministers who work hard but lack this essential kindness are no exception. Paul lists well over twenty-five things in the passage before us that are marks of a true servant of God, and notice how he puts "kindness" right in the middle of them. At the center of all his "proofs" is kindness. I do not think it is by chance that this virtue of kindness is also the middle virtue of the nine fruits of the Spirit. Without kindness, there is no virtue in the other virtues. This one puts flavor in all the rest -- without it, they are insipid and tasteless. So to grow in kindness is to grow in virtues that are flavored with a certain spirit -- the spirit of Jesus.<br><br>It remains a fact, however, that multitudes of Christian people are not kind. Some eminent Christian leaders have not been as eminent in this fruit of the Spirit as in others, and have worn their halo a little askew. Many are stern and unfeeling. They grow hard with sinners. Disciplined as they are in virtue, they become censorious and critical and their passion for righteousness makes it hard for them to show tenderness to violators of God's law. Jesus upheld God's laws more than anyone -- yet He was called "the Friend of sinners."<br><br>Prayer:<br><br>My Father and my God, although I never want to lessen the gravity of sin, I do want to be a person who shows tenderness to those who are enmeshed in it. Help me become that kind of person. In Jesus' Name.

God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and ... he went around doing good ..." (v.3<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>We come now to the sixth fruit of the Spirit -- goodness.<br>Most commentators agree that it is the hardest fruit to define as the word "good" is used so widely that it can mean nearly everything and nearly nothing. In some circles, for example, a man is regarded as "good" if he simply keeps out of the hands of the police, while in other circles "goodness" consists of being "highly respectable."The New Testament use of this word (Greek: agathosune) is meager -- apart from its use in Galatians 5:22, it appears on only three other occasions (2 Thess. 2:17, Eph. 5:9 and Rom. 15:14). So it is not easy to pinpoint the real meaning of the word. It is the view of most writers and Bible commentators that supernatural goodness is not just doing good things (though it includes that) but it is essential goodness -- goodness in the inner parts.<br><br>This deep down goodness, like kindness, is first an attitude before it becomes an action. In fact, some commentators are of the view that it is more non-verbal than verbal -- it is evidenced not so much in words as in one's whole demeanor. And it is a goodness which unconsciously proclaims itself. One feels it as an aura around its possessor. Its radiations are so powerful that it is doubtful whether anyone could be near to it and yet be unaware of it. Many, especiallynon-Christians, might not be able to describe what they feel in the presence of this "goodness," but they would feel something. And that something is the character of Christ flowing in and through one of His followers.<br><br><strong>For Further Study</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=eph+5&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Eph. 5:1-10</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=na+1&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Nah. 1:7</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=ps+119&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Psa. 119:68</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=ps+145&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">145:9</a><br>1.

(v.7)<br><br>We are seeing that "goodness" is essential goodness -- goodness in the inner parts. William Sangster, in my view, comes closest to grasping the content of this sixth fruit of the Spirit when he says: "Goodness is the impression a Christian makes as he moves on his way, blissfully unaware that he is reminding people of Jesus Christ." Perhaps we can get no nearer to a definition of supernatural goodness than that -- reminding people of Jesus Christ. But note the words -- "blissfully unaware ..." A Christian is largely unconscious of this fruit at work within him, for it is not something he tries to manufacture but something that flows out of his deep relationship with Jesus Christ.<br><br>George Muller of Bristol, the man who cared for so many stranded orphans, was said to demonstrate the fruit of "goodness" to a remarkable degree. Dr. A. T. Pierson says in his biography of the great man that one day, Muller was pressed to share what he considered to be the power behind his ministry, and he surprised his questioner by talking about his secret death. "There was a day," he said, "when I died; utterly died" -- and as he spoke, he bent lower until he almost touched the floor. He continued: "I died to George Muller, his opinions, preferences, tastes and will; died to the world, its approval or censure; died to the approval or blame even of my brethren and friends; and since then I have studied only to show myself approved of God." In those who manifest the fruit of goodness, one thing is always clear -- they have "died" to their own interests and have returned to "live" for Christ's.<br><br><strong>For Further Study</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=ga+2&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Gal. 2:1-20</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=2ti+2&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">2 Tim. 2:11</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=col+2&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Col. 2:20</a>, <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=col+3&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">3:3</a><br>1.

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Two divergent views </strong></span><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=ga+2&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Galatians 2:11-21 </a><br>"I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me ..." (v.20)<br><br>Paul tells us about his "secret" death in the passage before us today. In the main, there are two divergent views on this passage. One view is that Paul is referring here to the teaching he expounded in Romans 6 -- that when Christ died at Calvary, we all "died" in Him, but because He came back from the dead we must now apply ourselves to appropriating that resurrection power and allow it to work in us to overcome self and sin. They say Paul's statement about being "crucified with Christ" has reference to that. Others take the view that Paul is referring to a specific experience in his life, following his conversion, when his "old man" (the carnal nature) "died" to self-interest and self-concern. Thus, the "old man" being crucified, the Christ-man rises in his stead.<br><br>Personally I see truth in both these views. Sanctification is a process but it can also be a crisis. Many Christians can testify, as did George Muller, that even though they were applying the sanctifying power of the Holy Spirit in their lives day by day, there came a moment or a period when they experienced a critical putting to death of the ego. Not everyone, it seems, is brought by the Spirit to experience sanctification as a crisis, but it is significant that most of the saints whose lives are marked by a high degree of holiness testify to such an experience. Let your heart be open to God on this matter today and listen to what He might say to you. Perhaps this could be the day on which you die a "secret death."<br><br><strong>For Further Study</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=ro+6&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Rom. 6</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=ga+5&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Gal. 5:24</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=1pe+2&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">1 Pet. 2:24</a><br>1.

I thank you that I am not like other men ..." (v.11)<br><br>The fruit of the Spirit is not something that is achieved or manufactured, but something that is experienced as we abide in Christ and allow the Holy Spirit to produce in us the lineaments of Christ's character.<br><br>Many people have equated the sanctified life with keeping an ethical code, but the ethical code is not the source of sanctification but the result of it. If the path of ethical achievement is achieved by self-effort alone, then the person who achieves it comes to have pride in his achievement and falls prey to the sin of Pharisaism. Those who keep the ethical code by self-effort have a taut will and, though they might not realize it, they lapse into the sin of independence -- depending on themselves and not on God. People who struggle to exude goodness have a metallic ring about them -- they appear stern and rigid and have about them the atmosphere of a moral athlete. Those whose goodness is not imposed, but exposed from their deep relationship with the Lord, are sweetly human and exude the character of Christ.<br><br>A similar error is made by those who say they have been "doing good turns all their lives." Someone has said that this type of attitude is "the sin of Pharisaism in overalls." Self is very much at the center. It is tainted, not because the "good turns" are evil, but because they are prompted by the self-regarding principle -- I am doing them in my own way for my ends.

(4:1)<br><br>So often in life, our first thought is for ourselves. We are self-centered. Everything has an immediate self-reference. We are more upset over our own dead dog than a neighbor's dead child. And so deeply ingrained is our self-preoccupation that, left to ourselves, we would have to fillet our personalities to get rid of it. Yet there are multitudes walking the earth whose first thoughts are not for themselves but for the Lord and for others.<br><br>How has this happened? It has happened because the fruit of the Spirit was growing within them -- and especially the fruit of goodness. Take Catherine Booth, for example. When the great woman first learned the deadly nature of the disease that was to kill her slowly through two years of great pain, she knelt at the side of her husband and said: "Do you know what was my first thought? That I should not be there to nurse you at your last hour." Her first thought! A minister I once visited and who had been struck down with polio said to me: "But who will care for my people?" It was not of himself he was thinking -- but of others.<br><br>The self-forgetfulness of both Catherine Booth and the minister who was laid aside by sickness was not something that was manufactured but something that had been produced in them by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.

(v.5)<br><br>Although, as we have seen, goodness is a fruit that is difficult to define, we come close to seeing its meaning when we think of it in terms of essential goodness -- goodness in the inner parts. It is not something that is imposed but something that is exposed; it moves, not from without to within but from within to without. It is not self-achieved. Supernatural goodness is pure goodness -- a goodness which unconsciously proclaims itself. Christians in whom goodness is growing will not "use" others as many use their friends -- they will love them for themselves alone. They will not mentally fit people into their scheme -- for they have no schemes.<br><br>I think it would be true to say that goodness is there to some degree in all Christians who are in daily touch with the Lord and are growing in Him -- but in those who have known what it is to die to self, it is there in overflowing measure. They exude goodness. John Wallace, a Scotsman and the principal of the college where I received my training for the ministry, used to say: "Goodness, the fruit of the Spirit, is more 'felt' than 'telt'. It is not so much actions as attitudes, not so much talking as walking."I believe myself that God never gets closer to a sinner -- or, for that matter, an unsurrendered Christian -- than when He calls to that person through the life of someone in whom the fruit of goodness is ripe. So in yearning for this fruit of the Spirit, remember, it comes not by straining to be good but by surrendering to goodness.<br><br><strong>For Further Study</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=mt+5&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Matt. 5:1-16</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=1pe+2&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">1 Pet. 2:12</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=col+1&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Col. 1:10</a><br>1.

(v.6)<br><br>We examine now the seventh fruit of the Spirit -- faithfulness or fidelity. Faithfulness (Greek: pistis) is the quality of reliability or trust-worthiness which makes a person someone on whom we can utterly rely and whose word we can utterly accept.<br><br>It has been said that the ultimate test of a person's character is: Are there any circumstances in which that person will lie? If so, then that person's character is blemished. I know a Christian worker who puts in hours of service and who would work his fingers to the bone for anyone in need but, sadly, he cannot always speak the truth. That basic falsity cancels out much of the value of his accomplishments.<br><br>In a Third World country, where the leaders of churches are obliged to declare their property on their tax returns, one church owned a valuable gold cross. So that they would not have to pay so much tax, they decided to devalue the cross on their tax return and place its value at only a fraction of its real worth. One day the cross was stolen and cut up into small pieces. When the pieces were eventually recovered by the police, the church leaders went to court to prove they belonged to them. The judge called for a valuation of the gold and when told it was of very high value, he judged that the cross did not belong to the church as the stolen cross was of much higher value than the one listed on the church's tax return. So the gold was confiscated by the police. Those church leaders lost not only a cross -- they lost their character.<br><br><strong>For Further Study</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=eph+4&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Eph. 4:1-25</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=pr+12&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Prov. 12:19</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=le+19&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Lev. 19:11</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=col+3&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Col. 3:9</a><br>1.

(v.11)<br><br>We must not think that because faithfulness is listed among the last three qualities on Paul's list, it is of lesser importance. So important is it that Jesus says in our passage today: "He who is faithful with a trifle is also faithful with a large trust, and he who is dishonest with a trifle is also dishonest with a large trust" (v.10, Moffatt).<br><br>I have often said to myself: there is a young man with a great future in the things of God. Yet time and again, I have seen them fail in their fidelity to small obligations, and I have then said to myself: unless there are great changes, that person will end up like the children of Israel in the wilderness -- going around in circles. Look again at what Jesus said, this time in the Moffatt translation: "If you are not faithful with dishonest mammon, how can you ever be trusted with true Riches?" Here the basic principles are laid down. If you are not faithful in the trifling, you will not be faithful in the tremendous. If you are not faithful with the material (mammon), how can you expect to be entrusted with the spiritual -- true Riches? Notice how Moffatt spells the word "riches" with a capital "R." Why is this? Because spiritual richness is a richness that is so rich you just have to spell it with a capital "R." But Jesus says one more thing: "If you are not faithful with what belongs to another, how can you ever be given what is your own?" Those who are not faithful with other people's possessions finish up with nothing of their own.<br><br><strong>For Further Study</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=mt+25&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Matt. 25:14-30</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=mt+21&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">21:43</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=so+1&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Song of Songs 1:6</a><br>1.

The Tamils of South India have a saying: "The life of the cleverest lie is only eight days." The Germans have a saying: "Lies have short legs." During the Second World War, they adapted that saying to, "Lies have one leg." That was because Goebbels, the Propaganda Minister, had one short leg. A passionate antagonist of Communism is reported to have said: "In our fight against Communism we are handicapped by our decency and honesty." Since when was honesty and decency a handicap? It is indecency and dishonesty that are handicaps; they bring us into bondage -- inwardly and outwardly. Governments, organizations and institutions which practice dishonesty will be broken from within. History has proved that.

Afterwards she told him: "I made a person-to-person call to myself at home and of course was told I was not there. This let my family know that I had arrived safely and there was no need to pay for the call, as I didn't get through to myself." She thought she was clever but she was just a clever fool, for calling herself up in this way just started a series of calls to herself on the inside of herself -- calls that would lead to even more serious moral violations. She sold herself -- cheap.<br><br>In Madras in India they tell the story of a farmer who, when selling milk to his customers, had to drive his cow and its calf from door to door. Why did he have to trudge in the hot sun day after day? There was a simple reason -- he could not be trusted. The housewives knew that he would water down the milk and so they made him milk the cow in front of their eyes. His dishonesty doomed him to drudgery. Dishonesty always does this.

(v.13)<br><br>One thing is becoming crystal clear as we continue meditating on faithfulness and fidelity -- nobody gets away with anything in a moral universe if that "anything" is dishonest and untrue. The whole history of humanity is a commentary on this. Remember the first lie uttered by Satan -- "You shall not surely die"? He keeps on repeating that well-worn but discredited lie to every member of Adam's race. Something dies in us the moment we are dishonest -- not the least, our self-respect. Death eats away at our hearts the moment dishonesty is let in. We are not so much punished for sin as by sin. I came across a statement in a book in which the writer said: "There are two major principles for getting and keeping political power: (1) let nothing, least of all truth and honor, interfere with success; (2) be honest and trustworthy in the little things, but boldly dishonest in the large ones." What would be the result of someone getting political power by following those two principles? I will tell you. Like blind Samson, they would pull down the pillars of society around their heads and the heads of others also.<br><br>It is the ten righteous men who spare the Sodoms of this world. Fidelity is the cement that holds society together; take it away and it destroys itself. I may be stretching imagination too far by saying this, but in my opinion the Christian presence, especially as it represents fidelity, holds the world on its course. Civilization would have disintegrated long ago were it not for the moral and Christian character that flows out of the Church into the world.<br><br><strong>For Further Study</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=mr+9&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Mark 9:38-50</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=1th+1&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">1 Thess. 1:8</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=heb+11&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Heb. 11:4</a><br>1.

Another characteristic is the quality of carrying through on all God's commands to us -- keeping faith to the end.<br><br>To help us come through the times of testing everyone has to face at some time, the Holy Spirit builds into us the ability to see things through to the end. One writer has listed the eight fiercest tests a Christian faces in this world in this order: (1) Humiliation -- a savage and plausible attack on our reputation. (2) Suffering -- physical, mental or spiritual. (3) Bereavement -- especially in relation to a loved one whose death was "untimely." (4) Estrangement or treachery from one's family and friends. (5) Doubt -- deep, dark and awful. (6) Failure -- the breaking up of one's life work. (7) Dereliction -- the sense of being forsaken by God.

How does a Christian triumph in the midst of such fierce testings as are listed above? Any triumph we experience at such times is the triumph of the Holy Spirit. He dwells in us, not just for the pleasure of inhabiting our beings, but to lead us to victory over all our problems.

Note -- "so bear fruit steadfastly" -- only the steadfast are finally fruitful.The minister of a large church, when asked what was the outstanding need of his congregation, said: "Faithfulness. Fifty per cent of church members are hangers-on, getting a free ride, contributing nothing from purse or person; twenty-five per cent promise to do something and then, after a few stabs at it, drop out. They lack fidelity. The life of this church is carried on by the remaining twenty-five per cent." D. L. Moody, the great American preacher, said: "If we could get people who put their hand to the plow and never draw back no matter what the wind or weather, we would have a growing and powerful church."How many of us, I wonder, have loose ends, broken promises, half-fulfilled tasks cluttering up our lives? Whose fault is it?<br><br>It cannot be the fault of the Holy Spirit, for He dwells in us to provide the power to see things through -- if we let Him. Success in this area of the Christian life, as in all areas, is letting go and letting God -- letting go of self-effort and surrendering to the power of the Spirit who is resident in us. As someone once put it -- the Christian life is not my responsibility, but my response to His ability.

(v.29, NKJV)<br><br>We come now to the eighth fruit of the Spirit -- meekness or gentleness. The original Greek word, prautes, is translated in various ways in different translations of the New Testament. One version uses the word "tolerance," another "forbearance" and another "adaptability."The original Greek word has no exact synonym in English and after examining the various words used in the different translations of Galatians 5:22, my personal opinion is that the Good News Bible gets closest to it when it uses the word "humility." The words humility" and "meekness" are often seen together in the New Testament, as for example, in our text for today: "I am meek and lowly in heart." (Other examples are Eph. 4:2 and Col. 3:12.)The Christian in whom the Spirit dwells is a person who is meek, gentle and humble.<br><br>It has been said that apart from love, nothing is more characteristic of a Christian, and nothing more caricatured and misunderstood than humility. The world has never had much time for humility. "Throughout time," says one writer, "it is a virtue that has not been greatly praised -- except by a few."To understand humility calls for a piercing spiritual perception which is given only to those who know God. A lady came up to me at the end of a Bible study I had given on humility and said: "I do love to hear a preacher expound on the subject of humility. You see, it is one of the greatest qualities, and I want to know as much as I can about it." I felt that somehow, in seeking to walk the path of humility, she had lost her way.<br><br><strong>For Further Study</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=mt+18&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Matt. 18:1-6</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=pr+16&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Prov. 16:19</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=mic+6&amp;version=nas&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Micah 6:8</a><br>1.

(v.5)<br><br>We said yesterday that humility has not been praised -- except by a few -- in any age. Ancient writers regarded the quality of humility as a "servile, grovelling spirit." People today seem to view it in the same way and place it alongside the cringing spirit of Uriah Heep -- "I am so very 'umble, Master Copperfield." Perhaps it was this confusion that led to Gladstone, one of Britain's past Prime Ministers, to say: "Humility as a sovereign grace is the creation of Christianity." In choosing "humility" as the best translation of the Greek word used in the list of the fruit of the Spirit, we must be careful not to miss the thought that is contained in some of the other words used by translators, such as gentleness, meekness, forbearance, adaptability and tolerance. Threading them all together, we have a picture of this fruit of the Spirit as a gentle spirit of lowliness and humility with no arrogance but a joyous desire to serve.<br><br>Humility is not only misunderstood by the world; it is also largely misunderstood by the Christian Church. Some confuse it, for example, with self-belittlement. They think that by denigrating themselves or putting themselves down they are acting in humility. But by deliberately setting out to make themselves small, they are really trying to make themselves great. Self-effacement is their way of gaining face. They take the lowest place in order to be invited to go up higher. They express derogatory opinions of themselves in the hope that they will be contradicted. This is not real humility -- this is feigned humility: an unworthy substitute.<br><br><strong>For Further Study</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=lu+14&amp;version=nkj&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Luke 14:1-11</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=ro+12&amp;version=nkj&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Rom. 12:3</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=1pe+5&amp;version=nkj&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">1 Pet. 5:5</a><br>1.

(vv.3-5)<br><br>Humility is not a cringing, servile attitude -- although, sadly, many Christians seem to view it in this way. Philip Brooks, a great American preacher, once said: "The true way to be humble is not to stoop until you are smaller than yourself, but to stand at your real height against some higher nature that will show you what the real smallness of your greatness is. Stand at your highest, and then look at Christ, then go away and forever be humble."The truly humble are conscious of greatness before they are conscious of humility. The passage before us today says: "Jesus, with the full knowledge that the Father had put everything into his hands and that he had come from God and was going to God, rose from the supper-table, took off his outer clothes, picked up a towel and fastened it round his waist ... and began to wash the disciples' feet" (John 13:3?5, J. B. Phillips). The consciousness of greatness was the secret of our Lord's humility. The small dare not be humble. But Jesus' greatness was rooted in God. Being in God made Him great -- and humble. Great because humble -- humble because great.<br><br>A Hindu said to a missionary: "I used to believe in idols but now I don't believe in them at all. I am coming round to believe that I myself am a god." He gave up his idols and made one of himself! When we lose our perspective on God, we lose our perspective on humility.

Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment ..." (v.3)<br><br>We continue trying to clear up the misunderstandings that surround the word "humility." Humility has often been confused with that sad state which we describe as an "inferiority complex." But however much humility and an inferiority complex resemble each other -- and one has to admit that superficially they do look alike -- humility is deeply different.<br><br>Humility is not the result of being badly mishandled in childhood, nor is it a nervous illness. Neither is it derived from a foolish comparison with other people. Humility is a true and absorbing view of oneself seen from God's point of view. Paul urges us in our passage today not to think of ourselves more highly than we ought to think, "but to think soberly, as God has dealt to each one a measure of faith" (v.3, NKJV).<br><br>These verses are sometimes interpreted as meaning that we should have a low opinion of ourselves, but look again at what the apostle is saying: "... not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly." We should not think of ourselves more highly than we ought, but by the same token, we should not think of ourselves more lowly than we ought. We must have a sane and balanced estimate of ourselves -- one that is not too high and not too low. Humility, as we said yesterday, flows from a correct viewof God, but it also flows from a correct view of ourselves. These two facts need overhauling and emphasizing in today's Church, for I am convinced that a large percentage of Christians have neither a correct view of God nor a correct view of themselves.<br><br><strong>For Further Study</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=1jo+2&amp;version=nkj&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">1 John 2:1-17</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=pr+11&amp;version=nkj&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Prov. 11:2</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=pr+16&amp;version=nkj&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">16:18</a><br>1.

(v.21)<br><br>Some Christians confuse humility with lack of ambition, but here, too, they are mistaken. The Christian in whom the "harvest of the Spirit" is being reaped may lack worldly ambition, but in the spiritual area of life, he is the most ambitious person alive. Titles,honors, distinctions, money ... his heart is not set on them but on God. If these things are placed in his hands, they are seen as a trust; they are not, however, the things that he deeply covets. For the true Christian, life comes to fulfilment, not in things but in God.<br><br>Having spent a few days focusing on what humility is not, it is time now to focus on what it is. "Humility," says William Barclay, "is a gentle, gracious and submissive spirit." He suggests that in order properly to understand humility, we need to look at five significant passages of Scripture. When we have looked at all five, we shall then get a composite picture of this beautiful virtue which the Holy Spirit seeks to bring to fruition in our lives.<br><br>The first is James 1:21: "Humbly accept the message that God has planted in your hearts, and which can save your souls" (J. B. Phillips). <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Humility is a teachable spirit</span> -- an attitude that recognizes one's own ignorance and a humble acceptance of the fact that without God's help, one cannot understand the depths or profundities of truth. Every Christian who has a good understanding of Scripturewill, to some degree, be humble, for those who approach the Bible with a proud and know-all attitude will find it will shut like a clam and reveal nothing to them.<br><br><strong>For Further Study</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=2ti+2&amp;version=nkj&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">2 Tim. 2:1-16</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=pr+1&amp;version=nkj&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Prov. 1:7</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=pr+1&amp;version=nkj&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">5:12-13</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=pr+1&amp;version=nkj&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">18:15</a><br>1.

To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God." (v. 8 )<br><br>Another passage we must look at if we are to understand the deep meaning of humility is Galatians 6:1 -- "If someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should restore him gently" (NIV). Paul's advice is that if someone is overtaken in a fault, he must be corrected in a spirit of humility. Correction can be given in a way which discourages or in a way which sets a person on his or her feet with the determination to do better. Humility is the spirit which makes correction a stimulant and not a depressant, a means to hope and not a cause of despair.<br>The third passage is 2 Timothy 2:25: "Those who oppose him he must gently instruct." Paul is saying here that when we meet up with those who disagree with us, and whom we think to be mistaken, we must not attempt to bludgeon them into changing their minds, but treat them with the utmost gentleness and respect.<br><br>Suppose we go into a room on a bitterly cold day and find the windows are frozen on the inside -- there are two things we can do. One is to try to rub away the ice on the inside of the window panes, or we may light a fire in the grate and allow the window to clear itself. Heat does quickly what rubbing may take a long time to do. When dealing with those whom you believe to be in error ormistaken, always remember that gentle humility will accomplish what no amount of bludgeoning or battering could ever do.

But do this with gentleness and respect." Real Christian witness always has a gracious gentleness about it which is far more effective than the aggressive approach which tries to ram the Gospel down people's throats. As someone has put it: "To win some you must be winsome."A final text we explore is James 3:13 -- "Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show it by his good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom." The real ornament of life which is precious in the sight of God is a meek and quiet spirit. Those who think they are not gifted by temperament to relate to people in this way need not despair. The Spirit who dwells in you will, if you allow Him, transform your temperament into the image of Christ.<br><br>Paul's spiritual progress may be measured by the fact that in 1 Corinthians 15:9, he says: "I am the least of the apostles," and writing later to the Ephesians (3:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, he says he is less than the least -- not now of the apostles -- but "of all God's people." Still later, when writing to Timothy (1 Tim. 1:15), he says that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners -- "of whom I am the worst." Oh, the wonder of humility. God said through Isaiah: "I dwell ... with him who has a contrite and humble spirit" (57:15, NKJV). James said, "God resists the proud" -- He repels their advances.

The King James Version uses the word "temperance" but in most translations the Greek word (enkrateia) is rendered as self-control. Underlying the word is the idea of self-restraint, a fine mastery of one's personality, a controlled and disciplined nature. It is noteworthy that Paul puts self-control last. Most systems of thought, both ancient and modern, would put it first. Consider the various philosophies that have fascinated man over past centuries, and what do you find? They all seek to produce a happy and contented person through self-control. Some advocate thought control, some breath control, others will-control.<br><br>The Christian way is different -- it produces happy and contented people, not primarily by thought control or even will-control, but by Christ-control. The Christian is a self-controlled person, but he becomes that, not by self-effort alone but by the gracious supply of the Holy Spirit who indwells him. You do not gain God, Christ or the Holy Spirit through self-control: you gain self-control through God, Christ and the Holy Spirit.<br><br>You see, if you begin with self-control, then you are the center -- you are controlling yourself. But if you begin, as Paul does, with love, then the spring of action is outgoing and you are released from yourself and from self-preoccupation. When you begin with love, you end with self-control. But it is not a nervous, anxious, tied-up self-control; it is a control that is natural and unstrained -- hence beautiful.<br><br><strong>For Further Study</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=1co+3&amp;version=nkj&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">1 Cor. 3:1-16</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=1co+6&amp;version=nkj&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">6:19-20</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=pr+25&amp;version=nkj&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Prov. 25:28</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=ro+6&amp;version=nkj&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Rom. 6:12</a><br>1.

(v.33, NKJV)<br><br>Some people attempt to come into the Christian life at the level of self-control rather than at the level of love, and quickly discover that it does not work. I tried to come into Christianity this way. There was a time in my teens when I was greatly attracted to Christianity, but not willing to make the full surrender which it so clearly demands. Every day I would start out with the thought and purpose that I would do everything in my power to keep myself from sin -- and every night I fell into bed feeling a failure. How could a diseased will heal a diseased soul? Then I surrendered my life to Christ and something wonderful happened -- His love flowed into my heart and as I began to love Him, all lesser loves soon dropped away.<br><br>A university professor, writing on the subject of loyalty, says an interesting thing: "There is only one way to be an ethical individual and that is to choose your cause and then to serve it. This central loyalty to a cause puts other loyalties in their place as subordinate. Then life as a whole is coordinated because all lesser loyalties are subordinated."<br><br>Translate his thinking into New Testament language and you find an interesting similarity. The "cause" we choose is Christ and His Kingdom, and when we seek them first, then all other things, including self-control, are added to us. This does not mean, of course, that once we become Christians we automatically become people of supreme self-control. We have the potential for that, but it becomes a reality only as we continually surrender and submit to Christ's control.<br><br><strong>For Further Study</strong><br><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=1co+9&amp;version=nkj&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">1 Cor. 9:19-27</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=1co+6&amp;version=nkj&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">6:12</a>; <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?passage=ro+8&amp;version=nkj&amp;showtools=0" rel="nofollow">Rom. 8:13</a><br>1.
