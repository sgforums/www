              <p>Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into
              all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall
              hear, <em>that</em> shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.</p>
              <p>What Jesus say is that, to his disciples, he, cannot tell them what will be in the future, for his death will come.. IF HE TELL THEM, think, if will his disciples stop Judas? The answer is Yes.. And as for why do he want to die. is becoz he want to save us all.. n redeem us from our sin, for the law was given.. and allow those who believe in him, recieve the promises he has already promised..</p>

              You see how many times did Abraham had an experience with God? A mere few times And what about his wife Sarah? hardly! She hardly knew God except what she had been told by Abraham. So did Jacob, Joseph etc. The person who probably had the most experience with God was probably the ancient prophets notably Moses.

              That's the whole reason why faith still matters even when the personal knowledge of God is there.

               What is not revealed to A was revealed to B so that the bible records the all knowledge about God that's able to be recorded withstanding time the purpose of which so that another person may learn from another person experience with God. Hopefully so that he may experience God himself however little and as a testimony to glorify God. That's the purpose of the bible to bear testament of God's work just like saying "Look people God divided the red sea for the ancient people of Israel!" or "Look people God shifted back the shadows from the sun as a sign of his agreement as requested"

               Interesting you did not answer me so which preacher admits that he understands all the mysteries of God?

              You try to go around my question by saying that only John Wimber admits that he doesn't know how God works but that's not the answer to my question my question is which preacher claim to know all the mysteries of God?
              <br><br>
              You go to a service this Sunday a pastor or a priest then ask him whether he knows all the mysteries of God or know how God works exactly in every way.
              <br><br>
              If you find one which tells you that he does. Send me his email I've got a lot to ask.
