              or is it? Considering the fascist regime that you're in now you are probably one of those government lackeys. You should be ashamed as a Singapore born citizen that your country is at it is. A fraud claiming to be first world while in fact it is third world thanks to this tyrant lky and his lackeys which are nothing but thugs and goons. And don't consider this an insult but it is an honest opinion.
              <br><br>
              Of course you being in Singapore cannot be expected to appreciate other people's opinion and can't be expected to be able to take criticism as well and view them as threats. LOL. So much for Singapore's education. . . .
              <br><br>
              So Singaporean laurence are you a proud Singaporean because your country is run by a tyrant as a fascist regime?

              There are claims that lky may have cheated in election by blacking out the city. Let's face the cold hard fact that Singapore is run on a dictatorship. You have no opposition. The only function of your election and opposition is to make lky and his regime looks legitimate.

              And by what mere words? And you're saying that Singapore govt can be destabilize with mere opinions? Thanks for letting us know that as it points that there is something wrong with your government indeed. The ones that need to bes topped are lky and his lackeys as what my past ordeal has proved. You're one lost soul who doesn't know what is right and what is wrong. Not surprising as you live under a dictatorship that doesn't tolerate dissenting views. You hear me your country doesn't tolerate dissenting view that's why it's called a dictatorship.

              as it points that there is something wrong with your government

              know what is right and what is wrong. Not surprising as you live
              under a dictatorship that doesn't tolerate dissenting views. You
              hear me your country doesn't tolerate dissenting view that's why
              it's called a dictatorship.</p>

              Like I said you argue for the sake of arguing. You're mindless drone. I'm finish with you. I hope you get to live finally in the future and have a mind of your own. You would just drag me to your level. It's pointless to argue with man who doesn't have anything of substance to argue with yet persist doing so. You don;'t even have your own mind. What a loss to society.
