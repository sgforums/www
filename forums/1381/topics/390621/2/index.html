              <p>ya when I read it for the first time, it was so different from the god religion, in that there are no soul/self in Buddhism, which is so different from their souls concept. first time in the history of religion, that man can obtain salvation on his own, by his own efforts. other religion require a god in order to obtain salvation.</p>
