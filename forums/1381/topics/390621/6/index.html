              So you're preaching to yourself with false sense of righteousness....interesting I've long realized that no one man would view himself as an evil person. Men are irrational primitive mostly. Harry lee would make great specimen in the museum to give a fine example of the more regressed and primitive mankind . . . .all those education couldn't help harry get enlightened. Too bad it was probably between bad genes, society failure or a result of an abusive childhood.

              You can't even say your mind with good English.
               The state is and has always try to dominate over religious domain. Secularism doesn't work because in practice those in rule demand to be obeyed not withstanding religious teaching, laws and values. This is especially true in totalitarian regime such as communist state and fascist state as in Singapore.

              Sigh this is what happens when engaging a person with lesser intellect. I said secularism in a country ruled by dictatorship or less than democratic countries are utter BS.
              Secularism is GREAT in THEORY but in practice dictators and tyrants have always sought control over the religious domain.<br><br>
              Perhaps these tyrants and dictators could not abolish religions but as far as they are concerned the people could have their religion and could believe in God as long as they fear the ruler more than they fear God. 
              
              <br><br>
              Of course it's every tyrants and dictators dream to have religion banned.
              <br><br>
              I was just saying that secularism is GREAT in theory but in practice in less than honorable democratic countries it's used as mere propaganda as the state tried to wrangle control over even the religious domain.

              and just in case you still don't get it what I said never explicitly or implicitly imply that religions are linked to govt in Singapore. 
                                <br><br>
               But in Singapore every institution is controlled by the corrupt govt the press, the educational institution, the hospital, the police force and the judiciary system. So you can bet that every religious figurehead in Singapore to a degree kow tow to this harry lee when pressured and when harry lee demands. Even the intelligence works for the PERSONAL benefit of the harry lee and family instead for the people. Harry lee and his family have become the state with the citizens reduced to mere digits. This is the opposite of democracy. Singapore is not a democracy. The whole point of one party system and family run state is total control and fear is a tool that makes it go smooth. Almost everyone in Singapore fear of this harry lee.
