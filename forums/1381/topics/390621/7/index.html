              <p>and just in case you still don't get it what I said never explicitly or implicitly imply that religions are linked to govt in Singapore.<br><br>But in Singapore every institution is controlled by the corrupt govt the press, the educational institution, the hospital, the police force and the judiciary system. So you can bet that every religious figurehead in Singapore to a degree kow tow to this harry lee when pressured and when harry lee demands. Even the intelligence works for the PERSONAL benefit of the harry lee and family instead for the people. Harry lee and his family have become the state with the citizens reduced to mere digits. This is the opposite of democracy. Singapore is not a democracy. The whole point of one party system and family run state is total control and fear is a tool that makes it go smooth. Almost everyone in Singapore fear of this harry lee.</p>

              <p>Not once, but many times, not one person, but whole family</p>
              <p>To add, there are also full time army officers in parliament, ready to overthrow the gahmen if it does not pander to its wishes</p>
