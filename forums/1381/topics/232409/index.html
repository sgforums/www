            <div class='col-md body'>What makes you believe in god in the first place? Just wondering about the answer. So, what makes you believe god? Is it because of your parents or what? Plus, I have a few questions in mind.<br><br>And, why do you believe in god till now? Well I saw a comment taken from 'what makes you to stay strong for GOd despite'<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ghimpheng:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: green;">the reward of going heaven thus not going hell<br><br>if the reward is taken away no 1 will trust god anymore</span></div></blockquote>and some says (and most give me an impression), if you do not believe in gods you will do to hell or something along the line. Is this fair? Look at this example, someone is going to punish you just because you do not believe in him, which is not a crime.<br><br>Also, it makes me wonder, is people believing in gods because they are afraid of going to hell and they want to go to heaven?<br><br>I also heard that god forgive mistakes that you have done (or something along the line) if you repent for it, is this why people believe in god just to lessen their guilt in something that they have done, so they will not go to hell? Some will say, "Yes, god will forgive you if your pray and repent for your mistake or something". Well, I can also repent for mistake without believing in god. So what makes you think there is a need for believing god?<br><br>Also, there is another comment taken from 'will god forgive me'<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Pope Nicholas:</div><div class="quote_body">If u are Catholic, go for Confession and all will be forgiven.<br><br>If u are protestant, speak to ur pastor if u nid advice. If not atone for ur sins and repent.<br><br>If Christ could give Peter who denied him thrice, the charge to feed His sheeps, Christ can practically forgive anyone for any sins.</div></blockquote>Do you seriously think your sin will be forgiven just because you confess to someone about it? Afterall the 'someone' is still a human and not like he can communicate with god or something.<br><br>OK, you might be lost with all those examples in gave you all above, my point or question is:<br><br>1) Is it because of whether going to hell or heaven that you believe in god in the first place? So, if there is no hell and heaven, will you still believe in god?<br><br>2) What is believing in god to you in the first place or what is god to you in the first place? is it a way to reassure your sins to be forgiven or a ticket to go to heaven that makes you believe in god?<br><br>Oh yes, don't give me crap (afraid have to use this word) from the bible that why we should believe in god or so. Don't cut and paste from the bible to answer the questions I've ask. That means nothing if taken from the bible, use your own heart (or brain) to answer it.<br><br>If you ask me why can't we do that? I ask you who are you worshipping? The god or the bible? Why don't you just buy a few bibles and start worshipping it, if you going to answer all questions people give you with answers from bible. Makes me wonder, when people ask them questions they will say "the bible says that ... " Is bible the god or the god is god?<br><br>Lastly, I want to ask you all again, What makes you believe in god in the first place? Why do you even believe in god in the first place? Why do you still believe in it till now? Think about all this question I've asked.<br><br>Note: I'm not trying to oppose god or something, I just wondering why people believe in god in the first place after seeing topics in this forum. OK, personally I do not believe in god, if you ask me why, I ask you why should I in the first place? This is why I created this thread to know why do each of you all believe in god in the first place and what makes you believe in it.</div>

However I will attempt the two actual questions asked, from a personal standpoint:<br><br>1. Neither, I believe in God because I believe He exist. Heaven and hell matters very little to me. I don't believe it was even mentioned when I accepted Christ.<br><br>2. God is the supreme being. He created me, He loved me and He died for me on the Cross as Jesus Christ.... again it has neither to do with my sins nor a ticket to heaven.<br><br>I have asked myself this before: what if God found me unworthy at the end of my journey. Would I do it all over again? Yes, I would. Not for gain or reward will I serve the Lord.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To SumOne... I think tat it will be better for u to condense all your replies into 1 reply so it is an easier read.<br><br><blockquote>Maybe I remembered wrongly, but you mentioned before that when you were young you used to be brought to churches and all. So you're proof in itself that this statement is not necessarily true. Unless you want to say whatever you said last time were lies. </blockquote>About going to churches and all... I don't believe I had said tat. I can only say I got go to churches on a few occasions during my JC times which my friends have asked me to go as well as being in a Catholic Secondary school for 4 years. However I am brought up being "godless" till secondary school and do not know wat is the difference between christian and others etc untill after U. U may find it is funny tat I do not think of religion in secondary school but it is really true since being "godless" I cannot appreciate wat religion is about and the tales being told sounds really foreign to me. Furthermore I am a video gamer and spend a lot of time playing games and nothing else  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> . It is only when a few people knock on the door and asking me to convert then I realise tat there r people who really believe in it !<br><br>If u have heard other tales about me, then I can assure u it is wrong<br><br><blockquote>To add to to that, there are people who are brought up as non-christians, but they chose to become christians later on. Which further adds to the lack of truth in your statement. I hope you're not going to say something like,"Such people are easily brainwashed in the first place." Or ,"Such people are dumb, that's why they can be made to believe in Christianity." </blockquote>Tat is true, but one of the messages they receive is on the aspect of eternal life. I did not say that these people r stupid etc, but eternal life is one of the core messages and reason for the belief of christianity. If u see the banner outside chruches (if there is any) surely one of them mention eternal life<br><br><blockquote>Ha ha ha. Unfair advantage? Man, what a riot</blockquote>Look at city harvest and all those properity gospel and u will know tat wat I have said is right<br><br><blockquote>As it is with some anti-religionists (I do not use the term atheists here). So what's your point? Everyone chooses what they want to believe. </blockquote>True. But I can say wat I felt isn't it ? At least I don't go around and just perform personal attacks just because we sit on different side of the fence.<br><br><blockquote>I think a lot of other christians have given you reasons to be christians other than the heaven and hell reason. Just like in the post above yours. You just chose to happily ignore such posts. </blockquote>There r 3 replies, the first one, sadly, I do not know and do not want to find out (sorry icemoon). The second one do touch on the word "assurance?" and for chin eng, he may not believe for heaven and hell but my point tat there r many people who believe in christianity because of heaven and hell is not far from the truth<br><br><blockquote>as a child I was<br>1. Not taught that god exists. I was born into a taoist/buddhist rojak family. My parents never insist that I follow them to temples.<br>2. Never interested in any religion, Christianity included.<br><br>strangely, I also never gave a thought to heaven and earth and hell.<br><br>also strangely, back in those days, there is no such thing as wealth and health gospel; neither was there any message of believe-in-God-and-you-will-succeed-gospel.<br><br>I did not become a Christian because of a childhood brain-washed-environment nor was it because I fear eternal punishment, nor was it because of eternal wealth. I become a Christian because God is God.<br><br>I still hold to that belief. </blockquote>Why not Islam or buddhist or other religion ? I ask tis because there seems to be a lack of info on why u become christian... At least your answer beg more questions than answering anything...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Arguement from creation</strong></span><br>based on the law of causality,which says that every limited thing is caused by something other than itself. there are two different forms of arguements for this. 1. Universe needs a first cause 2.the universe needs a cause right now to continue existing.<br><br>1. Universe was caused at the beginning.<br>This argument says that the universe is limited in that it had a beginning and this was caused by something beyond the universe.<br><br>-the universe had a beginning.<br>-anything that has a beginning must have been caused by something else.<br>-therefore, the universe was caused by God<br><br>In order to avoid this conclusion, some people say that universe is eternal.<br>There are two ways to answer this question.<br><br>scientific: big bang theory, secondlaw of thermodynamics, saying that the universe is running out of usable energy. But if it was running down, ity would not be eternal. somthing that is winding down has to be wound up.<br>philosophical: Time cannot go back to the past forever. You see it is impossible to pass through an infinite series of moments. Time is real and each moment that passes uses up real time that we can go back to. you can never finsh an infonite series of real things. If the past is infinite, (if the universe has always exist without a beginning) then we have never could pass through time to get to today. if the world never had a beginning, then we could not have reached today.: so time must have began in a particular time in the past and today has come at a definite time since then. therefore the world is a finite event and needs a cause for beginning.<br><br>The second form of arguement.<br>The universe needs a cause for its contuinuing existence. after it has come to beginning it is continuing and conserving its existence in the present.<br>Terms:<br>- Finite, changing things exist.<br>- Ever finite, changing thing must be caused by something else. If iot is limited and it changes, then it cannot be sth that exists independently. if it exists independently, it would have always existed withought ever changing.<br>-There must be a first uncased cause  of every finite changing things that exist.<br><br>and then there is: arguement from design,.. moral law,.. and being.</div>
