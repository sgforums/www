              <p>Introduction on William Lobdell</p>
              <p><span>William Lobdell criticizes Christian faith healers such as Trinity
               Broadcast Network star Benny Hinn, who he calls a "charlatan," and 
              wonders why other mainstream pastors on TBN do not condemn Hinn. 
              "Where's the courage within Christianity?" he asks.<br><br>-----<br><br>William
               Lobdell's journey of faith -- and doubt -- may be the most compelling 
              spiritual memoir of our time. Lobdell became a born-again Christian in 
              his late 20s when personal problems drove him to his knees in prayer.<br><br>As
               a newly minted evangelical, Lobdell -- a veteran journalist -- noticed 
              that religion wasn't covered well in the mainstream media, and he prayed
               for the Lord to put him on the religion beat at a major newspaper. In 
              1998, his prayers were answered when the Los Angeles Times asked him to 
              write about faith.<br><br>Yet what happened over the next eight years 
              was a roller-coaster of inspiration, confusion, doubt, and 
              soul-searching as his reporting and experiences slowly chipped away at 
              his faith. He explored every doubt, every question -- until, finally, 
              his faith collapsed. - Kepler's Books<br><br>William Lobdell has been a 
              journalist for 25 years, winning scores of state and national awards. In
               1998, he was assigned to the religion beat for the Los Angeles Times. 
              During his eight years covering faith, he was a finalist for national 
              religion writer of the year in 2002, 2003 and 2004. He left the religion
               beat when he lost his faith, in 2007.</span></p>

              <p>Actually I am a Christian.</p>
              <p>But I like to make Christians who don't know half the shit they are talking eat their words..</p>
              <p>The Christians in Singapore or most of the Megachurches attendees don't know anything about the bible .</p>
              <p>They actually don't know that a Christian's life is filled with suffering and sorrow and trials and tribulations .</p>
              <p>For those Retards who have been telling you that God wants you to prosper in material sense because those are blessings , I can assure you thats fucking bullshit.</p>
              <p>Just watch the video , i promise that you won't regret it. And his book is being reccomended on a top Christian review website in the States for being honest , objective and truthful.</p>

              <p>Its a well known fact that they are , however you have to understand alot of Catholics do not agree with it , so you have to seperate the two entitys when you are addressing them , if not they will always give the respond  citing  christians at fault and nothing to do with them because they are catholics.</p>
              <p>You will be extremely surprise at the amount of Catholics who believe they are not Christians</p>

              <p>The Catholics 10 Commandments are already different from the Christians'. They have removed the 2nd Commandment and split the last Commandment to make it their 9th and 10th.</p>
              <p>If one were to study church history, from as early as 10AD to 16th century, the catholics were involved in persecuting christians, until the 16th century Reformation which led to a biblical separation from the RCC which was how the 'dark ages' in church history being broken.

              <p>mego churches christians are christians or not I don't know, its not up to anybody to decide. neither can I say the most fundamental church in the world contains 100% all genuine christians. you can call yourself anything apparently nowadays. You can call yourself a prophet, an apostle, a christian, and even reincarnated christ and nobody can stop you.</p>
              <p>Most importantly I would say is what God thinks about you, whether or not you are a christian you and God will know. not up to us. But if we are talking about secular laws wrt to religions, I would say that catholics' practices are not christians' practices, beliefs are different, and hence they cannot be called christians.</p>

              <p><br>Some denominations share the same practices as the Catholic/Christian churches.   They observe advent, ash Wednesday  .. . . .. .  , practise infant baptism.     Whether the same or not, they are linked in one way or other.  </p>
              <p>Ways of prayer may be different, some using rosary to pray some just pray without rosary.    </p>
              <p>Ultimately, all worship the same God.    The most important for all is to practise what is preached, exercise love as God intended.</p>

              <p>Me too is wondering which secular laws state that "there are two religions, one is catholic and
              the other is christianity" or if there such a law in the first place....</p>
              <p>If going by what you say that "You can call yourself a
              prophet, an apostle, a christian, and even reincarnated christ and
              nobody can stop you" then mega churches all christians what.....they called themselves so.</p>
              <p>Catholics too called themselves Christians and you go to any Catholic church and ask their priests to confirm.</p>
              <p>Again, if you says "catholics' practices are not christians' practices,
              beliefs are different, and hence they cannot be called
              christians", then mega churches are also not christians since they believed in greed for money = prosperity gospel which is also not christians' practices....</p>
              <p>Then you did not make any sense...</p>
              <p>Furthermore, what are "christians's practices" and who regulate and decide what are the correct "christians's practices"?</p>
              <p>And what "catholics' practices are not christians' practices" ? and what Catholics "beliefs are different"? and different from who? And who decided that their's was different?</p>
              <p>You did not clarify anything. What does the word Christian or Christianity means to you?</p>

              <p>The Catholics 10 Commandments are already different from the

              last Commandment to make it their 9th and 10th.</p>
              <p>If one were to study church history, from as early as 10AD to
              16th century, the catholics were involved in persecuting
              christians, until the 16th century Reformation which led to a
              biblical separation from the RCC which was how the 'dark ages' in
              church history being broken. They then branded christians as
              'protestants', ie, people who protest against the RCC. So catholics

              <p>The word "Christian" means "Christ in One" that means all those who received Jesus and who believe in his Name. So the real question is denomination.</p>

              <p>Introduction on William Lobdell</p>
              <p><span>William Lobdell criticizes Christian faith healers such as
              Trinity Broadcast Network star Benny Hinn, who he calls a
              "charlatan," and wonders why other mainstream pastors on TBN do not
              condemn Hinn. "Where's the courage within Christianity?" he
              asks.<br> <br> -----<br> <br> William Lobdell's journey of faith -- and doubt -- may be the most
              compelling spiritual memoir of our time. Lobdell became a
              born-again Christian in his late 20s when personal problems drove
              him to his knees in prayer.<br> <br> As a newly minted evangelical, Lobdell -- a veteran journalist --
              noticed that religion wasn't covered well in the mainstream media,
              and he prayed for the Lord to put him on the religion beat at a
              major newspaper. In 1998, his prayers were answered when the Los
              Angeles Times asked him to write about faith.<br> <br> Yet what happened over the next eight years was a roller-coaster of
              inspiration, confusion, doubt, and soul-searching as his reporting
              and experiences slowly chipped away at his faith. He explored every
              doubt, every question -- until, finally, his faith collapsed. -
              Kepler's Books<br> <br> William Lobdell has been a journalist for 25 years, winning scores
              of state and national awards. In 1998, he was assigned to the
              religion beat for the Los Angeles Times. During his eight years
              covering faith, he was a finalist for national religion writer of
              the year in 2002, 2003 and 2004. He left the religion beat when he
              lost his faith, in 2007.</span></p>
