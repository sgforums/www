I cannot translate everytime to her and it's a chore for me to catch the message and process it before returning to her in English and if we sit next to the interpreter who's more experienced helps to translates it for her, often messes up my mind instead. The interpreter would be talking about 1,2,3,4 now but the pastor would be at 5,6,7,8 already and I'd be so confused and messed up since both language makes sense to me while I jot down notes.<br><br>But whenever possible, it'd be better that the couple goes to the same church together. So it's about helping the one who's in more need.</div></blockquote>Hi.<br><br>Yes, language could also be another issue, but then, with so many churches in singapore, wonder if its that hard to find one that suits both husband and wife comfortably (both in term of language, doctrine and teachings)?<br>.... * will definitely take some efforts from bothof them, I am sure...<br><br>(**** I am not trying to be intrusive, its just a sharing of idea here)<br>I am thinking, maybe during service you can sit separately from your wife, so she can have the benefit of sitting beside the interpreter, and you can sit further away and not be 'confused' by the interpretation, then after service, you can follow up with her and see if she can follow/understand what the pastor said over the pulpit. (just a susgestion only)<br>oh ... along the way, you can also teach her Japanese as well ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>cheers<br><br></div>
