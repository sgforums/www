            <div class='col-md body'>From the ST today by William Furney:<br><br>THE Bible is back.<br><br>Verily I say onto thee, the seraphic tome is making a stealthy reappearance.<br><br><strong>Often touted as the world's best-selling book - only occasionally surpassed by a new Harry Potter - it's also the world's best never-read book.</strong><br><br>For some time I've had a dawning revitalisation that the Word of God is making increasing inroads into our lives. During the past few years, relatives and friends in England, not altogether known for their religious bent, have opted to name their boys Joshua, Joseph, Jacob.<br><br>These days, it's easier than ever to plough through the Holy Bible. Amazon.com lists the King James Version (bound in black imitation leather) as its most popular choice. There's also something called The New Oxford Annotated NRSV Bible with the Apocrypha, Third Edition. (There was a first and second?)<br><br>An online reviewer of the former, porsie from Borneo, said: 'I have attempted to get through this novel again and again, and it wasn't until I realised that it had a whole...load of authors that I understood the reason it's so unevenly written...The creation of the world in seven days? Give me a break! It takes that long to drive across the US...'<br><br>Z. D. Houghton of Indiana flippantly writes on the same review page: 'Although it can sometimes come off as a bit preachy, the Bible is a true semi-autobiographical masterpiece by the reclusive God, age 53 (to the infinite power), who resides lately in Indiana. One certainly hopes to hear more of this promising young writer in the days to come.'<br><br>Just as most in the Eastern world devotedly centre their lives around their religion - be it Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Shintoism, Confucianism, Taoism, etc - in the Western world - where Christianity prevails - most devotedly centre their lives around the ever-rising creed of consumerism while cheering and ridiculing religion.<br><br>Take this Amazon review of The Holy Quran: An English Translation: 'It proves wrong all those who seek to make Islam into a dogmatic tool for oppressors. Islam is for all people of all times.' (Bobby Darvish, Utah)<br><br><strong>The Quran reviews are overwhelmingly positive while the bible postings are underwhelmingly negative.</strong><br><br><strong>Is it any wonder that Islam is the world's fastest-growing religion while Christianity is possibly a contender for the world's fastest-declining religion? Even a staunchly Catholic country like Ireland is having trouble filling its once-overflowing priestly ranks and nunneries.</strong><br><br>Still, a shift is taking place - spurned by recent, global events.<br><br>And while we may not like to attest, the Bible has become so ingrained in Christian lives that it naturally spawns generations of doppelgangers, albeit for financial, narcissistic and un-altruistic gain: The Beauty Bible, The Ultimate Guide To Smart Beauty; The Sales Bible: The Ultimate Sales Resource; and what about: Bad Girls Of The Bible And What We Can Learn From Them (wisdom for today's woman from strumpets Jezebel and Delilah)?<br><br>In some ways, a womb-like return to the protected days of childhood is not altogether unexpected in this post-Sept 11 world.<br><br>As crazed militant bombers weave their deathly trail from New York to Istanbul to Madrid, we seek security in these insecure and largely unsecured times. Meanwhile, in the United States, millions have latched onto the fear-factor mantra extolled by the current administration and conservative media outlets in an attempt to keep the populace in hand for political gain.<br><br>Even those normally opposed to ethereal belief utter entreaties to a higher power when in situations of strife.<br><br>The Western world, unlike in many parts of the East, is overtly material and covertly spiritual. But our spirituality, regardless of religion, is wired within us like circuits seared onto a microchip, and if heretofore untapped, springs forth to calm our restive minds. And that could well be balm to the stressed soul.<br><br>The writer is a freelance journalist based in Bali.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not surprising. Western culture gives way to tech stuff, sciences, new age cults, Macdonalds. Its not unbelievable their belief in God is waning.<br><br>Look at the parts on 'many versions or editions of the Bibles'. One dont have to look far to see how people mangle or rewritten the Bibles. How many people in this forum try to push their own version of Christ teachings?<br><br>There is truth in this<br><br>"And while we may not like to attest, the Bible has become so ingrained in Christian lives that it naturally spawns generations of doppelgangers, albeit for financial, narcissistic and un-altruistic gain: The Beauty Bible, The Ultimate Guide To Smart Beauty; The Sales Bible: The Ultimate Sales Resource; and what about: Bad Girls Of The Bible And What We Can Learn From Them (wisdom for today's woman from strumpets Jezebel and Delilah)?"<br><br>Besides all the Bibles for everyday things on bookshelves, I was surprised to see Bible for Business Leadership in National Library. The book attempt to draw parallels between many saints and characters in the Bibles, with many successful businessman of today, and their personality.<br><br>Is there anything in the Bible that says spirituality = profit making?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The word BIBLE basically refers to the term BIBLIO which when translated means "THE BOOK". Biblios also give rise the word Bibliography.<br><br>Function: noun<br>Etymology: Middle English, from Old French, from Medieval Latin biblia, from Greek, plural of biblion book, diminutive of byblos papyrus, book, from Byblos, ancient Phoenician city from which papyrus was exported<br>1 capitalized a : the sacred scriptures of Christians comprising the Old Testament and the New Testament b : the sacred scriptures of some other religion (as Judaism)<br>2 obsolete : BOOK<br>3 capitalized : a copy or an edition of the Bible<br>4 : a publication that is preeminent especially in authoritativeness or wide readership  <br><br>.... so any reference to the word bible in the secular sense means the book in question has authority or has wide readership. Not to be confused with the use of the word Bible in the religious sense.</div>
