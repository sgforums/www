Unfortunately, marriage is also the only not-born-into relationship that is binding. Also, in terms of proximity to another human being, it is the closest and is suppose to last the longest. Hence the propensity for problems to appear is greater than any other relationship on this planet.<br><br>The desire to work on any relationship has to be understood by all parties concern. The cliche saying: it takes two hands to clap is very true.<br><br>The titles of those books? Never read them. We may consider that the books were written for people who may either already have problems or may wish to learn to prevent problems from happening.<br><br>28 yrs is not young but neither is it old. I'd suggest keeping your options open. I have a close relative who has given up on marriage till this person met the right one at the ripe old age of 38.<br><br>Yup, I have a good companion, we don't always see eye to eye, we do argue about all sorts of things, we also try very had to be mature about the arguments. Right now, she's cooking up a storm in the kitchen..... yummy.</div>
