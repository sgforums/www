              <p>regardless of whether the Lordship salvation is true or not, at least they are set in helping others as part of their belief. would you rather they open a megachurch and cheating the parishioners millions of dollars?</p>
              <p>afterall, in <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">Mark 9:38-42, it is said: </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">"'Teacher,' said John, 'we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop, because he wasn't one of us.' 'Do not stop him,' Jesus said, 'No one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me, for whoever is not against us is for us. I tell you the truth, anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to Christ will certainly not lose his reward. And if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his neck.'"</span></p>
              <p>even if their ideas are flawed, is it wrong to draw people to the Christian cause through their actions?</p>

              <p>okay, for let's go about this again.</p>
              <p>1st. you have ABSOLUTELY no proof that the lordship salvation is a false Christian doctrine. every single church denomination out there is criticized, from the Catholic Church (one of the oldest denominations out there) to the 7D adventist. so regardless of where you belong to, how do you know that yours is right?</p>
              <p>2nd. you are ignoring what salvation army has done and go around criticizing them. </p>
              <p>3rd. you are posting baseless accusations of their employees and beliefs. </p>
              <p>4th. giving up your sins and try to be as sinless as possible is wrong, why? is it wrong to try to aspire to become one everyone else can look forward to? or do you belong to a church where you believe you can go around sinning and expect to enter the gates of heaven as well? if people are turned away from not sinning, the problem is not with lordship salvation. </p>
              <p>5th. scroll up, and rebut my sentences line by line. right now, you are probably appearing to everyone as if you have a bag of fortune cookies next to you. post next message? okay! pull out next fortune cookie... "Confucius says: Corn in, corn out." </p>

              <p>Well, I do not know whether you accept this explanation which I got it from Buddhism. Buddha said there are many levels of heaven and many levels of hell. Those gods from other religion exist and I believe too because I have seen their followers' prayers do come true, although not always. However, there is no creator. There are six paths in rebirth : gods, humans, "a xiu lor" (fighters, don't know what is it called in English). <br>ghosts, animals, and hell. These rebirths are painful because of the senses they have. The ultimate aim of every buddhist is to get out of this rebirth cycle.</p>

              <p>i do not understand the buddhist way of thinking regarding death either, as it seems one blames one's past life for one's current life's bad karma. doing good so that one can have a better next life, while has good actions, does seem to have selfish intentions. </p>

              <p>Buddhists who do not listen to teachings will think that by doing good deeds without good thoughts will attain good fortune in this or next life. Those who really listen and follow the teachings will know that doing good deeds sincerely for the sake of others is the main teachings of Buddha. There is a Buddhist story about an Emperor (If I am not wrong was Emperor Lian Wu Di) who had done a lot of good deeds. One day, he encountered a high monk and he asked the high monk how much credits he had accumulated. The high monk told him none because he did the good deeds with the thoughts of credits in his mind. This story was told over and over again during Dharma talks by monks in the temples to remind followers what is actually good deeds. In fact, Buddha was called the englightened one because He is the first who fully understand the law of nature (karma). He was not the one who created the law of nature and he was also subjected to karma before his englightenment. That is why we called him Teacher because he taught us what he knew. One can benefit by following his teachings without praying to him as this is the law of natue, not Buddha's law.</p>
