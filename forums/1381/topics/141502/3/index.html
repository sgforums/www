He lump all these loop holes as "theology" but he seems to forgot the idea of faith is also a "theology" itself. Without theology, there is nothing to have faith on. Where is your faith founded on ? It is like meeting a stranger and have faith in him to be a good person just because the stranger ask him to do so. Even though he had performed countless times of bad actions and lie or contradict in several cases, he just dismissed all of them and insist he is a good person just because, well, I don't know wat u call these kind of people tat believe strangers without a doubt...<br><br>When told him tat faith can lead to wrong outcomes, he just say faith here faith there, when say tat we should use basic reasoning and logical deduction, he again say faith here and faith there etc. When say he is wrong about god being good and asking to show examples, he just say god is good and no examples. And abotu personal experiences, the peopel praying for 4D numbers from some idols have many interesting personal experiences in striking 4D as well.<br><br>Frankly, he is really a good example of how faith is really important for a religion. It makes u numb and do not use thinking or reasoning, everything in it is true true true and even though u have sufficiently show it is false, u just say it is true and totally dismiss the opposition. When ask a question to probe thinking, he totally do not even want to think and say I dunno and I don't wanna find out and watever the outcome, even though it show as plain as day somethign is wrong, he don't care and believe his faith is correct.<br><br>Tell u something,  when u believe, u should believe in the truth, not believe something u like to believe. If u think believing in something u like to believe is correct, then the japanese can be right by saying they didn't kill a single korean or chinese in WW2 if they refuse to believe the fact. </div></blockquote>wat is true to u? why u believe in this 'true' and not abt others?

God made the world and the universe.<br>2. If we agree with point 1, then point 2 is God sets the rules.<br>3. God is also a God that cannot stand sin and wickedness.<br>4. God decides what He decides. Its His perogative.<br><br>Job 40:1<br>1 Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said:<br>2"Shall the one who contends with the Almighty correct Him?<br>He who rebukes God, let him answer it."<br><br>Job 40:6-9<br>6Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said:<br>7"Now prepare yourself like a man;<br>I will question you, and you shall answer Me:<br>8"Would you indeed annul My judgment?<br>Would you condemn Me that you may be justified?<br>9Have you an arm like God?<br>Or can you thunder with a voice like His?<br><br>That said, you take the story of Noah out of context. Before the God sent the flood, this was what God saw..<br><br>Genesis 6<br><br>Genesis 6:11<br>11The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 12So God looked upon the earth, and indeed it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.<br><br><strong>So the context here is already different from your stipulated example. EVERYONE was corrupt and mankind was wicked.</strong><br><br>Genesis 6:5-7<br>5Then the LORD<strong> saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. 6And the LORD was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. 7So the LORD said, "I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth, both man and beast, creeping thing and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them."<br><br>[b]However the Lord saved Noah because this is what the Lord said about Noah</strong><br><br>Genesis 6:9<br><strong>9This is the genealogy of Noah. Noah was a just man, perfect in his generations. Noah walked with God. </strong><br><br>Genesis 7:1<br>1 Then the LORD said to Noah, "Come into the ark, you and all your household, because I have seen that you are righteous before Me in this generation.<br><br>But before the flood He did give warning to the people, He told Noah to build an ark. FYI, the before the rain of 40days, there was no rain, only mist to water the earth. So all the people thought Noah was mad...<br><br>In Genesis 8:21<br><br>21And the LORD smelled a soothing aroma. Then the LORD said in His heart, "I will never again curse the ground for man's sake, although the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; nor will I again destroy every living thing as I have done.<br><br>God said He would never destroy the world like He did before, therefore in order to satisfy the fact that God is HOLY and cannot stand sin, He sent His only son to die for us while we were yet sinners. So that we could be reconciled to Him. So this is God's showing us He loved us. But still He loves you enough not to force you, you have to make the choice, the way is there and the requirements are clear, so if you do not want to do them, they you reap the consequences. God loves the buddhists as people. They have a choice. Following from my points, God sets the rules, you choose if you want to play by them.<br><br>About the tower of Babel, I will answer that in the next post.<br><br></div>

And they used<br>brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar.<br>4 And they said, "Come, let us build for ourselves<br>a city, and a tower whose top will reach into<br>heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name; lest<br>we be scattered abroad over the face of the whole<br>earth."<br>5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the<br>tower which the sons of men had built.<br>6 And the LORD said, "Behold, they are one people,<br>and they all have the same language. And this is<br>what they began to do, and now nothing which they<br>purpose to do will be impossible for them."<br>7 "Come, let Us go down and there confuse their<br>language, that they may not understand one<br>another's speech."<br>8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from there<br>over the face of the whole earth; and they stopped<br>building the city.<br>9 Therefore its name was called Babel, because<br>there the LORD confused the language of the whole<br>earth; and from there the LORD scattered them<br>abroad over the face of the whole earth (Genesis<br>11:1-9 NAS).<br>In this classic story from the Old Testament of the Bible, the<br>people of the Earth were building a colossal "staged temple-tower or<br>multi-storeyed ziggurat" (Douglas 111). Two questions might<br>immediately come to mind: What was the purpose or significance of<br>the tower? And why were its builders punished?<br>Dr. Harold L. Willmington gives an eisegetical appraisal of the<br>situation. He submits that in reality they had no intention of<br>building a tower that would actually reach into heaven. As evidence<br>he points out that they chose as their construction site a plain in<br>Shinar when a mountaintop location would have spared them a<br>tremendous amount of work (53). Willmington alleges the true<br>intentions of the builders:<br>Actually, the purpose of the tower was to provide a<br>common religious center as a rallying point, lest the<br>people be scattered. The builders of the tower were in<br>open defiance of God's command (Genesis 9:1) (53).<br>In the ninth chapter of Genesis, God commands Noah and his sons<br>to "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth" (9:1 NAS). On the<br>fifth day of the creation of the Earth, God gave this command to the<br>birds and fishes (Gen. 1:20-23). On the sixth day, God reiterated<br>this command to the pinnacles of creation, man and woman (Gen.<br>1:26-2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. Humanity was to subjugate the untamed Earth by dispersing<br>themselves.<br>The builders in Shinar banded together for a common ecumenical<br>purpose. Genesis 11:6 suggests that this assembly would have given<br>rise to projects of a purely secular nature. The people did not<br>consider that their misguided enthusiasm may have been just a bit<br>shortsighted. Considering the benevolent, omniscient knowledge of<br>God it appears that the long-term consequences of the Tower of Babel<br>might have resulted in a plight similar to the apostate state of<br>humanity (Gen. 6:1-5) prior to the sanctifying flood of the entire<br>Earth (Gen. 6:6-24).<br>Genesis 9:18-19 and the entire tenth chapter of Genesis contain<br>the Table of the Nations. All of the people alive at the time of<br>Babel were descended solely from the three sons of Noah.<br>Consequently, Shem, Ham and Japheth are the fathers of modern<br>civilization. Hayes remarks that Genesis 10 is specifically written<br>to demonstrate that all humanity descended from these three men<br>(146). As Noah was a virtuous man in the eyes of God (Gen. 6:8-9),<br>it is reasonable to presume that the commandments of God were passed<br>on to his sons.<br>Genesis chapter 10, verses 5, 20 and 32 also suggest that the<br>land of the Earth was physically divided at this time in response to<br>Babel. Genesis specifies: ". . . the name of the one was Peleg,<br>for in his days the earth was divided . . ." (10:25). Willmington<br>comments that "Peleg" means "division" (53). The coastal outlines<br>of the Earth's continents suggest the likely prior unification of<br>the various land masses. The terra firma can be viewed as a<br>once-unified puzzle now separated into its various fragments.<br>It is important to note that although chapter 10 precedes the<br>account of Babel in chapter 11, the events described in both<br>chapters are not rendered in a chronologically consecutive fashion.<br>Accordingly, it must be understood that the tenth chapter of Genesis<br>details events prior, during and after those described in chapter<br>11. Chapter 12 of Genesis portrays the beginning of God's<br>redemptive plan commencing with the call of Abram.<br>Despite the bleak future of Babel, God had promised Himself<br>never to destroy the Earth with a flood again due to the<br>disobedience of mankind (Gen. 8:20-22). God also made a covenant<br>with Noah, his descendents and "every living creature," that He<br>would never again destroy the Earth with a flood. Genesis 9:8-17<br>affirms that the rainbow serves as a personal reminder to God of His<br>covenant.<br>Accordingly, God separated the people to different lands and<br>languages to frustrate their self-destructive plans. Determined to<br>stay faithful to His covenant, this was God's only merciful<br>alternative in response to the tower. If the people were punished,<br>it was a light affliction administered. The reproof was quite mild<br>compared to the prior worldwide flood (Gen. 7:21-23). Similarly,<br>the rebuke of God at Babel hardly parallels the subsequent fiery<br>obliteration of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 19:24-30).<br>Although at a casual glance this rebellion appears benign, it<br>has been demonstrated that this autonomous or self-governing spirit<br>would likely prove to be self-destructive. Willmington points out<br>that the first person plural pronouns "us" and "we" occur no less<br>than 5 times in this King James Version rendering of one sentence:<br>And they said, Go to, let us build us a city, and a<br>tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make<br>us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of<br>the whole earth (Gen. 11:4) (50).<br>Nowhere in the entire passage referring to the Tower of Babel is<br>there found the slightest indication that the builders considered<br>God's will in their plans. The Bible goes to great lengths to<br>confirm God's disdain for society's self-ruling ecumenical pursuits.<br>The Psalmist writes of God's intervention into the affairs of<br>humanity:<br>The LORD nullifies the counsel of the nations; He<br>frustrates the plans of the peoples (Psalm 33:10 NAS).<br>Archaeologists have long desired to locate the Tower of Babel.<br>They have been unfruitful in their efforts. There may be Scriptural<br>evidence for why the ruins have not been found. The land of Shinar<br>is shown in Zechariah 5:11 as a site for the city of Babylon. The<br>ancient city of Babylon was located some 80 kilometers south of<br>modern-day Baghdad, Iraq (Douglas 111). The Bible confirms that<br>Babel and Babylon were both located in Shinar. Of the history of<br>the Tower of Babel, Hayes states:<br>This episode (Gen. 11:1-9) was included . . . as the<br>capstone of . . . primeval history. . . . The original<br>story was . . . to explain the existence of multiple<br>language groups with its play on the words Babel<br>(Babylon) and babal ("confuse") (146).<br>Babylon is an apostate city frequently mentioned in the Old<br>Testament. From 2nd Kings 17:24 through Zechariah 6:10 there are at<br>least 257 direct references to Babylon (Strong's 94-95). Webster's<br>Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary defines ancient Babylon as: ". . .<br>a city devoted to materialism and the pursuit of sensual pleasure"<br>(122). In the 18th chapter of the Book of Revelation, Babylon<br>epitomizes mankind's final organized rebellion against the<br>sovereignty of God and is utterly destroyed. This parallels the<br>destruction of ancient Babylon, overthrown pursuant to the prophecy<br>of the 13th chapter of Isaiah.<br>Babel's founder was Nimrod the Hunter (Gen. 10:8-12), who also<br>was a "king of Shinar" (Webster's 79<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. Nimrod was a ruthless<br>conqueror of the ancient day with ambitious political aspirations<br>(Willmington 53). Willmington states: "Nimrod's name means 'let us<br>revolt'" (53). Genesis 10:9-12 shows that Babel was the first of<br>many cities that Nimrod established.<br>The Assyrian capital of Nineveh is enumerated (Gen. 10:11) as<br>one of the many cities built by Nimrod. The prophecy of the Book of<br>Jonah records God's solemn warning to the city to repent of its evil<br>ways. God sent the reluctant prophet Jonah to deliver the<br>admonition. Nineveh immediately repented. However, the prophecy of<br>the Book of Nahum declares that God's judgment would fall on the<br>subsequently backsliding and unrepentant Nineveh and that they would<br>be pillaged by the Babylonians, Scythians and the Medes.<br>In Genesis 11:5-7 an exceptionally rare and uncommon event<br>occurred. God personally visited the Tower of Babel to see what was<br>going on. Later, God paid a visit to the twin cities of Sodom and<br>Gomorrah to ascertain the degree of depravity of their inhabitants.<br>These cities were completely disintegrated by a fiery earthquake<br>metaphorically referred to as a "furnace" (Gen. 19:24-29).<br>Bible scholars believe that Sodom and Gomorrah stood at the<br>south end of what is now known as the Dead Sea (Douglas 944). As<br>with the Tower of Babel, Sodom and Gomorrah have never been found by<br>archaeologists. Isaiah prophesies of the forthcoming destruction<br>and perpetual desolation of Babylon. Babylon was sentenced to be<br>overthrown in a manner similar to the calamity executed upon Sodom<br>and Gomorrah:<br>And Babylon, the beauty of kingdoms, the glory of the<br>Chaldeans' pride, Will be as when God overthrew Sodom and<br>Gomorrah. It will never be inhabited or lived in from<br>generation to generation; Nor will the Arab pitch his<br>tent there, Nor will shepherds make their flocks lie down<br>there (Isaiah 13:19-20 NAS).<br>The cities of Babylon, Sodom, and Gomorrah reached unrepentant<br>stages of iniquity and therefore doomed themselves to destruction.<br>Contrarily, God frustrated the efforts of the builders at Babel<br>before they reached the point of no return. God thwarted their<br>plans in His benevolent omniscience.<br>So, the modern word "babbler" referring to an incoherent<br>individual has its roots in the Tower of Babel. Since they could<br>not communicate with one another, tempers flared and immediate<br>anarchy resulted. Each person appeared completely unintelligible in<br>their speech to the other, culminating in utter chaos.<br>The NIV Study Bible declares the meaning associated with Babel:<br>". . . The word is of Akkadian origin and means 'gateway to a god .<br>. .'" (23). The NIV Study Bible describes 4 other known temples or<br>ziggurats and the meanings associated with their names. First, at<br>Larsa, "The House of the Link between Heaven and Earth." Second, at<br>Borsippa, "The House of the Seven Guides of Heaven and Earth."<br>Thirdly, at Babylon, "The House of the Foundation-Platform of Heaven<br>and Earth." Lastly, at Asshur, "The House of the Mountain of the<br>Universe" (23). There is a common theme of "stairway to heaven" in<br>all of these names and parallels the desire to build a tower to<br>heaven as indicated in Genesis 11:4.<br>There is a method for unlocking the history written in the<br>Bible. The stories and events depicted in the Old Testament are<br>often reversed, reiterated, repeated or redefined in the New<br>Testament. Applying this concept facilitates interpretation of the<br>Bible and greatly enhances its dramatic impact upon the reader.<br>With this in mind, a parallel can be drawn between Genesis<br>11:1-9 and a significant event found in the Book of Acts. This<br>event is accepted as the beginning of the Church Age. However, the<br>two events are inversely correlated. In Acts, the disciples of<br>Jesus are at work bringing converts into the Christian church.<br>Jesus Christ's promise of the Holy Spirit to the believers (Luke<br>24:49; John 14:26, 15:26, 16:7; Acts 1:5, <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> is about to manifest.<br>God then acts to unite His followers in the proper fashion:<br>When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in<br>one place. Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a<br>violent wind came from Heaven and filled the whole house<br>where they were sitting. They saw what seemed to be<br>tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each<br>of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit<br>and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled<br>them (Acts 2:1-4 NIV).<br>When the resurrected Christ sent the Holy Spirit to the<br>disciples it confirmed that the "stairway to heaven" sought by the<br>ancients had been established. However, this gateway was not<br>accomplished by human initiative or effort but by the supernatural<br>power and grace of God. The timing and purpose were of God's<br>determination, not of the people. The Book of Acts details the<br>marvelous accomplishments by the Christians empowered by the Holy<br>Spirit.<br>And not only were their spirits united, but the language barrier<br>was broken. The disunity initiated by the scattering at the tower<br>of Babel has begun to be reversed and this time God gets the glory:<br>Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from<br>every nation under heaven. When they heard this sound, a<br>crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one<br>heard them speaking in his own language. Utterly amazed,<br>they asked: "Are not all these men who are speaking<br>Galileans? Then how is it that each of us hears them in<br>his own native language? Parthians, Medes and Elamites;<br>residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Capadocia, Pontus and<br>Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya<br>near Cyrene; visitors from Rome (both Jews and converts<br>to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs--we hear them declaring<br>the wonders of God in our own tongues! (Acts 2:5-11<br>NIV).<br>The Apostle Peter preaches in Acts 2:14-41 sharing the Gospel of<br>Jesus Christ to all who were attending. There is debate whether the<br>tongues were actual foreign languages or a supernatural<br>understanding (Acts 2:8, 11). Barclay argues against the<br>manifestation of foreign languages in this event (21-22).<br>The Tower of Babel is extremely significant to the epic of the<br>Bible. <strong>The story is much more than God indiscriminately<br>interrupting an insignificant building project. The Tower of Babel<br>marks the origins of the nations of the Earth. Will its mistakes be<br>repeated by future generations?</strong></div>
