About challenging god, first it is not mentioned as a reason for building the tower in the bible, second if god is so perfect, why will he be jealous of men achievement or fear challenge from  men so much so he sabotaged them ?<br><br><blockquote>no, i m not clear with the explanation, and in fact more confused. if ur idea of a cruel god is one that kill indiscriminately...that i understand...but now that u are saying nobody really got zapped by GOD and so there is no god.<br><br>My questions:<br><br>1) Do u think GOD is cruel?<br><br>or<br><br>2) Do u think he simply never exist? </blockquote>U get it wrong. I believe god never exists. BUT christian believe he do. I am telling u EVEN IF god exist as mentioned in the bible, HE is a cruel god. It is very much like one of the method of proving a scientific theory wrong. First it is assumed to be true first, then the later impossiblity of it being true and the contradiction it brings is discussed. U do not have to be a believer to comment.<br><br>It is like someone saying country XYZ have black snow because it is cold. U can argue tat even though XYZ may be cold, it couldn't have come out black snow. Or saying tat even if noah ark exists, mathematically it couldn't possibly hold so much animals and food. Same as god "zapping" people. Even if (it is a hypothesis) god exists as wat christian like to believe,  he is still a cruel and not a god of love because he himself say he killed a lot of people.<br><br>And the point about zapping people NOW is because a person is zapped in such a supernatural way, it will tend to lead people to believe tat god exists. But no such thing really happen in real life so it is a sign tat god is unlikely to exist.<br><br><blockquote>If u believe in 2), then u cannot believe in 1). Hope u can make up ur mind. </blockquote>If I believe in 1, it never means I cannot argue from a christian perspective.<br><br><blockquote>now u say u are arguing from the bible's perspective.....how can the bible perspective that GOD can be cruel since it is the very word of GOD? it just doesn't make sense. is this ur own perspective and not christians/bible's? </blockquote>WHy not ? It really is written as such. The things I said r really true such as many people r killed by god. In fact in the whole human knowledge, god probably is the being tat killed the most living things<br><br><blockquote>Debate on existence of God can be done in another thread if you want.</blockquote>things have already started as such, why not just carry on.

U claimed god never say they will be scattered, but surely he never say they will be together anyway. So they didn't break any rule or law or distrust god because he never specified it. An hypothetical example is god never specify tat men cannot wear red shirt, but he actually don't want them towear it. If one day u r punished for wearing red when u don't know, is it fair ? So wat is wrong with making a tower to grouped together ? About making a name for themselves, can't they make it for their future decendents ? Just like the pyramids or great walls, to show the work to their ancesters. Even if they build it to show god, why is it wrong ?

They could have use their unity to do something good for the good of mankind, but instead they chose to construct a tower that reach the heavens. Why do u think they want to do that?

They were punish because they were united and without dispute among them, and god fear they can achieve almost anything and therefore confuse them. They never say they can be like god, they specifically say they build the tower to prevent them from being scattered. Even god himself <span style="font-style: italic;">never</span> say they r building a tower to challenge him.
