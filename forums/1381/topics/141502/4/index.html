EVERYONE was corrupt and mankind was wicked. </blockquote>as said before, God find almost EVERYONE corrupted. He find almost everyone in noah world corrupted, he find sodom corrupted, midianites corrupted, egytians corrupted and he probably find animals, who never eat any fruit of wisdom corrupted. And wat do u do when u find a person is corrupted, do u try to change their ways or u kill them ? Well, god kill them ! Do he change the world filled with violence by more violence such as killing them ? He kill them as though he is restarting the computer ! Is tat love ? Do u kill your love one if he do not behave as much as u like him to ? As said in my previous statement, they seems to be living well together inthe world.<br><br><blockquote>21And the LORD smelled a soothing aroma. Then the LORD said in His heart, "I will never again curse the ground for man's sake, although the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; nor will I again destroy every living thing as I have done. </blockquote>Well, tat is obviously a lie since according to revelation, the world is gonna come to an end in a dramatic way. He do not intend to stop the judgement day is a sign he is gonna destroy living things as like noah ark.<br><br><blockquote>God said He would never destroy the world like He did before, therefore in order to satisfy the fact that God is HOLY and cannot stand sin, He sent His only son to die for us while we were yet sinners. So that we could be reconciled to Him. So this is God's showing us He loved us. But still He loves you enough not to force you, you have to make the choice, the way is there and the requirements are clear, so if you do not want to do them, they you reap the consequences. God loves the buddhists as people. They have a choice. Following from my points, God sets the rules, you choose if you want to play by them. </blockquote>Why not send his son earlier instead of killing everyone ? Is tat a sign of loving ? These people without laws and without christ and without any love from god surely goes to hell isn't it ? Is tat love to these people ? He cannot stand sin so he sent his son and we can sin (OT laws) all we want after ? tat is again incredulous. If he cannot stand sins he cannot stand men since all men r sinners. How to love something and can't stand it at the same time ? About buddhist, no matter wat u say, sending them to hell is a sign he does not love buddhist. He knwo it is a lousy placy where he keep his most hatred enemies, yet he send them there to be tortured eternally. God set the rules, the rules say non-believers and buddhist rot in hell and it tat shows god does not love all, only his believers. Well, talking about reaping consequence, do u blame yourself to be a christian ? Lets say the real god is, well, muslim god and he will send his wrath to christian who do not listen to his last prophet. So u think u should reap the consequences of hell eternal just because u r a christian now ? Should u be blamed for being  christian ?<br><br>For tower of babel, for goodness sake can u use your own points ?

So u tend to agree tat god treats himself as king and we as slaves and he can treat us as bad and unfair as he like<br><br><blockquote>Dare you challenge God?

Even if there is god, he probably just make himself sound better but putting credit all to himself and not wat as he described himself to be and we shouldn't fear him.<br><br><blockquote>You miss the point about the flood, the people were all wicked in GOD's sight and He is a righteous and HOLY God, who cannot stand sin.

A lot of his decision is almost unfair and cannot be righteous. And about u saying god gives his son (or give himself since they r the same...) for himself and then enables everyone to sin happily seems to contradict the idea he hates sins. Isn't tis incredibly silly ? he hates sin, he kill himself to offer to himself then everyone can sin since all the sin is carried by him. Meaning he have numerically more sins than anyone else which he should really detest and then he love all of the sinners who he should really hate.  It doesn't even sound logical. If sin is tranferable then it is probably the most unfair and silliest system in the world. If he knew we were never sinless, then why ask us to become one ? I mean if u made a doll tat can't sing, do u blame the doll for not singing or blame yourself ?<br><br><blockquote>It is hard enough to sacrifice your self for someone you love, how much more difficult to sacrifice your one and only son whom you love for people you do not know so that He can accomplish that which He desired, the salvation of all mankind.

If he is powerless to save the world and have to kill his son, then it is sacrifice. But in here he sacrifice his son( or himself from trinity) TO HIMSELF, or to appease himself so he can forgive people ?!?!? Isn't tat logically wrong ? I kill myself so I can forgive my enemies ? I burn 1 million off so u don't have to return your 10 cents to me ? Why not just forget about the 10 cents and keep the 1 million dollars ? Why not just forgive your enemy without killing yourself ? Why not forgive men without killing christ (or strangely himself, something like committing suicide isn't it ?)<br><br><blockquote>God is a righteous God, He has certain requirements that have to be met, and instead of asking you to meet them, which we can never, He met them Himself for us so that we can spend eternity with Him.</blockquote>So u say in the end he finally realise he is wrong and REGRET, and structually change his standard ?

            <div class='col-md body'>That is why SIS, you have to understand the OT, this sets up the tone for who and what GOD is and HIS standards which must be met. He is first and foremost the King and God of the Jews.<br><br>In having salvation, it is not a licence to sin... because God will judge your heart, if you are careless with your salvation, you will lose it. Do not test God.<br><br>This is the Tower of Babel story from as told by the Jewish people... passed down through generations by word of mouth.<br><br>Mankind initially lives as one nation.<br><br>Nimrod declares himself a god and he becomes a tyrant King. He uses religion as a political instrument to impose his domination and will upon the masses. In his role as a god, Nimrod  defines good and evil to suit his needs.<br><br>This type of exploitation will be repeated many times throughout history.<br><br>As a system, this is unfortunately self-perpetuating. For example, many Pharaohs were deified. We know that some of the Pharaohs practiced Monotheism in their private life and they rejected paganism. Yet, they were compelled to act in public as a god so as not to disrupt the local religious establishment and industries.<br><br>Nimrod leads Mankind in rebellion against G-d.<br><br>Nimrod denies that G-d is involved with the affairs of the world. He disassociates the flood as an act of G-d's will and as a consequence of MankindÂ’s behavior. He supports a theory which proposes that the Great Flood was a natural and predictable event. You see, the flood occurred 1656 years after Creation. Obviously, the Earth experiences sky quakes that occur in cycles of 1656 years and they cause floods. Nimrod commissions the construction of a huge tower to hold back the sky to protect civilization from the next eruption.<br><br>He also intends to install an idol at the top of this tower.<br><br>G-d intervenes and suddenly instills seventy languages within the world population. The civilized world can no longer freely communicate. The language barriers cause strife and frustration. The construction of the tower comes to a halt. Mankind disperses and develops into seventy nations.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>This is the Tower of Babel story from as told by the Jewish people... passed down through generations by word of mouth. </blockquote>So actually no one really knew who is nimrod for sure other than he a hunter and son of cush. According to history, there is really no record of him. If u wanna trust old wives tale, then probably there r countless examples such as Pang Gu or Nu Wa from chinese mythology or tooth fairies<br><br><blockquote>Nimrod declares himself a god and he becomes a tyrant King. He uses religion as a political instrument to impose his domination and will upon the masses. In his role as a god, Nimrod defines good and evil to suit his needs.<br><br>This type of exploitation will be repeated many times throughout history.<br><br>As a system, this is unfortunately self-perpetuating. For example, many Pharaohs were deified. We know that some of the Pharaohs practiced Monotheism in their private life and they rejected paganism. Yet, they were compelled to act in public as a god so as not to disrupt the local religious establishment and industries. </blockquote>Well, in the end men still lived with kings. Nothing different between before and after. Nobody formed a republic, but rather war between men started.  Isn't tat making it worse ? So wat is the point ?<br><br><blockquote>Nimrod leads Mankind in rebellion against G-d.<br><br>Nimrod denies that G-d is involved with the affairs of the world. He disassociates the flood as an act of G-d's will and as a consequence of MankindÂ’s behavior. He supports a theory which proposes that the Great Flood was a natural and predictable event. You see, the flood occurred 1656 years after Creation. Obviously, the Earth experiences sky quakes that occur in cycles of 1656 years and they cause floods. Nimrod commissions the construction of a huge tower to hold back the sky to protect civilization from the next eruption.<br><br>He also intends to install an idol at the top of this tower.<br><br>G-d intervenes and suddenly instills seventy languages within the world population. The civilized world can no longer freely communicate. The language barriers cause strife and frustration. The construction of the tower comes to a halt. Mankind disperses and develops into seventy nations. </blockquote>But the bible states<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">1Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. 2 As men moved eastward, [a] they found a plain in Shinar [b] and settled there.<br>3 They said to each other, "Come, let's make bricks and bake them thoroughly." They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar. 4 Then they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth."<br><br>5 But the LORD came down to see the city and the tower that the men were building. 6 The LORD said, "If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. 7 Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other."<br><br>8 So the LORD scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city. 9 That is why it was called Babel [c] Â—because there the LORD confused the language of the whole world. From there the LORD scattered them over the face of the whole earth. </span><br><br>The account of the bible, which is God's Words, said of a vastly different story of the tower of babel . The bible says as plain as day tat Men want to make a name for themselves and build a tower ONLY because they want to be united. The bible says tat God, after seeing men becoming united, decide to confuse, make them scattered and creates misunderstanding among men. And he do curse men simply for tat reason. The bible mentioned NOTHING about nimrod ! No one see anything about his idol tower ! There is no single word tat suggest men want a rebellion ! They r really 2 different accounts !<br><br>So come to tis, u rather believe in old wives tale and not your own bible ? U doubt god words ? If u doubt god word, then why not just simply believe in Pang Gu or Nu Wa as well since they maybe more reliable than the bible ?<br><br>Actually according to bible, Noah is actually nimrod great grandfather. (Noah-&gt;ham-&gt;cush-&gt;nimrod) Noah is one and he only have 3 sons. Altogther there is only a generations of people between nimrod and noah's sons (cush). How can he be a king and hunter of people when there is really little people ?</div>
