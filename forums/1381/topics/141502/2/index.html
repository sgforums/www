            <div class='col-md body'>The problem of laoda is really he blindly believe in faith and don't want to see any loopholes in it. He lump all these loop holes as "theology" but he seems to forgot the idea of faith is also a "theology" itself. Without theology, there is nothing to have faith on. Where is your faith founded on ? It is like meeting a stranger and have faith in him to be a good person just because the stranger ask him to do so. Even though he had performed countless times of bad actions and lie or contradict in several cases, he just dismissed all of them and insist he is a good person just because, well, I don't know wat u call these kind of people tat believe strangers without a doubt...<br><br>When told him tat faith can lead to wrong outcomes, he just say faith here faith there, when say tat we should use basic reasoning and logical deduction, he again say faith here and faith there etc. When say he is wrong about god being good and asking to show examples, he just say god is good and no examples. And abotu personal experiences, the peopel praying for 4D numbers from some idols have many interesting personal experiences in striking 4D as well.<br><br>Frankly, he is really a good example of how faith is really important for a religion. It makes u numb and do not use thinking or reasoning, everything in it is true true true and even though u have sufficiently show it is false, u just say it is true and totally dismiss the opposition. When ask a question to probe thinking, he totally do not even want to think and say I dunno and I don't wanna find out and watever the outcome, even though it show as plain as day somethign is wrong, he don't care and believe his faith is correct.<br><br>Tell u something,  when u believe, u should believe in the truth, not believe something u like to believe. If u think believing in something u like to believe is correct, then the japanese can be right by saying they didn't kill a single korean or chinese in WW2 if they refuse to believe the fact.</div>
