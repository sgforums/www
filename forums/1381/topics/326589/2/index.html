              <p>For <strong>God so Love the World</strong> that He sent His only Son Jesus...</p>
              <p>John 10:15 The reason my Father loves me(Jesus) is that <strong>I lay down my life</strong>—only to take it up again. <strong>No one takes it from me</strong>, but I lay it down of my own accord.</p>
              <p>on the cross<br>John 19:30 -...Jesus said, "It is finished." With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</p>
              <p>Romans 6:23 - For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
              <p>Hebrews 10:16 “This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the LORD: I(God) will put My laws into their hearts, and in their minds I(God) will write them,”then He adds, “<strong>Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more</strong>.”</p>
              <p>Hebrews 8:13 By calling this covenant "new," he has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and aging will soon disappear.</p>

              <li>You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me, (<em>Deuteronomy 5:9</em>)</li>

              </ul>
              <p>Now the people complained about their hardships in the hearing of the Lord, and when he heard them his anger was aroused. Then fire from the Lord burned among them and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp (Num11:1).</p>
              <p>The earth trembled and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains shook, they trembled because he was angry. Smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it (Ps 18:7-8).</p>
              <p>Serve the Lord with fear and trembling, kiss his feet or else he will get angry and you will perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled (Ps 2:11).</p>

              <p>A Samaritan Village Rejects the Savior</p>
              <p>Luke 9:54 - And when His disciples James and John saw this, they said, “Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them, just as Elijah did?” But <strong>He turned and rebuked them</strong>, and said, “You do not know what manner of spirit you are of. For the Son of Man <strong>did not come to destroy men’s lives but to save them</strong>.”And they went to another village.</p>
              <p>Don't be confused. We are <strong>Christ</strong>ian , we believe in Jesus <strong>Christ.</strong> The Just God has Judged all our sin in the body of Jesus, and the Love of God has send Him. Now it's only for us to believe. </p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I think we should not be too hasty to say that only "good Christians" will go to heaven, or even only Christians will go to heaven. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I will share with you some alternative views which you can consider. Afterall, not all Christians believe the same things. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Firstly - Heaven is not a place but a state of being</span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In Luke 17:20-21, when asked when the kingdom of God will come, Jesus’ answer was, “<em>The Kingdom of God does not come in such a way as to be seen. No one will say, ‘Look, here it is!’ or, ‘There it is!’ because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Kingdom of God is</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">within you</span>.”</em></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">So, if heaven is within us, then it is a state of being not a place. Jesus has already said so. So if the kingdom of God is in us, and God resides in his kingdom, then God is in us. This divine potential is in all of us.</span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Secondly – will all Christians go to heaven? Jesus said no</span></span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Even Jesus has said: <em>“Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.”</em> (Matthew 7:21)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">So not only those who converted to Christianity and go to church will go to heaven.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Thirdly<span>  </span>-who are “good Christians” any? See what Jesus said</span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">In Luke (chapter 10). Jesus told a lawyer one love one’s neighbour. The lawyer </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">asked: “So who is my neighbor?"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In reply Jesus said: "<em>A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, took him to an inn and took care of him. The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper. 'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.'</em></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Jesus then asked the lawyer "Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?"</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">The lawyer replied, "The one who had mercy on him."</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Jesus told him, "Go and do likewise."</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">You see, a Priest is a respected religious leader in Jewish society. A Levite also holds a high position in Jewish society as they are assigned to conduct religious rites for the Jewish people. However, Samaritans are of mixed marriages between Jews and non-Jews. The Jews do not consider them pure Jews and treat them as outcasts. They are despised by the Jews as only Jews are considered God’s “chosen people”. However, the Samaritan is the only one who stopped to help the injured man. Jesus considers him as the only one of the three having the <strong>TRUE spirit of Christianity</strong>.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">So to draw a parallel, I see it that in modern day, Christians now are similar to the Jews' status in the past, the so-called “chosen” people of God. And non-Christians are like the Samaritans. But if are not a Christian in name but practise love and compassion, even if you are a Samaritan or a non-Christian, you too have exercised the true spirit of Christ and as such according to Jesus – I believe what Jesus is saying is you are <strong>ACCEPTABLE</strong> to him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">So we should try not to be too quick to judge and say only Christians or good Christians go to heaven. That's too simple a thinking, don't you think?</span></p>

              <p>don't forget why Jesus answer in this way.. the verse before yours</p>
              <p>Luke 10:27 He (the lawyer)<strong> </strong>answered: " 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"<br><br>"You have answered correctly," Jesus replied.

              <p>This guy act blur right? He is the expert in the law yet he don't know?? So the best impact is to illustrate using his enemy as what Jesus did...</p>
              <p><span id="en-NIV-29423" class="sup">Philippians 3:17- </span>Join with others in following my example, brothers, and take note of those who live according to the pattern we gave you.

Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is on earthly things. But <strong>our citizenship is in heaven</strong>. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, who,
