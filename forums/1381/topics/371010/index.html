              First according to the bible there was no death. Adam and Eve lived in Eden, they conversed with God on even daily basis. Though Men didn't know evil and good they were going to live forever.
              <br><br>
              Satan who despises Adam and Eve wanted to destroy mankind. Through deceit it fooled Eve and Adam to break God's commandment thus sinned. And through sin death was created for the wage of sins is death.
              Cast out of Eden and now cursed to live with their own hands, the descendants of Adam and Eve struggle in life only to die in the end. Death was their only end. That is they cease to live and cease to enjoy life. All men died without hope, they fell into nothingness deprived of the blessings of life. 
              <br><br>
              Seeing the hopelessness of men, God decided to offer mankind salvation, a way out of the misery and hopelessness of death. God wanted to break His own commandment God wanted to forever vanguish death that has taken its toll on every human since the day of Adam and Eve. God wanted to restore mankind to grace and to give them LIFE. Not just a life but THE LIFE. This is where Jesus is meant. Jesus is to restore mankind to its grace in the eyes of God thus to be saved and freed from the doom of death and the impending punishment.<br><br>
              God never wanted death to prevail. He made His plans known through His prophets that there will be judgment after death. <b>That there will be an end to death</b>. God offered THE LIFE to those who honor Him in life and to those who believed in Christ. So that everyone who believed in God and honor Him in their life could hope that not even death would deprive them of the good things that have been promised to those who honor God. The dead In Christ could rest and be assured of their salvation even after they died. Not only God offers THE LIFE but He will put His chosen people in charge over powers. That God will give power to rule with Christ to anyone He chooses. God will even grant some people THE LIFE so that they may escape the bondage of death earlier, much earlier so that they could enjoy life as soon as possible. So that Christ died so some would be raised just like Him. In fact Christ died so that all will be raised and restored to life and grace just like Him
              <br><br>
              To the end of death and to the best of life!

              <p>1st ,their organ can be donate to the needy people.</p>
              <p>2nd, it will show that there is a better place after dead.</p>
              <p>3rd, who know they don't dead after jumping down from the 40 or 73 floor. as their ominpotent GOD is a miracle GOD.</p>
              <p>4th,make sure your entire saving or CPF put my name.</p>
              <p>Lastly, it is not a sin if they are dead their organ can be donated to the needy people and it eliminated the illegal way of purchase organ from the poor country .</p>

              <p>You were an angel, you have died, and you were put in
              heaven straight away. This here is heaven, stupid. And it is
              spoilt by angels who are not qualified to be in heavean, because
