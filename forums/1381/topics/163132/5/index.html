It's not too late. God loves you. He cares for you no matter what circumstances you are in. Pray this right now: Dear God in heaven, thank you for sending Jesus to die for my sins. I receive this forgiveness &amp; cleansing of my sins-everyone of them from the day i was born up to now. I thank you that if i confess my sins, he is faithful &amp; just to forgive me of all my sins &amp; to cleanse me from all my unrighteousness. Yes, thank you Father once again. I receive Jesus Christ into my heart &amp; I confess that Jesus Christ is my Lord &amp; Saviour. Amen.<br><br>Pls pray right now! Satan is accusing you before God making you feel guilty. God is waiting for you. Amen.</div></blockquote>God! I pray you release this JTB's poor soul from the clutches of the Devil and dissolve his mistakes! Let him see what is truely right and not the Devil's warped vision of "rightousness". Amen.</div>

David raped Bathsheba &amp; killed her husband but God still loves him. Abraham lied but God preserved him. Jacob cheated but God still loves him. Solomon went astray but God still loves him. Saul killed Stephen but later became Paul the greatest Apostle to the gentiles. Peter denied Jesus 3 times but Jesus mentioned him by name when He resurrected. Rahab, Mary Magdalene etc were prostitutes but God still saved them. So many stories of ugly sinners. Jesus said it's the sinners not the righteous who needs forgiveness.</div>
