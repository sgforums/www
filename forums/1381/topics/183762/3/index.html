            <div class='col-md body'>NT2,<br>very long post on your POV, something that I hope you did in your very first post, then all those earlier post would have been required.<br><br>I will take my time to slowly read your post a few times before I will reply, lest I mis understand your view,<br><br>one thing though, on the part where you quoted Paul's letter to the Corinthians, are you refering to 1 Cor 11:17-34, and the part where you talk about a person that is not worthy should not take the communion. This is a miss-interpretation of the scripture.<br><br>First, the word used is unworthily (KJV), unworthy manner (NAS, NIV), meaning its refering to the manner the people are taking the communion, and not whether the person is worthy or not (else, all of us (maybe its just me) cannot take communion, cause if it depends on me being worthy, sure fail one)<br><br>Second, the whole passage is on how the Corinthians parttake the communion, where some who is first in line, take all the bread (glutton) and drink all the wine (drunk), while those behind them had none left to take.<br><br>to use this verses as a quote to show that an unworthy person should not take the communion is a mis-quote of the scripture.<br><br>like I said at the begining, I will answer the rest of your view later, after I read them again.<br><br>God bless. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"....Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, ...'take and eat; this is my body.' Then he took the cup, ....'Drink from it. all of you. This is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins." Matthew 26:26 - 29<br><br>""...'this is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me....this cup is the new covenant in my blood, do this, whenever you drink it ,in remembrance of me. For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes." 1 Cor.<br><br>What Jesus said when he instituted the Holy Communion, and what Paul said to the Corithians is clear. Holy Communion is <span style="color: red;">to remember </span>the the body of Christ that was broken for us, the covenant of the blood that was shed for us, and we eat and drink this cup <span style="color: red;">to proclaim </span>the Lord's death till he comes. It is not my opinion, it is what Jesus said.<br><br>Nothing is said about the power to heal , like the "bronze snake" that Moses put up to heal those bitten by snake?<br><br>God may choose to heal us when we confessed our sins in our daily devotion, or after a prayer in a fellowship or CG meeting, or after partaking in a Holy Communion.  But that does not mean daily devotion, fellowship or CG meetings or Holy Communion have healing power. The power to heal is with God. This is not just my opinion, what is what I firmly believe.<br><br>To preach the power of healing in Holy Communion to the extent of using milo and biscuits for Holy Communion at a patient's bedside is Heresy.<br><br>Next time the church can sell the wine and the bread meant for Holy Communion to members as health supplements. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br>Yes, I agree that the bread is the body of Christ broken for us, and the cup is the blood of the covenant shed for us.<br>The reason of parttaking the communion is to remember Christ [personal interpretation: also include the reasons/purpose why Christ have to go through all these for us].<br><br>It does not means there is any supernatual healing in the bread alone, it means when taking the bread which when taking, we are to remember the body of Christ broken for us (why? Isaiah 53:4-6, He was beaten that we may be made whole, whipped that we may be healed, actually Isa53-55 is a good place to read in regards to the salvation plan of God), its knowing that Christ had paid the price that we can have the faith and confidence to believe God for our healing and restoration.<br>oh yes, cannot forget the Blood, very important also, the new covenant sealed in His blood, shed for the forgiveness of our sins, to enter into His covenant of everlasting love(Isa 54: 9-10).<br><br>If we were to treat the Communion as, ok loh, remember remember loh, and without really understand the purpose of Christ's suffering and death, we are not really giving honor to Him who died suffer and died on the cross for us.<br>God Bless.</div>
