            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding this topic, perhaps you will allow me to share an experience close to my heart. i have close relative, who is also a member of New Creation Church.<br><br>When her brother died at an early age of 20, she keeps trying to "resurrect" him through Holy Communion at the wake. She forced us to do Holy Communion with her 5-6 times at the wake.  Of course, her brother is not resurrected. And the result is as expected, she broke down and felt confused. It is only when i told her, that while praying, i saw an image of her brother waving and seemingly happy to be on his way to heaven (which is indeed what i saw in my mind), that she can be calmed.<br><br>I wondered then, why and where she gets the idea that Holy Communion can heal and can resurrect a person. Dont have the heart to ask her why then. Now thanks to NT2 and vince for pointing these out, i do get an idea although will be careful to say that this pdf article might not or is the sole cause of influence.<br><br>Having a perception that by partaking Holy Communion, we can be healed - actually misunderstood and debunk the ultimate price that Jesus paid on the Cross. Whether or not, healing takes place - is always dependent not on our works  nor our efforts, but by the Love and Wisdom of God to want to do so.  We can intercede and pray, yes. Then we wait.

            <div class='col-md body'>The memorial meal of our Lord using the food of those days (ie.Bread and Wine) is for practical and symbolic reasons. Using milo and bread as Holy Communion is fine..if one knows what that 2 food means. And under normal circumstances, we use bread and wine because there isnt any emergency to talk about in the first place. The sacrament is not an urgent food you must die die take before you die or for urgent healing. as such, using milo and bread is not acceptable.<br><br>I am not against using non-bread and non-wine to celebrate communion. Some denominations use Ribena and Crackers for their Lord's Supper and that is pefectly fine because we remember His passion and celebrate this sacrament in spirit and in truth. Not looking at the brand of wafer and type of wine. Injecting an element of  superstition...so desperate for healing that leads a person to run ro a convenient mart to get milo and bread for the supposely miracle-attached meal is something to rethink about.<br><br></div>

The reason why the anglican church fathers spend Article 28 in the 39 articles of faith to the Lord's Supper is for a reason. It is because the problems and issues they face during those days over the Lord's Supper is similar to us. Due to uneducated people and the Bible being kept away from the christians they are unable to see for themselves the truths behind the practices they hold on to. This led to many superstitious beliefs over christian doctrines and rituals.</div>
