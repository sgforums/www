It is the personal confession of faith resulting in the person receiving the sacraments that matters.</div>

Then he took the cup, ....'Drink from it. all of you. This is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins." Matthew 26:26 - 29<br><br>""...'this is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me....this cup is the new covenant in my blood, do this, whenever you drink it ,in remembrance of me. For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes." 1 Cor.<br><br>What Jesus said when he instituted the Holy Communion, and what Paul said to the Corithians is clear. Holy Communion is <span style="color: red;">to remember </span>the the body of Christ that was broken for us, the covenant of the blood that was shed for us, and we eat and drink this cup <span style="color: red;">to proclaim </span>the Lord's death till he comes. It is not my opinion, it is what Jesus said.<br><br>Nothing is said about the power to heal , like the "bronze snake" that Moses put up to heal those bitten by snake?<br><br>God may choose to heal us when we confessed our sins in our daily devotion, or after a prayer in a fellowship or CG meeting, or after partaking in a Holy Communion.  But that does not mean daily devotion, fellowship or CG meetings or Holy Communion have healing power. The power to heal is with God. This is not just my opinion, what is what I firmly believe.<br><br>To preach the power of healing in Holy Communion to the extent of using milo and biscuits for Holy Communion at a patient's bedside is Heresy.<br><br>Next time the church can sell the wine and the bread meant for Holy Communion to members as health supplements. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">    </div></blockquote>i second diehard's opinion.</div>

I have even heard some christians said that all christians group should be "cell" group cause 'cell' has life, and if 'cell' does not grow then there is something wrong.<br><br>But I do quote from the Bible, not indiscriminately of couse. Certain verses in the Bible are not subject to different interpretation. "...gave his only begotten son...." there is no doubt Jesus is the son of God and there should have no other different interpretation. Certain words of comfort, such as "the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want...." is a lot more comforting than any other words man can use. I guess the intention of quoting from the Bible is important.</div>
