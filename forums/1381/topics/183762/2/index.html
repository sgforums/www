I shall use this post as a format to ans some of the questions.<br><br>before that are some disclaimer:<br>1. This discussion topic is for Christians who regularly partake the Communion to talk abt. If you have in no way taken Communion irregardless of which denomination then pls refrain from talking about something you never tasted before.<br><br>2. The views all solely from Bible. Not extra-biblical revelations because there isnt any revelations added on to what the Bible already has.<br><br>3. The discussion is not a post-modern one. Only absolute truth is accepted, truths of the Bible are never meant to be interpreted for individual use, stop fooling yourselves.<br><br>Ok...my POV<br><br>The Bible talks about Holy Communion aka Lord's Supper as some refer it as a Passover meal. The biblical significance of having such a meal of unleavened bread traces back to the first Passover when God in His mercy spared the obedient families of Israel by applying the blood of a lamb over their doorposts. Families disobedient to this instruction, Israelite or Egyptians have their firstborn son slained that very night. The death of the first born being the last and final plague God sent on the land of Egpyt and after that the people of God are free to leave the land of slavery.<br><br>In the New Testament days, the Passover is still being celebrated and being a good Jew, our Lord Jesus also observe the Feast. On the night before He was betrayed, arrested and went on trial, Jesus and His 12 disciples shared a Passover meal because that night is the Passover. The unleavened bread and wine used in this particular meal was Jesus way of helping the disciples remember Him. The bread symbolises His body which will be broken, the wine His blood shed as blood of the new covenant for the forgiveness of sins. These can be found in the gospels.<br><br>Apostle Paul later in his letter to the Corinthians further elabourated and emphasise the Communion, talking about not despising the holiness of this sacrament though how common the bread and wine seems to be. To profess in communion with the Lord Jesus while living in unworthy and sinful manner is to mock at our Lord Himself. The reason for the divine judgment on those who take it lightly. If one demands any particular use for the Lord's supper other than a memorial meal, it has to be evangelistic because Paul in his letter mentioned that when we partake of the Holy Communion, we proclaim His death on the cross till His second coming.<br><br>This basically is the Holy Communion teaching. Held by all sound, mainstream and bible-believing churches of all denominations.<br><br>Why NCC's Holy Communion is heretical and not jus that, plain thrash:<br><br>There are no evidence in the Bible where healing is 'through' the Holy Communion. In the Book of James, divine healing is given when a sick person is anointed with the oil and with prayer. Prayer of a righteous elder or church leader (eg. pastors/ deacons) If the Holy Communion can bring divine health as  NCC teaches, are the Apostles of those days trying to hide some secrets from the readers? Are they denying the Church for centuries the source of divine health? Are we saying that such new revelation comes only now?<br><br>As we read the plain Scriptures, there is absolutely without arguements that no where does the Bible says Holy Communion is God's gift to man as divine health. Jesus Himself is the one and the Lord being our healer. Yes, i agree that God can use any means to heal a person. If you are not a Christian scientist, God heals through the doctors and surgeons dont you know? God certainly can use the Holy Baptism or Communion to heal a person. But dont make God a vending machine by purposely taking Communion and demand that God heals you through that way. Who are you?<br><br>Heresy is another that sound Christian, from the Bible sources and yet is corrupted and erroneous. You take something from the Bible and make a nice twist and present to others as if its a new discovery. It's the same with the Da Vinci Code.

The biblical significance of having such a meal of unleavened bread traces back to the first Passover when God in His mercy spared the obedient families of Israel by applying the blood of a lamb over their doorposts. Families disobedient to this instruction, Israelite or Egyptians have their firstborn son slained that very night. The death of the first born being the last and final plague God sent on the land of Egpyt and after that the people of God are free to leave the land of slavery.<br><br>In the New Testament days, the Passover is still being celebrated and being a good Jew, our Lord Jesus also observe the Feast. On the night before He was betrayed, arrested and went on trial, Jesus and His 12 disciples shared a Passover meal because that night is the Passover. The unleavened bread and wine used in this particular meal was Jesus way of helping the disciples remember Him. The bread symbolises His body which will be broken, the wine His blood shed as blood of the new covenant for the forgiveness of sins. These can be found in the gospels.<br><br>Apostle Paul later in his letter to the Corinthians further elabourated and emphasise the Communion, talking about not despising the holiness of this sacrament though how common the bread and wine seems to be. To profess in communion with the Lord Jesus while living in unworthy and sinful manner is to mock at our Lord Himself. The reason for the divine judgment on those who take it lightly. If one demands any particular use for the Lord's supper other than a memorial meal, it has to be evangelistic because Paul in his letter mentioned that when we partake of the Holy Communion, we proclaim His death on the cross till His second coming.<br><br>This basically is the Holy Communion teaching. Held by all sound, mainstream and bible-believing churches of all denominations.<br><br>Why NCC's Holy Communion is heretical and not jus that, plain thrash:<br><br>There are no evidence in the Bible where healing is 'through' the Holy Communion. In the Book of James, divine healing is given when a sick person is anointed with the oil and with prayer. Prayer of a righteous elder or church leader (eg. pastors/ deacons) If the Holy Communion can bring divine health as  NCC teaches, are the Apostles of those days trying to hide some secrets from the readers? Are they denying the Church for centuries the source of divine health? Are we saying that such new revelation comes only now?<br><br>As we read the plain Scriptures, there is absolutely without arguements that no where does the Bible says Holy Communion is God's gift to man as divine health. Jesus Himself is the one and the Lord being our healer. Yes, i agree that God can use any means to heal a person. If you are not a Christian scientist, God heals through the doctors and surgeons dont you know? God certainly can use the Holy Baptism or Communion to heal a person. But dont make God a vending machine by purposely taking Communion and demand that God heals you through that way.
