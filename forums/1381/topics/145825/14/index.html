            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Saturday, August 27th, 2005<br>Pessimistic Pope sees Europe as unique in its drift from God</strong><br><br>Pope Benedict XVI gestures on top of a hill at Marienfeld, a former coal mine, near Cologne, western Germany, during a mass Sunday, Aug. 21, the final day of the 2005 World Youth Day. (Associated Press)<br>The rather pessimistic cultural outlook of Roman Catholic Pope Benedict XVI comes into sharp focus in an address the former Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger delivered a day before predecessor John Paul II died.<br><br>The speech, translated into English and posted on the Internet by zenit.org, says Europe has excluded God Â‘Â‘from the public conscienceÂ’Â’ in Â‘Â‘a manner unknown before now to humanity,Â’Â’ radically contradicting Christianity and all other religious and moral traditions.<br><br>Like John Paul, Benedict is distressed that the now-moribund European Union constitution deleted mention of the continentÂ’s Christian heritage, though itÂ’s a Â‘Â‘historical fact that no one can seriously deny.Â’Â’<br><br>Benedict says mention of Christianity wouldnÂ’t offend Jews, who share the continentÂ’s biblical heritage, or Muslims, Â‘Â‘who do not feel threatened by our Christian moral foundations, but by the cynicism of a secularized culture.Â’Â’<br><br>In an aside, Benedict says terrorism is based on modern secular modes of Â‘Â‘manÂ’s self-authorization, and not on the teachings of the QurÂ’an.Â’Â’<br><br>WhatÂ’s the impact when the biblical God is relegated to the past?<br><br>Benedict endorses many good results of the Enlightenment, that period when Europe began straying from medieval Christian roots, including Â‘Â‘freedom of religious choice,Â’Â’ the Â‘Â‘religious neutrality of the stateÂ’Â’ and democracy. But he warns that many dangers lurk when culture forsakes faith and morality.<br><br>He believes campaigns against Â‘Â‘discriminationÂ’Â’ are turning into attempts to limit churchesÂ’ freedom, for instance, to morally oppose homosexual activity or limit the clergy to males. More generally, he thinks the culture seeks to suppress influences stemming from religion.<br><br>A Â‘Â‘confused ideology of freedom leads to dogmatism, which is showing itself increasingly hostile to freedom,Â’Â’ he says.<br><br>The Pope believes that exclusion of God Â‘Â‘leads to the self-destruction of freedomÂ’Â’ and severs the roots that nourish morality and human decency, leading ultimately to Â‘Â‘contempt for man.Â’Â’<br><br>In particular, he thinks Â‘Â‘the gravest dangerÂ’Â’ of our time is that development of science and technology has not been matched by the moral strength which is the precondition for the security, freedom and dignity everyone yearns for.<br><br>Humanity has reached a point of biological Â‘Â‘self-manipulationÂ’Â’ and reconstruction, making the person no longer Â‘Â‘a gift of the CreatorÂ’Â’ but Â‘Â‘a product of our actionÂ’Â’ with traits selected according to various desires.<br><br>Instead of bearing the image of God, the manufactured human Â‘Â‘is no more than the image of man.Â’Â’<br><br>He concludes, Â‘Â‘The attempt, carried to the extreme, to manage human affairs disdaining God completely leads us increasingly to the edge of the abyss, to manÂ’s ever greater isolation from reality.Â’Â’<br><br>What happened to Europe? Benedict doesnÂ’t theorize but a USA Today survey of EuropeÂ’s secularization said Â‘Â‘unprecedented affluenceÂ’Â’ could be one reason for secularization.<br><br>But then, how to explain the wealthy but devout United States, which isnÂ’t examined in BenedictÂ’s speech?<br><br>USA Today said one consequence of religionÂ’s decline is a dearth of children, but that could just as easily be a cause of secularization.<br><br>Since U.S. history is so different, one useful factor could be EuropeÂ’s past warfare between Christians and its church-state entanglements Â— which Benedict says violated the faithÂ’s true nature.<br><br>In SwedenÂ’s World Values Survey of 2000, only 18 per cent of Americans said they Â‘Â‘neverÂ’Â’ or Â‘Â‘practically neverÂ’Â’ attend worship, compared with these percentages for Europeans: France (60), Britain (55), Netherlands (4<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, Belgium (46), Sweden (46), Denmark (43), Norway (42), Spain (33) and West Germany (30). Canada leans toward Europe, at 26 per cent. Most percentages increased since a parallel survey in 1981.<br><br>Most observers think the problem is most acute in western Europe, noting ChristianityÂ’s strength in Poland, Russia and Ukraine.<br><br>USA Today said the need to revive European Catholicism was Â‘Â‘among the main reasonsÂ’Â’ the cardinals chose GermanyÂ’s Benedict as Pope. ThatÂ’s debatable, but thereÂ’s no doubt EuropeÂ’s plight is much on the new<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sat down with a Xtian friend last nite and went thru Romans, 1 Cor and Matthew and John. It seems the only real clear passage saying that homosexuality is a sin comes from 1 Cor, who is written by Paul. My friend pointed out 2 important things to me.<br><br>1) 1 Cor was written by Paul, and it expresses HIS views and his thoughts, not sayings from anyone else. Paul was human when he wrote this, and who is to say he didn't have his own prejudices like any other human? So the only ptatement in the Bible declaring homosexuality a sin comes from the words of a human, a sinner, who like any other human, had his own biasedness and prejudices.<br><br>2) MORE IMPORTANTLY, we looked thru Matthew and John, which covers the actual words of Jesus himself, and nowhere did I find Jesus saying that homosexuality is a sin.<br><br>Paul was a pious man, no doubt, and devoted to God, but even the mosy Godly of men have their faults, and ONLY Paul has ever said that homosexuality is a sin and that made it into the Bible. And then men mistake that as GOD or Jesus as saying homosexuality is a sin. But neither God nor Jesus ever said that, only Paul did.<br><br>As for the old testament, he told me we should no longer consider it the law because Jesus the messiah has come already and that only Jews consider it the law since they do not believe Jesus was the messiah. For Christians, only the new testament need apply.<br><br>Hence it is my personal belief that Christianity wrongly sees homosexuality as a sin because Paul who was human nontheless, wrote down his personal views, and that at no any time did God or Jesus say that it is a sin. And hence it is also justifable for many Christians who upon realising this fallacy of Christianity, to accept homosexuality as NOT a sin, and still be faithful to their religion.<br><br>That, Chin Eng, answers you.</div>
