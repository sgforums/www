It is quite natural for a proponent of such stands to voice their concerns, and if it is done within the confines of a predetermined parameter, ie one within a forum created for these proponents, then I suppose it should be tolerated. The folks at the other religious and philosophical forums within SGforums, too have their slant over what they'd considered as their stands. It would be extremely rude and also wrong for Christians to go into these forums and bash their philosophies. It should be understood that EH remains predominantly a Christian forum and would be natural to assume that topics posted will be in accordance with the general Christian doctrine, which may include speaking out, for example, against homosexuals. Then there are some of us who are young in the faith and are still extreme zealous to declare what we believe in - these, I sometimes address at a personal level, encouraging them to moderate a little.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> What should not be done is for any thread to evolve to a flame war. Both Christians and non-Christians are responsible in preventing this from happening. For example, as what you'd stated, EH is actually being used, sometimes, "to help Christians to understand the Bible to perform good". But for some unknown reason, it will eventually evolved into: "the Bible is a lie, Jesus did not die for your sins, blah blah blah" When that happens, can we expect less from an adverse reaction from some of us who are a little more zealous in defending what we believe in. Note that I am not giving such Christians with such reactions an excuse in any way....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> .... which leads me to state that I have tried very hard to avoid confrontation because it is pointless. I'd used EH to answer any queries I possibly can, sometimes using PMs. I'd still see myself being able to defend the faith in a less confrontational stance to people who are willing to have an open mind. Anyone else who has already formed an opinion of Christian - these I'd just stay on the level of casual communication.</div></blockquote>with age comes maturity i guess..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>had a conversation with my partner last night.. i uttered this out: "those who claimed that they are always right is DEFINITELY wrong".. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

He didn't exist. The point u missed is that the person who wrote this piece is undoubtedly christian, biased from a xtian P.O.V. hence it IS a christian who is doing the challenging 1st, and then a Xtian doing the challenging 2nd by starting a topic about this.<br><br>perhaps u would like to open your eyes a bit more in future b4 u start talking about others missing a point here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, if this happened in real life, then shame on the professor. After all, if you want to challenge people, then prepared to be challenged back, with equal or more ferocity.<br><br>the problem I see here is such a scenario shouldn't happen in real life. The original author purposely made the professor look "dumb", hence the passage tastes like a flame bait.</div>
