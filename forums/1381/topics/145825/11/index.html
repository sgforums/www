            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ben1xy:</div><div class="quote_body">1 Corinthians 6:9 (NIV)<br><br>Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders.<br><br>erm.. Heng ah .. can u tell me wad u honestly feel? did i take this out of context?<br>Pauls say explicitly; he addresses people that will not inherit the Kingdom of God. he mentions the homosexuals.<br><br>how is that out of context?<br><br>u dun have to agree with me.. i juz wanna know ur views on this<br><br></div></blockquote>Cited from www.religioustolerance.org.. the term "homosexuals" has no meaning during Paul's time.. it was a termed coined rather recently..<br><br><strong>I Corinthians 6:9:<br>The passage: In his first epistle to the church at Corinth, Paul lists many activities that will prevent people from inheriting the Kingdom of God (heaven). Robertson's Word Studies refers to this passage as: "a solemn roll call of the damned even if some of their names are on the church roll in Corinth whether officers or ordinary members."<br><br>The King James Version of the Bible translates verse 9 and 10 as:<br><br>1Corithians 6:9-10: "Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God." (Emphasis ours)<br><br>This verse has been translated in many ways among the 25 English versions of the Bible that we have analyzed. The two activities of interest here have been variously translated as:<br><br>effeminate. In the English language, this covers a wide range of male behavior such as being unmanly, lacking virility. One might think of the characters "John," the receptionist on NYPD Blue, or "Jack" on Will and Grace.<br>homosexuals, variously described as: "men who practice homosexuality," (ESV);<br>"those who participate in homosexuality," (Amplified);<br>"abusers of themselves with men," (KJV);<br>"practicing homosexuals," (NAB);<br>"homosexuals," (NASB, CSB, NKJ, The Great Book: The New Testament in Plain English);<br>"homosexual perversion," (NEB);<br>"homosexual offenders," (NIV);<br>"liers with mankind," (Rhiems); and<br>"homosexual perverts." (TEV)<br><br>Many of these entries are restricted to gay males; lesbians are often excluded. Unfortunately, the term "homosexual" is commonly defined in two different ways: as a behavior (engaging in same-sex activity) or as a sexual orientation (being sexually attracted only to members of the same sex). Most of the biblical translations appear to refer to behavior rather than orientaiton.<br><br>male prostitutes, also described as "men kept for unnatural purposes." It is not clear whether the term "male prostitutes" (NIV, NRSV, CSB) is restricted to homosexuals or may also include men who are heterosexual prostitutes.<br>catamites, also described as "boy prostitute." This is a young male who is kept as a sexual partner of an adult male. (Jerusalem Bible, NAB, James Moffatt)<br>pederasts: male adults who sexually abuse boys; an abusive pedophile (an adult who molests young children) or abusive hebephile (an adult who molests post-pubertal teenagers).<br>perverts: a person engaged in some undefined sexual perversion. (Phillips, The Great Book: The New Testament in Plain English)<br>sodomites: a name derived from the city of Sodom which is described in Genesis 19. (NRSV, NKJ). The men of the city are described as wanting to rape male visitors; many Christians interpret this as a blanket condemnation of all homosexual behavior.<br><br>Comparing religious conservatives and liberals: Conservatives and liberals often interpret this passage very differently.<br><br>Conservatives typically use the NIV or KJV versions of the Bible. They generally interpret passages literally, and believe that Paul was inspired by God to write epistles which were inerrant.  These translations condemn "homosexual offenders" and "abusers of themselves with mankind." Essentially all Fundamentalist and other Evangelical Christians believe that this verse condemns all homosexual activity, whether by males or females. They view it as valid today as it was in the first century CE. Verse 6:11 states clearly that once gays and lesbians become saved, then they will no longer wish to engage in homosexual activities. They will presumably become heterosexuals<br>From a forum on homosexuality and the Bible in the Philadelphia Inqurier: 1<br><br>A. Mohler: "I believe it explicitly relates to homosexuality. It has been understood that way in the Christian Church from the earliest era."<br>T. Crater: "It [malakoi] can have a meaning that's not carnal. But the way it's used -- it's embedded in the same context with adultery -- it's pretty clear what the meaning is...A hallmark of Evangelicals is that we take a literal, normal, face-value interpretation of the Bible. Some people attempt to keep some form of Christianity and hold on to homosexuality, too. It leads to strange interpretations of the Bible."<br><br>Liberals generally do not believe in the inerrancy of the Bible. They believe that Paul was writing from his own knowledge and experience. During the 1st century CE, even an educated person like Paul would know very little about human sexuality, compared to present-day sexuality researchers . From the same forum:  J. Nelson: "Paul used the Greek word malakoi. They translate it as effeminate and so on. It could mean that; it might not. It can mean soft. Paul was a Jewish theologian. Someone from a Jewish background would consider that behavior unacceptable. Many Greeks did not."<br>D. Bartlett: "There's considerable debate over what the Greek words mean. We just don't know. I've read most of the debate, and I don't know."<br>K. Stendahl: "When people come to me -- deeply Christian people -- and say, `This is the way I am created. This is how God made me, how He makes me feel love,' I have to respect that. We know many things people [like Paul] did not know at that time. One should read the Bible with some kind of reason." 1<br><br>Further discussion:  The NIV contains the phrase: "homosexual offenders."  Suppose for the moment that Paul had written "heterosexual offenders" or "heterosexual sexual offenders." We would not interpret this today as a general condemnation of heterosexuality; only of those heterosexuals who commit sexual offences. Perhaps the appropriate interpretation of this verse is that it does not condemn homosexuals. Rather it condemns homosexuals who engage in sexual offences.<br>The original Greek text describes the two behaviors as "malakoi" (some sources quote "malakee,") and "arsenokoitai." Although these is often translated by modern Bibles as "homosexual," we can be fairly certain that this is not the meaning that Paul wanted to convey. If he had, he would have used the Greek word "paiderasste." That was the standard term at the time for male homosexuals. We can conclude that he probably meant something different from persons who engaged in male-male adult sexual behavior.<br>"Malakoi" is translated in both Matthew 11:8 and Luke 7:25 as "soft" (KJV) or as "fine" (NIV) in references to clothing. It could also mean "loose" or "pliable," as in the phrase "loose morals," implying "unethical behavior." In the early Christian church, the words were interpreted by some as referring to persons who are pliable, easily influenced, without courage or stability. Non-Biblical writings of the era used the world to refer to lazy men, men who cannot handle hard work, and cowards. [John] Wesley's Bible Notes defines "Malakoi" as those "Who live in an easy, indolent way; taking up no cross, enduring no hardship." 6  One knowledgeable but anonymous reviewer of our web site said that the word translated here as "effeminate" really "means men not working or advancing ideas so as to concern themselves with love only. Not working for the good of the whole....Our present culture has all sorts of connotations associated with the word 'effeminate' that simply don't apply" to Paul's era. It would seem that the word "effeminate" can only be regarded as a mistranslation.<br>"Arsenokoitai" is made up of two parts: "arsen" means "man"; "koitai" means "beds." The Septuagint (an ancient, pre-Christian translation of the Old Testament into Greek) translated the Hebrew "quadesh" in I Kings 14:24, 15:12 and 22:46 as "arsenokoitai." They were referring to "male temple prostitutes" - people who engaged in ritual sex in Pagan temples. 4 Some leaders in the early Christian church also thought that it meant temple prostitutes. Some authorities believe that it simply means male prostitutes with female customers - a practice which appears to have been a common practice in the Roman empire. One source refers to other writings which contained the word "arsenokoitai:" (Sibylline Oracles 2.70-77, Acts of John; Theophilus of Antioch Ad Autolycum). They suggest that the term refers "to some kind of economic exploitation by means of sex (but no necessarily homosexual sex)." 2 Probably "pimp" or "man living off of the avails of prostitution" would be the closest English translations. It is worth noting that "Much Greek homosexual erotic literature has survived, none of it contains the word aresenokoitai." 5<br>Still others thought that it meant "masturbators." At the time of Martin Luther, the latter meaning was universally used. But by the 20th century, masturbation had become a more generally accepted behavior. So, new translations abandoned references to masturbators and switched the attack to homosexuals. The last religious writing in English that interpreted 1 Corinthians 6:9 as referring to masturbation is believed to be the [Roman] Catholic Encyclopedia of 1967.<br>Many would consider catamites, (a boy or young male who engaged in sexual activities with men) to be a likely valid translation for the first behavior. Such boys were often slaves, kept by rich men as sex partners. The second term might then refer to the men who engaged in sex with the catamites. That is, they are abusive pedophiles. The New American Bible 3 contains a footnote which reads:<br>"The Greek word translated as 'boy prostitutes' [in 1 Cor. 6:9] designated catamites, i.e. boys or young men who were kept for purposes of prostitution, a practice not uncommon in the Greco-Roman world....The term translated 'practicing homosexuals' refers to adult males who indulged in homosexual practices with such boys."<br>Harper's Bible Commentary (199<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> comments that the passage refers to "both the effeminate male prostitute and his partner who hires him to satisfy sexual needs. The two terms used here for homosexuality... specify a special form of pederasty that was generally disapproved of in Greco-Roman and Jewish Literature."<br>Many religious liberals might agree that the center portion of 6:9 might be accurately translated as: "male child abusers and the boys that they sexually abuse." i.e. the two behaviors probably relate to that portion of pedophiles who are child rapists, and the male children that they victimize. The verse would then refer to the crime of child sexual abuse and has no relation to homosexuality in the normal sense of the term: i.e. consensual sexual relations between adults of the same gender.<br>It is worthwhile to check the words attributed to Jesus by the author of the Gospel of Matthew. He also had a list of sins that could bring doom on a person: Matt 15:18-20: "...those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies. These are the things which defile a man..." It is worth noting that homosexual behavior is not one of the behaviors that is mentioned in this passage. One might conclude that Jesus did not consider it important.<br><br>Most liberal Christians, gays, lesbians, therapists, and human sexuality researchers believe that an adult's sexual orientation is fixed. A gay or lesbian Christian can go through a religious conversion and be "saved." But that act will not lead to a conversion to heterosexuality. Having a religious conversion may well result in people abandoning various forms of sinful behavior, such as slander, theft, alcoholism, greed, swindling etc. But one's sexual orientation cannot be changed. Homosexual behavior is not intrinsically sinful any more than heterosexual behavior is. Either can be sinful if they involve exploitation or manipulation or are not carried out safely in a committed relationship. Most conservative Christians disagree, and believe that homosexuality refers to behavior, not orientation</strong><br></div>

Acts 11:5 "I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. There was something like a large sheet coming down from heaven, being lowered by its four corners; and it came close to me. 6 As I looked at it closely I saw four-footed animals, beasts of prey, reptiles, and birds of the air. 7 I also heard a voice saying to me, "Get up, Peter; kill and eat.' 8 But I replied, "By no means, Lord; for nothing profane or unclean has ever entered my mouth.' 9 But a second time the voice answered from heaven, "What God has made clean, you must not call profane.'<br><br>concept of segregation in the OT is very strong, hence clear demarkation of what belongs to whom.... even the fabric issue. - thanks Mc2 for suppling me the verse. With regards to food, there are various issues with what is considered unclean back then. Probably the purpose is to preserve the nation of Israel.... <span style="font-style: italic;">I am not here to argue it those segragation is right or wrong.</span><br><br>the concept of segregation has to be thrown out of the window in NT but the mindset of the Jewish Christians has to be radically changed, starting for the stalwart at the point in time - Peter. According to the passage, whatever that was deemed uncleaned in the OT, is now considered clean. This entire change in mindset totally threw out the norms and tradition at the point - the issue of unclean food and eating with gentiles had to be rethink.<br><br>The above were stated on the assumption that Christians believe that the Bible is the Word of God. Of course it is entirely possible that the Jews in the OT DID NOT SEGREGATE AND they freely mix with the people at that time, or that perhaps Peter did not even exist. That being so, no need to use the Bible to argue.</div>

The ancients accounted fish the most delicate food (so far were they from allowing it on fasting-days, or making it an instance of mortification to eat fish); therefore God did not lay much restraint upon his people in them; for he is a Master that allows his servants not only for necessity but for delight. Concerning the prohibited fish it is said, They shall be an abomination to you (v. 10Â–12), that is, "You shall count them unclean, and not only not eat of them, but keep at a distance from them.Â’Â’ Note, Whatever is unclean should be to us an abomination; touch not the unclean thing. But observe, <strong>It was to be an abomination only to Jews; the neighbouring nations were under none of these obligations, nor are these things to be an abomination to us Christians</strong>. The Jews were honoured with peculiar privileges, and therefore, lest they should be proud of those, Transeunt cum onereÂ—They were likewise laid under peculiar restraints.

Members don question the rules for they believe the owner knows better and members submit to His authority.<br><br>Bash the christians, the church, and all christian organisation as you like, it is true that some do deserved criticism or canning on the backside, but if you are questioning God, twisting the Bible, do it at your own risks</blockquote>U say that members don't question the owner because the believe he knows better, but im asking u, the owner didn't write the rules, he told his member of staff to write the rules based on a rough guideline, and the member of staff writes it up as best as he could, but with his own views, prejudices and misunderstandings written into those rules, are u going to simply follow them blindly in the belief that the owner personally wrote the rules himself without making clear who actually wrote the rules?<br><br>So why do u say i am questioning god when i am questioning the bible itself, which was written NOT by god but by man? I am questioning if the bible hadn't been written with some human prejudice, biasedness, views, belief, misgivings and misunderstandings in? If for even a passage like 1 Cor 6:9, xtians can give 2 different explanations which both sound logical, then who are YOU to say that i am twisting the bible, and that you are not? The risk might be on your own heads all this while, that I will remind u.</div>

I sincerely hope that your Christian friends are learned enough to give you the correct answers.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>1 Corinthians 6:9 (NIV)<br>Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God?

How do u explain this?<br></strong></blockquote>umm.. shall we go back to the original Greek language in which 1 Corinthians was written: <strong>The word "homosexual" in the NASB version is the Greek aÃ±Ã³Ã¥Ã­Ã¯ÃªÃ¯ÃŸÃ´Ã§Ã² (arsenokoites).  It occurs two times in the New Testament.  The KJV translates it as Â“abuser of (oneÂ’s) self with mankindÂ” once, and Â“defile (oneÂ’s) self with mankindÂ” once. 1 one who lies with a male as with a female, sodomite, homosexual. (Strong, J.

Why don't u have a look and explain where they get their POV from? Don't be so self-righteously dismissive about it. I feel that its worth a look and some dissection into what they are saying as well. As far as it goes, all along here, your insistance is that YOUR view IS the xtian view. Might u not consider that other xtians might hae a valid point of view as well, and that might u not be mistaken? </strong></blockquote>errr. where did you get the notion that I said that MY VIEW IS THE CHRISTIAN VIEW.... at best I say that my view is my view as a Christian with my own understanding of the Bible. I'd said many times - you got more supportive evidence from the Bible, I'd be happy to read them. I did not reject your claims, which really is far and few in between, without explaining why. There are obviously two views, one: a pro gay Christian camp, the other an anti gay Christian camp. I just happen to be in the one you are not in. Please stop saying that I am insisting that I am right. If this is the case, every single individual, you including is doing that. EH folks had already commented about how I'd approach this topic. I don't think there is a misunderstanding on where I am coming from.

Safehaven is closer to home. I'd read most of the articles in it. It would be a stand of gay-Christian.

A young Christian can make all kinds of claims about the work of God and various deviant belief. What you need to do is not just to believe them, or me, at all. There are methods to read the Bible. The worst one being to take everything at face value without going to the original translation and see what a root word really mean when it was written or to make claims that we should not listen to wisemen because we are all given a brain.<br><br>One more thing, if you don't believe in the Bible, don't use a verse to support your claims...</div>

As much as I take that positively, such studies were done by various learned people (who probably do not mean a thing to you) OT was written before there were Christians. How can a law exist for people that did not exist at the time a law was passed. Romans and Corinthians and Acts exist after Christianity was formed</blockquote>Chrtistianity was based on jewish scriptures. How can they forsake their teachings completely and assume they r different ? In tat case why should the mesiah exist of r people who do not exist at tat time ? The OT is included as part of the bible for a reason. Jesus in the NT had himself said the importance of the OT laws. U wanna defy him ?<br><br><blockquote>who was murdered? gay people? and they were given death sentenced? to a murdered gay people? huh? were they given the death sentence because they were gay or because they murdered? again, who was murdered? </blockquote>There were articles from earthlings tat shows gays being murdered. Sort of death sentence being laid onto them isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>Most people can see that my argument is between non Gay Christian POV and Gay Christian POV. Any behaviour is towards Gay Christians and unless you admit to being one or is close to one, it does not matter to you... bbbut, you being SIS, everything that a Christian does matters to you.... I am glad that we influence your life as such.... </blockquote>Tat is very interesting but all along I have been arguing from the scripture point of view isn't it ? Or r u gonna tell me christian don't read bible ? And as said countless time, the teaching of christainity is gonna affect people of all belief and religion, which obviously include me. So I can't comment on anything tat is gonna influence me. But anyway u r gonna reply the same thing back anyway<br><br><blockquote>Precisely, why focus on homosexual but ignore bigamy, adultery, promiscuous sex, paedophile etc. So do you also think that because man is created lustful, therefore it is alright for man to be adulterous and lead a promiscuous life? Do you consider these behaviour good and natural? I would like your comment on these since you feel like expanding the topic. </blockquote>Bigamy, adultery involves another third party (current partner) so it is wrong and no one will stand up to it. Paedophile is a crime committed on another person who is deemed not matured enough to undertsand the nature of the business. For promiscuous sex, it depends on your definition of it. If u talk about a hooker doing it for a living and religious people go all out and condemn and curse them, I will stand up for them as well. If u talk about sex with boyfriends, I will stand up for them too. If u talk about nymphomaniac, it really had a very damaging influence to his wellbeing and at the current moment it is considered as a mental illness and as such, should be encourage to visit the pyschatrist. And as such, we do see eye to eye on such issues<br><br>Seems u r keen on expanding issues, why don't u expand on the topic of masturbation and contraception while u r at it ? These 2 points r perhaps the topics tat seem incredibly wrong IMO yet upheld by the religion to be right. We probably do not se eye to eye on these 2 so u wanna discuss them ?<br><br><blockquote>You did not answer my earlier question: DO YOU RESPECT A CHRISTIAN'S CHOICE as I am able to respect a non-Christian's choice?</blockquote>Lets say I am powerless to a choice made by christians. A poitn I need to make is there r many christians who do not respect the choices made by gays. However this being a forum, why don't we jut thrash it out and talk about it to get deeper understanding on the issues.<br><br><blockquote>That's right. When the gov says country practice meritocracy .. does it say foreign workers also get same treatment?  We have to admit the OT contains laws meant for people receiving the covenant, yet at same time recognise some commandments apply to all mankind. How to tell them apart is not the point here.<br><br>I hope it is clear that "thou shall not murder" applies to all mankind heh, though this is in the OT as well. </blockquote>So u mean u get to pick and choose the laws tat u like and follow them while conveninetly throw all the other laws to the jews ? From the wordings of the bible, it show tat all followers of god have to follow these laws. In the case of a country tat practise meritocracy, even if u r a foreign worker, u get fair treatment and can get promoted and a pay raise if u r more hard working than the rest. Tat is the ideal state tat the country is striving for.<br><br><blockquote>of course got diff. One implies the theology is wrong and full of discrimination, the other only says xtians sometimes get too arrogant and forgot what the Lord has taught them.</blockquote>And to the homosexual, wat is the diff ? To them they r gonna be treated differently whether they focus on the sin or the sinner<br><br></div>
