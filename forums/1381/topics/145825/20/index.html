            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I see your view on the Bible is really odd... OT laws don't apply to you, as we agreed, cos we are not Jews.</blockquote>Lets put it tis way. Even jesus was jewish.<br><br>Jesus was a Jew. He was born of a Jewish mother, in Galilee, a Jewish part of the world. All of his friends, associates, colleagues, disciples, all of them were Jews. He regularly worshipped in Jewish communal worship, what we call synagogues. He preached from Jewish text, from the Bible. He celebrated the Jewish festivals. He went on pilgrimage to the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem where he was under the authority of priests....  Jesus presented continuously as going into the synagogue on the Sabbath. He is presented as going up to Jerusalem for the pilgrimage holidays, specifically in John, for any number of pilgrimage holidays, and in the synoptic gospels, most importantly, for Passover. He lived as a Jew and followed Jewish religious practices. He lived, was born, lived, died, taught as a Jew.<br><br>From his birth, as is indicated by his very Jewish genealogy, Jesus was raised a Jew. He was circumcised the eighth day (Luke 2.21), bore a common Jewish name, Yeshua, 'he [God] saves' (Matthew 1.21). In fact, Yeshua was the fifth most common Jewish name, 4 out of the 28 Jewish High-Priests in Jesus' time were called Yeshua.<br><br>After his birth, Jesus was presented to the Lord in the Jerusalem temple (Luke 2.22; cf. Deuteronomy 18.4; Exodus 13.2,12,15) according to Mary's period of uncleanness (Leviticus 12.2-<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. A sacrifice was offered for him - a pair of doves and 2 young pigeons - which indicated that his family were not wealthy (Leviticus 12.2,6,8; Luke 2.22-24). Thus Jesus was raised according to the law (Luke 2.39).<br><br>Every year, (perhaps the family was prospering or were particularly dutiful for most only went up to Jerusalem occasionally) Jesus' family went up to Jerusalem to celebrate Passover (Pesach) (Luke 2.41-43) a tradition which Jesus continued (John 12.12; Mark 14.12-26). Jesus also kept Tabernacles (SukkÃ´th, 'booths') (John 7.1-39). John 10.22-23 may also indicate that Jesus celebrated the Hanukkah festival which commemorated the 2nd century B.C. rededication of the Temple under the Maccabees.<br><br>"As was his custom" he also attended synagogue every sabbath (Luke 4.16) even during his travelling ministry (Mark 1.39; Matthew 4.23; 9.35; Luke 4.15,16-27,44).<br><br>In tithing, fasting and almsgiving he was totally Jewish. Although he opposed excessive worrying about the minutiae of tithing "mint, dill and cumin" (Matthew 23.23) he still argued that the crowds and his disciples should do as the scribes and Pharisees said (Matthew 23.3; "but not as they do"!). In fact the law only specified tithing of grain, wine, oil and livestock.(40)<br><br>Jesus said grace, or rather a blessing, before and/or after meals (Deuteronomy 8.10; Matthew 6.41; 26.26 and Luke 24.30 which is post resurrection; cf. Didache 10.1). The object of the blessing was not the food but God, when the New Testament inserts 'it' or 'the bread' in such verses it is not found in the Greek. It was inconceivable that a Jew would bless the object and not the originator/creator. The traditional blessing is:<br><br>"Barukh attah 'Adonai 'elohenu Melekh ha-olam ha-motsi lechem meen ha-arets"<br>"Blessed are You, our Lord God, King of the Ages/Universe, who brings forth bread from the earth"<br><br>In every respect, therefore, Jesus was a Jew, and was not ashamed to call himself one:<br><br>"we know what we worship, for salvation is from the Jews" (John 4.22)<br><br>Jesus also refused to abolish Biblical Judaism<br><br>Matthew 5:17<br>17"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. 18 I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. (NIV)<br><br>Now u say tat the OT laws was not applicable to christians, when even jesus too follow them.</div>

The study will appear in a 2005 issue of the refereed scientific journal Psychological Reports (Volume 96: pp. 693-697).<br><br>Speaking on behalf of his Colorado Springs think tank, Dr. Cameron said, Â“Indeed, gay obituaries suggest that engaging in homosexuality costs participants between 15 to 25 years of life, suggesting that homosexuality is more dangerous than smoking or obesity and that homosexuals generally do not reach old age.Â”<br><br>Â“10,000 gay obituaries have been collected from homosexual publications. Are the obituaries listed in the gay press representative of gay deaths in general?Â” Cameron asks.<br><br>A new study that compared them with Centers for Disease Control data indicates they are.<br><br>The CDC reported that 9% of heterosexuals who died of AIDS were at least 65 years of age. But less than 4% of homosexuals and IV drug abusers who died of AIDS reached 65.<br><br>Â“These findings add substantial support to our previous findings,Â” said Cameron, who headed the study. Â“While no one has all the facts on this issue, the CDC data is about as good as it gets. These data indicate that considerable progress in medically combating HIV is being made Â– itÂ’s even affecting deaths from other medical causes. Right now, the median age of death for gays in the obituaries is running near 60 Â– about tied with the median age of death for lesbians. Of course, the median age of death for adults is about 80 Â– so the 20 year hit for engaging in homosexuality that we reported 15 years ago continues to hold.Â”<br><br>The new study Â“Gay obituaries closely track officially reported deaths from AIDSÂ” can be read in the scientific journal, Psychological Reports (2005;96:693-697).</span><br><br>Therefore, the lower lifespan does not just affect those that died from sexually transmitted disease or drug abuse causes.<br><br>Some things to ponder on....</div>
