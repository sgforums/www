            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Icemoon:</div><div class="quote_body">This is true, especially among the charismatic churches.<br><br></div></blockquote><blockquote>Leviticus 20:10-21 and Deuteronomy 22:13-30 provide explanations of sexual immorality. The following sexual behavior is forbidden by the Bible:<br><br>Adultery Â– sexual relations with someone married to another person<br><br>Homosexuality (Lev. 20:13) relations with the same sex<br><br>Incest Â– sexual relations between blood relatives who are forbidden to marry, such as parent and child or brother and sister<br><br>Pedophilia Â– sexual relations with children (1 Cor. 6:9)<br><br>Preventing conception Â– (masturbation), e.g., Onan (Gen. 38:9)<br><br>Prostitution Â– taking money for sexual favors (Lev. 19:29); This includes fathers who prostituted their daughters for money. The Canaanites (Joshua 2:1) and the Philistines had prostitutes (Judges 16:1)<br><br>Rape Â– taking a woman by force (Deut. 22:2<br><br>Sexual relations during menstruation Â– (Lev. 15:24; 18:19)<br><br>Sodomy Â– sexual acts with animals (Ex. 22:18; Deut 27:21; Lev. 18:23; 20:15)<br><br>Transvestism Â– erotic exchange of clothing between men and women (Deut. 22:5). </blockquote>I asked another few Christian friends about these passages. This is what one of them said: "u're reading old testament, that's when? before Jesus come right?"<br><br>And furthermore, she directed me to some discussions where these statements were made:<br><br><blockquote>The other 29 verses of the chapter are largely ignored, yet two seem curiously related. Verses 11 and 12 say, "Don't wear clothing woven from two kinds of thread: for instance, wool and linen together. You must sew tassels on the four corners of your cloaks." One might ask why there isn't a great disturbance about the blended fabrics commonly worn today by both men and women. And how would the world react to tassels. How indeed!</blockquote><blockquote>Let's also note what else Deut. 22 tells us.<br><br>It tells you what to do when you find someone else's cattle (verses 1-4).<br>It tells you what to do if you find a bird's nest on the ground (verses 6-7).<br>It tells you that you have to put a railing around your roof to make sure nobody falls off of it (verse <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br>It tells you not to plant more than one kind of seed in the same vinyard (verse 9),<br>not to hitch your plow to an ass and an ox at the same time (verse 10),<br>NOT TO WEAR CLOTHING OF MIXED FIBERS (verse 11 -- look, more potential alt.clothing.lingerie content!! -- "Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, AS OF woollen and linen together" (King James version, emphasis mine), and<br>that your clothing has to have fringes on it (oh, how sixties -- verse 12).<br>It tells you what to do if a man claims that his wife was not a virgin when they married, and what to do if he's right and what to do if he's wrong (verses 13-21).<br>It tells you that adulterers must be put to death (verse 22).<br>It tells you that a woman betrothed to someone who has sex with someone other than her betrothed, in a city, and doesn't cry out, shall be put to death (verses 23-24).<br>It tells you that if a woman is raped in a field where there's nobody to hear her cry out, you kill the rapist but not the victim (verse 25-27).<br>It tells you that if a man lies with a woman who is not already betrothed, they have to get married (verses 28-29).<br>Finally, it says you mustn't sleep with your father's wife (verse 30). </blockquote>So I have to ask u, do u faithfully follow everything that is said above? Do u avoid wearing clothing of mixed fibres? Does your clothing have fringes on it? Do u have tassels sewn on the four corners of your cloak? Should we put adulterers to death? Have you put a railing on your roof? If u answer no to any one of these, how can u then say that u're faithful to the bible as well? Or more to the point, all of these passages from the old testaments, can u really be sure that is what God wouldn't be too pleased with, or just something humans made up?<br><br>Here's another paragraph from a discussion of the bible specifically about the Deutronomy:<br><br><blockquote>Now that we've put it in context (though for homework you should go read a few other chapters of Deuteronomy as well), here's some insight from a Christian perspective:<br><br>Most (not all) of the other Christians I've talked to about the Mosaic laws have agreed that Christ "fulfilled" the law and that Christ's law supplants Mosaic law -- otherwise Christians would have to keep kosher, cover our heads at all times, not perform any "creative acts" on the sabbath (note that this is interpreted by modern Jews to include not turning on any electrical devices, and that the sabbath runs from sundown to sundown (actually from sundown to an hour after sundown, I think) Friday night/Saturday)).<br><br>How many of the folks who're quoting Deut. 22:5 at you obey all of that? Also, most of the ones who've quoted that verse at me have been clean-shaven, and I believe there's a biblical injunction against that too!<br><br>Anyone out there wear poly/cotton or wool/linen or wool/cotton blends? </blockquote>so are u clean shaven as well? thats against the bible then it seems. Also please make sure u do not turn on any electrical devices on the sabbath if u want to be faithful to the bible instead of being hypocrite and only following or believing in some of the things written inside.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A couple of cents worth..... but forgive me if I might miss a few points:<br><br>1. <strong>Ignore the darn story already!!!!</strong> It is completely fictitous and had been making it's round too many times. Might have been conjured to make a point in some Christian magazines or at the pulpit but I personally feel it is totally out of place here. Sorry, Honey.... just my opinion <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>2. The issue on the various teachings in the OT vs the teachings in the NT. Let's be pragmatic about it. Some of these teachings:<br>a. were cultural in nature - needing an understanding to the largely agricultural background of the people of Israel would be necessary.<br>b. need an understanding in the language used in those days. I'd once mention the concept of "slave" in the OT is different from what we know today.<br>c. were specific to a group of people ie, the epistles of Paul and Peter<br>d. were historical, meant to be read as a record of the events that had taken place, these are typically NOT doctrinal in nature.<br><br>Many of these teachings were adapted to be part of our lifestyle because they are proven to be good: eg monogamy (note that polygamy is common in the OT), heterosexualism (for the purpose of procreation),<br><br>I'd read somewhere in SGforums recently that internet links were included to prove that homosexuals exist in the animal kingdom to be taken that it is natural. If we go that way, might as state that genocide is natural, incest is natural, infanticide is natural  - all because some animals do it.<br><br>Church teachings, like any teachings, do evolve. Whether we will see homosexuality being accepted as part of a Christian life by ALL churches remain to be seen, but at any given point in time in history, every creed and beliefs will have their stand, otherwise how can they exist?<br><br>When I was a teenager, musical instruments were confined to the pipe organ in the sanctuary. Anything beyond that is seen as sacrilege when used in worship. Over the last 15 yrs, it has evolved so much that not many churches use the pipe organ solely. Even my extremely conservative liturgical service sees an occasional violin and saxophone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this is my favourite gay animal story.. so please indulge me.. heh..<br><br><strong>Feb. 23 - Birds do it. Bees do it. And, it turns out, even the penguins at the Central Park Zoo do it. So let's do it: Let's let gay people make a lifelong commitment to each other openly and in public.<br><br>I reached this Cole Porter-esque conclusion on Valentine's Day when, in my ongoing quest to understand why some heterosexuals believe that gay marriage will destroy their "traditional" marriages, I stopped by the Central Park Zoo to interview the famously gay penguins, Roy and Silo. You may not know about Roy and Silo, but we New Yorkers have been mighty proud since they came out in 1998. Finally, instead of having New York's collective sex life defined by the floozy, commitment-challenged heterosexual women of "Sex and the City" or the pages of personal ads taken out by single losers, we finally had a First Couple of Monogamy that would show the world that love and fidelity could still conquer all (plus, they looked great in their little tuxedos).<br><br>Roy and Silo's love is a story for the ages. Like so many great lovers, Roy and Silo met in a zoo holding tank in 1998. They were young then, and unsure of themselves sexually like many adolescents (and when I say "adolescents," of course, I mean me). But their attraction could not be denied, and they have remained inseparable, according to Central Park Zoo penguin keeper Rob Gramzay.<br><br>Gramzay knew that Roy and Silo had paired off, because at breeding time, they did everything the "straight" penguins did: they built a nest, they defended it from others and engaged in what zookeepers euphemistically call "ecstatic display." It sounds kinky, but it simply means that the penguins stand straight up, stretch out their wings and entwine their necks. It's the penguin equivalent of going to City Hall in San Francisco. (As an aside, isn't S.F. mayor Gavin Newsom a genius? By allowing gays to marry, not only is he sending a powerful civil rights message, but every one of those gay couples had to buy a marriage license. At $83 a pop, Newsom has added almost $400,000 to the strapped civic treasuryÂ—money that certainly won't be refunded when President Bush amends the Constitution to do something no reasonable compassionate conservative would ever do: Make it less protective of individual freedom and personal liberty rather than more).<br><br>Back in the tank, Roy and Silo's behavior indicated that they really wanted a kid. Zookeepers gave them a dummy penguin egg, just to see if they'd actually incubate it. When they did, zookeepers gave them an actual egg, which Roy and Silo again incubated. When the baby chick was born, Roy and Silo cared for it, feeding it yummy regurgitated smelt and keeping it warm until it could survive on its own.<br><br>Years later, Roy and Silo are still going strong. And so are all their heterosexual penguin pals who share the tank with them. So that dispels one myth about gay marriage: Roy and Silo's commitment to each other has not destroyed the sanctity of the other penguin marriages. Gramzay said the penguin divorce rate remains the same as it was before Roy and Silo hooked up.<br><br>Not that you see much "hooking up." I'll admit it, I had gone to Central Park in hopes of seeing some hot gay penguin sex, but it turns out that penguins pretty much ignore each other until mating season, which begins in about six weeks. So when I visited the tank last week, Roy was puttering around with a rock while Silo swam and barely made eye contact. In other words, they looked liked an old married couple.<br><br>Besides, sex in the penguin worldÂ—straight or gayÂ—isn't all that hot (and it's barely sex). Penguins don't have genitals, per se, so gay penguin sex is exactly the same as straight penguin sex (not to be graphic here, but it basically involves the locking of cloacae. Can I say "cloacae" on a family Web site?). The only difference, Gramzay said, is that Roy and Silo unlock before, um, "completion."<br><br>That sounded strange to me, so I called my thespian friend, Eric Oleson (it's okay to call him that because he's openly thespian). As a gay man, Oleson was impressed by Roy and Silo's commitment to each other, despite a climax-free sex life. "It's actually kind of sweet," Oleson said. "They realize that they don't have the equipment, yet they're still devoted to each other. It shows that gay marriage is not just about sex." (Another gay-marriage myth dispelled! Just because a couple can't breed, doesn't mean it can't love. And, after all, Roy and Silo successfully adopted.)<br><br>So if Roy and Silo can do it, why can't humans? Indeed, if homosexual marriages exist in the animal kingdom, they must be normal. Then again, many opponents of gay marriage say that anything animals do is, well, animalistic and they want no part of it. But by that logic, we should give up straight sex, too, because animals pretty much invented it (and the French perfected it). And if Roy and Silo haven't destroyed the other penguins' heterosexual relationships, why do so many human heterosexuals feel that their marriages will be undermined just because a few thousand gays in San Francisco are pledging to spend the rest of their lives together?<br><br>After all, human marriage has somehow survived a 50-percent divorce rate. As Roy and Silo prove in their tank in Central Park, marriage will survive letting gays into the imperfect club, too.</strong><br></div>
