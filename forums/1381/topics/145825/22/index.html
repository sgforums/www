Have you ever fell in love with the same gender? Have you ever find one of the same gender so attractive that you body will react (e.g., heart racing, pupil dilating, &amp; xxxxxxx) to his/her sight alone?<br><br>I had never had a partner until the age of 29.. I came out only at 28.. Prior to that, I was denying my own sexual orientation.. Tried to go out with a lady.. Pretending to like her but my body tell me a different story.. I just can't have a reaction to this lady (btw, she's quite decent looking, not the ugly type)..<br><br>Anyway, this is Psychologist's view on this issue:<br><br><a href="http://www.apa.org/pubinfo/answers.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.apa.org/pubinfo/answers.html</a><br><br><strong>Is Sexual Orientation a Choice? </strong><br>No, human beings can not choose to be either gay or straight. Sexual orientation emerges for most people in early adolescence without any prior sexual experience. Although we can choose whether to act on our feelings, psychologists do not consider sexual orientation to be a conscious choice that can be voluntarily changed.<br><br><strong>Can Therapy Change Sexual Orientation? </strong><br>No. Even though most homosexuals live successful, happy lives, some homosexual or bisexual people may seek to change their sexual orientation through therapy, sometimes pressured by the influence of family members or religious groups to try and do so. The reality is that homosexuality is not an illness. It does not require treatment and is not changeable.<br><br>However, not all gay, lesbian, and bisexual people who seek assistance from a mental health professional want to change their sexual orientation. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual people may seek psychological help with the coming out process or for strategies to deal with prejudice, but most go into therapy for the same reasons and life issues that bring straight people to mental health professionals.<br><br><strong>What About So-Called "Conversion Therapies"? </strong><br>Some therapists who undertake so-called conversion therapy report that they have been able to change their clients' sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual. Close scrutiny of these reports however show several factors that cast doubt on their claims. For example, many of the claims come from organizations with an ideological perspective which condemns homosexuality. Furthermore, their claims are poorly documented. For example, treatment outcome is not followed and reported overtime as would be the standard to test the validity of any mental health intervention.<br><br>The American Psychological Association is concerned about such therapies and their potential harm to patients. In 1997, the Association's Council of Representatives passed a resolution reaffirming psychology's opposition to homophobia in treatment and spelling out a client's right to unbiased treatment and self-determination. Any person who enters into therapy to deal with issues of sexual orientation has a right to expect that such therapy would take place in a professionally neutral environment absent of any social bias.<br><br></div>

The study will appear in a 2005 issue of the refereed scientific journal Psychological Reports (Volume 96: pp. 693-697).<br><br>Speaking on behalf of his Colorado Springs think tank, Dr. Cameron said, Â“Indeed, gay obituaries suggest that engaging in homosexuality costs participants between 15 to 25 years of life, suggesting that homosexuality is more dangerous than smoking or obesity and that homosexuals generally do not reach old age.Â”<br><br>Â“10,000 gay obituaries have been collected from homosexual publications.

But less than 4% of homosexuals and IV drug abusers who died of AIDS reached 65.<br><br>Â“These findings add substantial support to our previous findings,Â” said Cameron, who headed the study. Â“While no one has all the facts on this issue, the CDC data is about as good as it gets. These data indicate that considerable progress in medically combating HIV is being made Â– itÂ’s even affecting deaths from other medical causes. Right now, the median age of death for gays in the obituaries is running near 60 Â– about tied with the median age of death for lesbians. Of course, the median age of death for adults is about 80 Â– so the 20 year hit for engaging in homosexuality that we reported 15 years ago continues to hold.Â”<br><br>The new study Â“Gay obituaries closely track officially reported deaths from AIDSÂ” can be read in the scientific journal, Psychological Reports (2005;96:693-697).</span><br><br>Therefore, the lower lifespan does not just affect those that died from sexually transmitted disease or drug abuse causes.<br><br>Some things to ponder on....</div></blockquote>an article to counter your article: <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><a href="http://www.aegis.com/news/wb/2005/WB050622.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aegis.com/news/wb/2005/WB050622.html</a><br>ANTI-GAY GROUPS are already touting the conclusions of a soon-to-be published study by the conservative Family Research Institute that claims being gay is as dangerous as smoking or using illegal drugs, with a New York group calling for a warning label on gays.<br>Paul Cameron, known for anti-gay research regularly quoted by conservatives to denounce gay rights, asserts in a study that gay men die younger than heterosexual men. Cameron based his conclusions on what he said was a review of 10,000 obituaries published in the Washington Blade, and data from the federal Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention on the ages of people who die from AIDS.<br><br>"[The data] suggests there are all kinds of choices people can make. You can choose to smoke, or to have fun with illegal intravenous drugs or engage in homosexual activity," Cameron said in an interview this week.<br><br>"Certainly the data shows that homosexuality and shooting drugs seem to be among the most dangerous choices people can make. Homosexuality is a tremendous public health risk," he added.<br><br>Cameron said the study of the obituaries, which he compared to the CDC report "AIDS Cases in Adolescents and Adults, by Age - United States, 1994-2000," supports his research and shows that gays die 20 years earlier than heterosexuals.<br><br>According to Cameron, the newspaper obituaries show the median age of death for people with AIDS was 42 while CDC data concludes the average age of deaths of gay men with AIDS was 43.<br><br>Cameron then takes the AIDS deaths reported in the Washington Blade and averages them in with other deaths of gay men reported in the paper to come up with, what he said, is an average age of death for all gay men at 60 while the average age of death for adults is 80.<br><br>CDC disputes findings<br><br>Cameron's methodology is simply bad science, said Ronald Valdiserri, deputy director of the CDC's National Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention.<br><br>"[The CDC] does not collect statistics on the lifespan of gay men," Valdiserri said. "While gay men continue to be severely impacted by HIV and AIDS, AIDS-related death data cannot be used to indicate that homosexual men live shorter lives than heterosexual men overall."<br><br>Because there is no national database that gives a count of all gay men in the U.S., "making assumptions about the group as a whole is difficult," Valdiserri added.<br><br>Titled "Gay obituaries closely track officially reported deaths from AIDS," Cameron's report appears this month in the journal Psychological Reports. The publication requires authors to pay $27.50 per page for their work to appear.<br><br>Anti-gay groups regularly cite Cameron's work to oppose gay rights. This week, the New York Christian Coalition used the most recent Cameron report to suggest gays should wear warning labels.<br><br>"We put warning labels on cigarette packs because we know that smoking takes one to two years off the average life span, yet we 'celebrate' a lifestyle that we know spreads every kind of sexually transmitted disease and takes at least 20 years off the average lifespan according to the 2005 issue of the refereed scientific journal Psychological Reports," said Rev. Bill Banuchi, executive director of the New York Christian Coalition.<br><br>Banuchi issued the press release as part of a denouncement of the first Gay Pride Day in the town of New Paltz, N.Y.<br><br>In the recent issue of Intelligence Report, the Southern Poverty Law Center labeled the Family Research Institute as "extremist." The SPLC said Cameron was the "longtime house psychologist" of the anti-gay movement and noted that Cameron said in 1985 that "extermination of homosexuals" might be needed in the next three to four years.<br><br></div>

These decisions are a tremendous victory for children, for parental responsibility, and for common sense.Â”<br><br>------------------------<br><br>This morning the California State Supreme Court issued groundbreaking opinions in three cases involving the legal status of children born to same- sex parents. The three cases are Elisa B. v. Superior Court, K.M. v. E.G., and Kristine H. v. Lisa R. The National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR) was counsel for Emily B., a mother seeking child support from her former partner, in the Elisa B. case and filed amicus briefs in the K.M. and the Kristine H. cases.<br><br>In all three cases, the Court held that when a couple deliberately brings a child into the world through the use of assisted reproduction, both partners are legal parents, regardless of their gender or marital status. The California Supreme Court is the first state Supreme Court to reach this issue, and its holding in these three cases inevitably will influence courts in other states.<br><br>In the Elisa B. case a same-sex couple Â– Emily B. and Elisa B. Â– had children together using artificial insemination by an anonymous sperm donor. Emily gave birth to twins in 1998, one of whom has Down Syndrome.<br><br>After the twinsÂ’ birth, the couple decided that Emily would stay home to care for the children and Elisa would be the familyÂ’s breadwinner. When the couple split up 18 months later, Elisa eventually cut off all contact and support, prompting Emily to apply for assistance from the state, which brought a child support action against Elisa. In todayÂ’s ruling, the California Supreme Court strongly affirmed the trial courtÂ’s ruling that Elisa is a legal parent who cannot simply walk away from her obligation to support the two children she agreed to bring into the world.<br><br>Â“I am elated beyond words that the Court recognized the reality that my children have two parents,Â” said Emily B. Â“This is a tremendous victory not only for my family but for all children born to same-sex couples.Â”<br><br>In its decision today, the Court held: Â“A person who actively participates in bringing children into the world, takes the children into her home and holds them out as her own, and receives and enjoys the benefits of parenthood, should be responsible for the support of those children Â– regardless of her gender or sexual orientation.Â”<br><br>In the K.M. v. E.G. case, a fertilized egg from K.M. was implanted in her partner E.G., who gave birth to twins in 1996. When the couple broke up in 2002, E.G. denied K.M. any access to the children and took the position that she was the childrenÂ’s only parent. In its decision today, the Court held that both women are legal parents.<br><br>In the Kristine H. v. Lisa R. case, a same-sex couple had a child using assisted reproduction. Before the child was born, the couple sought and were granted a court judgment declaring that both women were the childÂ’s legal parents. After the couple ended their relationship 2 Â½ years later, the birth mother filed an action seeking to vacate the judgment and have the court declare that she is the childÂ’s only parent. The Court held today that the birth mother was stopped from challenging the judgment and that both women are legal parents</strong><br></div>

I personally believe it's really due to the low level of awareness of gay issues. Which lead to the saying: "you fear something that you dont know"...<br><br>Most people's understanding of homosexuality is: "It's a lifestyle issue".. Even the media say so.. The question of "nature vs nurture" was not address through rigorous research but through a little bit of assumptions here and there. And media are not allowed to put forth any information that seem to support the gay cause anyway for fear of "spreading homosexualism".. Isn't this real sad? Assume that we choose our orientation.. And spread this assumption through media to further cement this position.. Without any alternative views (censored).. Isn't this the technique they used to squeeze out the opposition too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ?<br><br>Btw, I'm not at any point attacking AEN lah..
