But God didn't. How is this God good then? Hmm?<br><span style="color: blue;">Student</span>: (Student is silent.)<br><br><span style="color: red;">Prof</span>: You can't answer, can you? Let's start again, young fella. Is God good?<br><span style="color: blue;">Student</span>: Yes.<br><span style="color: red;">Prof</span>: Is Satan good?<br><span style="color: blue;">Student</span>: No.<br><span style="color: red;">Prof</span>: Where does Satan come from?<br><span style="color: blue;">Student</span>: From...God...<br><span style="color: red;">Prof</span>: That's right. Tell me son, is there evil in this world?<br><span style="color: blue;">Student</span>: Yes.<br><span style="color: red;">Prof</span>: Evil is everywhere, isn't it? And God did make everything. Correct?<br><span style="color: blue;">Student</span>: Yes.<br><span style="color: red;">Prof</span>: So who created evil?<br><span style="color: blue;">Student</span>: (Student does not answer.)<br><br><span style="color: red;">Prof</span>: Is there sickness? Immorality? Hatred? Ugliness? All these terrible things exist in the world, don't they?<br><span style="color: blue;">Student</span>: Yes, sir.<br><span style="color: red;">Prof</span>: So, who created them?<br><span style="color: blue;">Student</span>: (Student has no answer.)<br><span style="color: red;">Prof</span>: Science says you have 5 senses you use to identify and observe the world around you. Tell me, son...Have you ever seen God?<br><span style="color: blue;">Student</span>: No, sir.<br><span style="color: red;">Prof</span>: Tell us if you have ever heard your God?<br><span style="color: blue;">Student</span>: No , sir.<br><span style="color: red;">Prof</span>: Have you ever felt your God, tasted your God, smelt your God? Have you ever had any sensory perception of God for that matter?<br><span style="color: blue;">Student</span>: No, sir. I'm afraid I haven't.<br><span style="color: red;">Prof</span>: Yet you still believe in Him?<br><span style="color: blue;">Student</span>: Yes.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Prof</span>: According to empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol, science says your GOD doesn't exist. What do you say to that, son?<br><span style="color: blue;">Student</span>: Nothing.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Student</span></strong>: Professor, is there such a thing as heat?<br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Prof</strong></span>: Yes.<br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Student</strong></span>: And is there such a thing as cold?<br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Prof</strong></span>: Yes.<br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Student</strong></span>: No sir. There isn't.<br>(The lecture theatre becomes very quiet with this turn of events.)<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Student</strong></span>: Sir, you can have lots of heat, even more heat, superheat, mega heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat. But we don't have anything called cold.<br>We can hit 458 degrees below zero which is no heat, but we can't go any further after that.<br>There is no such thing as cold. Cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat.<br>We cannot measure cold. Heat is energy. Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it. �(There is pin-drop silence in the lecture theatre.) �<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>Student</strong></span>: What about darkness, Professor? Is there such a thing as darkness?<br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Prof: </strong></span>Yes. What is night if there isn't darkness?<br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Student</strong></span>: You're wrong again, sir. Darkness is the absence of something.<br>You can have low light, normal light, bright light, flashing light....But if you have no light constantly, you have nothing and it's called darkness, isn't it?<br>In reality, darkness isn't. If it were, you would be able to make darkness darker, wouldn't you?<br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Prof</strong></span>: So what is the point you are making, young man?<br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Student</strong></span>: Sir, my point is your philosophical premise is flawed.<br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Prof</strong></span>: Flawed? Can you explain how?<br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Student</strong></span>: Sir, you are working on the premise of duality. You argue there is life and then there is death, a good God and a bad God.<br>You are viewing the concept of God as something finite, something we can measure.<br>Sir, science can't even explain a thought. It uses electricity and magnetism, but has never seen, much less fully understood either one.<br>To view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing.<br>Death is not the opposite of life: just the absence of it. Now tell me, Professor.<br>Do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey?<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Prof</strong></span>: If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, yes, of course, I do.<br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Student</strong></span>: Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir?<br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Prof</strong></span>: (The Professor shakes his head with a smile, beginning to realize where the argument is going.)<br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Student</strong></span>: Since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavour, are you not teaching your opinion, sir?<br>Are you not a scientist but a preacher?<br><strong><span style="color: red;">Prof</span></strong>: (The class is in uproar.)<br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Student</strong></span>: Is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the Professor's brain?<br><strong><span style="color: red;">Prof</span></strong>: (The class breaks out into laughter.)<br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Student</strong></span>: Is there anyone here who has ever heard the Professor's brain, felt it, touched or smelt it?.....No one appears to have done so.<br>So, according to the established rules of empirical, stable, demonstrable protocol, science says that you have no brain, sir.   With all due respect, sir, how do we then trust your lectures, sir?<br><strong><span style="color: red;">Prof</span></strong>: (The room is silent. The professor stares at the student, his face unfathomable.)<br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Prof</strong></span>: I guess you'll have to take them on faith, son. �<br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Student</strong></span>: That is it sir.. The link between man &amp; God is FAITH. That is all that keeps things moving &amp; alive. � �<br><br>NB: I believe you have enjoyed the conversation...and if so...you'll �probably want your friends/colleagues to enjoy the same...won't �you?...forward them to increase their knowledge... ��<br><span style="color: #444444;"></span><span style="color: #444444;"></span><span style="color: darkred;"></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I thought I have actually answer tis before ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>On heat and cold, it is true tat cold is an absense of heat. But there r other quantities tat has 2 sides, such as negatively charged or positively charged. An absence of both means neutrality. An object with more positively charge ions than negative one have an overall positive charge and vice versa. The same thign can be said to magnetic forces as well. So question is, is evil and good the same as heat or same as charge ? Obviously he made the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If it is just an absence of goodness, then just call it the tree of the knowledge of good is sufficient. In Genesis 8:21, bible mention<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The LORD smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart: "Never again will I curse the ground because of man, even though [a] every inclination of his heart is <strong>evil </strong>from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done.</span><br><br>Deuteronomy 13:5<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">That prophet or dreamer must be put to death, because he preached rebellion against the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery; he has tried to turn you from the way the LORD your God commanded you to follow. You must purge <strong>the evil from among you.</strong></span><br><br>If u search the bible, u will find tat throughout it mention evil as a quantity of its own, not because of the absence of good. So the analogy of evil being created by god is true.<br><br><blockquote>Since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavour, are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you not a scientist but a preacher? </blockquote>There r strong evidence tat states tat evolution exists. On the other hand there r really weak evidence tat states your religion is true. There is a difference between believing in something tat there is actually no reason to believe in and believing in something where the evidence is strong. U never see your brain, tat is true, but surely after cutting up a few hundred people head, u can see they all have brain. If u r not convinced u can go for an ultrasound or magnetic resonance to prove your brain exist. For religion, there is nothing for u to fall back. People believe because they believe, and they can't come out with other answer other than tis.<br><br>The argument is really based on evidence versus no evidence<br><br></div>

It is quite natural for a proponent of such stands to voice their concerns, and if it is done within the confines of a predetermined parameter, ie one within a forum created for these proponents, then I suppose it should be tolerated. The folks at the other religious and philosophical forums within SGforums, too have their slant over what they'd considered as their stands. It would be extremely rude and also wrong for Christians to go into these forums and bash their philosophies. It should be understood that EH remains predominantly a Christian forum and would be natural to assume that topics posted will be in accordance with the general Christian doctrine, which may include speaking out, for example, against homosexuals. Then there are some of us who are young in the faith and are still extreme zealous to declare what we believe in - these, I sometimes address at a personal level, encouraging them to moderate a little.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> What should not be done is for any thread to evolve to a flame war. Both Christians and non-Christians are responsible in preventing this from happening. For example, as what you'd stated, EH is actually being used, sometimes, "to help Christians to understand the Bible to perform good". But for some unknown reason, it will eventually evolved into: "the Bible is a lie, Jesus did not die for your sins, blah blah blah" When that happens, can we expect less from an adverse reaction from some of us who are a little more zealous in defending what we believe in. Note that I am not giving such Christians with such reactions an excuse in any way....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> .... which leads me to state that I have tried very hard to avoid confrontation because it is pointless. I'd used EH to answer any queries I possibly can, sometimes using PMs. I'd still see myself being able to defend the faith in a less confrontational stance to people who are willing to have an open mind. Anyone else who has already formed an opinion of Christian - these I'd just stay on the level of casual communication.</div>
