The next one is Light of Atlantis at 20+. A distant 3rd position is Buddhism - Wisdom Bliss at page 2.<br><br>For people constantly looking to bashing out the "non-scientific" folks, seems that the never visit these forums regardless of how "illogical and non-scientific" these forums are also.<br><br>Others come in and see what Christian have to say on some issues, somehow, still, nothing we say seem to be right....<br><br>So is EH a victim of it's popularity? or has it become popular because it is victimised?<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>As this is a Christians forum, fundamentally whoever want to post here should respect what Christians believe, God, Jesus Christ, the BibleÂ…. What I see is that Christians beliefs or doctrines they do not agree become biased, atheists or agnostics bashing, Christians who standby what we believe become extremists or bigot. And they are ever ready to come in and give us a bashing for what they disagree.<br><br>There are also those who do not believe in the Bible but are trying to "interpret" the Bible to justify their own course. They will not accept what God says if they do not agree. How they wish the Bible says that homosexual act is right, sexual immorality is right, then we can all go on doing what we like, "For apart from law, sin is dead." Roman 7:8.<br><br>Is there a way where we can be right? We have to maintain that what is right with the Bible is right with us, what is not right with the Bible is not right. Bigotry or not!<br><br>The purpose of this forum, as I understand from sillyme the mod and starter, is "A place where we look for hope or provide hopeÂ…for my hope is in Christ, Son of God and Giver of Life. I hope that through this forum, we can share how wonderful God has been in our lives." This should be a place where Christians shares about the God we believe. Non-Christians should come here if they are interested in the God we serve, the hope we have, ask questions about Christianity and even bring up behaviors in churches or among Christians which they think are not in line with the teachings of the Bible (Christians are not perfect), or doctrines that clash with their culture. In the end we are looking for a better understanding of one another.<br><br>I enjoy very much and learn a lot from bros like you, breytonhartge, laoda, icemoonÂ…. Keep it up.<br></div>

Or so we think.<br><br><blockquote>To me the story is outright insult to science and atheists.

The author did not assert "there is a God" and went on to give the evidence. He only defended the rationality of believing in the christian faith. Essentially he is saying "you believe you have a brain why can't I believe in a God".<br><br><blockquote>3) Everyone has his own belief. You believe in Jesus, just like I believe I'm a god reincarnated. It's not right to thrash others who are not in your group.</blockquote>In the story, the professor trashed the student first. In real life, there are many people who have bones to pick with the believers. SIS is one good example.<br><br><blockquote>4) Atheists simply do not believe in religion, why would they try to use science to understand it?
