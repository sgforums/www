I don't want to impose my views on you. You took the liberty to quote Eccl 7:13 which has nothing to do with homosexuality.</strong><br><br>Yes, I can be wrong.... in the course of eternity, maybe the Bible is wrong.... maybe we are all wrong, but what's the point. The point is: for one person to call him/herself a Christian, this person must believe in the Bible. If the person cannot/will not believe in the Bible, don't call one self a Christian. If an organisation calls itself a Christian church, it must not change the tenets of Christianity. The entire argument/exchange centers on the definition of what a Christian is and what a church should be. That is all to it.<br><br>Please, please, don't ever ever say that I'm imposing my views on you. Where did you get the idea from?<br><br>Yes, God gave you brains to think, please re-read Ecclesiastes in totality.[/b]</blockquote>fr your info, i did read most of Ecc chapt 7 along with that verse, and i see it as questioning humans as to who are they to declare something unnatural and therefore a sin when God made it with his own hands. It talks of the folly of xtians who, using their human biasedness, judge what they think is or is not god's work. THAT makes it rather pertaining to homosexuality in view of today's context. And do xtians not believe that while the bible was written in the past, thru god's powers he could forsee the future and the bible could thus be written in such a way that we can discover new meanings from old passages in today's context?<br><br>And YOU are the one who keeps telling me Ecc has nothing to do with homosexuality, And when u keep telling me something U personally believe, u're imposing your view on me don't u think? Maybe I am imposing some of my views on you, but at least i don't try to deny it.</div>

That is what offends me, that xtians seem to think they MUST know it all and they MUST be right and that the way the THINK they understand the scripture MUST be right and that they aren't willing to even acknowledge that they might be mistaken because of the things they aren't aware of, or because of the things they do not want to acknowledge.</div></blockquote>I am constantly learning about things that I am not aware of, by this I read statements and comments made by all, which is why I do not think that Pokemon and Harry Potter is satanic as painted by some preachers. Or that rock music is bad for Christians. Or Christians should not eat food offered to idols.<br>Like to find out from you: where have I said that I am right? Go through all my postings, and you will never find that statement anywhere. I am willing to accept any challenge and when proven wrong, I will apologise and retract my statements (which I have done before).... <span style="font-style: italic;">so on the same note: are you? Are you willing to admit that you may have been mistaken about Eccl 7:13?</span><br><br>All I am stating:<br>1. Valid only for Christians. Non-Christians, I don't care. I will never impose my views on anyone.<br>2. Romans and 1 Corinthians is written in plan English, in many versions and languages saying the same thing.<br>3. No other verses (including Eccl 7:13) has positive things to say about homosexuality.<br>4. Unless you can provide something from the Bible that allow another dimension to the Romans and Corinthians passage, those passages stands.<br>5. As the argument is only for gay-Christian (and their supporters) the assumption is that these people recognise that the Bible is the Word of God.<br><br>Of course it is now established that there are NO TRUE Bible Scholars in the world and the intepretation of the Word of Gods are left to the masses, perhaps, anything goes.<br><br>None of the above are my personal opinions, and until you are willing to enlighten me and make me aware of where I have erred, those five points stand.<br><br>The 10 Commandments thing? Contrary to popular belief, it is not something that the church, as a whole, pays a lot of attention to. It was probably fun watching Charlton Heston doing the Moses thing, but that was it. They are good lifestyle rules. And following them is probably good for you.<br>Yup, homosexuality is not inside, neither is bigamy, bestiality etc etc. So what does that mean? Doing a dog is OK? Is this where you are going? Just because it is not in the 10Cs? Oh, please I am not imposing on how/what you should think but where were going with this one?</div>

Say, you have a grudge against someone and want to finish him off, and reads chapter 7 and sees that God is providing an answer that you MUST kill the guy, wouldn't this contradict the murder thingy.<br><br>I'd like to imaging God in all his wisdom write a Bible with cars and 7-11s because he can foresee the future, but pity the poor folks in history who have no idea what these stuff are. Taking all that in, how can you explain Romans and Corinthians and the fact that there is NOTHING ELSE specifically positive about homosexuality.<br><br>The language thing? The "I personally believe" statement? Hey it's semantics. Once I wrote without the personal believe statement, I got accused of imposing too. So now, I clearly state that it is my opinion - I personally believe - it is personal and that means you don't have to agree with me.<br>Difficult, you know. Can't please everyone. But sorry if I'd confused you.... wish I know how to best express my opinions.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">very simply, where we are going is to attack bigotry and discrimination in any guise and any form, be it religion or society.</div></blockquote>I agree with you on this one - I am totally against bigotry and discrimination. But to state something as sin is not condemning the sinner. Say you are a Christian and gay, if you are my personal friend (someone with a face and a name), I think it is within my rights to point out that something is not right. If you choose no to agree with me, I will still be your friend. I know there will be bigots anywhere and will severe such relationship, but this basis is totally wrong, if one goes with the "condemn the sin but love the sinner" concept. I have had church members telling me off 'cos I (and my sons) play pokemon and read harry potter. It is within their rights, but they don't really give me a hard time about it. At the end of the day, my explanation to them may be working 'cos no one hounds me anymore.<br><br>Peace.... gotta go... dinner appointment....<br></div>
