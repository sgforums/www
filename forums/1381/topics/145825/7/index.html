But, it should not be viewed this way. It is true that Solomon devotes most of the book to a consideration of the futility of life (the word "vanity" occurs 37 times). But, this view is approached in the context of life "under the sun" (a phrase which occurs 29 times). In other words, life is only vain if we have a "this world" concept of life. Solomon's conclusion is a<br>warning against such an attitude. He encourages the reader instead to "remember thy Creator" and to "fear God, and keep His commandments". This God-centered approach to life puts everything in perspective, and gives greater purpose to all that we do. </span></strong><br>Extracted from http://www.oconcofc.org/ecclesiastes.pdf.<br><br>Nothing in Ecclesiastes is about a gay life style. The writing was ascribed to King Solomon in his later years where he has gone through his life, in his so-called wisdom and realised that everything is empty without God.<br><br><strong>Try reading Ecc 7:13 in another language and see if the supposed implication of gay lifestyle is still present.</strong><br><br>This is a classic example of taking ONE verse out of an entire passage and reinterpreting it to suit one's agenda.[/b]</blockquote>really? and whos to say what is considered taking it out of context? on whose authority are u judging that on? who are u to say that God for sure did not create homosexuality? Besides, i might point it out to u that I did not take it out of context, rather, a xtian friend of mine highlighted several passages to me when we were discussing the debate of whether homosexuality is God's creation or not. And I'd like to hear your explanation on xtians, who aren't gay but who feel that homosexuality is a sin, and who can use the bible to argue that view. How do u explain it, and how can u tell me for sure it isn't the homophobic xtians who are quoting the bible out of context? nothing here seems to be certain does it? How can I trust u when u say u're quoting passages in context and they are quoting passages out of context? how can i and WHY should i trust any of u?</div>

It would appear that the bible is clearer on the issue of not wearing mixed fibres than it is on homosexuality! and yet xtians do not obey something that is so clearly written, and choose to take stands on a clouded issue.

How can I trust u when u say u're quoting passages in context and they are quoting passages out of context? how can i and WHY should i trust any of u?</div></blockquote>well let's not get to emotive about this thing.<br>for starters, do all the research you can on the book of Ecclesiastes. You WILL NOT FIND any reference on homosexuality in this book from all prominent Bible scholars (who are not my friends).<br><br>I did not quote from any friends.<br><br>So far I have show text from Romans and 1 Corinthians, and please use all language and versions you can lay your hands on, and they will say the same thing.<br><br>On the other hand, you'd quoted from Ecclesiastes, which in any language (or from any Bible expository) does not refer to homosexuality.<br><br>Not a single quotation from any supposedly homophobic source.<br><br>Also, don't trust me, don't trust anyone. Read the Bible, the entire book of Ecclesiastes and come to the conclusion yourself that there really is a reference on homosexual - no just one or two words from on verse of 12 chapter book that talks about the sadness of life.<br><br>Allow me to give you the New International Version of Ecc 7:13 - Consider what God has done: Who can straighten what he has made crooked?<br><br>Let me "give" you another homosexual verse: James 2:3 And ye have respect to him that weareth the <strong>gay </strong>clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool: (KJV WBS YLT) <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">So does this verse prove inclusively that homosexual is ok, afterall the person in the verse is wearing gay clothing?</span></strong><br><br>The dictionary's definiton of gay:<br>1. Of, relating to, or having a sexual orientation to persons of the same sex.<br>2. Showing or characterized by cheerfulness and lighthearted excitement; merry.<br>3. Bright or lively, especially in color: a gay, sunny room.<br>4. Given to social pleasures.<br>5. Dissolute; licentious.<br>The problem here is: meaning number 1 is a very very new definiton.<br><br>I don't know who you friends are, and what they'd said to you, but it is irrelevant in this discussion. You also do not need to believe what I'd written. You need to read the passages where we both quoted from, ask yourself what is the context they were written - these are simple task that I teach my sons when doing comprehension. Decide again, if there is any positive reference on homosexuality in the Bible.<br>You conclusion can be:<br>I don't believe in the Bible - that being the case, no need to argue from the angle of the Bible.<br>Inconclusive - than you need to do more research in books written by Bible scholars, no need to quote friends or debate with someone like me who knows very little.<br>Homosexual is OK for you - which is fine with me, if you are a non-Christian.</div>

Unfortunately I cannot do that, I need to deal with it. Has it been easy - nope, it is actually very tough. Along the same line, is paedophile a medical condition? I really don't know.

Did anyone put out a public announcement tat all people who r fat r sinners and being discriminated ? Even people of other faith r affected as they r being discriminated by the believer of christainity/catholic. Wat happen to the so called free will ? If it is nature, then we shouldn't discriminate these people. U r not born of the condition, tat is why it is easy for people to say "deal with it".<br><br><blockquote>This statement is only partly true. The true part is that humans can and wil interprete anything to their convenience.<br>The part of something being written that "God stated that everything in the scriptures are iron laws that cannot be changed" is a little dubious. What cannot be changed is the content (think a verse in Revelation supports this). There are very few so-called "iron laws" in the Bible. There are probably ten in the OT (10 Commandments), and probably only two in the NT (Love God, Love others as God has loved us). Things written by the Apostles in the letters pertains to public and private conduct that may apply to certain groups of people, many of these points are actually pretty practical. </blockquote>Tat is very funny, is homosexual part of the 10 commandments from OT or the 2 iron laws in NT ? It is not either. U r refering to the other laws from the OT and from the OT u can find out other laws such as not eating prawns, stoning non-virgins or releasing pigeons after a period. U r really pick and choose the kind of laws u want isn't it ? If u find the OT laws r for Jews only, then Jesus Christ is only for Jews and not for the other people since the messiah is mention in the OT.

If u say tat u do not live in the times of 4000-300 BC so u do nto have to follow OT, but u r not living in 0 BC to 300 BC as well. Why follow the 2000 year old book ?<br><br></div>
