            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>"How did these various pieces come to be regarded as Scripture by Jewish and, later, Christian communities? There were no committees that sat down to decree what was or was not a holy book. To some degree, the process of Scripture-making, or canonization as it is often called (from the Greek word kanon, a "measuring rod" ), involved a process, no longer completely understood, by which the Jewish community decided which works reflected most clearly its vision of God. The antiquity, real or imagined, of many of the books was clearly a factor, and this is why Psalms was eventually attributed to David, and Proverbs, Song of Songs, and Ecclesiastes (along with, by some people, Wisdom of Solomon in the Apocrypha) to Solomon. However, mere age was not enough. There had to be some way in which the Jewish community could identify its own religious experiences in the sacred books.<br><br>This occurred, at least in part, through an elaborate process of biblical interpretation. Simply reading a text involves interpretation. Interpretative choices are made even in picking up today's newspaper; one must know the literary conventions that distinguish a news report, for example, from an op-ed piece. The challenge becomes much more intense when one reads highly artistic texts from a different time and place, such as the Bible. "<br>Conclusion? Interpretation, contextual understanding is important. </blockquote>So wat is your conclusion ? The bible is fallible and subjective to each people interpretations ? If one want to read it to show tat OT is relevant, there r scipture evidence tat support his cause but if another wanna ignore the old laws he can again selectively read and believe the other sections of the bible ?<br><br><blockquote>Okay, let's talk biblically lar. In the beginning, God made man and women. And He wants them to multiply. God made women because He knows that man desire company. With women made, God commanded them to multiply and bear fruit.<br><br>The question I would like to ask you is: Can homosexuality lead to pregnancy and bear child? If it can't, doesn't it mean against God's wonderful plan of filling the earth with people? It is definitely not pleasant to God and God did not make homosexuality. Disability/handicap is a consequences of sin. It has reflected that the earth is in a sorry state of condition. But homosexuality is consequence of sin entering earth. It is a reflection of how man desire accompaniment to fill the void in them. In my view, and biblically, homosexuality is a sin lo.<br><br></blockquote>Tat is right. In the bible god made man and woman and they have to be united and bear offsprings. SO if going by tat principle people who didn't marry also commit the same offence as homosexual. God made adam and eve not made adam itself. So aren't priest tat vowed calibracy commiting the same offence as homosexual ? At least being homosexual may means he still can have sex with girls and still give offsprings. Can being priest tat substain from such acts leads to pregnancy ? If it can't doesn't it mean they r against the god wonderful plan of filling earth with people ?<br><br></div>

Look at the sorry state the planet earth is facing. God cursed the earth because of sin!<br><br>Jesus came to fulfil the laws according to God's will.

Nvm, read below to clarify lar..) . I would assume that you know the meaning of the word "homosexual" ba. You said that "At least being homosexual may means he still can have sex with girls and still give offsprings". But the bible tell us that Jesus told us: "4"Haven't you read," he replied, "that at the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female,'[a] 5and said, 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh'[b]? 6So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate." (Matthew 19:4-6)<br><br>So we know that in the beginning God wants man and women to be united as one and not commit adultary. God created man to be joint with women lawfully. However, since sin has come into the world, man can no longer fulfil this plan according to God's pure justice. Therefore, there is nothing wrong to being not married as Paul has also encouraged us to remain single, if that is possible. It is also a sin to have sex with other girls.<br><br>As for the priest thingy, Chin Eng has answered your question.  (Thanks Chin Eng.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) According to Catholic tradition, Priest is supposed to represent Christ. Therefore, Priest pratise calibracy . Please correct me if I'm wrong with this because I'm not a Catholic.<br><br>If you have further interest in my answer, do reply and I will try my best to answer them, if that is within my knowledge.<br><br>[THE ABOVE IS MY VIEW AND THE ENQUIRIES ARE BIBLICALLY ANSWERED.]</div>

If you are a homosexual and is NOT a Christian, I really don't give a s-hit.<br><br>You can claim that you sat down with your friend to examine the Bible, I like to know a few things:<br>1. Why the Bible, if you are not a Christian? Why the need to justify your inclination?<br>2. Who's this friend? It's like me approaching my best buddy who may be a chemist for medical advice when I am sick. He may know something about medication but he's not a doctor. Sure.. probably this person has the same inclincation as you but whatever that maybe, but what's his/her take on the epistles? Sames as yours? Then this person should stop calling himself a Christian.<br>3. On what basis are you using to take away parts of the Bible? Just because something did not agree with your view? or just because some were written by men? Under this <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>assumption</strong></span>, the entire NT is written by man. Why make the distinction between the Gospel of John and the letters of John, or the Gospel of Matthew and the epistles of Paul....?? It goes back to your basis of definition. <span style="font-style: italic;">At least most of the atheists that visits EH are consistent in this point - they totally do not believe in the Bible. </span>You are taking out parts that did not agree with your lifestyle and gives superfluous meanings to other verses.<br>4. You said you spent time reading the Bible, then where is the support for homosexuality? You stumble verse upon verse that condemns it and you TAKE IT OUT????<br><br>Blind faith is, of course, bad. But so is blind reliance on your personal opinion. I am more than willing to reconsider my standing, if you can show me a clear verse in the Bible that supports homosexuality. You on the other hand is totally unwilling to accept that perhaps you and your friends are wrong even when confronted with Biblical verses which you suddenly feel to have the liberty to discount.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">YOU STILL HAVE NOT EXPLAINED ON ECCLESIASTES - AND I AM STILL WAITING.</span> and do your friends have any answer to your claim?</div>

Here's an article that documented Dalai Lama's conversation on the gay issues..<br>http://quietmountain.org/links/teachings/gayrites.htm<br><br>In the scripture itself.. Sexual Misconduct is one of the "precepts".. Homosexuality was not labelled as a Sexual Misconduct until more recently, when Western Religions (through colonisation) came to this region..<br><br>Also, read this article from wikipedia..<br><br><strong>Buddhism<br><br>One of the five precepts of Buddhism states that one is to refrain from sexual misconduct or, more accurately, one is to refrain from indulging in sexual desire. Most Buddhist schools construe this to mean that monks and nuns are to practice celibacy. However, there has been a diversity of opinions on this matter ranging from strict vows of celibacy to Japanese Buddhist schools that taught heterosexuality was to be avoided for clergy.<br><br>For laypersons today, this precept mainly applies to adultery. However, wide ranges of interpretations are possible about what exactly constitutes "sexual misconduct" and therefore the different schools of Buddhism - or even different individual monks - at different periods of time have offered varying opinions.<br><br>Interpretations of what constitutes misconduct include sex outside marriage (relatively modern idea), sex with another person without the consent of your life partner(s), or the historically prevalent view that it was limited to describe rape, incest and bestiality.<br><br>Buddhist schools condemning homosexuality is a recent development and there is no scriptural basis upon which it is to be condemned. Prior to colonialism under Abrahamic countries homosexuality was sanctified by Buddhist leaders throughout Asia.<br><br>Different countries held various views, for example in China where believers often belong to Confucianism as well, exclusive homosexuality was discouraged because it would prevent a son from carrying out his Confucian religious duty to reproduce, all at the same time non-exclusive homosexuality was permissible and widely practiced.<br><br>Within Japanese traditions homosexuality was said to have been started by the Bodhisattva Manjusri of wisdom and the sage Kukai while in China it is attributed to the Yellow Emperor, the father of China.<br><br>In India, Tibet, China, Southeast Asia and Japan, areas where Buddhism was or remains one of the chief religions their cultures have been historically unconcerned with the gender of sexual activity or the object of desire.<br></strong><br></div>
