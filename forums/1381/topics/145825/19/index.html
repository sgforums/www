Anything else, especially such a touch and grey topic like sexuality, what Paul has said, is simply not impartial enuf to be taken 100% for sure as the law. And in such a case, where something is so unclear that if not clarified, it can be debated either way, since neither Jesus nor God themselves have choosen to clarify that homosexuality is a sin, I rest my case that not only is it justified for me, but for millions of Christians in general, to believe homosexuality is not a sin as well.</div></blockquote>I have read the sites I posted. The bible is absolutely clear that homosexuality is a sin. I hope you read the articles and go and refered to the relevant verses that have been put up. The bible is very clear indeed leh.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay lar, I put the verses to let you see:<br><br>Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor <span style="text-decoration: underline;">homosexual offenders </span>nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-10)<br><br>26Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. 27In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.<br><br>28Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done. 29They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, 30slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; 31they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless. 32Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.<br>(Romans 1:26-32)<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sodom and Gomorrah Destroyed </span><br>1 The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. 2 "My lords," he said, "please turn aside to your servant's house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning."<br>"No," they answered, "we will spend the night in the square."<br>3 But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate. 4 Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of SodomÂ—both young and oldÂ—surrounded the house. 5 They called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them."<br><br>6 Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him 7 and said, "No, my friends. Don't do this wicked thing. 8 Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don't do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof."<br><br>9 "Get out of our way," they replied. And they said, "This fellow came here as an alien, and now he wants to play the judge! We'll treat you worse than them." They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door.<br><br>10 But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. 11 Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door.<br><br>12 The two men said to Lot, "Do you have anyone else hereÂ—sons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here, 13 because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the LORD against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it."<br><br>(Genesis 19:1-13)<br><br>Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.

Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.<br><br>28Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done. 29They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, 30slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; 31they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless. 32Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.<br>(Romans 1:26-32)<br><br>Good nite</div></blockquote>I've said earlier liao. PAUL wrote this. He wrote this to express his thoughts. Nothing in the Bible says that Jesus or God ever said that. So its not only me, but millions of Christians who not only think its not a sin to be homosexual, but are also uncomfortable that their fellow Christians could use a passage of a human's words to justify their own homophobia. I think that is very clear cut too. Christianity preaches tolerance, not intolerance.</div>

While I do not doubt that Paul wrote 1 Cor, I do think that just because Paul wrote something expressing his views does not necessary make that THE WORD or THE LAW. Paul is human. John writing down what Jesus himself had said is different from Paul writing down what he thinks might be or not be.<br><br>It is simply foolish to trust everything in it because just reading thru 1 Cor, gut feeling is that it doesn't seem right, and its different from the nature of what Jesus says. Furthermore, Jesus himself never said that homosexuality is wrong, and when u have such a grey area topic like sexuality, don't u think Jesus would have seen fit to clarify a topic that, if it were a sin, would have to be clarified?<br><br>So no, I won't be trapped by the way u frame it, either believe in, or not, because nothing is so simple, that u can either believe in a huge compliation of different scriptures of different nature or u not. As for the Old Testaments, its meant for the Jews only and since Jesus is the messiah, it has been rendered void, so no need to discuss about that.</div>

Anything else, especially such a touch and grey topic like sexuality, what Paul has said, is simply not impartial enuf to be taken 100% for sure as the law. And in such a case, where something is so unclear that if not clarified, it can be debated either way, since neither Jesus nor God themselves have choosen to clarify that homosexuality is a sin, I rest my case that not only is it justified for me, but for millions of Christians in general, to believe homosexuality is not a sin as well.</div></blockquote>I see that your view to the Bible is basically "selective reading". So it seems that to you as long as Jesus did not explicitly state something, your opinion is everything else is can be ignored at your convenience...?? Maybe doing the dog is ok too?? Since neither Jesus nor Paul made any comments about it....???<br><br>I see your view on the Bible is really odd... OT laws don't apply to you, as we agreed, cos we are not Jews. NT don't apply to you 'cos for most parts they "were written by opinionated men". So where is your basis for Christianity, assuming you are claiming to be a Christian? If you are not a Christian, why use the Bible to justify homosexuality?<br><br>Homosexual rape??? Rape is rape. Homosexual or heterosexual... why differentiate? Why do you think that OT makes a specific mention on homosexual rape on the presumption that it is not OK? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Still... you have not answered my question on Ecclesiastes...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Christianity preaches tolerance, not intolerance.</strong></blockquote>This is a mistaken concept..... a pacificist view on Christianity. Throughout the Bible, the teaching that God hates sins is very clear. The fact that we are told to love sinners does not mean that we need to tolerate the sins. All the epistles contain various rebukes by Paul/James/John/Peter to the churches who have committed sins. Tolerance was not evident in these writing. Of course one can still go on the "these-are-personal-opinions-expressed-by-old-fogeys" line.<br><br>I want to be clear on one point here.... the rebukes by the apostles were mostly directed at Christians, Jews and gentiles who believe in Christ... not applicable to non-Christians.</div>
