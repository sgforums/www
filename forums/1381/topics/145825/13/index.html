            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry for being away for so long... Tying up the loose ends first<br><br><blockquote>Aiyah... the prawn issue again..... well let's look at the context of Leviticus:<br>Leviticus<br>1:1The LORD called to Moses and spoke to him from the Tent of Meeting. He said, 2"Speak to the Israelites and say to them: `When any of you brings an offering to the LORD, bring as your offering an animal from either the herd or the flock.<br><br>bla bla bla bla bla bla</blockquote>U see, Moses only have influence on israelites.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  All the other tribes r probably killed and became slaves when moses is on the journey to the promised land. (those who believe r in judaism r "israelites", and not necessary must be the citizens of Israel) In fact when Jesus address the people on the mountian, when he deliver the speech they r all, in fact, Israelites as well.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. 18I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. 19Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven</span><br><br>And from tis passage, he already clearly stated tat people who follow the old laws r to be liked by god while those who do not follow the law r least liked by him. As said before, if u felt tat the old laws r for only israelites, then all the teachings from jesus r for israelites only as well since the whole religion starts basically from judaism.<br><br><blockquote>unless I am an Israelite, I'd say the entire book of Leviticus is not really meant for me, doctrinally</blockquote>Then why do u think it is included in the bible  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote>Like I say I really don't care what his comments are. I like him less than John Paul. He also condemned Harry Potter</blockquote>However u do agree with him on the point of homosexual isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>You assume that all bigamous relation are problematic. Might not be so.<br>My argument is NOT on discrimation. I have specifically stated that I am against discrimination.<br>My argument is about translation and understanding of the Bible. </blockquote>If bigamous relation r not problematic, I have no problems with it. The whole point about bigamy is really started by u. If u felt tat it is only about translation and understanding of the bible, then why do u bring tis into the picture ?<br><br><blockquote>Well I have already stated who Leviticus is meant for.... the Israelites and their leaders. There are so many verses in this book stating clearly who should be reading it. So can we now give the prawn issue a rest. I just had three crayfish last night.... </blockquote>IMO, it is meant for people of the lord, as seen in DT 27<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Then Moses and the priests, who are Levites, said to all Israel, "Be silent, O Israel, and listen! You have now become <strong>the people of the LORD your God</strong>.</span><br><br>And it sound completely reasonable since these laws apply for u if u r a believer of god and if u r not the people of god then u don't believe. If u think the laws r for israelites only, then why r these laws part of the bible ?<br><br><blockquote>The Church decides on how the bible should be interpreted and taught. The lay people don't. </blockquote>I thought the bible is meant to be simple and everyone can understand them if they read it. Otherwise wat is the point of the bible when it is hard to understand, no one can interprete it and it is up to the imagination of a group of people to interprete them<br><br><blockquote>The Church compiled the books in the bible. So it doesn't make sense if someone says that the Christians twist the words. The bible teaching belongs to them in the first place. </blockquote>Lets put it tis way. They r already one sided to just proclaim the good side of the bible while defending against the words tat speak badly about it.</div>

Jesus's mission is really to bring God to the common folks. Hence, it's strange to say that a common folk won't be able to understand the Bible.<br><br>2) The Bible was written by various authors ard 2000 yrs ago. The Book of Revelation, according to BBC's ancient evidences, was written to predict the fall of Rome. The reader at that time would understand the symbology used in the Book of Revelation. However, in the modern world, without understand the historical background when the Book was written, it's hard for nowadays common folks to understand. Anyway, the documentaries were made in consultation with theologists and historians. The most interesting thing they discovered is that the devil is not denoted by the number 666, but by 616.
