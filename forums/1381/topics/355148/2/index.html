              <p>oh so you can believe that out of nothing "suddenly there's an explosion" the big bang created the world with order, the trees, plants, birds,seas,lands and mammals.</p>
              <p>let me tell you every "missing link" that was found was an fully formed creature God created. it wasn't half-way done, everything was perfect.</p>
              <p>and God made the birds of the air first before it made the creatures on the ground including insects and other tiny creatures. Then he formed man with His own hands.</p>
              <p>The existence of God is obvious, it's everywhere. You cannot tell a painter his own painting "hey i believe this painting wasn't painted by a painter, it was maybe formed when the red then yellow then blue hit it. then it appears to be a painting. That is what the world is doing right now, ignoring the existence of your Creator.</p>
              <p>and about the wisdom tooth comment.</p>

              <p>The answer to your 'Why?' is because you wrote that "Christianity cannot be proven". Since you wrote it, I am sure you know the answer and thus, my asking of why you say it cannot be proven.</p>
              <p>As for your 2nd question "Are you saying that it can be proven?", my answer is "I have not said anything about whether it can or cannot be proven."</p>
              <p>Thus since you wrote that Christianity cannot be proven and if you can explain the reason why you wrote so, I would love to hear your explanation. Else, I would take it that your comment was posted without an understanding behind what was written.</p>

              <p>The level of scientific ignorance is astounding. The OP doesn understand what the defination of a "scientific theory" is, which differ from common daily usage. No scientific knowledge can be absolutely proven, and are constantly refined as new evidence reveals themselves. A theory such as evolution (or relativity for the matter) are all supported with massive amount of evidence, and is one of the more successful theories out there.</p>
              <p>Crackpot unfalsifiable claims such as creationism do not qualify as a scientific theory simply because it could never be tested.</p>

              <p>GENEVA: The swine flu virus that has killed dozens in Mexico
              could mutate into a "more dangerous" strain, a senior WHO official
              said on Sunday, adding that the UN agency will decide on Tuesday if
              it should raise its alert rating.</p>
              <p>"Yes, it's quite possible for this virus to evolve," Keiji
              Fukuda, acting WHO assistant-general for health, security and the
              environment told journalists.</p>
              <p>"When viruses evolve, clearly they can become more dangerous to
              people," he said.</p>

              <p>Oh yes! Thanks for reminding~ The watch and its designer concept...</p>
              <p>We all know that the watch is created by the designer because it has complicated parts... Nobody who found a watch in the desert or jungle will say that a watch is evolved or something like that rite?</p>
              <p>So human gotta be created by a designer rite? =)</p>
