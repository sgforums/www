              <p><br>I don't really disagree with that. Though i believe we can decide for ourselves what that purpose to be. I believe it is more demostrative of God's power to be able to accomadate multiple possiblities and paths, rather than that of only one straight direction.</p>
              <p>It becomes a problem when we designate that purpose to be given by another being which since does not physically appear before us cannot be reasoned with or disputed. If non believers wants to disagree, believers would insist that this is God's will and cannot be reasoned with.</p>

              <p>Hey let's talk about something smaller, an organ of a body and see if it could have logically taken that evolution route. If you were to take any part of the eye the retina for example, it does not work. the lens or the cornea? blindness. for the eye to see, all parts must be functional and or course present. that in in itself is a strong argument for design am i right?</p>
              <p>i go into another direction, we take the concept back into the evolutionary chain. somewhere along the way, a creature making its way to humanity would have had to begin having an eye. the eye could not have evolved because there is nothing that would have caused a creature to begin forming a sightless eye. Since the evolutionary theory says changes come about because of adaptation, tell me what could have caused an eyeless thing to will a useless eye into its head? how would it ever know that it would need an eye that could see?</p>
              <p>An eye could either see or it can't and there is no reason for a creature to develop a partial eye just so it could become a seeing eye later. So where did the eye begin? Randomly or by design?</p>
