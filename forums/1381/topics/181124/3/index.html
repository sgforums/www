I don't believe this is uncommon. Perhaps these people were <strong>Buddhist in name only</strong>. They may have had their Buddhist shrines and numerous rituals but I think they were just following these things because that's what their parents did and <strong>they didn't really have a true understanding.</strong>  Unlike Western Buddhism whereas buddhism in the East is so laden with rituals and tied in to cultures by folk traditions that the dharma is often obscured. Also in my experience of the last couple of years I have found born again Christians to be very friendly and charming but <strong>underneath that exterior an extremely aggressive need to convert others without exception</strong>. It is very interesting to observe their modus operandi. If you are Buddhist in name only (joss stick buddhists)and also maybe having problems in your life, you are ripe for the picking.
