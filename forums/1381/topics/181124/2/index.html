            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Continue to pray sincerely that you will be a Christian and pray that your family will accept you. Prayer works in strange ways, it's a way or a method which can help you in this situation.<br><br>Also during these times, relax a bit, dont get into conflict with them, slow down and lower down your guards, so you can smoothly bring the transition over. Being low key is the way.<br><br>Show them your love and care towards them, how much you love them, and how much you care also about your new found faith. They love you and they will definitely come to an understanding and acceptance. They will. Love and faith is the key. Just dont rush because acceptance may take time.</div>

Therefore, if you changed you behavious suddenly, like getting upset to them or argue with them whenever  you start a converstaion with them about religion, they will definitely be upset &amp; will want to oppose you.  Never use SATAN as the excuse.  You must be conscious of whatever you say or do to them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a 1st Gen Christian myself and in the same family setting as you. I came to know Christ when I was in P4 and that's in the year '99. I accepted Christ in my heart during my Boys Brigade Devotion Time. Let me share my testimony.<br><br>I started to have confidence to pray when I'm in P5 and that is the year 2000. During that time, I go church once in a blue moon, during Boys Brigade activities such as enrollment, BB Week and Sharity Gift Box. I started to know more about Christ. P6 was when I decide to go church whenever I have the chance but I still have objection from Parents and my Grand-Mother. I continue to pray, knowing that one day, God will open the way for me.<br><br>During Sec 1 in the year 2002, I started interacting with Christian friends in my class and that built up my Christian life. In Sec 2 and that's the year 2003, I faced a difficult family problem and during one of the time, I just cried out in prayer during the situation. The first time I prayed loudly in front of my family members. My parents is argueing every night and eventually my mother attempted suicide one evening and sent to CGH and eventually to IMH for a fortnight. That is when I asked for permission to start going to church. Permission was miracluously granted without any condition. That deepen my faith in Christ.<br><br>I started attending church service for 1 1/2 year. During this time, we started a prayer group with my friends in school and build up my Christian faith. In Aug 2004 when I took my step to accept Christ during alter call and take on my cross to follow Jesus. My family problem have somehow quieten down alot. I decided to be baptised, but don't know how to tell my father. That very night after I've prayed, my father called me, I'm staying with my aunt. I took the chance to ask him and he agreed. During that 1 month between my Baptism Preparation Course and date of Baptism, I have times when my family members tried to ask me if I wish to delay my Baptism. I told them I've decided for myself and they didn't probe further. I took my step of faith and went ahead with my Baptism on 15 Aug '04.<br><br>From then on, I have a great time with God and He answered all my prayer. My Christian life was fun. I was suddenly hit with a case of severe internal bleeding in Mar '05 and I stopped schooling. I prayed, I tried almost every form of praying for the whole year but the bleeding never stopped. Experience so much agony and felt that God is forsaking me. However, I still hold on to Christ everlasting Promise that He've made. During that period, I continued praying. During Dec '05, I went to Thailand with my Boys Brigade and did mission work. I never have the thought of leaving Christ and putting down the cross I'm carrying. My operation date is already set by then. Up to the very day before I went in for my operation, people pray intensely for me, I prayed too. I know God wants me to go through this trial of faith.<br><br>I went in for my operation on 14th Feb and even at that very moment, I was praying until my G.A took effect. During my initial recovery in hospital, I suffered intense pain and vomiting. But I still hold on to my faith in Christ. Each time I have pain, I messaged my church group to pray for me and I pray and rebuked the pain. My pastor came to visit me and prayed for me too.<br><br>Right now as I looked back, I realise that Christ never forsaked me in any moment. Instead, because of the rough times I've been through, I'm now a stronger Christian. And also through these, my aunt is starting to believe in Christ. Praise God.<br><br>Don't ever think it's too long to get your famiily member to give you the approval because I took 2 - 3 years of prayer before I was given approval. God have everything drafted out for you. Continue praying because prayer is a powerful weapon. With Christ for me, nothing is against me !</div>
