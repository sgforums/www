However, it happens.<br><br>Everyone around me play a big role in influencing my burning interest in discovering purpose of life.<br><br>Fortunately, these people are christians(soccer friends, Pre-U school friends and i guess my own curiousity).<br><br>i do not want to break the news immediately to them. So, i slowly try to hint to them by placing bible everywhere, missing from my room in Sunday mornng(i always sleep till late and they know service is held every sunday morning), sing christian songs...<br><br>my mother start to approach me  a few months back" You can go to church but dont get too serious arh!!"<br><br>my 2nd sister said to me today "you can go to church but never ever think about becoming a christian, mum and dad will be so depressed and disappointed."<br><br>i've been praying faithfully since i became one. i should say this is my biggest worry.. all i can do now is pray and wait for a right moment and break the news to them... or wad do u think ? please advice me... esp. for 1st generation christian..  beside praying and asking for God's helping hand, what should i do?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, I would give this advice. Being a christian and living in a place with people who are not a christian can be quite challenging. Its not just a difference in ideals, but viewpoints as well.<br><br>Its like being an eskimo in a hot country. However, situations changes overtimes when one learns to adapt. So, initially your family members might be feeling awkward over your religion, but as time passes by, Im sure they will understand you.<br><br>Their doubts probably stems from the fact that they do not your religion as well as they know theirs, that could explain why they dont wish you to be involve too much in your religion--they simply lack knowledge on the subject.<br><br>When I started going to church, my parents also became very defensive and insisted that I do not dabble too much in it, I even had several quarrels with them over the issue of religion. Eventually, everything worked out when they understood a bit more about christianity. So take it easy, its just a matter of time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I believe you need to let them understand Christianity bit by bit, and show them that Christ works in your life. Maybe then they may accept it. If by any case they do not, continue praying. All the best! Do approach church members or friends for advice too..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>brown_obsession,<br>seems like you are going through what I had went through before, I am born in a traditional taoist family. Till age 16, I would not have been able to imagine myself being Christian (so uncool, so much rules®ulations ...etc),<br>So when I first accepted Christ, I was not sure how to let my parents know about it.<br>So its with much prayers and encouragement from my friends that I sit down and discuss it over with my parents respectfully (key is must be with respect to them), Thank God that after that discussion, my parents was able to accept me being a Christian.<br>If I may add this, as our parents/siblings may not be ready to be Christian yet, do not try to convert them "by force", especially parents. Do however continue to pray for them, and entrust them into God's hands. Another thing is, must be truthful to them and not keep them in the dark, pray for a right opportunity to discuss things with them in a repectful manner.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>May the peace of God keeps you strong.</div>

This means you should honour them for their viewpoints and their believes. It has never meant that you should ignore your parents words in place of Jesus. Your parents matters to you also. thats why you call them parents and jesus ask you to honour them.</div>

Afterall, my parents are His beloved children too. what my parents did to bring me up are nothing compared what Jesus did to me.

BUT, IT IS NOT A CHOICE BETWEEN JESUS AND YOUR PARENTS!!<br><br>Take note, God now has a plan for you, to bring your parents and the rest of your family to Christ!! Quarrelling with your family is the last thing you should do.<br><br>If your parents do not insist that you pray to their Gods, it is a blessing from our God and your parents are very kind already.<br><br>My suggestion is that you focus on how you live your new life! You can only influence them if you show a POSITIVE difference in you. Dwelling too much in words and religious activities is not likely to impact them. Love, care and tolerance will manifest the love of God, together with your prayers, let the Holy Spirit do the changing of hearts.<br><br>May God's blessing be with you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok ok thanx, so basically be a walking bible? show even more care and concern towards them, pray to God and at the same time honour your parents. well ppl in my church told me it is a good start for them to say " can go to church but dont get too serious" cos that was what happened b4 they came to christ ( for 1st generation christian) .<br><br>And my friend all told me not to rush, cos i always get impatient , wanting to tell them asap but yet if i tell them now.. it is really unwise and when i pray abt it, i dont think it is time yet.. So in the meantime, to keep the pressure off i just meditate phillipians 4:6-7 "Be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your request be made known to God and the peace of God which surpasses all understanding will guard your heart and minds through Jesus Christ"<br><br>i will take note everything u guys said  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  thanx for the encouragment<br>honestly, i know i should be worried but sometimes i just cant help it.<br>chunyong, i am emotionally too exhausted to rebut what you say...</div>
