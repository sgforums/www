              <p><br> let me give you another piece of advice. If you are a policeman,
              you should not sleep well when criminals are at large. If you are
              somehow related to the criminals you ought not sleep well for you
              had not done your part to help the criminals from committing the
              crime. If you were there witnessing the crime, you ought to be
              ashamed of yourself if you had not done your part to stop the
              crime.</p>

              <p>You sound sincere in your question. To us Christian, all men (and women) are creation of God, and it is the wish of God that the created are ultimately reunited with Him in eternity. What separate us from God is sin. It is our belief that we are born with the root of sin, away from God, e.g. human are more prone to do bad things than good. </p>
              <p>To be reunited with God, man's effort to do good would be in vain because of our sinful nature. In God's love, Jesus made the sacrifice on the cross to make atonement for our sin, so that we can be reunited with God. That is our belief.</p>
              <p>Of course, non Christian would not agree with us, for if they believe, they would be Christians.</p>
              <p>To believe in God, and accepting Jesus is an individual choice.</p>

              <p>You sound sincere in your question. To us Christian, all men (and women) are creation of God, and it is the wish of God that the created are ultimately reunited with Him in eternity. What separate us from God is sin. It is our belief that we are born with the root of sin, away from God, e.g. human are more prone to do bad things than good. </p>
              <p>To be reunited with God, man's effort to do good would be in vain because of our sinful nature. In God's love, Jesus made the sacrifice on the cross to make atonement for our sin, so that we can be reunited with God. That is our belief.</p>
              <p>Of course, non Christian would not agree with us, for if they believe, they would be Christians.</p>
              <p>To believe in God, and accepting Jesus is an individual choice.</p>
