            <div class='col-md body'>Faith and Belief: The Difference<br><br>People often times erroneously equate the two concepts above. But nothing could be farther from the truth. These two concepts may have similarities but similarity does not mean sameness.<br><br>Understanding the difference dispels the antagonism of other so called Â“ChristianÂ” groups who despised and write off the theology of salvation by faith alone. When they hear: Â“Salvation is by FAITH ALONEÂ” they would say: Â“Height of speculative nonsense!!!!Â”<br><br>Those words could have been true if faith means belief. But the two are not identical. So what is faith? And what is belief?<br><br>Faith involves the mind, the emotions and the will. Belief touches only the mind. Faith is trusting. Belief is having mental cognizance of a matter and assenting its truthfulness. All who have faith has belief but not all who believe has faith.<br><br>Joh 2:23 Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, <strong>many believed in His name when they saw the signs which He did.<br><br>24 But Jesus did not commit Himself to them, because He knew all men</strong>,<br><br>Belief is knowing something about the Lord Jesus Christ while Faith is knowing the Lord Jesus Christ. It can be confusing sometimes because the two can be in a sense be the same. Belief and faith, in a way, can be lumped in one word Â‘BelieveÂ’. But faith goes degrees deeper than belief. No one can have faith in Christ unless he has first heard and believed the facts about Him.<br><br>Faith is committing and resting yourself to who Christ is and what He has done in Calvary. While belief is merely mentally knowing something about Him and what He has done and not committing yourself to Him. Belief is knowing something about the truth, faith is using that truth to your advantage and benefit. Belief is knowing that there is a rock there to keep you safe. Faith is hiding in that rock<br><br>2Ti 1:12 For this reason I also suffer these things; nevertheless I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have <strong>believed</strong> and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have <strong>committed</strong> to Him until that Day.<br><br>Practical Application<br><br>HereÂ’s the truth:<br><br>You are a sinner, helpless to save yourself from sin. Helpless to make yourself perfectly righteous in GodÂ’s sight. Christ Jesus came to die for your sins so that you will be perfectly righteous in GodÂ’s eyes.<br><br>If you are born in a Christian family you might very well know these things and believe that these things are true. But the Question is: Have you used this truth as a balm to your helpless soul? Have you appropriated this truth to  yourself?<br><br>How do you know that you have appropriated this truth to yourself<br><br>1)	Have you stopped believing that your works could somehow make you perfectly righteous before God?<br><br>2)	WhatÂ’s your motive in doing good works? Is it done with a motive to pay for your sins and earn yourself a place in heaven? If yes, then you have not used the truth above my friend. You merely assent to it but not have faith in it.<br><br>When God says you are perfectly righteous in GodÂ’s eyes through what the Lord Jesus did. FAith says: "thatÂ’s enough for my soul." Have faith in it. DonÂ’t just mentally believe it. Rest on what Christ has done.<br><br>Sound simple? Yes, itÂ’s simple because you were not the one who died and suffered on the cross of Calvary. ItÂ’s simple because itÂ’s a gift. Heaven is not a belief away. No. ItÂ’s just a faith away.<br></div>
