              cannot enter.. because there is no one righteous..  How many millions

              </blockquote>
              <p>If the Law was there from the beginning, then why was Jacob not killed when he deceived his own father Isaac? The Law says he who dishonors his parents should be stoned, doesn't it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have repeatedly said that the Grace we have received is not to be used as an excuse to sin.  In fact, I have also repeatedly mentioned that because of His grace, we now want to live according to His law, but this time, it is because the Spirit is the one who leads us.   But anyway, your verse is interesting.. and i shall provide my answer..</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1 John 2:4 </span> :   "<sup id="en-HCSB-30728" class="versenum">3</sup> This is how we are sure <sup class="xref"></sup> that we have come to know Him: by keeping His commands.  <sup id="en-HCSB-30729" class="versenum">4</sup> The one who says, "I have come to know Him," without keeping His commands, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.  <sup id="en-HCSB-30730" class="versenum">5</sup> But whoever keeps His word, truly in him the love of God is perfected. This is how we know we are in Him:  <sup id="en-HCSB-30731" class="versenum">6</sup> the one who says he remains in Him should walk just as He walked."</p>
              <p>This verse is actually a verse that was meant to give confirmation. It is saying that, if you are in Christ, you will keep His commands...</p>
              <p>Let me use a different example in order to make it clearer..</p>
              <p>This is how we are sure that I have been born to my parents, by having the DNA of my parents.  The one who says " I am born to mr and mrs XXX " but has not the DNA of Mr and Mrs XXX is a liar, and the truth is not in him.But whoever has the DNA of Mr and Mrs XXX , truly is their son.  This is how we know we are of Mr and Mrs XXX: The one who says he is their son should have their DNA..  </p>
              <p>Do you understand now?</p>
              <p>We are able to keep His commandments because we have come to know Christ, and not the other way around..</p>
