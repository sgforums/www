              <p>The only reason why christians are so confused by the book of romans is because of the mindset. Rav Shaul (Paul) was a jew, who learned at the feet of Gamaliel, a Jew of Jews. christians try to interpret what Rav Shaul says from a greek hellenistic mindset rather than a hebraic mindset and hence all that confusion.</p>

              <p>just how is Torah an old covenant? the laws of Yahweh have not changed. Another reason why christians cannot understand Romans is becuase they disregard much of the Tenakh. I dare say that most of the Brit Chadashah is comprised of the Tenakh. How can one start reading from the middle of the story book and understand the whole story? But that is what christians do exactly.</p>

              <p>It is not abolished, ... Jesus said He did not come to abolish the Law, but to fulfill it..  A covenant is an agreement is it not?  If we have an agreement, and one of us fails to uphold it, then the one who fails needs to pay some compensation..  Likewise, man made an agreement with God. If we obey His Law, then we get blessed. If not, the curse would fall upon us..  And almost immediately, we see the golden calf..  first law already broken... so we have to pay... with our life...  But then Jesus came...  He shed His blood for our sins, and some common sense will do us good here..  once the debt has been paid, stop paying!  </p>
              <p>Now, with the new covenant, God said He will write the laws no longer on stone, but on hearts...  Men obey God no longer to deserve it, but because they are accepted, they reciprocate His love..   Thats why Paul says, We love, because He FIRST loved us.. </p>
              <p>Also, with Christ working IN us, we are able to work it OUT, and be a testimony to the world...</p>

              <p>Your answer reflects very accurately the greek/roman christian mindset. They cannot make the distinction between the Torah of Yahweh, and the Torah of the Pharisees which is leagalism. Yet the Pharisees did not get it all wrong according to Yeshua. The driving force for the legalism of the Pharisees is that they did not want to transgress Torah, but they went about it in a very kia su way so much so that they had prohibitions on prohibitions so that they would not transgress Torah.</p>
              <p>This legalistic Torah of the Pharisees is what was meant when Kefa speaks about the yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear...</p>
              <p>Seriously do you think that obeying the Torah of Yahweh will bring us into bondage?</p>
              <p>The truth sets us free.</p>
              <p>KJV John 8:31-32 <span class="GramE">Then</span> said Yeshua to those Jews which believed on him, If<br> ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; <span class="GramE">And</span> ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make<br> you free.</p>
              <p>The Torah is truth</p>
              <p>KJV Psalm 119:142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness<span class="GramE">,</span><br> and thy law is the truth.</p>

              <p>Then if you do not focus on what is right and wrong in the eyes of Yahweh, how do you know you are doing what pleases Him?? Torah only gives life when you live it according to how Yahweh says we should. In the end in order for us to know whether we have kept His word, we have to refer back to His word. That is the bench mark.</p>

              <p>Yet the
                                      Pharisees did not get it all wrong according to Yeshua. The driving
                                      force for the legalism of the Pharisees is that they did not want
                                      to transgress Torah, but they went about it in a very kia su way so
                                      much so that they had prohibitions on prohibitions so that they
                                      would not transgress Torah.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Sorry, I'm afraid that the Law of the Pharisees was actually way lower than that of the Law of Yahweh...</p>
              <p>The Law of the Pharisees was brought down to a level where they could keep it... then they condemned those who were unable to keep their standards..  But God's standard is way higher.</p>
              <p>See, if it was not , then Jesus would not have brought the law back to its high standard by saying : </p>
              <p><sup id="en-NIV-23255" class="versenum">20</sup>For I tell you that
              unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the

              <p><sup id="en-NIV-23256" class="versenum">21</sup>"You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not murder,<sup class="footnote" title='"See'>[<a title="See footnote a" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-23256a">a</a>]</sup> and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' <sup id="en-NIV-23257" class="versenum">22</sup>But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother<sup class="footnote" title='"See'>[<a title="See footnote b" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-23257b">b</a>]</sup>will be subject to judgment.

              I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital
              unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who
              marries the divorced woman commits adultery."</p>
              <p><sup id="en-NIV-23268" class="versenum">33</sup>"Again, you have heard

              <p>How can I tell the difference?  Because in this whole passage, Jesus never said:" It is written."   He said :" You have <strong>heard</strong>... or It has been <strong>said</strong>...  "   And in those days, not everyone has a torah in their house...  only the priests had access and the people would gather on the Shabbat, then the priests would teach..   So what the people were doing was the priests standard... not God's standard..</p>

              <p>Seriously do you think that obeying the Torah of Yahweh will

              </blockquote>
              <p>Yes I do. Because it is written so. Let me show you the comparisons..</p>
              <p>I state 2nd Corinthians whole of Chapter 4... Is it okay if I dont post the whole thing? kinda long.. xD </p>
              <p>But ill highlight some key areas..</p>
              <p>Old Covenant(OC) :   <strong>letter kills</strong></p>
              <p>New Covenant(NC): <strong>the Spirit gives life</strong></p>
              <p>OC:<strong> ministry that brought death</strong></p>
              <p>NC: <strong>ministry of the Spirit</strong></p>
              <p>OC: <strong>ministry that condemns men is glorious</strong></p>
              <p>NC: <strong>how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness!</strong></p>
              <p>OC: <strong>that which lasts!</strong></p>
              <p>OC:<strong> not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from gazing at it while the radiance was fading away.</strong></p>
              <p>NC: <strong><sup id="en-NIV-28842" class="versenum">16</sup>But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</strong></p>
              <p>OC: <strong>No Spirit mentioned </strong></p>
              <p>NC: <strong>7Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</strong></p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Let me show you the ENTIRE paragraph.. </p>
              <h5>Tsadhe <span style='font-size: 125%; font-family: "Lucida Grande","SBL Hebrew",David,Narkisim,"Microsoft Sans Serif","Times New Roman";' dir="rtl"><span style="font-size: 100%;">×¦</span></span></h5>
              <p>"<sup id="en-NIV-16036" class="versenum">137</sup> Righteous are you, O LORD, <br>       and your laws are right.</p>
              <p> <sup id="en-NIV-16037" class="versenum">138</sup> The statutes you have laid down are righteous; <br>       they are fully trustworthy.</p>
              <p> <sup id="en-NIV-16038" class="versenum">139</sup> My zeal wears me out, <br>       for my enemies ignore your words.</p>
              <p> <sup id="en-NIV-16039" class="versenum">140</sup> Your promises have been thoroughly tested, <br>       and your servant loves them.</p>
              <p> <sup id="en-NIV-16040" class="versenum">141</sup> Though I am lowly and despised, <br>       I do not forget your precepts.</p>
              <p> <sup id="en-NIV-16041" class="versenum">142</sup> Your righteousness is everlasting <br>       and your law is true.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>What is being said here, is that God's Law will keep to its promises. It is true to its statutes. It will not bend away, it is righteous!  <strong>BUT</strong> the Law cannot make you righteous..   It is like a mirror, reflecting all our flaws.. A mirror tells the truth. A mirror can show you where the dirt is... but it cannot make you clean..rubbing your face with the mirror wont change a thing.. </p>
              <p>Now, my friend, let me show you where the truth that sets you free comes from... </p>
              <p>John 1 :17 For the law was given through Moses; but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</p>
              <p>Now, the law was given. You can give from a distance..  But grace AND truth <strong>CAME </strong>through Jesus Christ. Notice truth is on the side of grace? Grace and truth are one!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Then if you do not focus on what is right and wrong in the eyes
                                      of Yahweh, how do you know you are doing what pleases Him?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, are we going to commit the same mistake as Adam? God said not to touch the tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil..  Let us instead go to the tree of Life!</p>
              <p>What is this tree of life?  I'll give an example. Lets say a man is trying to lose weight..  The tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil will say "Excersise more because it will make you healthy!"  or "Eat less sugar! Its not good for you!"  Good and evil..</p>
              <p>But the tree of Life will say: "Do you desire to eat donuts? if so, eat.  Do you want to excersise today? if not, rest."  </p>
              <p>This has actually worked... a Pastor has lost weight by this revelation.</p>
              <p>If a person thinks, "ooh.. so by eating donuts i'll lose weight", he is going back to tree of knowledge of good and evil, and he'll fall sick from donuts..Its not concepts or knowing what is good, what is bad, but what has revelation and life! </p>
