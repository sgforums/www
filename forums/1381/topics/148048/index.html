He is the angel of forbearance and mercy (Enoch, xl:3) who taught Enoch the mysteries of clemency and justice (lxxi:2). In the book of Jubilees (i:27 and ii:1), the angel who is said to have instructed Moses on Mount Sinai and to have delivered to him the tables of the Law is most probably Michael.<br><br>Michael in the canonical New Testament<br>In the Epistle of Jude of the New Testament in verse 9, Michael disputes with Satan over the body of Moses.

            <div class='col-md body'>Technically, there are only two Archangel, Michael and Lucifer. Archangels are the highest ranking angels. The other angel, mentioned by name in the bible, is Gabriel.

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.therussianshop.com/russhop/icons/straphlt.jpg"><br><br>The name of this archangel (Raphael (means "God has healed") does not appear in the Hebrew Scriptures, and in the Septuagint only in the Book of Tobias. Here he first appears disguised in human form as the traveling companion of the younger Tobias, calling himself "Azarias the son of the great Ananias". The story of the adventurous journey during which the protective influence of the angel is shown in many ways including the binding "in the desert of upper Egypt" of the demon who had previously slain seven husbands of Sara, daughter of Raguel, is picturesquely related in Tobit 5-11, to which the reader is referred. After the return and the healing of the blindness of the elder Tobias, Azarias makes himself known as "the angel Raphael, one of the seven, who stand before the Lord" (Tob., xii, 15. Cf. Apoc., viii, 2).<br><br></div>

Uriel can be identified with Agni, Devic Lord of the mental plane--the plane of fire. [Alice A. Bailey. Treatise on Cosmic Fire. Lucis Trust, p. 605-6].<br><br>Some accounts place the Archangel Uriel at the head of the third order or company of angels. Others identify Uriel as one of the Seven Spirits before the Throne. Kabbalistic writings assign Uriel to the middle pillar of the Tree of Life, and specifically to the sephirah Malkuth, the Kingdom.<br><br>The Archangel Uriel personifies the Divine Fire that comes down from the 3rd Aspect of Deity--Universal Mind--penetrating each plane until It reaches the physical. There, the Fire ignites the fusion in the center of the Sun, the fission at the center of the Earth, and the kundalini at the base of the spine. It creates worlds, universes, and life--which then await the quickening impulse of the 2nd Aspect to evolve and grow.<br><br>The Book of Enoch describes Uriel as "one of the holy angels, who is over the world and over Tartarus... the leader of them all." Later we read in the same book: "Uriel showed to me, whom the Lord of glory hath set for ever over all the luminaries of the heaven... the sun, moon, and stars, all the ministering creatures which make their revolution in all the chariots of the heaven."<br><br></div>
