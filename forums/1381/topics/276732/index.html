            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">I bought the latest issue of TIME magazine. Very interesting coz it gives u an insight into the faith of faithful Christians like Mother Teresa. Part in BOLD ORANGE is for Mr. Earth and other Atheist guys:</span><br><br><a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1655415,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1655415,00.html</a><br><br><span style="color: green;">Her secret letters show that she spent almost 50 years without sensing the presence of God in her life. What does her experience teach us about the value of doubt?</span><br><br>Jesus has a very special love for you. As for me, the silence and the emptiness is so great that I look and do not see, listen and do not hear.<br>Â— Mother Teresa to the Rev. Michael Van Der Peet, September 1979<br><br>On Dec. 11, 1979, Mother Teresa, the "Saint of the Gutters," went to Oslo. Dressed in her signature blue-bordered sari and shod in sandals despite below-zero temperatures, the former Agnes Bojaxhiu received that ultimate worldly accolade, the Nobel Peace Prize. In her acceptance lecture, Teresa, whose Missionaries of Charity had grown from a one-woman folly in Calcutta in 1948 into a global beacon of self-abnegating care, delivered the kind of message the world had come to expect from her. "It is not enough for us to say, 'I love God, but I do not love my neighbor,'" she said, since in dying on the Cross, God had "[made] himself the hungry one Â— the naked one Â— the homeless one." Jesus' hunger, she said, is what "you and I must find" and alleviate. She condemned abortion and bemoaned youthful drug addiction in the West. Finally, she suggested that the upcoming Christmas holiday should remind the world "that radiating joy is real" because Christ is everywhere Â— "Christ in our hearts, Christ in the poor we meet, Christ in the smile we give and in the smile that we receive."<br><br>Yet less than three months earlier, in a letter to a spiritual confidant, the Rev. Michael van der Peet, that is only now being made public, she wrote with weary familiarity of a different Christ, an absent one. "Jesus has a very special love for you," she assured Van der Peet. "[But] as for me, the silence and the emptiness is so great, that I look and do not see, Â— Listen and do not hear Â— the tongue moves [in prayer] but does not speak ... I want you to pray for me Â— that I let Him have [a] free hand." .........................<br><br>But for most people, Teresa's ranking among Catholic saints may be less important than a more general implication of Come Be My Light: that if she could carry on for a half-century without God in her head or heart, then perhaps people not quite as saintly can cope with less extreme versions of the same problem. One powerful instance of this may have occurred very early on. In 1968, British writer-turned-filmmaker Malcolm Muggeridge visited Teresa. <span style="color: orange;"><strong>Muggeridge had been an outspoken agnostic, but by the time he arrived with a film crew in Calcutta he was in full spiritual-search mode. Beyond impressing him with her work and her holiness, she wrote a letter to him in 1970 that addressed his doubts full-bore. "Your longing for God is so deep and yet He keeps Himself away from you," she wrote. "He must be forcing Himself to do so Â— because he loves you so much Â— the personal love Christ has for you is infinite Â— The Small difficulty you have re His Church is finite Â— Overcome the finite with the infinite." Muggeridge apparently did. He became an outspoken Christian apologist and converted to Catholicism in 1982. </strong></span>His 1969 film, Something Beautiful for God, supported by a 1971 book of the same title, made Teresa an international sensation.<br><br></div>

Over the years,its always been the "underdog" saints that impress me the most. Great successes don't impress me. The Pope doesn't impress me. John Calvin doesn't impress me. But guys like Peter, Paul, St Augustine, worthless pieces of junk that God gracefully used. These are the guys that inspire me the most. I guess I'll be adding Mother Teresa to that list...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, i have a question...<br><br>why didn't God reveal himself to someone like Mother Teresa?<br><br>It was written in Deuteronomy 4:29 - "But if from there you seek the Lord your God, you will find him if you look for him with all your heart and with all your soul."<br><br>But she had waited over 50yrs for God to speak to her, and found only silence. I believe it is true that God's love for mankind had been manifested through her, and no one will say that she was not a faithful servant.<br><br>So my question is why did God choose to remain silent towards her when it is written plainly that one <strong>will</strong> him if one looks for him with the right attitude and with enough faith?</div>

At best, we can only speculate....<br><br>It does, however, echoes the sentiment from some of us that at some point in our lives, we cannot feel God or perhaps we have lost our directions, at which point, some of us will echo the same words....<br><br>At the crucial point of Christ's work, isn't He the one who uttered "Father, Father, why have Your forsaken me?"<br><br>Therefore, to reiterate, I don't think anyone can give an answer to your question. Nonetheless what can be concluded are:<br><br>1. Crisis of faith can happen to the greatest of saints.<br>2. The work of God continues, inspite of this crisis.<br><br>Also, isn't it true that throughout scripture, the many patriachs, prophets and leaders, too suffered the crisis of faith? Can we ask for anything less?<br><br></div>
