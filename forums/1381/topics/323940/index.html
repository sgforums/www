              <p>Faith in unseen? For the majority of people or believers. But I've seen the glorified Jesus. Tried to see His face but in the end I got burning sensation in both my eyeballs in the process. But it was a long time ago when I was in my 7th grade. Now I'm 28 years old.</p>
              <p>I'm not the only one too. But probably one stupid enough to risk mocking from people like you because I cannot prove it to you. But a witness doesn't need to prove that he is a witness as far as I know. So I'm a witness of the living Jesus.</p>
              <p>But here I wrote what I saw</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Alright I'll yell you...</p>
              <p>I was in my 7th grade at the time and life wasn't being particularly easy on
                          me(hey 7th grader also has their own problems).</p>
              <p>So at one night I was laying on my bed and pondering that my life was pretty
                          painful for me. I started to cry but being a boy who thought that no boy
                          should ever cry I covered my face with my pillow. Then while crying I started
                          to imagine that I was hugging Jesus just to make me feel better. Suddenly I
                          came to think that only Jesus was worth defending as he was really a man of no
                          sin. After that thought came to me I started to feel love for Jesus. Small at
                          first but it grew rapidly so that in a mere seconds I felt a total love for
                          Jesus so much so that I would give anything really anything at all  for Jesus
                          even if Jesus asked me to walk through hell and came back. It was really a pure
                          love that I never felt before. I've been in love but this was different. While
                          I was full of love for Jesus suddenly a powerful thought came over me that I
                          earned a right to ask something from God. And because I knew that every picture
                          of Jesus was just fictional picture I would like to be allowed to see Jesus
                          true face. So that was what I asked: to be allowed to see Jesus face. At the
                          instant I asked that in my heart, while my face still being covered with my
                          pillow I 'saw' very clearly a person covered in immense white light which I
                          took to be Jesus and still believe so. I tried to get a glimpse of His face but
                          was confronted with such an immense white light coming from the direction of
                          His face that I failed twice(I tried more than once) in my attempt to penetrate
                          the light. And because I failed to penetrate the light I began to think to
                          myself: Hey never mind not being able to see His face, now that I've seen Him I would
                          be able to tell everybody I've seen Him(God). Then I tried for the last time to
                          get a glimpse of His face. This last attempt made both my eyeballs physically hurt
                          like being pierced by a thousand small needles. It was a burning sensation
                          which hurt both my eyeballs. So I knew I couldn't push it and I gave up trying
                          to see this person face and set my eyes low 'on the ground'. Not long after
                          that the vision started to grew weak and weaker until it disappeared
                          completely.</p>
              <p>btw the white light that was coming from the face was much brighter than that our sun at mid-day. Never seen such a powerful light before and after in my life.</p>

              <p>Thanks David.</p>
              <p>I've been experiencing God in my life as well. God is my companion to some extent.</p>
              <p>God is actively involved in my life too especially in the last few years. Though I cannot say that every one of my prayer is granted instantly. .</p>
              <p>Jedi like power. Anyone? LOL. Well to some extent.</p>
              <p>Where is that lightsaber of mine.....otherwise I would have to start making a new one from bamboo. But it would be pretty kinky.</p>

              hey domonkassyu,
              
              i dunno if u r aware tat christians r divided into 2 camps when it comes to salvation...while both camps agree tat salvation is thru the grace of God alone n nt by the works of man...the division is regarding the issue of predestination n freewill of man. miracles&amp;prophecies is probably a believer of predestination from the way he shares in his posts...
              
              while i do nt wish to debate which camp is rite(theologians have debated abt tis for centuries but stil cun come to an agreement), i wonder if u actually noe tat the reason for miracles&amp;prophecies last sentence was on the basis of predestination...tat man plays no part in his own salvation n tat those who r saved r elected by God Himself, nt by man's freewill...

              <p>Aside from that I believe that no one is worthy to be given eternal life for the works done only a shortwhile on earth. The gift of eternal life is beyond human effort. That's why it's called a gift. No one can work his way up to heaven. But this doesn't mean that deeds are not counted at all. Because faith is required to enter salvation. And that faith must be backed by deeds because sooner or later a man who proffessed that he puts his faith in Jesus must choose to act whether he really believes in Jesus. Otherwise that faith is a fake one and the man is actually living in denial in that he doesn't believe in Jesus because his actions say so.</p>
              <p>As for predestination. I do not call it predestination. I believe that God knows everything. In fact God knows the very end even before he started to create this universe. God knows each of us before we were born. God knows how we are going to live our lives even before we were born/before we exist. God knows how we are going to die before we are born. In short God knows everything.</p>
              <p>I want to give testimony,</p>
              <p>I've had my future told in great detail by a Catholic priest in a monastery in 1997(during high school retreat). The prophecy took 5 years to come to pass. In the prophecy my thoughts and feelings in the future were known, people who I was going to meet are known, dream that I was going to have are known, even the future president of my country were told and came to pass  and of course the story plot that was going to unfold was known in great detail. It's actually very very scary to know that whatever moves we are going to take God already knows them.</p>

              <p>No I'm actually rather insane LOL. That's a more logical explanation Asked God? and God did answer? Come on.......</p>
              <p>You must have been watching too many horror movie Zwei. They are just that movies. If you take even movies who claim to be inspired by true events as the real deal you will have a very distorted view on life.</p>
              <p>I've realized not to take any movie as historical or accurate since I've watched couple of historical based hollywood and hong-kong made movies and happen to have read the real historical accounts of the period. They are for your entertainment! only that. Inspired by the movie? it's okay. Believe it as an accurate representation of what really happened? No way.</p>
