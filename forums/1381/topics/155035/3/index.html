IT DOESNT REPRESENT ALL CHRISTIANS BCOS EACH HAVE DIFF VIEWS OF EVANGELISM. &amp; views can change over time &amp; mine did after many rebukes from God. I have tried very hard ground w atheistic, intelligent, articulate frens &amp; cousins. One can never win them on logic alone bcos they always smarter than me. U come up w one argument they come up with better argument or so it seems. U talk abt creationism they tear it down &amp; talk abt evolution. U try to explain scientific principles based on the bible, they say bible is man made &amp; unscientific. So much argument &amp; finally heated shouts &amp; debates. Luckily we try to keep it non personal &amp; not beat each other up bcos still ok frens &amp; cousins. So Christians can be considered very stubborn, dogmatic, narrow minded, holy moly, terroristic, doomsday prophets at least in my case. All sorts of abuse hurled at me. Frens from other religion not better also. U talk your religion they talk theirs, like competition for converts. Now it's even more dangerous bcos they can accuse me of religious intolerance or worse sedition &amp; plotting to overthrow S'pore govt by terrorism or force or subversion etc. I have been compared to a terrorist u know. I think i was a bit extreme last time so tone down a lot. Then come frens who only talk money. Talk religion &amp; they will switch to business like MLM etc &amp; ask whether i m interested to join w/c i did lah but didn't do. I think better leave everything in God's hands &amp; just live everyday like there's no future day. I think dont talk abt it anymore &amp; dont insist cos no use. Closed means closed lah. But i have my own successes &amp; it's all by the Holy Spirit bcos didnt do much talking.</div>

The details r "horrific" to anybody sane, that's why i appear insane.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Left Christ for very long time. That's why appear heretical. Can be considered unconventional bcos of my experience. Almost wanted to be a priest or monk if there r still monasteries ard now. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> If i were catholic, might consider being a priest but i heard very tough w 6 yrs of hard training &amp; many drop out. Anyway, dont agree w catholic doctrines so cannot. I wasn't really shouting in my posts. Just to emphasize what i was really saying. I never went bible college &amp; never went for many conferences altho read some bks. Many things still dont know. Only just beginning to understand the bible. Now no longer logos anymore but slowly rhema. But, u or others might not see what i c bcos of our unique exps. I am sorry for embarassing everyone else w my nonsense but it's not personal. Just putting in what i think. Maybe wrong &amp; of course can change lah. Even pastors dont agree sometimes. Even denominations dont agree sometimes w/c is very sad to me. Yes, one more thing-to my exp, non christians dont just look at theology or doctrines per se. They also look at what we do rather than what we say. But some can be confused like what u said abt preaching vs sharing. Anyway, i might go for deliverance. God bless u.</div>
