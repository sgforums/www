I believe that the time is nearer. The thing happening today seems to match what is decribed in the bible. We are much closer to the hour of trial than before. But I don't think it is that immediate yet. Afterall, we still have to watch and watch. What if we said it is very near then people question it has passed so many years yet nothing happen. Then people starts to lose faith. I think we should not come to any conclusion yet. Furthermore, there are still many people not heard of the Gospel yet. I have been thinking if it is possible to reach out to everybody who has not heard of the Gospel within 20 years to 30 years. The bible tells us that all must hear the Gospel first before the end will come. This leads me to think if this will carry over to the tribulation period. Whatever it is, I believe we are closer ...</div>

He will baptise us with fire &amp; with water.<br><br>Do u know John was under so much pressure from the world esp the pharisees &amp; sadducees? &amp; was beheaded by Herod? Why was he crying in the wilderness by himself only &amp; nobody except God to back him up? Bcos it was wilderness like desert! Very dry &amp; parched with nobody daring to speak up bcos of the govt then. Ppl dying everywhere &amp; being oppressed &amp; here we have ppl bashing Christians when they should be helping the poor &amp; homeless &amp; orphans &amp; widows. Yes, &amp; the homosexuals, prostitutes, gamblers, tax collectors &amp; all sorts of sinners like drug addicts, molesters, murderers, rapists, etc etc. I wonder how many here r like that. Does one reject these ppl bcos they r bl**dy sinners or what?<br><br>The warning is not to scare ppl altho we r all scared. I also said encouragement to those walking right with God no matter how much ridicule or suffering we r going thru. Christians r not holy people per se. Bcos if we r, we don't need Christ Jesus to forgive us in the first place. Only sinners need forgiveness.<br><br>JUST ONE MORE POINT: I AM NOT GOD SO I CANNOT JUDGE YOU. EACH ONE OF US HAS TO ANSWER TO GOD FOR OURSELVES. NO POINT CONDEMNING OTHERS FOR THEIR SINS. OTHERS CAN ALSO CONDEMN YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID TO THEM. YOU JUST DONT KNOW WHAT THEY SPEAK OF YOU BEHIND YOUR BACK, THAT'S ALL. CAN ANY OF US STAND BEFORE GOD &amp; SAY THE DEVIL OR MY FATHER/MOTHER OR FRIEND OR GOVT ETC MADE ME DO IT?
