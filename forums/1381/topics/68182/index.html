Hope to share...<br><br><strong>St Peter's Is The Main Catholic Church In Rome, And The World</strong><br><br>It is certainly the most famous and most publicised, but it is not the main one. That honour goes to the relatively unheard of St Giovanni in Laterano (St John Lateran) which is officially the Cathedral of Rome and Metropolitan Church of its Bishops. The building also bears the inscription ' Mother And Head Of All Churches In The City And The World'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's another msiconception. This book I referred to for stuff is actually written by Graeme Donald of Unwin Paperbacks....not by Edward Phillips......ahh thats how usual misconceptions started.<br><br><strong>Adam And Eve And The Garden Of Eden</strong><br><br>Presuming that you accept the Bible's version of the so-called Creation, there are several misconceptions attached to these two characters which have been perpetuated down the ages by artists and clergy alike.<br><br>First, lets look at the 'apple'. Genesis 3 simply refers to 'the fruit' and never gets more specific. That it was an apple is less than likely since Mesopotamia, where the Garden of Eden is traditionally held to have been, is far too hot for apple cultivation. The apricot is a good contender but the most likely culprit as the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge is the fig, since it is only after having a nibble that Adam and Eve start rowing and sporting fig leaves to bury their differences. It was Aquila of Pontus who first started talking about apples when he translated the Song of Solomon from Hebrew into Greek. His choice of fruit was dictated by the fact that in his culture the apple symbolised desire and even lust. No one, and that includes St Jerome who translated the Old Testament into Latin, ever checked up, and the myth lived happily ever after.<br><br>Finally, there is the belief that God gave Adam and Eve their marching orders out of anger at their having disobeyed his intructions to leave the Tree of Knowledge strictly alone. Actually he drove them out 'lest he put forth his hand, and take also the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever.' So it was divine concern at the prospect of man achieveing immortality that prompted the eviction.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>IHS</strong><br><br>It is wholly incorrect to print the above as I.H.S, that being the customary form which gives credence to teh myth that the letter represent Iesus Hominum Salvator, (Jesus, Saviour of Men) or In Hac Salus, (Safety in this [the cross]) or In Hoc Signo (In this sign[you will conquer]). IHS is nothing more than abbreviated form of Greek equivalent of the names Jesus, which is lesous, IHS being but the first two and last letters. It is obvious that there is a double misconceptions here; the 'H" is not an "H" at all but the long Greek "E" which just happen to be represented by the symbol "H". This was mistaken by those people familiar with the Latin culture, but ignorant of the Greeks, as being the letter 'H" as in "Harry". Because of this, IES might be better, but either way, I.H.S. makes no more sense than does putting J.I.M. instead of 'James'.</div>
