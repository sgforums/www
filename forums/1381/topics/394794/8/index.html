              <p>First of all, with God race is not an issue and does not matter.</p>
              <p>Secondly, there is basis that you say about some people joining churches just because it seems 'cool', or to "see girls" and many other insincere reasons. It is sad but true, and wrong. It is however not applicable to all church-goers or all people who call themselves Christian or Catholics.</p>
              <p>Bear in mind also, Christians and Churches also have their own rituals to perform. There are Christians also who have different roles and responsibilities within the church. This extends to things like organising events outside of the church grounds but are still church activities. The extent of these rituals and responsiblities vary not just for the individual but even among different churches or different denominations.</p>
              <p>It is seen by some as an "angmoh" religion but it really actually is not. Besides like I have mentioned before, Christianity is about more than just race. Likewise Buddhism and Hinduism and even Islam is also practiced by people all over the world, although to different degrees.</p>
