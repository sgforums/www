              <p><br> you have the misconceptions that retributions (karma, cause and
                  effects) will only happen in the next life time. in fact, many
                  happen within the same life time. jack neo is one good example.
                  many more if you were to observe people around you. in office,

              <p>Not against you personally but the statement.</p>
              <p>It's common that when shit hits the fan, those with religious belief quickly steps in and say it's retribution but when it didn't, they will say retribution will happens in next life or some other time and those karma thingy will starts to come in.</p>
              <p>It's all planned out by our all mighty god. Pretty convenient, isn't it?</p>

              <p>I don't see the link between the murder victim and mother mary. You only pity because you don't believe in afterlife. It's no big deal to not have sex with your wife if god told you he is coming to earth. </p>
              <p>You do not know it exists. You can't prove both ways if it exists or it doesn't but if there isn't afterlife all the priests would go "WTF I wasted all my life preaching for nothing."</p>
              <p>Its a huge gamble if you believe too deep but since you can't prove anything why not gamble small stakes and be an annual christian like me.</p>

              <p>well, guess what ? according to historians, men that lived in
              Jesus's time and place DON"T wear their hair

              You only pity because you don't believe in afterlife. It's no big
              deal to not have sex with your wife if god told you he is coming to
              earth. </p>
              <p>You do not know it exists. You can't prove both ways if it
              exists or it doesn't but if there isn't afterlife all the priests
              would go "WTF I wasted all my life preaching for nothing."</p>
              <p>Its a huge gamble if you believe too deep but since you can't

              <p>You can go to your x-rated paradise. Yes, you have to explode
              your body before you can receive your reward - one virgin?No no.
              Four virgins? No No. More than 4 dozen of them, boys or girls!</p>
              <p>Christian heaven is so different (from your x-rated paradise)
              that you can't fit in there.</p>
