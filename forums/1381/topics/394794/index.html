              <p>Chistianity only became westernised when Jesus' disciples brought it to Rome.</p>
              <p>Christianity was also given more prominence during the Reformation period.</p>
              <p>Thats how it became an "ang moh" religion.</p>
              <p>However, you don't find many young people becoming Catholics. They joined the other Chriantian religion.</p>

              <p>I know one of the reason they gave when asking you to join them is, You can make more friends! (I was approached by them few years back)</p>
              <p>I think most of the young people don't really understands the point of the religion. If they 'recruit' people by giving this reason, i guess it kinda lost 
              its meaning.</p>

              <p>i believe in the teachings of moral values in christianity. but not evangelism. the lack of tolerance for other beliefs goes against the very basic teachings of tolerance.</p>

              <p>Cannot say like that lah. Coz, since when Taoist (Not so for Buddhist, maybe?) can see good marriages one (Or even meet your gf, no need first, any term also can)?</p>
              <p>No right? Even yes, later also kena divorce one, almost can be sure, almost especially  sure to those vegetarians due to these religions. (And almost sure that for people who say no and boos on me regarding this, is because they are not married or even have a relationship once in their entire lifetime, no ---- secretly in love or one sided love / puppy love does not count). Ok, you can hate me for that, but this is what I see with almost no exception. Sure, you can claim that chrisitans also got extra marital scandal (More famous one like JN, etc) and neither is that a complete family either, but the first thing is if you join Taoism especially, you are not given a damn chance!</p>
              <p>Since when you see people being successful and say "I am taoist / buddhist?" -- Hell no right? What about Christians? Yes. As same as the completeness of family.</p>
              <p>Since when you see people became crazy when become a christian? Not really right? I am pretty sure you see some youths ended up jump down from 9 storey flat in Bedok Resevoir (And die) right? What was the cause? Believing in Taoism or rather, Taoist who believe that after their death can become excorist. Crap! They should have watched D-Grey Man (Even though I am no anime fan)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What is the reason for not able to be rich, hippy or whatever (No boy/girl friend lah)....?<br>In one of the "hippy" Chrisitan area in Suntec level 3, although I cant remember the full thing, but to summarize it is basically it means that God believes that you (one) is not yet up to it /cannot handle it. He does not wish you to become a sucker (Like a vampire drama series, cant remember the name) to leech out of your date. He will give it to you when you are really ready such that it is the best for you.</p>
              <p>What about Taoist / Buddhist? Taoist I am not very sure, but Buddhist says Karma (Was it the right term?). In short, of my limited knowledge, it appears that that has to do with my past life or whatever? Hell who knows if such exist and even if so (Against Chrisitian belief), it is quite unfair because now things should now settle, dont later come and claim. (Like refund good policy also got like 2 weeks, 15 days or 30 days one right? How can one say o, u last 20 years bought a TV and now spoilt, ask for refund?!)</p>
              <p>In summary, in seems like the Christianity's explanation can "heal" those lost people without hurting their pride much. It gives them a power to go up and requesting the need more so that god (He) will give it at a suitable time. Whether is it true or not, I have never seen it, I just think that personally, I am atheist, who ban religion, but among those religion, I still can accept more on christian, not because of Ang Mo one but because the way they phrase it looked more suitable and appealing in the perspective of psychology, even if they have missed out certain fundamental facts.
