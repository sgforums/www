              <p>For this, there are successful people ended up failure because of their wrong doings, you reap what you seow as a saying, similar to Karma which is logical in the case of people caught by police and charged by the court for real criminal offenses (Instead of political supress in anywhere world) or people like Tigers and Jack. This can be quite subjective and people view it differently. To me, I see it as people who fight for their request and suffered for almost 30 years or slightly more but had finally reached the goals they want is a success, while people who have fight for about 22 years but still under oppression and no sign of real changes and progress despite both getting sympathy from else where in the world is still a failure because their objective had not met and how long could a person live? Lol, this can be subjective and political and possibly not so much on religion because that also depends on who the opressor is and full history context which is OT but, my point is, success to me = my objective had reached and failure = my objective had not met or need some amendments to it (Still better than nil afterall)</p>

              <p> <span style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 15px; color: #333333;">This is one of the lamest threads I’ve ever seen. After reading through some threads in this forum I’ve learnt that this is the worst place anyone who wants to find a religious path should come.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 15px; color: #333333;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I am a catholic so I could help answer one of your questions. Catholics do not worship Mother Mary we venerate, or honor her. The reason why we honor her is because we believe she was entrusted to deliver god(human form).</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">You should learn to respect other religions. Even though I’m an annual Christian and only go to church once a year after being confirmed as a catholic. I learnt not to cross reference religions to spread the word of god.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">On a sidenote, I think religion is parental influenced in most situations. I heard from a Malay friend of mine that his parents will disown him if he quit being a muslim. If you have freedom over religion use this privilege to find one for yourself and not<span> </span>insult other religions with common misconceptions. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Edit: and catholics do not have to give 10% of their salary to church they can give any amount they want to the collection that is held in an anonymous way during mass, the church wardens go around with a collection bag held by a pole. You can choose to put any amount of money you desire into it. 1 billion catholics giving 10% of their salary would be unrealistic.  </p>

              <p>I think the biggest smear campaign against Catholics do not come from non christians but rather from Protestants</p>
