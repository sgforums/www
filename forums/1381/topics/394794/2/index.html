              <p>young people join Church becoz it's seen as the coolest FALSE

              <p>1) will they go to temple and join the aunties and uncles to
              burn joss-sticks ? HELL NO..............</p>
              <p>2) will they have the discipline to kneel and chant ? FARKING

              <p>will young people want to be christians if they have to do the
              above 3 things ?.............HECK NO...........they'll not want to
              be caught dead holding joss-sticks............though i'm sure the

              <p> </p>
              <p>the truth is Christianity is the ''easiest''

              ...........it is considered a Western or ''ANGMOH''
              religion..................</p>
              <p>if the fabricated Jesus character is a BLACKIE from say
              Bangladesh..............or Nigeria, you think young people still
              wanna join this religion..............NO FARKING
              WAY...............</p>
              <p>well, guess what ? according to historians, men that lived in
              Jesus's time and place DON"T wear their hair
              long.............they're certainly not fair-skinned and absolutely
              not blonde with blue eyes..........</p>

              <p>Since when you see people being successful and say "I am taoist
                  / buddhist?" -- Hell no right? What about Christians? Yes. As same
                  as the completeness of family.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I'm pretty sure Jesus didn't teach the Christians to shout out to the world "I'm a Christian" when they become successful.</span></p>
              <p>Since when you see people became crazy when become a christian?
                  Not really right? I am pretty sure you see some youths ended up
                  jump down from 9 storey flat in Bedok Resevoir (And die) right?
                  What was the cause? Believing in Taoism or rather, Taoist who
                  believe that after their death can become excorist. Crap! They
                  should have watched D-Grey Man (Even though I am no anime fan)</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Where is your source? Or is this an assumption? So you claiming that IMH is Christian-free?</span></p>
              <p>What about Taoist / Buddhist? Taoist I am not very sure, but
                  Buddhist says Karma (Was it the right term?). In short, of my
                  limited knowledge, it appears that that has to do with my past life
                  or whatever? Hell who knows if such exist and even if so (Against
                  Chrisitian belief), it is quite unfair because now things should
                  now settle, dont later come and claim. (Like refund good policy
                  also got like 2 weeks, 15 days or 30 days one right? How can one
                  say o, u last 20 years bought a TV and now spoilt, ask for
                  refund?!)</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Karma doesn't necessarily involve past life, it's like the concept of do to others what you would want others to do to you which can be found in Abrahamic religions too.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">And being Atheist as you claim to be one doesn't justify being ignorant, I'm not religious but when I lack the knowledge of a certain religion, I do research.</span></p>

              <p>seems that people go church for personal selfish gains.................to gain wealth, pleasure, etc etc............</p>
              <p>if Jesus said that there's no wealth or sensual pleasures to be gained, i wonder if the pope would be the 1st to leave...............LOL</p>
              <p>like i've always said, there are religions that are based on reward and those on fear...............whether it makes sense or not, people instinctively will know even if they refuse to accept it..............</p>

              <p>people simply cannot accept that there's no eternal after-life
                                      because they'll feel their present lives have no meaning ! they refuse to accept that their existence on earth for that several decades has no significance...............</p>
              <p>ultimately, there's also the fear of death............so they choose to think that after their death, they can have an after-life somewhere far far better than their previous life.............</p>
              <p>for whatever religions, they never pause to think why should their Gods look like humans.............why they act like humans..............and have human traits like anger, jealousy, favouritism..................</p>

              <p><br>you have the misconceptions that retributions (karma, cause and effects) will only happen in the next life time. in fact, many happen within the same life time. jack neo is one good example. many more if you were to observe people around you. in office, relatives, friends or even strangers from the newspaper.</p>
              <p>don't be too happy if your wish to become successful and rich  is granted by heavenly gods and goddess. if one does not deserve it (no good karma), there is a trade off and the worst trade off is your life span. thus, to paly safe, do good deeds sincerely. don't believe, start observing now.</p>
              <p>reasons for stopping me in believing in christianity, mainly are as follows :</p>
              <p>1) god is not so cruel to create animals who bleed and feel like humans for consumptions for he is a loving god.</p>
              <p>2) many questions unanswered that lead to creations.</p>

              <p>Cannot say like that lah. Coz, since when Taoist (Not so for Buddhist, maybe?) can see good marriages one (Or even meet your gf, no need first, any term also can)?</p>
              <p>No right? Even yes, later also kena divorce one, almost can be sure, almost especially  sure to those vegetarians due to these religions. (And almost sure that for people who say no and boos on me regarding this, is because they are not married or even have a relationship once in their entire lifetime, no ---- secretly in love or one sided love / puppy love does not count). Ok, you can hate me for that, but this is what I see with almost no exception. Sure, you can claim that chrisitans also got extra marital scandal (More famous one like JN, etc) and neither is that a complete family either, but the first thing is if you join Taoism especially, you are not given a damn chance!</p>
              <p>Since when you see people being successful and say "I am taoist / buddhist?" -- Hell no right? What about Christians? Yes. As same as the completeness of family.</p>
              <p>Since when you see people became crazy when become a christian? Not really right? I am pretty sure you see some youths ended up jump down from 9 storey flat in Bedok Resevoir (And die) right? What was the cause? Believing in Taoism or rather, Taoist who believe that after their death can become excorist. Crap! They should have watched D-Grey Man (Even though I am no anime fan)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What is the reason for not able to be rich, hippy or whatever (No boy/girl friend lah)....?<br>In one of the "hippy" Chrisitan area in Suntec level 3, although I cant remember the full thing, but to summarize it is basically it means that God believes that you (one) is not yet up to it /cannot handle it. He does not wish you to become a sucker (Like a vampire drama series, cant remember the name) to leech out of your date. He will give it to you when you are really ready such that it is the best for you.</p>
              <p>What about Taoist / Buddhist? Taoist I am not very sure, but Buddhist says Karma (Was it the right term?). In short, of my limited knowledge, it appears that that has to do with my past life or whatever? Hell who knows if such exist and even if so (Against Chrisitian belief), it is quite unfair because now things should now settle, dont later come and claim. (Like refund good policy also got like 2 weeks, 15 days or 30 days one right? How can one say o, u last 20 years bought a TV and now spoilt, ask for refund?!)</p>
              <p>In summary, in seems like the Christianity's explanation can "heal" those lost people without hurting their pride much. It gives them a power to go up and requesting the need more so that god (He) will give it at a suitable time. Whether is it true or not, I have never seen it, I just think that personally, I am atheist, who ban religion, but among those religion, I still can accept more on christian, not because of Ang Mo one but because the way they phrase it looked more suitable and appealing in the perspective of psychology, even if they have missed out certain fundamental facts. (Such as how does human created after Adam &amp; Eve because the records got some error or not complete enough lol!)</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>just curious. what is the explanation that you consider logical for people who were born poor (in poor family or poor countries).</p>
              <p>europeans, americans and british are mainly christians but their divorce rate is very high. thus, your observation that completeness of family for christians is not correct.</p>

              <p>This one I agree on Taoism / Buddhism issue. But, Terrorism also about spreading their extremism ideology due to their grivenance and mainly using suicide squads in the name of holy war. Did you see they mainly use elections to be on power? Most of them no, except notable exception in Middle East, Palestine. The rest apart of the 2 extremes is a rebel military force either.</p>

              <p>No, neither. Afterall the story of Adam and Eve in the first place dont make sense to me either. (Some people condemn a pastor for condeming LGBT people, which the rebuttal was how was the humans continued after the 2 sons of Adam and Eve, unless incest because that will turn into LGBT (Anyway, humans are not to be reproduced in LGBT way either), which from start, I already stated there is a major flaw there OR certain records inaccuracies / incomplete.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I try not to OT, but from start my point is that why would youngsters join Christian as topic, is because of "higher failure of life rates" and also the way of explanation is something more like the youngsters wana to listen instead of bashing non-Chrisitians religion in the name of Atheist. (PS: Like the below forumer, who said he from young follwed his / her Taoist parents etc, but for my case, was initally a Taoist mum who converted to Buddhist at a later time --- Primary 5 or 6 where now I am in Poly 2. This had never accepted by me either, but personally, I still hate Taoist more than Buddhism because the latteral do make sense to me somehow while the former almost no. In the name of fairness, and be "secular" so as to avoid conflicts, I put myself a name of Atheist either)</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes, I agree. Young people want to listen to good things rather than the bad as I'm a young adult myself I would rather listen to one preaching about the love of God than one preaching about God's jealousy, wrath and violence. But yet the preaching of half the story just bothers me. But I understand what you're saying.<br></span></p>
