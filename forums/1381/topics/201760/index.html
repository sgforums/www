            <div class='col-md body'>In response to Socialoutcast's post... lets try this... the gospel is not christian, but the gospel is jewish... unless you leave the christian ways which are not connected to the bible, you will still be wandering the desert. Seriously. All the twelve apostles were Jewish and they knew the Torah, and they had power because they knew the word. Unless one leaves the land that you know, you cannot inherit the new land that Yahweh is preparing for us.<br><br>Yahweh has given us a new way to worship. We cannot apply the old ways of idol worship to the way we worship Yahweh... which is exactly what is happening in the christian mindset.<br><br>The gospel that is life is not christian, the chirstian faith is more connected to death than it is to life. The gospel is israeli. Glory to Yahweh that the gospel is not christian.<br><br>I am not saying to get rid of the bible or the gospels, or the new birth, or the holy spirit, or salvation by faith in Yeshua, but we have to get rid of the christian mindset. We have to delve into the bible and go back to the roots, and compare this to what the "church" is about today keeping in mind that for the first century or so, there was no new testament and all the new believers had was the old testament.<br><br>Go and dismantle the old mindset and start afresh. Don't worry that it might explode, but Yahweh can heal... and at least the old mindset does not harm anyone else anymore... the christian mindset is a deathtrap. It has killed more people than it has brought alive, I am not talking about the gospel, I am talking about christianity, let us make clear this distinction. Even Shaul was not preaching christianity, he was preaching the word and the signs and wonders followed him... Shaul was preaching relationship with Yahweh, and not a religious system which is what christianity is.<br><br>Get the word of Yahweh into you, and not "christian" theology. It is not through christianity, but through the Jewish Messiah of Yeshua Hamashiach that we get saved.<br><br>Yahweh will take you to a land that He will show you. You don't know that land yet, but unless you leave the old, you cannot know the new. Leave christianity and come back to the word. None of the religious systems can work. Yeshua is the word of Yahweh made flesh, come back to the word and leave the old lands.<br><br>Many times we are afraid to leave our land or to leave the old because we are afraid of losing something. But unless we leave the old, we will stay small. Yahweh wants to bless us but we have to know the truth and so it shall set us free, free to walk our new land and our greater blessings. Do we dare to leave the old land so that Yahweh can show us His land?<br><br></div>
