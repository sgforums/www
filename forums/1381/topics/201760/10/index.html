            <div class='col-md body'><br>can i quote Scofield:<br><br>"The Word of God declares plainly that the Christian believer is not "under the law." The New Testament declares this important truth four times: (1) Romans 6:14; (2) Romans 6:15; (3) Galatians 5:18; (4) 1 Corinthians 9:20"<br><br>Can I quote Alva MacLain:<br><br>The preposition "under" (hupo) means "subject to the power of any person or thing, to be under the power of something, to be under the rule or sovereignty of something." An excellent illustration may be found in Matthew 8:9 where the Roman centurion says, "For I am a man under (hupo) authority, having soldiers under (hupo) me." Just as the centurion was absolutely under Roman military authority, both as to its laws and its penalties, so also were his soldiers under his authority. To be under the law in the Biblical sense is to be under the law of GodÂ– the entire Mosaic legal system in its indivisible totalityÂ– subject to its commands and liable to its penalties. [Footnote #14--See LAW AND GRACE by Alva McClain, pp. 41-43.]<br><br>Can I quote George Zeller:<br><br>In Romans 6:14 Paul declares that the believer is not "under the law but under grace." What did Paul mean by this? Was he saying that we are not under the law with respect to justification (the believerÂ’s right standing before God in Christ) or was he saying that we are not under the law with respect to sanctification (the believerÂ’s progress in holiness)? Paul earlier in Romans made it clear that a person is not JUSTIFIED by the works of the law (Romans 3:20; 3:2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. In Romans chapter 6 the subject is that of sanctification or holiness (see Romans 6:19,22), not justification (the subject of justification was dealt with previously in chapters 3-5). It is clear from Romans 6:14 that Paul is talking about being free from sinÂ’s dominion and power and authority, which is what sanctification is all about. We conclude then that Paul in Romans 6:14-15 set forth the great truth that the believer is not under the law as a rule of life and as a means of sanctification. The key to living the Christian life is not Mount Sinai, it is Mount Calvary. The emphasis of Romans 6 is upon Mount Calvary (and the believerÂ’s relationship to Mount Calvary in light of our identification with Christ and our position in Christ). To go back to Mount Sinai is to go back to bondage.<br><br></div>

I have not come to destroy but to fulfill. for truly i say to you, till the heaven and the earth pass away, not one jot or one tittle shall in any way pass the law UNITL ALL IS FULFILLED.
