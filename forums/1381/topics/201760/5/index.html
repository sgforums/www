I am merely pointing out that it is not. It cost Yahweh something, but it did not cost us anything. It is still not free for us. You have to accept Yeshua to have this life saving grace, if you do not believe then do you have that Grace?NO WAY!

I always think tht a problem occurs when a person goes through different phases of his life and speaking to some of my friends, they too agree that the messages that Pastors preach do vary (i know a person from my church formerly from NCC felt really strongly on this) and even contradict their earlier teachings when certain verses gives them certain insights. but how can truth contradict truth since it's all inspired by the Holy Spirit? this is not an attack on Protestants per say, but rather, what happens if one day while searching for the deeper truths (liek u said) you find that the earlier insights weren't actually correct? r u following my train of thoughts? but yah... it was juz something that i thought of.<br><br>cheers</div>
