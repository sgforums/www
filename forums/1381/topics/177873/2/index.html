After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of God.

Failure to understand this will result in cofusion as to comprehending the Bible.<br><br>For example:<br><br>Why has God prohited the Israelites here in eating certain kinds of meat while in Genesis 1:29 we are told that they are to be vegeterian only. No meat at all.<br><br>Ge 1:29  "And God said, "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food."</strong></span><br><br>And then again in Genesis 9:1-7 we are again told that they can now eat meat:<br><br>Ge 9:1  "So God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them: "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.<br><br>2 "And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be on every beast of the earth, on every bird of the air, on all that move on the earth, and on all the fish of the sea. They are given into your hand.<br><br>3 "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. I have given you all things, even as the green herbs.</strong></span><br><br>4 "But you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood.<br><br>And then again in the Christian dispensation we are told:<br><br>1Ti 4:4 <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be refused if it is received with thanksgiving;</strong></span><br><br>This does not mean that God is fickle and unstable in His ways. It means, however, that there is a divine program for the ages. Though this is a very lengthy topic to tackle. Let it be enough though that we are now living under the Church Age. And it's precepts towards food is that one there in Timothy.<br><br>Like the command to build an ark was commanded to Noah only we are not under these regulations about food and etc.<br><br>Heb 9:9 It was symbolic for the present time in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make him who performed the service perfect in regard to the conscience--<br><br>10 <strong>concerned only with foods </strong>and drinks, various washings, and fleshly ordinances imposed <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>until</strong></span> the time of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>reformation.</strong></span><br><br>With regards to offerings:<br><br>we are not under the sacrificial offerings. WE no longer sacrifice goats and lambs to a priest in this dispensation. Interestingly however, in the dispensation of the coming  Mellinium, the sacrifices will be observed and practiced again as prophesied in the Old TEstament.<br><br>With regards to taking another human beings life:<br><br>In Genesis prior to the flood God absolutely prohibits taking another human beings life, but after the Flood, God allows capital punishment under the governmental aurthority of man.<br><br>the point is this:<br><br>We are now in the Christian dispensation.

And I think it is better to discuss how we handle such situation rather than what is clean and what is not clean.<br><br>If it is unclean for us, then should we throw the food away? Are we allowed to donate what we consider unclean to non believers??? If one's grandmother, the only non-believer in the family, laid chickens and all the food at the tomb of his grandfather during Qingmin, and after that, should the family eat or should they go McDonald and let the grandmother finish up everything, or throw away??<br><br>Now chicken and ducks are not safe cause of bird flu; mutton is not safe cause the its fat is bad for heart; beef is not safe cause of mad cow disease; pork is also not safe cause of don't know what; plus residual pesticides, coloring, preservative, ....so what food is clean??<br></div>
