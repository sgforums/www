My grain of thot different from yours. I agree that you are correct in saying eating food offered to idols are not idolatrous but i was cautioning against the demonic powers behind these foods which have been partaken with idols. Sorry i stop arguing here.<br><br>Yes, I eat pork but i was raising an awareness that do we still eat unclean foods when God commanded not to. I was asking a question &amp; starting a discussion but people got personal. Sorry about this. I wasnt holier than thou if you read my posts carefully. I wasnt saying if you eat pork, you go to hell! Why people always misunderstand what i write?</div></blockquote>If you are so adament about what is written in Leviticus, then commandment of pork applies to you. There are not buts in this issue. Leviticus explicitly teaches that pork is considered as unclean food, you have very strongly insisted that because God say so, it must be so. You also explicitly group OT Jews and NT believers. Therefore Leviticus must also apply to you.<br><br>It is very clear, if you eat pork, according to YOU, you go against the words of God in Leviticus.<br><br>What the need to raise an awareness that we still eat unclean foods that God commanded us not to, when you are not even able to define what these are in our modern context, especially when these food are interwoven into our culture.<br>Also what is the purpose of raising such an awareness when you, despite of your strong words, are doing exactly the same thing?<br><br>Lunch time.... maybe I'd just have fried oysters, or prawn mee, or bak chor mee, all of the above have been condemned by the laws of Leviticus.</div>
