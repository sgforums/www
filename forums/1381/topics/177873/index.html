            <div class='col-md body'>There are biblical health reasons as to why the Jews were commanded not to eat certain kinds of food. It is good to follow if you can, but even if you have the occasional lapse, our food that we eat is sanctified in Jesus name.<br><br>here is an exerpt taken from an article written by Douglas Winnail:<br><br>" Probably the best known and least understood biblical health laws deal with clean and unclean meats (see Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14). These are often referred to as "Jewish" food laws because they are still followed by Orthodox Jews; yet Muslims and others also observe similar food restrictions. Many theologians assert that these biblical guidelines were not given for health reasons, but were merely cultic practices designed to separate ancient Israelites from other peoples. Others teach that these instructions were for people living under the Old Covenant and that Christians, who are under a New Covenant, are free to eat whatever they want. Some argue that biblical dietary restrictions are silly, old fashioned and merely limit human freedoms and pleasures!<br>These widely accepted ideas are based on ignorance. Most theologians have little or no training in biology, ecology, microbiology, parasitology, epidemiology or public health, yet knowledge of these fields reveals the wisdom behind the laws about clean and unclean foods. Many unclean animals are scavengers (e.g. snails, crabs, lobsters and gulls)Â—their ecological role is to devour dead plants or animals. Other unclean animals are filter feeders (e.g. clams and oysters)Â—their ecological role is to purify water in lakes, streams and estuaries. Other unclean animals are predators (e.g. lions, snakes and alligators)Â—their ecological role is to manage the size and health of other animal populations. There are very important ecological reasons why unclean animals that God created are not to serve as food for human beings. God designed them for another purpose!<br>However, there are also important health reasons behind these dietary restrictions. Many unclean animals carry parasites that cause serious diseases in humans. Pigs, bears, squirrels and raccoons carry trichinosis and other diseases. Scavengers such as crabs and crayfish can transmit lung and liver flukes. Human populations that consume these creatures on a regular basis often have high rates of parasitic infections. Filter feeding organisms, such as clams and oysters, may contain high concentrations of toxic heavy metals, pathogenic bacteria and virusesÂ—making them dangerous for human consumption. When you eat these creatures, you are actually eating organisms God created to be nature's "clean-up crew." Would you eat the contents of your vacuum cleaner bag or your garbage disposal? Hardly! Yet many gourmet dishes are served in blissful ignorance of the risks involved.<br>Far from being outdated Old Covenant practices, the biblical laws concerning clean and unclean meats were inspired by a God who created all things for a purposeÂ—a God concerned about promoting health and preventing disease! Avoiding unclean meats is a fundamental step in preventing major parasitic diseases that afflict millions of people around the world. When we violate these basic principles, we do so to our own detriment! Regrettably, modern theologians do not understand the value of these powerful public health principlesÂ—nor do many professing Christians!"<br><br>After reading this, you make your own judgements as to how or what you want to eat...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here is Jesus' explaination on clean/unclean food, guarding the heart is more important than guarding the stomach.<br><br><blockquote><br>Matt 15:10-20<br><br>Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand. What goes into a man's mouth does not make him 'unclean,' but what comes out of his mouth, that is what makes him 'unclean.' "<br>Then the disciples came to him and asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"<br>He replied, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots. Leave them; they are blind guides.If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit."<br>Peter said, "Explain the parable to us."<br>"Are you still so dull?" Jesus asked them. "Don't you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body? But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these make a man 'unclean.' For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander. These are what make a man 'unclean'; but eating with unwashed hands does not make him 'unclean.' "<br></blockquote>just so, on the principles of eating these 'unclean' food, paul make it clear that the food itself is not 'unclean', but the governing principle of loving each other.<br><br><blockquote><br>Roman 14:14-18<br>As one who is in the Lord Jesus, I am fully convinced that no food is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is unclean. If your brother is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy your brother for whom Christ died. Do not allow what you consider good to be spoken of as evil. For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by men.<br></blockquote>so its seems like its not the food that we eat, but the attitude that counts most.<br>after all, after giving thanks for the food we eat, we santified them, meaning they should be safe. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
