ArenÂ’t you GodÂ’s people, do you abstain from pork? If you donÂ’t, you have no right to question anybody.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Repented John 2:</div><div class="quote_body">Again, I said unclean foods as listed in the bible not our modern scientific understanding. God is much more knowledgeable than our scientists right?<br></div></blockquote>Correct, may I quote Paul who wrote the book of 1 Corinthians under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit:<br>1 Cor  8:4 So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that an idol is nothing at all in the world and that there is no God but one. 5For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many "gods" and many "lords" ), 6yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live.<br>7But not everyone knows this. Some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat such food they think of it as having been sacrificed to an idol, and since their conscience is weak, it is defiled. 8But food does not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do.<br>9Be careful, however, that the exercise of your freedom does not become a stumbling block to the weak. 10For if anyone with a weak conscience sees you who have this knowledge eating in an idol's temple, won't he be emboldened to eat what has been sacrificed to idols? 11So this weak brother, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your knowledge. 12When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. 13Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother to fall into sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause him to fall.<br>So I ask you John, is Paul correct? Idols are nothing, the food has no power... Note that the reason given by Paul for any abstainance of some food is very clear - for the purpose of NOT stumbling others. <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">You know, you are not Paul, you are precisely what Paul is talking about - one who is weak in conscience that when you eat such food you think of it having been sacrificied to an idol.</span></strong><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Repented John 2:</div><div class="quote_body">But Paul did say also we donÂ’t partake food with demons &amp; also eat from the holy communion</div></blockquote>Eating food previously offered to idols is NOT partake food with demons. The meaning of partake is to be intrinscally involved in the ritual.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Repented John 2:</div><div class="quote_body">It is not so simple. Holding joss stick means worshipping the demons behind the idols. Why still hold joss stick? Afraid of persecution?

Holding joss stick and lighting it up and putting it into the urn IS worshipping. Holding joss stick in itself is a physical act. Here, I am not debating about participating in a idol worship, I am addressing only the mere act of holding a joss stick, although there is really no good reason why anyone should be doing it. It is to illustrate that there is a difference in real idol worshipping and picking up a joss stick or candle or angpow<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>You know, I am sad for you.... whatever god you are worshipping is so weak that he cannot withstand the supernatural power of the devil.

Or use oneÂ’s life story and testimony to allow the Holy Spirit to move? At the end of the day, itÂ’s the individualÂ‘s choice of whether to accept Christ or not. <strong>You are no position to question my urgency!</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Chin Eng:</div><div class="quote_body">Correct, may I quote Paul who wrote the book of 1 Corinthians under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit:<br>1 Cor 8:4 So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that an idol is nothing at all in the world and that there is no God but one. 5For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many "gods" and many "lords" ), 6yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live.<br>7But not everyone knows this. Some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat such food they think of it as having been sacrificed to an idol, and since their conscience is weak, it is defiled. 8But food does not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do.<br>9Be careful, however, that the exercise of your freedom does not become a stumbling block to the weak. 10For if anyone with a weak conscience sees you who have this knowledge eating in an idol's temple, won't he be emboldened to eat what has been sacrificed to idols? 11So this weak brother, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your knowledge. 12When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. 13Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother to fall into sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause him to fall.<br>So I ask you John, is Paul correct? Idols are nothing, the food has no power... Note that the reason given by Paul for any abstainance of some food is very clear - for the purpose of NOT stumbling others. You know, you are not Paul, you are precisely what Paul is talking about - one who is weak in conscience that when you eat such food you think of it having been sacrificied to an idol.<br><br></div></blockquote>Paul did say further down in 1 Cor 10:14-22 : 14 Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. 15 I speak as to wise men; judge for yourselves what I say. 16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? 17 For we, though many, are one bread and one body; for we all partake of that one bread. 18 Observe Israel after the flesh: Are not those who eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar? 19 What am I saying then? That an idol is anything, or what is offered to idols is anything? <strong>20 Rather, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to God, and I do not want you to have fellowship with demons. 21 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the Lord's table and of the table of demons. 22 Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He? </strong><br><br>that we cannot partake of the Lord's table &amp; of the table of demons. Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? as in vv 21-22. do we take holy communion &amp; food sacrificed to demons as in vv15-20. Paul told us not to have fellowship with demons.<br></div>
