Or you have a special diet of manna?<br><br>We destroy our health by not taking things in moderation and not exercising, which has got nothing to do with the Leviticus context of unclean food and why in the NT, there is no such prohibition.</div></blockquote>I only go according to bible lah. In bible where got char kway teow, bak chor mee etc? If the regulation on unclean foods was good for the Jews(who are still God's people) then &amp; now, why can't Christians follow albeit not religiously as in go to hell if take them? They are also human. We are also human. But we gentiles. They God's people. When Christ came, only then are we accepted into God's kingdom by the blood covenant. Or else we like hooligans or barbarians to them.<br><br>In NT, all things are permissible for us, but not all things are good for us. Paul said it. Can Christians smoke or drink? No prohibition specifically what. Where did you see Thou shalt not drink alcohol or Thou shalt not smoke? Then we can say since we are saved by grace thru faith, we can smoke &amp; drink.</div>

WE no longer sacrifice goats and lambs to a priest in this dispensation.
