Writing down Christian beliefs and doctrines is expected. One of the most prominent Christian doctrine is that "there are not other gods but Jehovah". I don't even want to go into the definition of what an Idol is.....<br><br>My personal opinion is: If any Christian ventures into the other religious forum and whack the hell out of them by posting pro-Christian threads, that is wrong. If I know that I'd be the first to kick the butt of that individual who posted inflammatory remarks.<br><br>What Johnnie boy had written about idols (I assume it's still about idols) is not erroneous by the Christian definition. Would I, CE, make comments about other folks' "idols"? Probably not, but can't we all tell that Johnnie boy has poor judgement in what can or cannot write.<br><br>In this particular case, an uncalled for, unprovoked deragotory remark was made about the central figure in the Christian belief, do you think it is fair?<br><br>We can all pass negative comments about Johnnie boy, but what has that got to do with Jesus?</div>
