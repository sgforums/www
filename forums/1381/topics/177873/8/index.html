            <div class='col-md body'>I was reading Mark &amp; I came across this passage in Mark 7:14-23 talking abt the pharisees &amp; indirectly abt food. I was reading the NASB version so it has a bracket which talks abt food which NKJV doesnt say. Pls compare yourself.<br><br>14 After He called the crowd to Him again, He began saying to them, "Listen to Me, all of you, and understand: 15 there is nothing outside the man which can defile him if it goes into him; but the things which proceed out of the man are what defile the man. 16 ["If F109 anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."] 17 When he had left the crowd and entered the R240 house, His R241 disciples questioned Him about the parable. 18 And He said to them, "Are you so lacking in understanding also? Do you not understand that whatever goes into the man from outside cannot defile him, 19 because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach, and is F110 eliminated?" <strong>(Thus He declared all foods clean.)</strong> R243 20 And He was saying, "That R244 which proceeds out of the man, that is what defiles the man. 21 "For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed the evil thoughts, fornications, F111 thefts, murders, adulteries, 22 deeds of coveting and wickedness, as well as deceit, sensuality, envy, R245 F112 slander, pride F113 and foolishness. 23 "All these evil things proceed from within and defile the man."<br><br>So in NASB version, all foods are clean so I apologise to CE &amp; the rest here for creating a lot of misconception. I couldnt get it from the normal reading. KJV also dont have this bracket. Very new to me &amp; I hope it calms all fears abt unclean foods. KJV below:<br><br>14 And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand: 15 There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man. 16 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. 17 And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable. 18 And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him; 19 Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats? 20 And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. 21 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, 22 Thefts, covetousness, F26 wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: 23 All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.<br><br>It is also found in NLT:<br><br>14 Then Jesus called to the crowd to come and hear. "All of you listen," he said, "and try to understand. 15 You are not defiled by what you eat; you are defiled by what you say and do! F31 " 16 F100 17 Then Jesus went into a house to get away from the crowds, and his disciples asked him what he meant by the statement he had made. 18 "Don't you understand either?" he asked. "Can't you see that what you eat won't defile you? 19 Food doesn't come in contact with your heart, but only passes through the stomach and then comes out again." <strong>(By saying this, he showed that every kind of food is acceptable.) </strong>20 And then he added, "It is the thought-life that defiles you. 21 For from within, out of a person's heart, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, 22 adultery, greed, wickedness, deceit, eagerness for lustful pleasure, envy, slander, pride, and foolishness. 23 All these vile things come from within; they are what defile you and make you unacceptable to God."<br><br>Thank God for showing me the truth thru His word the bible albeit NASB &amp; NLT versions. Pls do this interesting comparisons yourselves with these versions. Have fun!<br><br></div>
