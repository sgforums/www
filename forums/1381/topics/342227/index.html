              <p>An interesting question <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png">. Indeed you'll find other events in the life of Jesus that were recorded in some of the Gospels but not in others. This is because the Gospels were written by different persons, each telling the story of Jesus from a different perspective to bring out a particular understanding of Jesus to his particular audience.</p>
              <p>The Gospel writers did not write everything that Jesus said and did. The Gospel of John (20:30) tells us, <em>"Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of (his) disciples that are not written in this book. But these are written that you may (come to) believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through this belief you may have life in his name."</em></p>

              <p>The gospels are not historical biographies or documentaries like what we would expect to read today or watch on History Channel <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png">. The gospels were written to bring out a certain portrayal and understanding of Jesus Christ. This might or might not require coverage of the virgin birth, depending on the intentions of the inspired author. <br> </p>
              <p>If you want a clear, orderly presentation of Jesus' ministry on earth, the gospel of Luke is probably your best bet. </p>
