              what if he's right?
              
              Sorry don't mean to confuse you but when you believe you need to believe wholeheartedly otherwise you are only going to follow the masses. And you will not see anything from God.
              
              I don't mean to become a fanatic. God still need His followers to use their head as much as they use their faith. This doesn't mean we are allowed to compromise with evil and be a part of it though. But as a Christian we need to live to see God's work in our life so that you can say for sure Jesus Christ who is alive and now glorified is my savior in whom I shall be saved from the sting and imprisonment of death and eternal punishment that shall come afterward. Furthermore so that people with open heart and good conscience, who are around you can see God's work in you and say there is no God like God.
              
              What about those who see God's work and yet still reject God and you? Just surrender them to God there is nothing to be done. God gives each of us a freedom to choose and not everyone use their good judgment, common sense and conscience to choose life. If such people are close to you praying is your best option if you want them saved. 
              
              Such people do not know where they are going. If only they knew what death is. They would choose life instead.

              Do you know how an airplane fly? An airplane's engines don't make it fly. It only push it forward. Instead it is the shape of the wings that helps an airplane to fly/lift due to a difference in air pressure on them. Yet the wings cannot make an airplane fly(lift) without the AIR.
              
              
              And guess what. We humans didn't create the AIR. So without whoever that created the AIR any plane couldn't possibly be able to fly. 
              
              
              If you say that the air is just a coincidence that means the whole universe and that's including everything and that everything includes you and me are one VERY BIG  coincidence. So if you think everything is just a coincidence that means our science is also the result of that coincidence. Then we are very very very very very lucky indeed to have a universe perfectly set up and our home planet conveniently placed to our sun tilted so conveniently to make a hospitable climate.
              
              
              Our entire existence is one BIG coincidence and all things living are ONE big lucky phenomenon. Happy?

              <p>No I know where I'm going though I still hope that God to spare me from death immediately as death is no joke and it's an absolute waste of time. As I know that there are people who are spared immediately from death. Not only they are spared immediately from death but they are given power to rule [with Christ]. But let's debate this some other time. Now read these two links I give you. I know not every Christian would agree with what I wrote but I'm not making up my testimony so either I'm so crazy or I'm speaking the truth because I'm taking huge risk of being ridiculed to write this testimony.

              <p>No the bible knows and writes about the world of the dead. The bible is written by people who put their faith in God, the living God and that faith is not in vain. God does reveal things that are otherwise hidden from men.</p>
              <p>I'm a Catholic and my testimony is not a lie no matter how unlikely it seems. But do not take my words for it the bible suports what I wrote instead of me writing to support the bible.</p>
              <p>Look if you want to prove everyhting yourself be my guess. Good luck. Like reinventing everything again. Fist you need God to reval Himself to you just like He did to Abraham. Then you need God to hand you down the law. Then you need to await for the rebirt of Jesus if you convinced God that Jesus is needed to be reborn again so that you may believe. And after following Jesus and seeing His miracles he performs you need to see His death again well it was on the cross may be today would be on the electric chair. And after Jesus 2nd death you would need to see His rise from death and witness a living Jesus. Not only alive but Jesus needs o be glorified or take a glorified form to convince yourself that He is indeed your savior.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After all this you write down all your experience with God. And another Joolead would still not believe you. And Jesus needs to be born the 3rd time for this second Joolead to be saved and God needs to reveal Himself to this second Joolead just like he did you and Abraham.</p>
              <p>Well it boils down to blasphemy in the end and the cycle keeps on repeating itself.</p>
              <p>Luckily God is no fool even though so many of us are. Of course you are not one of those.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cheers</p>
              <p>And about your comment unless he is satan....well if God didn't exist why must there be satan? Or even spirits because it is written that God is also the Lord of spirits.</p>

              <p>Why should anyone who believed in God and His Kingdom of Heaven kill himself? You claimed to have read and know the Bible but it seems like you do not know that killing is a sin....including killing yourself.</p>
              <p>Again, if you read and understand the Bible, the Bible is about faith, hope and love.  "Whoever fails to love does not know God, because God is love." (1Jn 4:8)</p>

              <p>No but I've seen Jesus Christ. well long time ago when I was in my 7th grade.</p>
              <p>Here's the story I wrote for a different forum.</p>
              <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Hello HolyRoute yes I did see Jesus Christ when I was in my 7th grade. I will never forget that day.<br><br>I was then in my bed at night about 8 pm. I felt terrible about my life. i felt that many people seemed to hate me for no obvious reasons. Then I started to cry. But Because I'm a boy I covered my face with my pillow not to let anyone knew I was crying. As I began to cry I started to imagine that I was hugging Jesus where in fact I was hugging my pillow. As I was doing this I thought to myself that no one was worth defending except Jesus and a powerful thought came to me that Jesus was the one without sin. After that thought I felt love for Jesus. Small at first but in a mere few seconds that small love for Jesus was growing exponentially such that in the end I was really really in love with Jesus. I would give to Jesus anything that He asked of me anything at all because I loved Him so much. Then a thought came to me that I could ask anything from God.<br>So I did.<br><br>I asked to be allowed to see Jesus face. Mind you I didn't really realize that Jesus was not mere man as I was still a child. I never read the bible then too. After I uttered my wish with my thought a powerful vision came to me while I was still fully awake lying on my bed. I saw what I believed to be Jesus. His whole body was covered with such immense white light that was coming out from His face. I didn't see any figure but I knew the direction of His face. And because I wanted to see His face I tried to look into the direction of His face but the intensity of the light was such that I couldn't penetrate the light. The light wasn't giving me any pain though. But I was persistent(or foolish) that I kept on trying over and over again. Until I thought to myself: Never mind not being able to see Jesus face. I've seen God and now I could tell this to others. After I thought that to myself I tried for the last time to stare into the direction of His face but this time both of my physical eyeballs hurt. It felt like burning(I didn't realize it was a burning sensation then though) it felt like any small needles hit both of my eyeballs. After this I didn't dare to stare in the direction of His face and only dare to stare down. The vision then began to grow weaker and weaker until it disappear completely.<br><br><br>Be blessed</p>

              <p>As for evil somebody sent me an evil spirit to my dorm room back in 2001 in Singapore. It went by the name Olahzhong. Got rid of it after I cried out to God. It fled with its tail tucked between its legs perhaps because it fled so right away after I cried out to God. So I can say that even evil spirit actually fear God greatly. To them God is very frightening lol.</p>

              <p>I've seen quite extraordinary things that evil could do but never I see them as being greater than the power of our Lord. Never. Not even once. There's always a greater similar thing from God that God allowed me to witness. Not even once.</p>

              <p>Dear M&amp;P,</p>
              <p>Very inspiring post, thank you <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To my fellow Christians (and gentle non-Christians) out there, seems to me that there are a few who post on this forum (especially in this thread) who go all out to offend and provoke others, then retreat and say 'You better not lash back 'cos you're supposed to be Christ-like!'.</p>
              <p>No point getting offended or upset, 'cos their actions speak for the 'attractiveness' of their own belief system. Best way to deal with this is to ignore their meaningless posts and pray for them. Stay strong ya? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> </p>

              <p>there is also no indication that He is not.</p>
              <p>Yes Bible is recorded by man and there is nothing wrong about it unless you want to see God stretching his hand down to us, grab a pen and write the Book before our eyes.  Most Christians probably don't mind.  But it's going to freak the hell out of the non believers.</p>
