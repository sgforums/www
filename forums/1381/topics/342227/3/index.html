              <p>yep, recorded and re recorded by man. but the events that happened, i'm sure it's just one big conspiracy that coincidently, Joseph and Mary(because she's ambitious and wanted her baby to be remembered for the next thousands of years) decided to try (and succeeded) to fulfil hundreds of hundreds of years old prophecies which foretold of the messiah and orchestrated with the entire jewish nation, and roman empire to have him killed in exactly the manner described hundreds of years ago by prophets of old.</p>
              <p>Oh, i'm sure, that everythingm from his lineage to his lifestyle, and to his death, it's all just one big conspiracy by man, and none of it is orchestrated by God. =)</p>

              hi all, wad i wanna say is is there anything on earth tat can be 100% proven??? the word "proof" has often been abused...when ppl ask for proof...wad kind of proof...i remember miracles &amp; prophecies once said this:" public proof no way, private proof, yes , plenty...
              
              y r we asking others to prove to us when at the end of the day, the best form of proof is personal/private experience? i ask everyone here a qn: say i am standing at a road junction full of vehicles n am hesitating whether to cross the road. now i ask u: prove to me tat if i cross the road, i wun get knock down my a vehicle. if u can prove to me, then i will cross." how will anyone prove to me? if u cross the road urself n when u get to the other end, reply me by saying:" see? i made it to the other end. i have proven to u its safe to cross the road." my answer to u is:" sorry, u have NOT proven to me. u have onli proven tat YOU wun get knocked down by wad abt myself? can i use ur personal experience of crossing the road safely as proof tat i will also get across safely?
              
              the way to prove to myself of cuz is to TAKE A STEP OF FAITH n cross the road myself...it requires faith cos there is always tat one in a million chance tat one of the drivers happen to be my enemy n is waiting to knock me down when i am crossing the road even when the "green man" is flashing. likewise, how to prove to others tat God exist? there is no way we can prove 100% unless these ppl r willing to experience God themselves...cheers!!!

              <p>Accepting that there was indeed a historical figure called Jesus (regardless of whether he was divine) is a good first step <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png">.</p>
              <p>Actually, I can sympathise with you. For a non-Christian, I can understand your difficulty in accepting that the bible is the word of God, that the miracles described really did occur, that what the Church and the bible teache about the divinity of Jesus is true. You will not find 'scientific proof' of Jesus as God, just as you will not be able to 'scientifically disprove' the existence of God.</p>
              <p>We will never be able to convince you of God, only God himself can reach out to you. It might be through someone you love and admire, it might be through various experiences. But whatever it might be, I pray that you do not resist God's graces and love, that you ultimately leave this world in God's friendship. Afterall, heaven is big enough for everyone.</p>

              <p>The Bible is a compilation of many books.  If there was any mistake in any of the book, it would have been rejected by the Church and not be part of the Bible. Perhaps you may want to read about the history of Bible, how it came about. I am not putting it here, cuz it's a long story (it took 1 RCIA lesson just to go through this part of the history and somemore it's already a summarised version) and I may not be able to remember every detail correctly.</p>
              <p>To understand why the Church teaches this and that as well as the Bible, one has to undertstand the history, culture and politics as well.</p>

              so now bringing tis discussion back to the topic, is it possible to prove the birth of jesus? the answer is no. the furthest we can go is to provide reasonings to make it seem logical n reasonable tat he was indeed born as the saviour to mankind. its like saying, can we realli prove tat albert einstein existed??? we have seen photos of him, read abt him etc...but did any of us live during his time to noe tat he existed??? could the photos n facts recorded abt him been fabricated? maybe he nvr existed. albert einstein could jolly well be a fictitious character tat man made up to provide an answer to the qn on who invented the law of relativism for eg...
              
              science said tat sth is onli considered to exist if tat sth can be touched, felt, seen, tasted or smelled. can any of us touch, feel, see, taste or smell albert einstein? since TS believe in science, then he shld not believe tat albert einstein once existed...if tats the case, then all the historical scientists may not have existed. tis leads to the qn: where then did the scientific laws n theories come from? u see, if we do not believe in a 1st cause, tis argument can go on n on 4ever. its regressive without any end. so, wad proof r we toking abt here?

              <p>Dear M&amp;P,</p>
              <p>Very inspiring post, thank you <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>To my fellow Christians (and gentle non-Christians) out
              there, seems to me that there are a few who post on this forum
              (especially in this thread) who go all out to offend and provoke
              others, then retreat and say 'You better not lash back 'cos you're
              supposed to be Christ-like!'.</p>
              <p>No point getting offended or upset, 'cos their
              actions speak for the 'attractiveness' of their own
              belief system. Best way to deal with this is to ignore their
              meaningless posts and pray for them. Stay strong ya? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> </p>

              <p>yep, recorded and re recorded by man. but the events that happened, i'm sure it's just one big conspiracy that coincidently, Joseph and Mary(because she's ambitious and wanted her baby to be remembered for the next thousands of years) decided to try (and succeeded) to fulfil hundreds of hundreds of years old prophecies which foretold of the messiah and orchestrated with the entire jewish nation, and roman empire to have him killed in exactly the manner described hundreds of years ago by prophets of old.</p>
              <p>Oh, i'm sure, that everythingm from his lineage to his lifestyle, and to his death, it's all just one big conspiracy by man, and none of it is orchestrated by God. =)</p>

              <p>so now bringing tis discussion back to the topic, is it possible to prove the birth of jesus? the answer is no. the furthest we can go is to provide reasonings to make it seem logical n reasonable tat he was indeed born as the saviour to mankind. its like saying, can we realli prove tat albert einstein existed??? we have seen photos of him, read abt him etc…but did any of us live during his time to noe tat he existed??? could the photos n facts recorded abt him been fabricated? maybe he nvr existed. albert einstein could jolly well be a fictitious character tat man made up to provide an answer to the qn on who invented the law of relativism for eg…</p>
              <p>science said tat sth is onli considered to exist if tat sth can be touched, felt, seen, tasted or smelled. can any of us touch, feel, see, taste or smell albert einstein? since TS believe in science, then he shld not believe tat albert einstein once existed…if tats the case, then all the historical scientists may not have existed. tis leads to the qn: where then did the scientific laws n theories come from? u see, if we do not believe in a 1st cause, tis argument can go on n on 4ever. its regressive without any end. so, wad proof r we toking abt here?</p>

              <p>TS believe in god not science.As for me i believe in science rather than the man make god easy believe system.Albert Einstein is real and from  his <a class="mw-redirect" title="Special theory of relativity" href="/wiki/Special_theory_of_relativity"><span style="color: #002bb8;">special theory of relativity</span></a>,alot of thing have been invented .and improve and better for the sake man-kind.And thru the spirit doubts mind of seeking,research and asking question.</p>

              <p>hi all, wad i wanna say is is there anything on earth tat can be 100% proven??? the word “proof” has often been abused…when ppl ask for proof…wad kind of proof…i remember miracles &amp; prophecies once said this:” public proof no way, private proof, yes , plenty…</p>
              <p>y r we asking others to prove to us when at the end of the day, the best form of proof is personal/private experience? i ask everyone here a qn: say i am standing at a road junction full of vehicles n am hesitating whether to cross the road. now i ask u: prove to me tat if i cross the road, i wun get knock down my a vehicle. if u can prove to me, then i will cross.” how will anyone prove to me? if u cross the road urself n when u get to the other end, reply me by saying:” see? i made it to the other end. i have proven to u its safe to cross the road.” my answer to u is:” sorry, u have <span>NOT</span> proven to me. u have onli proven tat <span>YOU</span> wun get knocked down by wad abt myself? can i use ur personal experience of crossing the road safely as proof tat i will also get across safely?</p>
              <p>the way to prove to myself of cuz is to <span>TAKE A STEP OF FAITH</span> n cross the road myself…it requires faith cos there is always tat one in a million chance tat one of the drivers happen to be my enemy n is waiting to knock me down when i am crossing the road even when the “green man” is flashing. likewise, how to prove to others tat God exist? there is no way we can prove 100% unless these ppl r willing to experience God themselves…cheers!!!</p>
