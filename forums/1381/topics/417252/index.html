              <p>A pastor faces eight years in prison for a ponzi scheme that defrauded millions of dollars from

              I definitely agree with you that what these pastors are doing is wrong
              
              in NUS, for example there are  a bunch of friends, then a guy asks another guy, " eh is that guy a christian", the other guy replies," no la he goes to City Harvest''. "oh okay" . alot of christians in singapore do not accept the City Harvest and New Creation people as 'Christians', they are more like people who are enticed to give their money so they can supposedly get more. 
              
              the main theory of Kong Hee's Prosperity Gospel  is:
              
               you give me $1, you get $1000 dollars back. 
               this may not be in monetary terms, u could supposedly get a promotion, yet it could also be about spiritual wealth! how you would be renewed in the spirit! 
              
              as Matthew 6:19-20 says:
              
              19 â€œDo not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 20 But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
              
              I do have to make some clarification about the issue of wealth
              
              
              For example: There are 2 very wealthy men
              
              1)18 year old who just inherited all the money from his late parents
              2) a 50 year old who has been seeking money all his life
              
              although they may have the same net amount of money, the 18 year old may not have a Heart that always cares about money and always strives to make more of it, instead he could give it to charity and the poor, however the 50 year old sole purpose in life is to earn money, and that is terribly wrong, because his priority and focus is not on God, but on himself and his wealth. I am not going all out to say all the people in city harvest are like the 50 year old man, but looking at it from a neutral standpoint, i am sure its quite obvious many people feel the same way.
              
              
              
              1) there is no evidence in the bible that says you should seek wealth and fame
              
              2)There are many instances in the bible that seems to show God's disliking of rich people
               Matthew 19:23-24, Mark 10:24-25, Luke 18:24-25
              
              ...I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
              
              HOWEVER, that doesnt mean rich people would go to hell, because if you are rich and u give to the poor and are an honest person whose faith and hope is in the Lord Your God, then it is perfectly. As long as money does not come before God in terms of your priorities. it is okay.
              
              On a personal note, i think that these pastors have already fallen through the gap and now put money before God in their lives, which i think is very sad but not entirely shocking, after all Satan is constantly tempting us with worldly things such as wealth, satisfaction etc, however all these pleasures are only temporary and you will only continue to want them, the need for satisfaction would never end and you would fall into the gap. Although i do condemn the pastors, i still believe they can be forgiven as long as they come out and repent and give back the money they have stolen from others. 
              
              I pray that you would understand Christianity and not keep trying to screw it up.
              It has allowed me to live a morally correct life and i truly treasure my Church and its members. Thank God.
