The <a class="mw-redirect" title="Just War theory" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_War_theory">Just War theory</a> was developed in order to reconcile warfare with Christian belief by the Romans who embraced Christianity.</p>

              <p>actually if you read the NT carefully it is about teshuva, or returning back to G_d, it is not just about love... it is about duty, following His commandments and following His ways.</p>
              <p>It speaks about the final battle to come and how we must be prepared for it.</p>
              <p>It speaks about our salvation by becoming part of Yisrael, and how we have covenant with Yahweh.</p>

              <p>To answer that question, there're a few foundational things to deal with....</p>
              <p>First of all, the answer has nothing to do with the differences between the NT and the OT.</p>
              <p>The bible is ONE, and God is the same throughout the ages, He never changes today or tomorrow.</p>
              <p>The differences between the Old and New Testament is a matter of covenants and ceremonies. For example, in the Old Testament, before Jesus came to wash away sin through His blood, the ceremonies and festivals were necessary as a symbol of how the Lamb of God will redeem us, but after He has come, there is no longer a need for such ceremonies...and so on.</p>
              <p>However, the character of God is the same throughout the NT and OT. The law is still valid, in the OT and NT, although both in the NT and the OT, nobody could be saved by the law, but these are eternal truths of God's character that does not change.</p>
              <p>So the concept of a difference of whether it is right/wrong after OT/NT is a wrong concept and in theology, it is a type of heresy to believe a seperate character of God in OT/NT.</p>
              <p>Back to the question on whether Christians can be soldiers. As in all things, it is according to your faith, whether right/wrong, the laws of God are plain to read, the commandments of God, not to kill the innocent, etc. are plain.</p>
              <p>But whether joining your nation's army is right/wrong is a matter of your own discernment/faith, if your country's military force is for the peace of mankind and nations, or for destruction and the use of satan.</p>
              <p>A few scriptures to consider:</p>
              <p>In Ecclesiastes, it says, there's a time for everything....including for peace/war.</p>
              <p>In the OT, the children of Israel had an army.</p>
              <p>In the NT, the nations in the end times were judged according to which side their army was on, for or against Israel.</p>
              <p>In Revelations and throughout the bible, God has an army too - of angels.</p>
              <p>So....I think we can conclude, throughout the bible, there's nothing against an army/military force. Just like you can be rich and be righteously rich like David, or you can be poor but a sinner. Rich or poor doesn't mean if you're right, so army or not, doesn't mean you're righteous or not either. It is a matter of what you use your military force for, just like money, or anything you're given in this lifetime.</p>

              <p><em>Suppose you hear in one of the towns the LORD your 
              God is giving you that some worthless rabble among you have led their fellow 
              citizens astray by encouraging them to worship foreign gods.  In such cases, you 
              must examine the facts carefully.  If you find it is true and can prove that 
              such a detestable act has occurred among you, you must attack that town and 
              completely destroy all its inhabitants, as well as all the livestock.  Then you 
              must pile all the plunder in the middle of the street and burn it.  Put the 
              entire town to the torch as a burnt offering to the LORD your God.  That town 
              must remain a ruin forever; it may never be rebuilt.  Keep none of the plunder 
              that has been set apart for destruction.  Then the LORD will turn from his 
              fierce anger and be merciful to you.  He will have compassion on you and make 
              you a great nation, just as he solemnly promised your ancestors.  "The LORD your 
              God will be merciful only if you obey him and keep all the commands I am giving 
              you today, doing what is pleasing to him."</em>  (Deuteronomy 13:13-19 NLT)</p>

              <p>It always been said that NT is about love and turn the other

              <p>During those days most Jews are right handed &amp; they use the back of the right hand to slap slaves &amp; animals. Thus the slap on the right cheek.

              <p>My Jesus in the Bible is firm yet not over demanding. He over turned the money changing tables at the temple. He called the Pharisees a broad of vipers &amp; He also called them hypocrites. When the Pharisees challenged Him with the Law when they showed Him the woman they caught in adultery, He challenged those Pharisees to stone her if anyone of them are without sin.</p>
              <p>Peter was a coarse &amp; rugged fisherman but Peter followed Him. Peter cut off a Roman soldier's ear at the garden of Gethsamane before Jesus's arrest but Jesus healed the Roman soldier.</p>
