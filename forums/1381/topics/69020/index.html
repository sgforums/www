            <div class='col-md body'>Stop loving this evil world and all that it offers you, for when you love the world, you show that you do not have the love of the Father in you. For the world offers only the lust for physical pleasure, the lust for everything we see and pride in our possessions. These are not from the Father. They are from this evil world. And this world is fading away, along with everything it craves. But if you do the will of God, you will live forever. [1 John 2:15-17]<br><br>-------------------------------------<br>FOREWARD<br>========<br>Many times we wonder where God is in our lives, on our campus, in our workplace and neighbourhood.But when do we really take time to simply ask Him where He is in all this. God is interested in every detail of our lives; He is interested in spending time with us too. This 12-day prayer focus is a good time to start seeking God regarding all these questions. We need a good heart to heart talk with our Maker! Ask Him to show us the condition of our lives, the campus, workplace and the world! Ask Him to show us His heart for these people and the work that He is continually doing!Ask the Lord of the harvest to send labourers to the harvest field. If Christ really is going to return and at an hour we least expect, let us be ready and vigilant, faithful with what He has entrusted us with! If there is a spiritual war going on, then His people need to fight and intercede!<br><br>iNVITATION<br>==========<br><br>Dear Brothers and Sisters,<br><br>From 9th -20th Feb 04, the Campus Crusade for Christ is 'engaging with God' and 'dis-engaging from the world'. It is not isolation but rather to spend the time we have so often spent on with God rather than with the world. Personally, i realised most of my time are spent here and I have decided to spend the next 12 days 'forum-less.' What about you? What kinds of activities take up most of your time and draw you away from God?<br><br>I want to seek God and His purpose for my life as an individual, as well as me being part of the Body of Christ and Kingdom. What are His plans for me? What can I do for Him? One clear example that our Lord has told us to do is to be His witnesses to the ends of the earth.(Matthew 28:19-20)<br><br>I will only post one short post for the next twelve days and hope that you will take a look at the Scripture verse and pray along with us.<br><br>There are NO prayer pointers given because we trust that as you focus on Him, He will place in your hearts what to pray for. Be disengaged from some activities you normally do and use this time to seek God. You are also encouraged to fast( Optional: be it one meal or full day as the Spirit leads you) and remember to pray when you fast else it becomes dieting!<br><br>This is not merely a 'NUS Campus Crusade' thingy..but rather a chance we can spend quality time with God with areas concerning us,people around us, our Nation and lastly the world at large.<br><br>BE ENGAGED....<br><br></div>
