            <div class='col-md body'>Shifting from topic Aunt Agony's topic "Aunt Agony" to here, I would like to ask what's wrong with my part in saying that Jesus's strength is limited whereas God's strength is perfect. In the Bible, it says that Jesus went to village to village to teach God's words and healed MOST (BUT NOT ALL) sick ppl through God's perfect power. And follow by hours of quiet time with God. When John and the rest of his disciples searched for Jesus to heal more ppl, he said to move on to another village. Which part of my intepretation is wrong, the_don? Many thanks</div>

Sorry to quote something from the bible, as I'm a christian. The bible actually stated that Jesus only healed MOST(Not ALL) sick or demon-possessed ppl in villages, coz he knows his strength is not perfect and can't endure curing everyone even when his disciples persuade him to continue. Only God can do that. There's no underlying intention of asking you to believe in God and Jesus, but hope to let you know that we, afterall, are just human beings.<br><br>From your posts that I have read, you have already done a fantastic job!<br></div></blockquote>First, a disclaimer. i am by no means an authority on the scriptures. but as far as i know, these are the underlying teachings.<br><br>Jesus is GOD in flesh, He is perfect, on earth as He is in heaven.

Jesus wants everyone to be well, that's why he spent so much time healing. why all is not healed seems a pretty debatable issue. but in my opinion it has a lot to do with our faith in Him; our faith in His willingness, in His ability and His Joy to heal us.

I totally agree with that too, Hallelujah! Perhaps, I failed to bring this up into the context. The reason why I quoted Jesus in Yuhanier's example is because Yuhanier is a human who gets tired like what you said about Jesus. What I realised from a visiting pastor's teaching, which makes sense, is that people nowadays, have been emphasising the 'loud' side of the Spirit but not the 'quiet' side of the Spirit. Jesus gets tired after a day's of healing coz as what you said, He's human. He's doing what is within human limits that's why He went into prayers to seek strength from God, and even though His disciple hurried Him to continue, He said move on, He could have just said yes and continue healing them.<br><br>From the begining till forever, I have never doubt what Jesus can do for He is God in flesh. I have and will always pray through Him and in His most precious name.<br><br>Another question is the Bible stated that love is not jealousy, hatred etc(can't really remember)...then why my pastor said God is a very jealous God when God's love is perfect?</div>

Ex 20:5, Ex 34:14) describes God as a jealous God, it uses the hebrew word <span style="font-style: italic;">Qana</span>. The particular form of the word was used only to describe God, it was never used to describe human's emotion. This is the first clue that God's jealousy is different from what we understand of human's jealousy.<br><br>Elsewhere, another form of the word <span style="font-style: italic;">Qana</span>, was translated as zealous. So when the word jealous is used to describe God, it conveys the idea of "protective love to guard one's beloved". Think "jealous for" not "jealous of"<br><br>When God is described as jealous, it is in the context of warning the Israelites against worship of foreign gods (idols). God is being protective of His chosen people.</div>
