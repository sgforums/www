              Read the first link so sad. A Christian should never look and expect anything from other fellow Christian or so I've learned. Just look into Christ.<br><br>
              
              It's easy to be religious when everything is smooth sailing, but when things go bad and life seems to falter apart then it's the real test whether you are a Christian at heart or not.<br><br>
              Many people seems to believe that by being a Christian could help them reap financial gains directly or indirectly in other words they bought the faith because they sold themselves or think they would gain for things of this world. But being a Christian is about receiving eternal life and that's not going to happen after a person dies. <br><br>
              Christianity is also not about religion but it's about a way of life a set of mindset and heart and a personal experience with God. It's about a relationship with the most high.<br><br>
              Any Christian should also be aware that the enemy of every Christian is the devil itself. It would seek ways to destroy a Christian faith. It only got this lifetime to succeed or fail(and the stake is HIGH VERY HIGH) and it will use any ways including fellow Christian themselves just like what was told by that Korean women to destroy a believer faith.<br><br>
              It means constantly being engaged in a war. Just stay close to God and all will be alright no matter how hard. Bring glory to God alone and it's never between us and the devil but between the devil and God. We are just bearing the brunt of its attacks but also receive and will receive any measures of help that's required.
              <br><br>
              
              I feel sorry for the woman.<br><br>
              The devil ruined her inheritance by ruining her life with the help of that ex husband of her.<br><br>
              
              She quit probably because she never knew God all her life. But to each their own burden.<br><br>What men broke God could heal. Perhaps in time she will found healing and gain what is now lost.<br><br>
              If you're a Christian and you don't know that you're at war you better wake up you are at war! Just watch where the enemy will strike.

              And if you're wondering what is at stake:
                                                  
              <br><br> 
              God promised ETERNAL power(authority) and life to all that wins through the end. The very best of life. The kind of life that would make every warlords, conquerors, leaders, kings, presidents envy very much.<br><br>
              Men of this world kill each other for a puny and short power but God will give what's even unthinkable to those that win through the end. Those who win will be set higher than the angels of God. Angels are servants but those who win will rule as kings with Christ our Lord and savior. Do you have what it takes to be a king? Claim your inheritance as the children of the Most high.
