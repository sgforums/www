              <p>Dear TS,</p>
              <p> I admire you for your faith in your own religion. However,
                      I would urge you to be more tolerant towards other
                      people's religion.</p>
              <p>By declaring that idols of various materials are FALSE GODs, you
                      are assuming that other religions are nothing but
                      a fairy-tale.</p>
              <p>I respect you and your religion. However, what I can't
                      understand is your lack of respect for others. Of course there are
                      endless debates on whether so and so exists. Before you start
                      proclaiming something of no substance, please take into
                      considerations that many religions happen B.C. not A.D.</p>
              <p>Peace to all.</p>

              <p>    This is a Christian forum so Christian topics are to be expected</p>

              <p>    Yes Christian faith requires a believer to denounce any other Gods or deities. But we are tolerable in that we welcome people of other faith to live side by side in harmony. But we really believe that there is no other true God than the one we worship. As does the Jews, the Moslems or others believe such too . And we respect their belief.</p>

              <p>been there, done that. a long debated topic la.</p>
              <p>i mentioned it before in some threads. of course, some christians say that they only... use it as rememberance or reminder etc.. and i'll give them that la.</p>
              <p>but some forgot that it's just a "reminder" and they "walk fire, enter demon", and it becomes a subconscious worship, without them realising it.</p>
              <p>to each his own i guess? but bible very clear cut about idolatry la, as domon says</p>
              <p>but hey, everyone has some form of idolatry in their lives also la. anything that you love more than God is an idolatry in itself alr.</p>
              <p>so it's hard to... say right?</p>

              <p>Well actually not only in times of desperation though most people pray their earnest/sincerest in desperation.</p>
              <p>I believe that God could take an active part in your life in that God is not a passive God who only acted on prayers but a God who also do a lot of initiatives in your daily life. There is no way for us to know what we are going to need and ask for it hence God may took the initiative to see you get it for example.</p>
              <p>It's like having a friend who is there 24/7 for you but you won't know when that friend is going to give you something but you can be sure that that friend will give you something from time to time. Though that friend never get tired or ever go to sleep, share with you your every time, listens to the whisper of your hearts(prayer) though he may not act on it all the time in that he alone decides and that he knows everything and that time is of no relevance to him and that the hearts of men is known to him as well as the ability to manipulate...our physical environment and our own body too and that he may give you an overhwhelming peace that gives you joy and makes you feel like the richest person on the planet every second of it if you find favor in him but which may be forfeited if you have an attachment to sin(my bad, I was experimenting too, my dumbass) and that he is the ultimate terror to evil spirit unless that shaman was being very nice or that particular evil spirit was a skittish one from the start LOL. Unfortunately I've never seen my friend trembles a living evil person before LOL. Would make me a great bully to evil people if he would.</p>
              <p>And nothing is too small for God to give us His blessings I guess. And you would never know what you are going to be given next.</p>
              <p>But I just realized that God could take an active role in my life for the past few years and it started with me going through a terrible event in my life. But unbelievers may cry something else which I have disproven with a personal event that...is personal. LOL. Sorry I couldn't let it out clear. I'm keeping this to myself I guess.</p>
              <p>I've come to the conclusion that when people just don't want to believe they go the extra miles to make up reasons that are not reasonable at all and force themselves to believe them. Just like the ostrich which would bury its head to escape trouble and believe that it is free since it couldn't see anything.</p>

              <p>yes..i wholey agree that God is not passive..waiting for prayers then act. otherwise, JC wont be sent down to redeem humans. no1 prayed for a saviour yet a saviour was sent. God is a revealer of secrets M&amp;P.. you mentioned personal unfortunate events as well as a vision. only God will know what actually happened. in a way, it changed u no doubt and seems like you are now a zealous witness to God. that is very impt to God. but do pray that you do not get emo like the christians and get irrational. that will not please God too.</p>
              <p>when people are convinced of a certain belief, they will go all out to defend it. im sure if people discredit your God, u will go all out to defend his name rite?( though im not sure which name you would defend). whatever it is, base all points back to the bible instead of this pastor taught me tat or tis. May your name be included in the scroll of life too. =)</p>

              <p>I'm may be a witness but don't think I'm a zealous one apart from this forum I hardly ever witness to anyone else and when I do try people just don't want to listen LOL. And no it wasn't because I was overzelous or rude or emotional or inconsiderate. I was and am gentle in fact.</p>
              <p>what I wrote in my previous post about God being a friend is from my own experience not some pastor teaching. I don't know if only God could know the future since seems that there are throngs of people who advertise themselves that they could tell the future but then again if they really could what are they doing by advertising themselves to other people? Besides if they claim that they could save other people's future i.e, changing it for the better then what they knew isn't the future then. But I do know that God could tell the future...but He doesn't tell me everything that is going to happen just a few events counting 4 events to this day. One of them was on a distant nation that has nothing to do with me. Until this day I have no idea why I was told that.</p>

              <p>hihi M&amp;P..</p>
              <p>glad to know more about you. but also i worry for u. actually, witnessing is best done face to face insted of on forums like this..i come here during my work time to kill time.. you know insurance agents that flock the streets? actually witnessing is something like that. we are selling the ultimate life insurance. but have to be really tactful.</p>
              <p>as for your 2nd point that God is your fren, im sure God will be please to have more of his creatures to regard as frens. also, only God can know the future.not even JC knows the future except what was already told to him. with the completion of revelation, God has no more need for people to act as his prophets like old times. meaning, ALL those who claims to be able to see the future or has visions of the future means only 2 things.</p>
              <p>1st..they are lying to get $$ or other things they desire.</p>
              <p>2nd..they have been shown things they normally should not be seeing by the demons.( i believe this to be your case.) of course all the things they see are lies by the demons. it may happen to further convince the victim that it is indeed a vision from the living God.</p>
              <p>an anecdote of my experience. i have a fren though not very close. she is a christian and baptised. she is a quite devoted one too. however, she like harry potter novels and movies alot and always read them or watch the movies..soon, she started having strange dreams and they would often happen in real life.from dreams came "visions" and predictions. bad thing was i should have gotten some toto or 4d numbers from her but i didnt. now shes diagnosed as mentally unstable by imh.</p>
              <p>which is why i said im worried for u M&amp;P though i do not know u.</p>
