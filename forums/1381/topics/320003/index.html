              <p> I admire you for your faith in your own religion. However, I would urge you to be more tolerant towards other people's religion.</p>

Before you start proclaiming something of no substance, please take into considerations that many religions happen B.C. not A.D.</p>
              <p>Peace to all.</p>

              <p>Christian God is all knowing, thus He already knows who will be saved of who will not be...so why should Christians tremble at the thought of Armageddon or the end of this world?  And in the first place, why should God be feared?  Isn't He supposed to be a loving "Father" to all of us?  If He is loving, then He will want what is best for us, and end this miserable world as soon as possible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You asked whether our Christian friends have made their choice for God, but I thought Christians have already made their choices.  How can one call himself a "Christian" if he had not made his choice to follow God?  Wouldn't that be hypocritical if one claims to be a Christian and yet still undecided about the teachings of the Bible?</p>

              <p>having said that.. christians are also human, prone to human weaknesses. it all boils down to whether they live by the spirit or not lor. if they yield to the HS, they won't want to lead a life of sin, vice versa.</p>

              <p>1st qn..no im not a christain yet. but i dont just shoot my mouth off here..i had done researches on most types of religions before and observed them. i am still studying the bible which is my latest "project". it seems like bible answers most of the qns found in today's problematic society.</p>
              <p>2nd qns. i answered before but here goes.. it took 1 perfect man to bring sin to the world. God being fair will require 1 perfect man to end all sins is it not? of cuz if God just said all our sins are forgiven den no1 needs to die. but JC was willingly to die and if God just says to forgive like that, that does not make God fair. and no lessons learnt.</p>
              <p>a teacher is teaching, say, maths to a class. suddenly a student challenges the teacher and offered an alternative answer. he twists it so that it looks logical. but in fact wrong. however the rest of the class will have doubts. what better way then let the erring student show what he got then correct him so all can learn? or u prefer to cut him off b4 he can go on?</p>
              <p>by letting JC die, God is not punishing him cuz none of his bldy biz in the 1st place.</p>
              <p>hope i answered ur qn.</p>

              <p><br> The planet is in a phase or readjustment. Its like a house
              undergoing renovation. There will be some discomfort but the end
              result is a beautiful house. You are blindly corelating what you
              read to what you see around you.</p>

              <p><br>so in your wise opinion,what is the planet "renovating" itself into? humans has reached the end of govt ideas, they tried all kinds liaoz. tech wise, not fully explored already did so much harm to planet. with exploding population and massive usage of resources.. i really too stupid to see what beautiful house the planet can transform into in the hands of humans like yourself. the effects of the planet's demise is pretty obvious. it most probably wont just happen the next few hours, but the way humans are torturing it, it surely wont survive another billion years.million in fact.</p>

              <p>many people thinks armageddon is the end. but it is not. no1 can stop armageddon like in the movies except God. while the events unfolds, there are instructions to follow is it not? it is the instructions that is impt. the events are interesting too as more unfolds and we being in it..its like we already know the ending to a show but still we are participating in it.</p>
