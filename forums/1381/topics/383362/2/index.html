              <p>what are you really here for. If you realise that the scripture is too difficult for you ask your pastor to write in here and discuss. If not ask the bishop. If not the pope. </p>

The base of this topic is God's existence. Stop harassing those christians, respect what they believe in. I dare you to say in front of an indian temple that Krishna doesn't exist in front of all their worshippers. You will get arrested for religious harassment. The way you speak is really offensive to those with religious beliefs. You say that by common sense, there is no god. So you are saying more then half of the people in Singapore have NO COMMON SENSE?

              <p>what benefit? oh, ok lor, then chrisitian say freely you give you receive. lan chiao, the pastor openly ask for money in faith but where is the same faith openly tell the congregation "who is poor here and needs money?!!</p>
              <p>Already the con is in the church. let alone the internet. I havent warm up and tell about the specials clubs controlling the christian network. Ya, your pastor always disappear to other country from time to time, meeting here and there. I wonder who they really meet. Because they rather spend time meeting than spend actual time teaching the bible verse for verse to new converts. </p>
              <p>thats why ppll like you end up talking cock the minute some one like me tell you otherwise about the new testament. Its called knee jerkers yur pastor has programmed you to retort even before they lay foundation of the old testament.</p>
              <p>being comprehensively conned is never an easy revelation. you dont have to feel embarrassed. A lot of money was involved.''</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Really? There are con websites? Why not show it to everyone here as proof? After all didn't you already proof that Jesus was not the messiah? Isn't it? Proof it now, go, run and find it like a dog looking for his bone.</p>

              <p>''For it is proven there is no god:</p>
              <p>God does not exist in any physical place.</p>
              <p>God does not have any physical characteristics''</p>
              <p>Really? So you are saying Isaac Newton is one of those idiots who think there is a god up there? So idiotic that he went to the extent of finding how and when the world will end as stated in the christian bible? And Thomas Edison too? REALLY? WOW. I am amazed. Seriously. This is a GOD TOPIC. The base of this topic is God's existence. Stop harassing those christians, respect what they believe in. I dare you to say in front of an indian temple that Krishna doesn't exist in front of all their worshippers. You will get arrested for religious harassment. The way you speak is really offensive to those with religious beliefs. You say that by common sense, there is no god. So you are saying more then half of the people in Singapore have NO COMMON SENSE? That is also slandery.</p>
