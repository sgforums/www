              <p>When your heart stops to beat, you are dead....</p>
              <p>You will find yourself floating above your own body. You see the doctors trying to revive you.  You see your loved ones crying. You see your own body.  But strangely, you feel that the body is not "Yourself" anymore......that's because you are now a spirit.......</p>
              <p>After a while you will find yourself falling into a dark tunnel....there you hear screams, you see spirits in the form of imps, animal head spirits....you know you are farked, because you are going to hell, a place of darkness....where there is no love, only hate and regret,  next to flames from a sea of fire......yes... you are farked forever....</p>
              <p>Scenario 2:</p>
              <p>But if the tunnel is pleasant, you will soon find yourself in a beautiful garden where everything is so beautiful. You may meet a loved one who had died previously, asking you about those still alive, and how they are faring....</p>
              <p>Suddenly you see a being of Light, very bright in appearance. You feel you are so unworthy to be with this Light, yet the Light is so loving and kind, and so accepting. You see your life pass before your very eyes, as the Light asks you " What did you do with your life?" Even as you try to answer, you feel the love of the Light, and you realise that there isn't much to say, because the Light already knows, and He accepts you and loves you, in spite of all your shortcomings....</p>
              <p>Soon, the Light and your love ones accompany you on your journey towards a new dimension of existance.....</p>
              <p>Conclusion:</p>
              <p>To me the Person of Light is Jesus Christ. And just in case you find yourself in the dark place, I hope you have one last chance to call for help. "Jesus please save me!".....but I really hope it would not be too late, because there are stubborn people who will not ask for help either in this life or the next......</p>
              <p>Just wondering if you are "hardcore stubborn till the end".....are you?</p>

              I saw the dead in the kingdom of death or sheol or hades. I wonder when will they be raised back to life? I wonder how many fall into sheol and for how long? They neither suffer or in joy. They are in death deprived of life. They don't even know where they are...they don't feel anything and they don't  remember anything. They are not able to register the passage of time at all which is a very good thing if they have to stay there for awhile!
