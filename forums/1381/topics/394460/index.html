              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Ah Soh knew in his heart that his birthday was important. He would be 50 years old. His friend came into his tiny one room flat. Ah Soh was not the kind of person to host a party. He did not have the money!</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">For him, whatever little money he earned as a coffee shop assistant was just enough to make end meets. On some of the occassions, he could not even meet his end meets. On such occassions, he needed to seek financial and material help from his church. Fortunately for him, his church members were still quite ready to help Ah Soh tide through his difficult moments.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Ah Soh wanted to be a pastor. He wanted to preach for Jesus so much, so much. But he was not born during biblical times. In those days, anyone could be a pastor. Peter and most of Jesus' disciples were uneducated people!</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">In Singapore, a person needed to attend a bible college to be able to preach, officially. Ah Soh could not be a pastor. He was not smart in his studies. He failed his PSLE. Going to a bible college was an impossible dream for him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Still, Ah Soh wanted to tell his friends about Jesus. All his uneducated friends. All of them who spoke Hokkien like him. All of them who could not speak proper english. So he saved up his money, little by little. He cut down on his food. He wore the same clothe, year after year, without buying new ones. He walked to his church instead of taking buses. He tried his best to cut down on his transport cost.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Finally, he had just enough money to host a birthday party. And that was what he did.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"Ah Soh, happy birthday!" His friends greeted him one by one. When all of his friends were in his house and they were done with eating, Ah Soh got them to sit in a circle. He spoke about Jesus passionately to his friends. He spoke on and on, ignoring the occassional mockeries that came from his unbelieving friends.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">His friends left his home, seemingly unchanged and unmoved. But in Jesus' eyes, unknowingly to Ah Soh or the church in Singapore, Jesus saw a pastor. This pastor was uneducated. This pastor could only speak in Hokkien. This pastor did not win a single soul. This pastor preached only 1 sermon during his entire life for Jesus.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Still, in Jesus' eyes, he saw and smiled at pastor Soh.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">P/S: Feel free to share this story with anyone so long as you glorify God in your sharing of this story.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">It had been a long while since I last wrote a christian short story. This was due sadly to me falling away from God for a period of time. However, I am back with God, again. Check up my christian short stories blog at <a href="http://www.singaporechristianfiction.blogspot.com">http://www.singaporechristianfiction.blogspot.com</a>.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I give thanks to the God who is the inspiration behind all my stories.</span></p>

              <p>This story is actually meant for christians.</p>
              <p>It is meant for christians who do their best to serve God in love of God, and how even though no one notices what these christians did, God in heaven sees their acts and commend them.</p>
              <p>It is a story to tell all christians that no matter how small a thing they may be doing, their small acts of kindness does not go un-noticed in the eyes of a loving God.</p>
