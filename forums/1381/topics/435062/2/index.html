              <p>The reason we pray to Kwan Yin is not becasue she is a transexual or a prostitute. But to the fact that she had achieve Enlightenment and Nirvana despite of what she was.</p>
              <p>Buddist pray to those for what they had achieved and not for who or what they were.</p>
              <p>Therefore a man-whore who had achieved Enlightenment and Nirvana will still receive Buddist praying while an ignorant man-whore will become a condamned thing know as divingutd.</p>

              <p>I'm a Buddhist here. I think troll such as divingutd is here to sow discord between Christians and Buddhists. So, can any Christians here just ignore the troll crap he is talking about?  He obviously loves to flame bait topics. May we practise tolerance and respect towards each other's religion.</p>
              <p>I'm glad many Christians adhere to the teaching of Jesus and God and refrain from attacking other religions.</p>
              <p>Here are some explanations:</p>
              <p>Guanyin is not a god. He is originally a "he" in India, but in China, has been made into a "she" to complement the image of a woman of compassion. This is so that she can be closer to the public, just like the image of a mother. Guanyin is known in Buddhism as a "bodhisattva", which literally means "enlightenment existence". In another word, Bodhisattva are Buddha's disciples and their role in the world is to save sentient beings. Guanyin for instance represents compassion and loving-kindness.</p>
              <p>Unlike Christianity's central bible teaching on almighty God, Buddhism's central thoughts are focused on Buddha (which is known as the Enlightened one). Below it, you have Bodhisattva and Arhats, who are Buddha's disciples. They are somewhat like the Angels in Christianity.</p>
              <p>I hope my post can clarify the doubt and make sure that Christians and Buddhists can respect each other's religion, and avoid harsh or vulgar words.</p>
              <p>In fact, I wonder if divingutd is a Christian himself. He is spreading hatred around.. this is not good. May he repent for his wrong-doings and vowed never to spread hatred around.</p>

Her appearance are there only for one to 'see' (largely because many people are blinded by ignorance and cannot see Buddhism's teaching), so the sangha community made it into a figure for one to "worship" and revere, but the spiritual essence of Guanyin lies in her compassion.</p></div>
