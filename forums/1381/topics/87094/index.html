            <div class='col-md body'>I still believe that people with illness can get healing in this day and age but it's all up to God who is Souvereign.  Do note that it is 100% healing and not today well, tomorrow sick again.<br>Saying this, i can understand how people feel when their loved ones are terminally ill, or suddently struck down with critically ill situations (cos i work with people in these situations).  They would put all their hopes on these miracle healers.  In the end if their love one dies, all they get in respond from the miracle healers will be "you don't have enough faith"<br><br>I've included an article written from my pastor on this issue for sharing purpose.<br><br>Apologize if it is a bit lengthy.<br><br>Miracle Healing Ministry Examined<br>Rev. Prabhudas Koshy<br><br>Sickness has long been a disturbing and difficult problem to every man. It is only natural that we desire and search for cures. When normal methods of cure do not bring quick relief or bring no relief at all, Christians pray and hope for God's miraculous healing. The Bible does not prohibit us from praying for God's mercy and healing to come upon a sick person. In fact, we are encouraged to pray for the healing of brethren who have fallen ill. "Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him" (James 5:14,15). The search for healing and the desire to pray for healing were indeed the experience of the early church.<br><br>We also know that the Apostle Paul besought the Lord thrice, that the thorn in the flesh, which he had been afflicted with, might depart from him (Cf. 2 Corinthians 12:7-<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. However, the Lord did not remove it, but granted him His "sufficient grace" to bear it and continue with his ministry (Cf. 2 Corinthians 12: 9). From this instance and other such events in the Scriptures, we can correctly conclude that though we are encouraged to pray for healing of the sick, we must pray with a readiness to submit to God's will even if it means to continue to be sick.<br><br>However, we have been hearing and seeing many "miracle workers" or "faith healers" going about claiming that they are gifted to heal. They hold miracle services, claiming that they can heal the sick. In their meetings they command the sick to be healed in Jesus' name, but many people are not healed at all. Many of their claims are proven to be false. Many, who claimed to be healed from certain sicknesses, later, were found to be suffering from the same sicknesses, or died because of the same sickness.<br><br>Some, in the present day, have desired and even claimed to duplicate the experience of the early church as recorded in the New Testament. The New Testament records abound with miraculous events, not the least of which are the miraculous healings of people who were diseased.<br><br>The following observations on healing incidents in the Bible will show how the modern miracle healings do not follow the biblical pattern; and thus proving to us that these are spiritually dangerous phenomena, which we should not seek after.<br><br>1. The healings were instantaneous. Further treatment was not necessary (Acts 3:1-11).<br><br>2. The healings were complete. Those who were healed could immediately resume their normal activities unhindered by the sickness in any way (Acts 9:32-34).<br><br>3. The healings were permanent. This is not to say that the ones healed were never sick again, but it is to say that the next day when the "healer" was gone, the sickness was not returned (Acts 4:22).<br><br>4. Those with the gift of healings had the ability to heal organic illnesses as well. They did not heal mere psychosomatic illness (Acts 3:1-11; 5:14-16).<br><br>5. Those with the gift of healings were not selective in whom they would heal. They could heal anyone (Acts 5:14-16; 28:8-9).<br><br>6. Those with the gift of healings could heal at will. There were no conditions placed on the ones being healed (Acts 3:1-11). The same was true of other miracles (Acts 13:11-12).<br><br>7. Faith on the part of the one healed was not a requirement or condition. Faith was often rewarded, but it was never stated to be a condition of a person's healing, nor was it ever used as an excuse for a failed attempt to heal (Acts 3:1-11; 9:40).<br><br>8. The attempts at healing were always successful. (The only exception to this is the one occasion recorded in Matthew 17:20 when the disciples lacked faith.)<br><br>9. The healings were usually performed for unbelievers (Acts 3:1-11; 5:14-16).<br><br>10. The healings were usually unsolicited (Acts 3:1-11).<br><br>11. The healings were secondary to preaching (Luke 9:6). This is also seen in Acts 20:17-38 where Paul reviews his ministry in Ephesus and makes no mention of his great miracles performed there (cf. 19:11-12), only his faithfulness in ministering the Word. No man was ever given a "healing ministry."<br><br>12. Those with the gift of healings could also raise the dead upon request (Acts 9:40).<br><br>13. Although the healings were not at all hidden, they were generally performed in relative privacy and never in a public healing service. "Healing services" were never a part of the early church (Acts 3:1-11).<br><br>14. Miracles and healings were performed by the apostles and their close associates. Philip and Stephen were the only non-apostolic healers, however, they were close associates of the apostolic band.<br><br>15. The healings were never performed by a supposed "slaying in the Spirit" or the like.<br><br>16. The healings were performed free of any financial charge. Neither were any souvenirs sold or offerings taken.<br><br>17. The healings and miracles could not be denied. They were indisputable feats of power (Acts 4:14-17).<br><br>18. The powers associated with the gifts of miracles and healings did not extend beyond healing, casting out demons, and raising the dead. These powers did not include the ability to perform tricks, heal animals or raise them from the dead, or the like.<br><br>19. Healings were performed in various ways: by touching (Acts 3:6, 7); usually without physical contact of any kind (Acts 5:14-16; 9:32-34); by speaking (Acts 14:10); with the use of handkerchiefs and aprons (Acts 19:11-12); with prayer (Acts 9:38-41; 28:8-9); usually without prayer (Acts 3:1-11); and sometimes even in absence (Acts 19:11-12).<br><br>20. Healings were described as the sign gifts of the apostles. In other words, they were unique to the apostles and their time (2 Corinthians 12:12; Romans 15:19). The writer of the book of Hebrews, writing as a second generation Christian, speaks of the miraculous gifts, which God gave to the apostles as a sign of confirmation of the Word of God which they revealed, in the past tense (Hebrews 2:3-4).<br><br>These observations are most revealing, especially in comparison with present-day claims to the gift. If there are similarities, they fade quickly in comparison with differences which are much greater and more obvious. The gift of miracles, enjoyed by the early church at the hands of the apostolic company, appears to have been a unique experience which served its purpose and then faded away.<br><br>The history of the church after the Apostolic era also shows that miraculous healing did not continue as an individual gift. This is not to say there were no miraculous healing at all. We believe that God is still able to heal the sick miraculously, according to His will. So we should pray for the sick. Nonetheless, in the light of the above observations of Scriptural data on healing, claims by people that they are specially gifted, like the Apostles, to heal miraculously, must be rejected as unbiblical as they do not match up to the pattern and doctrine of the Apostles.<br><br>(Scriptural data on healing is adapted with some editing from Fred G. Zaspel's article, "The Gifts of Miracles and Healings today?" )<br><br></div>
