              <p>i think he's trying to point out that most of us, while living, take our eternal future for granted. because we're young, death seems so far away, and we are preoccupied with  what's before us.</p>
              <p>but until we get a rude awakening, when someone close to us dies, we remember that we are all on the journey which ends with death. some sooner, some later, and suddenly, everything that we have been pursuing, been doing, seems so insignificant.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">basically, the question is: are we ready for whatever is beyond when our time is up? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">how do you want to feel, when you're moments away from death?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">who do you want to be surrounded with?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> what do you want to be remembered for?</span></p>
              <p>yes, i saw a relative died.</p>

              <p>Thank you for reading. Be blessed.</p>
              <p>Though I believe many people still descend to the world of the dead that Jesus referred as the kingdom of death I strongly believe that God does raise some people immediately after his or her death. The 12 apostles are not counted among the dead in my conviction as well as the Lady Mary. BE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR LIFE. Do not take life for granted.</p>

              <p>Actually putting faith in God is also about life as much as it is about the afterlife.</p>
              <p>God values our life and is interested in our life here in the world just as much He wants us to be saved in the end i.e to be raised to life. Either immediately, early or in the last day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only a thing that never has been alive that will not fear the power of death. Becoming a permanent resident of the kingdom of death is not anybody's dream though anyone who is in the kingdom of death can have the peace of rest. Death is no life without being raised! That's why we need Jesus. That's why Jesus is the Messiah because Jesus conquered death and is not counted among the dead. I'm very very sure that nobody ever can conquer death and its imprisonment without God's help.</p>

              <p>The fear for death is the ultmimate fear I think.  To a lesser extend we fear darkness, we fear the unknown.  Surely one can argue that believing in a God will overcome death.  If that in fact is to rid of the fear, than is not the right reason to believe in a god.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If there is God, and if we are indeed His creation, who are we to stay away, to reject Him, and not to believe in Him?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So to me, I have no choice but to proclaim Him as my God.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do I fear death therefore?  In all human emotion yes I do. </p>

              <p>It's perfectly humane Michael to fear death. I do too. Not that I fear hell so much but now that I know what death is I fear that God may not raise me immediately.</p>
              <p>The one thing that I want from God eeerr is actually eternal power hahaha I know I'm so out of my league but even a fool is allowed to dream. I mean if he could succeed I could aswell as he was a living person much like we are now yet now he's not counted among the dead and now holds a great power(authority). However I do trust in God's judgment so let those who deserve, have a share in the cake of power that God is giving away for free and for eternity. </p>
              <p>The second thing I desperately wish is to be raised immediately. I do not want to spend 'eternity' in the kingdom of death. I don't care if God promised that the dead shall have rest because now that I know what kind of rest that is I certainly hope I do not have to wait for long before being raised back to life. Not that I would be aware of the passage of time while I'm dead but I suppose 3 days of the living or a maximum of a year would be nice or even a 100 years in death is not that bad as long as I do not have to wait till the end.</p>
              <p>It's perfectly humane to fear death imo. I know it not as an unknown or I believe I know it not as an unknwon yet I still fear it though to a lesser degree.</p>
              <p>The important thing in life is to get ourselves saved by being God's people and by doing good. I know that it's not our work that determines our salvation but it is our work(life) which confirm our faith in our God, the ruler and creator of realms, the Lord of spirits and the flesh. And that everytime I fell down in sin I remember that I still have hope in my savior Jesus Christ. On the verge of death i shall call out to my great lawyer the Holy One from God. Get your ass right here ASAP and don't let me descend if that is possible at all. lol</p>
