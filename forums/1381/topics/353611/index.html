            <div class='col-md body'><p>This will give you the chills........<br>GOOD chills.<br><br><br> A young man had been to Wednesday Night Bible<br> Study.<br><br><br><br> T he Pastor had shared about listening to God and obeying the Lord's voice<br><br><br><br> The young man couldn't help but wonder, 'Does God still speak to people?'<br><br><br><br> After service, he went out with some friends for coffee and pie and they discussed the message.<br> Several different ones talked about how God had led them in different ways.<br><br><br><br> It was about ten o'clock when the young man started<br> driving home. Sitting in his car, he just began to pray, 'God...If you still speak t o people, speak to me. I will listen. I will do my best to obey.'<br><br><br><br> As he drove down the main street of his town, he had the strangest thought to stop and buy a gallon of milk.<br><br> He shook his head and said out loud, 'God is that you?' He didn't get a reply and started on toward home.<br><br> But again, the thought, buy a gallon of milk.<br><br><br><br> The young man thought about Samuel and how he didn't recognize the voice of God, and how little Samuel ran to Eli.<br><br><br> 'Okay, God, in case that is you, I will buy the milk.' It didn't seem like too hard a test of obedience. He could always use the milk. He stopped and purchased the gallon of milk and started off toward home.<br><br><br> As he passed Seventh Street, he again felt the urge, 'Turn Down that street.'<br><br><br><br> This is crazy he thought, and drove on past the intersection.<br><br><br><br> Again, he felt that he should turn down Seventh Street .<br><br><br><br> At the next inters ection, he turned back and headed down Seventh.<br><br><br><br> Half jokingly, he said out loud,<br><br><br><br> 'Okay, God, I will.'<br><br><br><br><br> He drove several blocks, when suddenly, he felt like he should stop He pulled over to the curb and looked around. He was in a semi- commercial area of town. It wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst of neighborhoods either.<br> The businesses were closed and most of the houses looked dark like the people were already in bed.<br><br><br> Again, he sensed something, 'Go and give t he milk to the people in the house across the street.' The young man looked at the house. It was dark and it looked like the people were either gone or they were already asleep. He started to open the door and then sat back in the car seat.<br><br><br> 'Lord, this is insane. Those people are asleep and if I wake them up, they are going<br> to be mad and I will look stupid.' Again, he felt like he should go and give the milk.<br><br><br> Finally, he opened the door, 'Okay God, if this is you, I will go to the door and I will give them the milk. If you want me to look like a crazy person, okay. I want to b e obedient. I guess that will count for some thing, but if they don't answer right away, I am out of here.'<br><br><br> He walked across the street and rang the bell. He could hear some noise inside. A man's voice yelled<br> out, 'Who is it? What do you want?' Then the door opened before the young man could get away.<br><br><br> The man was standing there in his jeans and T-shirt. H e looked like he just got out of bed. He had a strange look on his face and he didn't seem too happy to have some stranger standing on his doorstep. 'What is it?'<br><br><br> The young man thrust out the gallon of milk, 'Here, I brought this to you.' The man took the milk and rushed down a hallway.<br><br><br> Then from down the hall came a woman carrying the milk toward the kitchen. The man was following her holding a baby. The baby was crying. The man had tears streaming down his face.<br><br><br> The man began speaking and half crying, 'We were just praying. We had<br> some big bills this month and we ran out of money. We didn't have any milk for our baby. I was just praying and asking God to show me how to get some milk.'<br><br><br> His wife in the kitchen yelled out, 'I ask him to send an Angel with some. Are you an Angel?'<br><br><br> The young man reached into his wallet and pulled out all the money he had on him and put in the man's hand. He turned and walked back toward his car and the tears were streaming down his face.<br> He knew that God still answers prayers. <br><br> THIS IS A SIMPLE TEST.... If you believe that God is alive and well, send this to at least ten people and the person that sent it to you!!!!!!!!<br> This is so true. Sometimes it's the simplest things that God asks us to do that cause us, if we are obedient to what He's asking, to be able to hear His voice more clear than ever. Please listen, and obey ! It will bless you (and the world).. Phil 4:13<br> This is an easy test - you score 100 or zero. It's your choice. <br><br> I f you aren't ashamed to do this, please follow the directions. Jesus said, 'If you are ashamed of me, I will be ashamed of you before my Father.' <br><br> Not ashamed...Pass this on.</p></div>

              <p>It very well indeed may have had happened</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In some people God speaks through a gentle voice.</p>
              <p>In some people God speaks through unexplainable urge to do something or to say something</p>
              <p>In some people God speaks through seemingly random invading thoughts</p>
              <p>In some people God speaks through unexplainable knowledge</p>
              <p>In some people God speaks through a dream which is not a mere dream</p>
              <p>In some people God speaks through letting know the hearts of other people</p>
              <p>In some people God may speak through the combination of the above various ways conveying message be it about  a past event, current or foreknowledge of things to come.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No these people are not psychic or possessing esp like some non theist believe them to be. Perhaps the more accurate words are they are connected to the spiritual world through their faith and through God favor and blessing.</p>
              <p>God is actually scary...for He lives among His people. Immanuel. The God who is with us and in each of us.</p>
