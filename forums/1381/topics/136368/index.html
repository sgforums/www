            <div class='col-md body'>hope im not offending anyone by posting here.. but somethings i really i wish to discuss.. it took me a long struggle to decide to post this cos i too have a lot of christian frens.. i really afraid someone might get offended by my post.. but i really have doubts..<br><br>it is something regarding a city harvest service months ago..<br><br>i was invited by my fren to a city harvest service few months ago.. it was held at indoor stadium because they had invited an oversea pastor.. (forgotten the name le.. but according to what they say.. he is very famous and had been going all over the world.. i think he is call pastor heen or sth.. )<br><br>these are the things that he actually said.. every word came from his month..<br><br>he mentioned that a town near egypt, before the town was taken over by the egyptian, these ppl believed in jesus, and they never got sick until egypt took over the town..<br><br>he too mentioned he once saved a long-term wheel-chaired lady to be able to walk again by just saying that he will give miracle in the name of god.<br><br>at the later part.. he demostrated something that is call "miracle". the pastor asked wheel-chaired patients.. bed-widden patients, patients with uncurable diseases like cancer.. to come onto the stage..<br><br>he actually said this to the patient " by the name of lord jesus, i give u miracle". then these patients either they would claimed they felt better, or the person will walk again etc.. at the end of it.. he even demostrated the "great miracle".<br><br>i din see the "great miracle". cos i really feel very unpleasant.<br><br>my fren believed in this.. and he hoped i would believe too.. but the fact im really disturbed..  i have a family of only i being the healthier one, the rest are all haunt by illness.<br><br>i do see ppl actually believing this, crying, shedding tears when they see this scene..<br><br>i really want to ask the christians ppl in this forum, how many of u will actually believe so when u see this??<br><br>i still insist im not trying to offend anyone by asking this questions, but i really wanna know.. best if there are ppl from city harvest who witness this too to give a pov<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can tell u frankly on the things u saw about people able to walk just by hearing the "word". They r bullsh!t. If they are't bullsh!t, why do they ask people to give money and donate to the deaf people which is one of its charity site. If they r so good, there wouldn't be dead/sick people in City harvest as well. Why doesn't tat happen ? Why doesn't there any scientific studies tat show "miracles" ? If there is really "miracle healing, where real physical change can be detected such as bone suddenly sprang up in size or muscle suddenly becoming stronger, fracture suddenly vanishes or cancer tumors really dissappeared then surely medically speaking it can be recorded. However these people never do these tests and the real scientist never bother asking. Trust me anyone who make a scientific test and recorded properly these phenomenon, if they r true, can become as famous as einstein if they found the route to permanent cure of disabilities and win a nobel price for proving god exists. Why do u think all these never happen ?</div>

Why doesn't very pious people such as church leaders from other denomination don't know how to heal as well ?
