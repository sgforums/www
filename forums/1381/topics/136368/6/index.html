So if you are faithful, you will do good naturally.<br><br>So even if an ideal Christian do good, he doesn't mind if he will be blessed because of it anot. (He already is blessed.) He just do good, for the sake of doing good and not because he can go to heaven or people will praise him you know. The intentions of doing good is technically pure.<br><br>So it is promoting good, and also the pureness of intentions. But thats the ideal situation la. Some Christian missionaries and preachers, just wanna do good so that people will convert to Christianity. Thats how to goes lor, but noone is perfect la. So.. understandable.<br><br>But if you are a Christian, try la. Do good, don't expect any sort of return, heck, don't even expect a simple thank you. Thats the spirit.</div>
