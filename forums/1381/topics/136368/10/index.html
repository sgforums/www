            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by k4korny:</div><div class="quote_body">but that's not the point.<br><br>the point is that you can be a believer in the Christian faith but does evil.. everytime i do something evil, I will think that "hey, I'm weak and have succumb to the work of the devil. I will go to church this weekend and God will forgive me for cutting the head off a stray dog which was minding its own business."<br><br>Doesn't it sound strange to you that an Almighty God will "reward" someone like him, and banish, say a Nobel Peace Prize winner, to hell cos he's a Buddhist?<br><br>I'm not asking for quotes from the bible, but am appealing to your common logic. Doesn't this argument sounds flawed?<br><br>If this is the case, then how does the Christian teaching actually motivates its believer to do good?<br></div></blockquote>den that is not a true believer. its called "cheap grace". and no.. but i wish i can quote from the Bible on the fly though, but i can't.<br><br>so it boils down to God's secret formulae to determine if a person is true or not .. other den dat, i've no ideas and wun try to push it to make myself sound holy.<br><br>personally, im sure those who enter heaven, are good nuff. basically, if you believe in the Lord, you will go about having "Biblical moral values", and should not be weak towards sin. those dat u mention is what it says "abuse of grace".<br><br>so.. ill juz type down this set of daily devotion journal thingie dat i got from my church.<br><br><blockquote>Twntieth century theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer coined the term "cheap grace" as a way of summerizing grace abuse. Living in Nazi Germany, he was appalled by the cowardly way in which Christians were responding to Hitler's threat. Lutheran pastors preached grace from the pulpit on Sundays, then kept quiet the rest of the week as the Nazis pursued their policies of racism, euthanasia and finally genocide. Bonhoeffer's book, The Cost of Discipleship, highlights the many New Testament passages commanding Christians to attain holiness. Every call to conversion, he insists, includes a call to discipleship, to Christlikeness.<br><br>God's grace can be "abused" when we do not understand what it is and its purpose in our lives. So let's understand what is true grace:<br><br>1. Gace empowers you to live in God's righteousness. It is God's grace that enables us to live in his Righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ. The Bible says we are saved by grace through faith (Eph. 2:3) Romans 5:17 adds, "For if by the one man's offense death reigned through the one, much more those receive abundance of grace and of th gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ."<br><br>2. Grace empowers you to work hard. Paul says, "But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me" (1 Cor 15:10)<br><br>3. Grace empowers you to serve God (1 Pet. 4:10).<br><br>The grace of God doesn't make you passive, complacent, lazy or apathetic. On the contrary, grace teaches you to do what is right adbear the fruit of it. True grace is the power of God that enables yout to live a life that fullfills God's purpose.<br></blockquote>well.. this is the official stance on the "True Grace of God" for City Harvest.<br><br>and yes, this weakness is found in everyone who wants the easy way out. including me. strange it may be, but a theologian, or any Christian could argue by saying ".. God's ways are higher than man's way, thus its up to him."<br><br>its a faith right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
