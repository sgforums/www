            <div class='col-md body'>Hi shade343,<br><br>yes I believe everything the bible says, otherwise I would not be a believer right?<br><br>They have done studies on the bible, and there are something like 2500 prophecies in the bible of which 2000 have already been fulfilled to the letter... scientists say that 10 to the power of 8 is an impossibility but when the researchers did the calculations for 2000 prophecies to be fulfilled they came up with 10 to the power of 50, with another 500 to go... still unfulfilled. How can you not say that the bible is false? Of every problem or event that will occur in life, the bible says that there is nothing new under the sun. Everything has been done already.<br><br>I believe what the bible says also because I see it happening in my own life. I know a God that loves me so much and cares for me so much that He sent His only son to die for me... so that I would be in Heaven. I am not saying this to "judge" other religions, I am just sharing how much it means to me to know that God (who seems so uncaring to most people out there) actually does care and does love us... if not for Gods hand on Singapore, we would have suffered the effects of the Tusnami as well.<br><br>As I know more of God, He reveals more of Himself to me, and His heart. IT cries for all of mankind... He does not bring disaster upon us, only the devil does.<br><br>The bible is the LIVING word of God and it is definitely living for me. I am passionate about God because I know hell to be real and I am fighting for every soul, I don't want anyone to end up there...we only have our time now...I know that for a fact and Jesus is coming again very soon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In exchange for our trust in Him, Christ does many things for us that religion cannot do. For example:<br><br>He loves us (John 15:13; Rom. 8:35).<br>He brings us to God (1 Tim. 2:5).<br>He brings God to us (Col. 1:15).<br>He bought us for God (Eph. 1:7).<br>He defends us before God (1 John 2:1).<br>He declares us "not guilty" (Rom. 3:24; 5:1).<br>He reconciles us to God (2 Cor. 5:19).<br>He sets us apart for God (1 Cor. 1:30).<br>He gives us peace with God (Rom. 5:1).<br>He makes us acceptable to God (Eph. 1:6).<br>He forgives us (Eph. 1:7).<br>He frees us from bondage (Rom. 8;2).<br>He qualifies us for adoption (Eph. 1:5).<br>He makes us heirs of God (Eph. 1:11).<br>He gives us His Spirit (John 14:16-17).<br>He gives us a new focus (Col. 3:1-2).<br>He lives within us (Col. 1:27).<br>He brings us into God's family (John 1:12).<br>He intercedes for us (Rom. 8:34).<br>He rescues us from Satan's power (Col. 1:13).<br>He places us into God's kingdom (Col. 1:13).<br>He gives us eternal life (Rom. 6:23).<br>He shows us how to live (1 John 2:6).</div>
