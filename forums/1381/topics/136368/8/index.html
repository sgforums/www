These negative karma is generated because man is arrogant, egoistic and proud. The only way karmic debt can be cleared is through suffering. So the reason why you suffer now is because of karmic debt. Jesus suffered so he could help us clear our karmic debt. But he cannot clear ALL our karmic debt, if he did it, I would have been in heaven by now.</div></blockquote>Sin, from Biblical viewpoint is not what you described. Seriously, where does it say all those?<br><br>Sin was first introduced from the temptation of Adam by Lucifer, and it passes down generations after generations.<br><br>Jesus died to pay for all the sins of mankind, but does not prevent the inherent source of sin within man, so that part is correct.<br><br>When a person believes in God, and give their all to God - he will accept suffering and do good as a natural function, like breathing. But not, as a means of salvation.<br><br>If I can remove my karmic debt of the murder of one person, by rescueing two people, than I can simply go out kill one person, and rescue two and all will be forgotten. So this paradox still exists in so called grace by works.<br><br>I don't know if you understand the meaning of "doing good as a natural function". That means, doing good if there is no salvation (since a faithful believer has already attained salvation), doing good if there is no repayment, doing good even if you won't be thanked for, doing good for others and not for yourself.<br><br>This is the tough part, people usually do good works so they themselves can get saved in the afterlife. But if you are assured of a pernament place in heaven, would you want to continue to do good for mankind and continue to suffer?</div>

The bible is the word of God, so if you believe in God, then why not the bible?<br><br>trusting that you can be saved by your own works is true arrogance, to think that you are so good that you can make it. Look at it this way... there is no difference between big sin and small sin... sin is sin and do you think that anyone can lead a totally sin free life? Because the moment you lose your cool, you are sinning... when you gossip and talk badly about someone, you are sinning... if you tell a white lie, you sin... so that is why i cling to the cross and Jesus because i know then that God does not impute sin to me. I am cleansed by the blood of the lamb and I am the righteousness of God in Christ.<br><br>Lets test your theory of reincarnation... if that holds true, then the world should be getting better all the time right? The basis for reincarnation being that you are coming back to do better to reach the next level and finally nivarna... ie Heaven... But the exact opposite is occuring...the world is getting crueller, meaner... more wars, man becomes more depraved... how then do you people who believe in reincarnation justify this? therefore I can say that this does not work... and where exactly in the bible is reincarnation mentioned? Exact verse and book of the bible please... please do not talk about what you do not know.</div>

GOD never told anyone to go to war except to the isrealites when they conquered the promise land... even in the time of the crusades and the spanish inquisition... all driven by mans evil desire, God had nothing to do with it. Nowhere did Jesus ever mention going to war... in fact He said in Romans 12:18<br>If it is possible, as much as depends on you, live peaceably with all men.<br></div>

They always think that theirs is better and their religion is the only way to god.<br><br>Let me give you another illustration. How do you reach Suntec City?<br><br>You can reach there by either car, bus 518, Take MRT to City Hall or walk there. There are many ways to reach there. Just pick the one which you prefer. There is no such thing as there is only 1 way.<br><br>Same thing applies to God as well.<br></div></blockquote>No, its not arrogance. Its something they believe in with absolute faith. Not that I have that abolute faith thing, but many does.<br><br>Its not better, its true and untrue. How do you reach the Moon? Space shutter right, I don't think there is bus 512 or MRT or other ways. Same thing applies to the Christian God as well.<br><br>As for why Christian thinks that some other religions are inferior, you have to understand - rather than calling them arrogant fools all the time, try to see from their viewpoint - when Lucifer have influence over the world as we know it, he started doing copies of religious and miracles to make people believe that he is god and there are other means of salvation - like.. him!<br><br>Evil spirits, often seem to do good so that people will be awed by their mercy and grace and worship them. Problem is, their intentions were not good, and after gaining their trust, they were used to eliminate the true Church.<br><br>These other deities, to Christian faith, are demons, spirits and angels worshipping but not God Himself. They also offer powers to their believers, in forms of spells and witchcrafts (which is more like elimination of pagan religion  by the Church).<br><br>That is why the only way, is through Jesus and Jesus alone - unless you are considering Judaism, or Islam.<br><br>The problem with believers for all religions are their ignorance of other religions and the fact that these must be taken and treated individually and uniquely - even they may be interwined culturally. This is the part where I will fight for, because I truely believe in it.<br><br>Arrogance is when some bastard, thinks he is better and literally treats you like Shit. Humility is when the same bastard thinks he is better, but still treats you like a friend. And to Christians, a good friend would want his friends to end up in Heaven - and thus saving your friends became the main Church policy and ended up as a gesture of being a Christian.<br><br>But the essential part is that la. Even if we have some siao gin nah running around forcing people to Church.<br><br>But I'm not really a good friend so, I don't care. And I don't like to force ppl go leh.

If you want to blame anyone for sin and suffering, then blame Satan or the devil, its his fault! Put the blame where the blame should be.</div>
