Its because of the law of karma. God puts you where you deserve to be. God decides how much suffering you deserve. The point of reincarnation is for people with karmic baggage to suffer. Life is Suffering. You suffer because of your karmic baggage.<br><br>When I say that the bible is inaccurate, Im saying that the content may have been altered or changed over the ages. Im not saying that you should dump your bible. But the bible is only a guide. A guide to teach you how to do good and be good. When reading the bible, you should use your eyes and your brains to find out what is really required of yourself to make GOD happy.<br><br></div></blockquote>hey hey i suddenly imagine wad my pastor would reply. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>he would say...<br><br>den you are a moral man, not a Godly man! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>no serious, he will definitely say dat. by faith, and complicated chemical math calculations in my head.<br><br>for me, ya, life is suffering, bible contents might be different from the original depending on versions and translation.<br><br>but there are many words that remained constant, and one of them refer to reaching God through Jesus and Jesus alone. many things didn't change. really.<br><br>thats why its incorrect to force the idea of reincarnation (actually, u were refering to regeneration, not reincarnation, different things) and the idea of going through other mediums to reach God, to Christians.<br><br>not to partake in Holy Communion is one thing, but advocating a Christian to worship to Buddha as though he is Christ is another thing altogether.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i dont believe in miracle healing either. there's so many ppl dying everyday... ask that pastor to perform miracles in hospitals, clinics lar. i see what he can do. haha. there'll be no more deaths, no more tormenting sicknesses...<br><br>hey, i think every medical students can stop their studies. what for study for so many years? the pastor dont even need to be a doctor to perform his so called miracles. he just need to book the indoor stadium and start curing anyone. not enough padang, kallang stadium also can. ask him to teach more ppl to perform hor. all over the world will have such "pastors"... let us see them defying God's plan? some ppl are fated to die on that day and WOW, they didnt die ar after those "miracles"..<br><br>yeah, but i believe that faith sometimes can cure emotional hurts. Praying to God, let Him know ur feelings, and some time u'll surely get over it.<br><br>Hebrews 13:5<br><br>I will never leave you, nor forsake you.<br><br>Jesus heals, but i dont think just anyone can perform miracles just like that. don't forget that are human beings themselves. dont tell me they dont get sick? their house dont even need medicines then...<br><br>City harvest is quite a charismatic type of church, i wouldnt really want to go there. i'll feel quite out of place.</div>
