            <div class='col-md body'>The original religion in Christianity is Catholicism. The Vatican is Catholic. Worshipping God should be fun? yes why not? but not in the chc sense. Just imagine the pope preaching like pastor kong and his altar boys dancing and singing like pop stars on stage.<br><br>I have been to chc three times. What i don't like:<br><br>1) people speaking in tongues. speaking in tongue has to be spontaneous and in a language of its own, not everybody reciting thesame and rehearsed "abra-bra-bra-bra".<br><br>2) people dressed to "chiong" (dyed hair, fanciful earrings, stunning clothes etc) leading the singing while on stage. these people sing as if they are pop stars, like "we" are the fans cheering their singing ability<br><br>3) i remembered a hip-hop dance routine during the interim and i was appalled to see some dancers with tattoos.<br><br>Call me a conservative catholic but i will never ever subscribe to chc's way of celebration. I believe that there are many young pple who are going to chc just to make friends with the opposite sex and or prob even to make out. God is just not the main focus for many there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i rather there be 500 followers who desire the voice of god than 500,000 idiots who only want to learn thru music, celebrate gatherings  the "pop" wayb etc.<br><br>Religion should be pure, that's why we need leaders who can trod that path. Being a pastor of a church and taking near $10,000 per month, holding other businesses and driving flashy cars, are not my ideas of "pure".<br><br>Anyone from Catholic JC here? Who knows how much Bro. P takes a month? I know for sure Catholic priests can only take a few hundred a month to serve basic needs. Salary is not an issue at all for these Fathers, they only want to serve God.<br><br>To me, that's what religion shd be.</div>
