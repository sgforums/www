The OT was in the temple kept by the teachers of the law. Faulty? depends on what's your belief and meaning of faulty...<br><br>back to the topic<br><br>2 Samuel 6:16<br>As the ark of the LORD was entering the City of David, Michal daughter of Saul watched from a window. And when she saw <span style="text-decoration: underline;">King David leaping and dancing before the LORD</span>, she despised him in her heart.<br><br>Later part the bible said michal became barren. So i learned, don't despise people dancing and enjoying... i was once like that.(only being to Chc once). so if somebody come with a wrong motive, it's their problem, God will handle them...( my friend came for wrong motive and now became devoted christian)<br><br>Now, if the worship is towards Jesus and God, i'm for it. Btw since when did the bible said worship must not be enjoying and joyful? and which bible say rock music is from the devil? is it men's idea or scripture?(christians can answer?)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>aiyah this kind of question will discuss until the cockroaches become extinct still no conclusion. Why limit yourself when God gives you the freedom to worship Him?<br><br>In my opinion, Hymns are satanic becos i saw how hymns make some people sleep and never worship God. How about that? ANd I would have created another meaningless discussion  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
