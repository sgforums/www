It is not uncommon for rich people to have too many commitments until they have less time for God. Furthermore it is harder to practise Christian values because the higher up you are, the more responsibilities you have and the more dark politics you will face.<br><br>Take for example, Bill Gates. Many portray him as evil businessman. But we shouldn't forget he is accountable to his staff and shareholders too. So I argue it is easier to practise Christian values if you are Mother Theresa than if you are Bill Gates. So the only good things Bill Gates have done is to donate generously to charity.<br><br>Take another example - our foreign minister Yeo. He is Catholic no doubt, and he is rich (just by looking at his paycheck .. I heard it is quite a lot). Surprisingly he is one of the first to advocate for a casino in Singapore, even before LKY!! But is this really surprising? As a minister, he has to look after the nation's interest first.<br><br>The words of King Solomon sums it up - vanity vanity .. all is vanity!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

They believe in 3 persons in one god. The way they worship is not the christian worship. Look at the way they worship, purely rock. They don't know who is the real Jesus. They rock and worshipping the devil. If you have the discerning spirit, you will not be bless the way they worship" and "just because they are rockin out, dat doesnt mean they arent praising God. cant you have fun praising God?? if you dont have fun while you are praising, you dont really feel anything. we should think prasing God should be fun and holy, like how hillsongs does it" the way they worship at chc is definitely more appealing to the younger generation. so what wrong about this kind of fun and modern way of worshipping? anyone please enlighten me thanks!</div></blockquote>If the fun and modren worship takes away people from the real purpose of worship and people forget for what it is they worship, then it defeats the purpose.
