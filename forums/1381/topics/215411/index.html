            <div class='col-md body'>whats wrong with the type of worship as done in chc? i used to think that as long as you are worshipping with your heart, any form of music should be the same, whether it is rock or pop but it seems that there is a lot of disapproval over the way worship is done in chc. theres also the link that rock music is associated with the devil? is that true? and i saw comments like this over at youtube "The Hillsong Ministry are trinitarians. They believe in 3 persons in one god. The way they worship is not the christian worship. Look at the way they worship, purely rock. They don't know who is the real Jesus. They rock and worshipping the devil. If you have the discerning spirit, you will not be bless the way they worship" and "just because they are rockin out, dat doesnt mean they arent praising God. cant you have fun praising God?? if you dont have fun while you are praising, you dont really feel anything. we should think prasing God should be fun and holy, like how hillsongs does it" the way they worship at chc is definitely more appealing to the younger generation. so what wrong about this kind of fun and modern way of worshipping? anyone please enlighten me thanks!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>let me tell you why i left the church why i left christianity,<br>the following are my personal  observations , analysis and beleive,<br><br>after 2 years in the church and some other church i went for visiting<br>i realised that the "rock" concert is nothing but a distraction, its to keep the young ones entertained, to get them to come back.<br>every time the light dims, and the synth starts to kick in, the pastor will say the holy spirit is here, its nothing but well perffected stage embience.<br><br>the pastors are always so "fired up" when preaching, "on fire" as they put it,<br>this puts me off, i heard some pastors go as far as to wage war against the demons that are hindu Gods, ironically the pastor was indian.<br><br>i also observed that many christians are very disliked by many people,<br>christians say they are persecuted because of their faith and that it is fortold in the bible, oh they are suffering for their faith, they make it sound saintly.<br>i think they got the word persecution wrong, i think the muslims are lagi more persectued,<br>another reason why christians are disliked IN MY OWN OPINION, is because of the fundementals of their teaching of how to relate to others,<br>i have read up about the islamic concept of seeking forgiveness,<br>first a muslim have to seek forgiveness from the person they have sin against, before they are fit to seek forgiveness from Allah,<br>this in MY OPINION is very good, because it puts them personally responsible.<br>Christian teaching on the other hand, just have to seek God's forgiveness and that is about it. the absolves them from alot of personal acountability.<br><br>why i left the church, because simply i saw how a mess the protestant church is,<br>I SAY CHURCH HERE NOT THE RELIGION, all religions are of divine ideals, but its the people who screw things up.<br>every church is a schizm, has its own dogma, its own opinion on the bible.<br>and they like to bitch about each other.<br>and see the mega churches like CHC, NCC lighthouse evangelism,<br>LOOK at how much money they spent on the physical building, is it what they call humble? is it necesarry, or is it luxury?<br>it looks to me like solomon's temple.<br>end of the day its a business to these alpha pastors, its a number game.<br><br>finally i left the church because it never gave me peace, not the worship not the place not the sermons, but one thing they taught me is that if the holy spirit is there u will find peace.<br><br>i guess i found the holy spirit in a thai temple, i found a peace i never had before.<br>my life experienced positive changes , and i am convinced, by their creed and actions.<br><br>peace<br>these are just my own personal feelings analysis and observations, and i hope it will shed some light on your question</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly, there is nothing wrong with the CHC kind of worship. It's just that many of them 'play-act' to show enthuasism and vibrancy. They are encouraged and 'forced' to worship in such a manner by their fellow cell leaders and cell members. You have to be regarded to be with the 'in-thing' within the church cell group clique or you might counselled by your cell group leader why you don't show enthuasism in worship. In order to move up to be a better christian in their context, you must exhibit that kind of joy and excitement when worshipping or else you would be thought of as not strong in your love and faith in God.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rock and worship are 2 parellel lines which willnever see eye to eye, which will never meet.<br><br>Integrating rock into worshipping is crap. CHC lavish's church is tantament to the ignorance of what worshipping &amp; holiness is all about.<br><br>Look at catholic churches, they are v. solemn. They (Catholics) listen to what the priest is talking about, they sing hymns, they read the gospel, they have their holy communion, etc.. not in a wild and 'fun' manner.<br><br>How ridiculous!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
