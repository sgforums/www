              <p>Christians are under much scrutiny when it comes time to demonstrate their faith and devotion to their beliefs.</p>
              <p>To all the anti-theists, atheists, agnostics, free-thinkers:</p>
              <p>1.  When a believer (a christian especially) scolds you, calls you bad names, or is rude, you have just received proof that the person is not as firm a believer as he should be.  He may be trying hard, yes, but every misdeed goes a long way.</p>
              <p>2.  Do not try to convert believers into non-believers.  It is a process only by personal experience.  It is harmful to both parties to logically argue with another person who is armed with faith.</p>
              <p>3.  We must do our part to live our lives to the fullest.  We have only one life, which is here on earth.  There is no afterlife, no eternal damnation, no eternal bliss.  We owe it to ourselves and those we love to make the most positive secular impact while we are alive.</p>
              <p>To all the believers (especially christian):</p>
              <p>1.  I appreciate you inviting me to your church or other religious places.  I will go with you if you come to my Atheists of Singapore group meetings.  No?  Then no thanks.</p>
              <p>2.  Bible teachings do teach goodness, humility, caring, empathy, brotherly love.  Now show it to me on a consistent basis.</p>
              <p>3.  If I were a beggar, would the front entrance of a church be the best place to sit?  Would the security kick me away, or would people invite me in and give me food to eat and a place to stay?</p>

              <p>City harvest in Jurong. Why do they need this type of church?</p>
              <p>Largest "Transfer Beam" in the World<br> 6 floors of the building are resting on the "ceiling" of the
              column-free auditorium. The ceiling, technically known as a "transfer
              beam," is the largest ceiling structure in the world with an area of
              3,500 square metres and a depth of 3 metres. Sato Kogyo and Bachy
              Soletanche jointly built it.</p>
              <p>First Titanium-Clad Building in Asia<br> The front facade of the building is clad with the same titanium that
              wraps the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. The renowned museum is
              reputed to be the most beautiful contemporary architecture in the world
              today. According to the Swiss museum specialists, this building in
              Singapore is the first architecture with such titanium cladding in Asia.</p>
              <p>Largest Church Building<br> From the lowest basement to the top of the steeple cross, the building
              is 54 metres in height, or equivalent to 18-20 floors of a HDB flat.
              This is the biggest church structure in the Southeast Asian Peninsula.</p>
              <p>First Broquard Fountain in Southeast Asia<br> Mr. Jerome Broquard from Los Angeles, USA, is widely recognised as the
              number one fountain maker in the world. Mr. Broquard is the designer of
              the fountain wall at the front of the building and this assignment is
              his first fountain project in Southeast Asia. (Japan has the only other
              Broquard fountain in Asia.)</p>
              <p>Largest Stainless Steel Church Cross in the World<br> At 12 metres high and 800 kg in weight, the stainless steel cross is the largest in the world.</p>
              <p>Largest Sound Console in the World<br> Mr. Steven Le Roux, the sound and lighting consultant of the Sydney
              Opera House, provided consultancy services to City Harvest Church with
              relation to acoustics of the main sanctuary. The auditorium is fitted
              with a 60-channel sound console, which is the largest and only one of
              its size in the world.</p>
              <p>Most Advanced Fire Evacuation System in the World<br> The fire evacuation public announcement system, designed by Klotz
              Digital, is widely touted to be the most advanced and efficient in the
              market today. They designed this specially for the new Munich Airport
              which is due to be opened in 2003. The church was approached by Klotz
              Digital to be the first architecture in the world to be fitted with
              such a system.</p>
              <p>Largest Church Donation Campaign in Southeast Asia<br> The land purchase and building construction costs a total of $47.6
              million. This amount is raised locally and entirely from City Harvest
              Church's own congregation in Singapore over a period of 7 years. Only
              45% of the congregation are working adults, the rest are mainly
              schooling youths, housewives and retirees.</p>

              <p>CHC member testimonial taken from another forum</p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>"I was a member of CHC few years back and I was
              brainwashed by them. Brainwashed, as in, really brainwashed. During
              that time family ties and friendships were strained badly because I
              kept preaching to them. Whenever my father forbid me to go to church, I
              would find all means to get out of the house, even resorting to lying
              just to "be close to God" and "with all brothers and sisters,
              experience God's presence".</p>
              <p>One day a friend screamed at me, "You aren't the person I once
              knew." Then I realised how terrible my mindset was being distorted. I
              kept my distance from my cell group mates and stopped going to church.
              Changed a couple of phone numbers and blog URLs. All contact has been
              broken off."</p>

              <p><br>But far too many so-called christians are blinkered by false prophets and teachings. I question the soundness of the theology practiced in the many churches in Singapore. If christians are able to differentiate for themselves what is right and wrong, they might as well be god. The so-called christians are claiming righteousness but in reality, are just purely self-righteous. I will mock at so-called doctrines that cannot be true in daily life.</p>
