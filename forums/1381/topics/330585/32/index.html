              <p><br>their so call transparent accounting is just for show to the public that they are clean. But deep down there a per-audit system is carry out to black out the loop hole of taking money from the church goers into their pocket. Before the real and actual auditing begin done on them. same for NCC.</p>
              <p>eg: if there is a charity and the money from the donator is about $40k (not on paper). they make sure it the account will fit what they advertise to the public as $30k(only on paper.)</p>
              <p>So what happen to the rest of it ($10k)? Went into their pocket the where the major portion of it end up with founder of the church buying landed property ,branded items, luxury holiday in overseas at 6 stars hotel or payment for the new car. </p>

              <p>Hi folks!!! gd evening, i happen to see this topic and would like to give my comments on Church in Singapore. Basically they only target a few groups of people to join and believe in god . First you must be very english educated and has low or swallow understanding of your own original roots and cultures. Your mother toungue is weak. As bible teaching target those and spread upon easily in english. Second type of Christain.. those old and elderly... being weak at heart at thier twitlight zone, they found god via vaRious dialects.</p>
              <p>Ok, let see. alot of young christain are friendly... lovely... and have great courage.. because they sing and shout god name loud loud in any public area and they feel proud... IS THIS THE WAY TO PRAISE  GOD OR TO CREATE MORE PUBLICITY IN FAVOR TO GAIN MORE PEOPLE ATTENTION. Most Christain girl are more erm...erm... eh... easy to get and are vuluneerable to F. Ons. Don't ask me why out of 10 girl i hunted down 6 are Christain. Second they like to dress nice nice  and they mind how they look outwardly... they like to package them till as if christain is meant for those rich and famous. Look back christain back in those ancient days they are pure and could endure sufferings. Their heart, soul mind can really communicate with god.. and god really answer them. When any religion is in relation to alot of money matter involve... i have no comments. YOU SEE FOR YOURSELF. I HAVE HIGHLIGHTED IN MY OTHER POST N GOD SAYING THAT IT'S HUMAN WHOM MISINTERPRET GOD.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do not know they still build disco and bar.... too this is too much......and acting more and more stupid. it had become from singapore youth club to nightspot businese under the name of god... ''god'' funds.. i think sooner or later baba will go pull them down for his own pocket. If these people can really exercise spiritually any power from god to and fro... then there are only 1 possibility.. Using Satan in disguise. After so many stupid doing plus, wrong imparting of skills ... do you think these lovely short skirt young hip hop ladies whom are good at playing games and singing, with a cross neckalace on their neck... have ability to exercise anything spiritual in context with god?.... I HAVE NO COMMENTS.</p>

              <p>Stupid enough local naive people believe in anyway. wE tHE cityzan of this city always been taken in by anyone....the government... religion... when we realized anything wrong.. we curse and swear.. but in the first place why did we read up more and open our eyes big to see with our heart and think with our eyes.</p>
              <p>Those who practice and are spreading religion currently, i mean any type of religion.. do not alter ,change, modify, the original style meaning of any religion... ''dancing to the tune of nowadays'' people trend and style.... this would spoilt and degenerate religion... I STAY PREFER THE ORIGINAL MOONCAKE AND ORIGINAL DUMPLING NOT THOSE FANICFUL MOOKCAKES OR DUMPLING EVOLVING OVER THE YEARS..... FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSE. THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE.... FOR FOOD YES... CHANGE OFIT MIGHT BE GOOD.. FOR RELIGION IF YOU CHANGE IT... YOU ARE A SINNER. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People should learn the hard way towards religion... not religion breaking down into simple form for simpleton to understand or accept AND ADOPT.. if you are simple and you expect you can understand the profoundness of any religion... think back again.. AM I BEING CONNED/?</p>
