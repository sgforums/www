              <p>personally, i really have no problem when folks here have opposing views.... that's why there are discussions.</p>
              <p>however, in many of such discussions.... phrases like: "it's in the Bible" gives a finality to any discussion because to debate against it is like debating against the Word of God, so after that, no point already.</p>
              <p>... but i have already concluded a couple of days back that any difference, to me, is just technicality because KNOWING that one does good work is not really a pre-requisite for salvation, whichever way our opinons swing, so as long as we all agree that good work is important and that we keep doing it.... whether it is a condition for salvation is really not that important after all.....</p>

              <p>I agree with Chin Eng on his reply to you on this. When I started work, not all company have fax machine! We actually type our quotation on a typewriter (no computer! but already very advanced with electronic typewriter) and mail out by post (snail mail - no such thing as e-mail yet) ! And we are all waiting for technology to make life easier as they promised....like now and more promises that it will get better.....</p>
              <p>Taking bus involved a bus conductor punching tickets and collecting cash.....MRT still under construction....</p>
              <p>Handphone is a dream and we slot 10cents to make pulic phone call...phone card comes in later.....</p>
              <p>I don't know cause I just dislike Christians then and what they say to me etc...and if some think like you then, that it's towards end of time, the world is still pretty much here and alive....</p>
              <p>With or without technology, if the world is going to end, it will end. For me, it is not when it is going to end but am I prepared ?</p>
              <p>So, don't think too much and relax.....life goes on and I still wonder why you asking what Catholics think of this..............maybe I still didn't get you.</p>

              <p>Yes, I know you're not asking about these groups of people. But I'm curious nevertheless about <em>your take</em> as to whether a person who has never heard the gospel before through no fault of his own, or is mentally incapable, may still obtain eternal salvation through the mercy of God, if they seek God with a sincere heart and moved by grace, try in their actions to do his will through the dictates of their conscience, as taught by the Catholic Church ?</p>
              <p>And you might have mis-read or mis-understood my previous post. I made it clear that the Catholic Church <em>does</em> teach that there is no salvation outside of Christ and his Church (unless it's through no fault of the person such as the situations mentioned previously). So someone who rejects Christ's salvation after knowing about it (unless it's through no fault of his) is certainly in grave danger of going to hell. But we will not know <em>for sure</em> whether he would eventually <em>be</em> in hell. Why ? As cited in my previous post, a person who has rejected Christ could repent on his death bed and he will still have a chance of heaven with God's mercy. Agree ?</p>

              <p>Correction. I don't believe that I am perfecting Christ's finished work but I certainly need to apply Christ's finished work to my life (ie: co-operate with God's graces).</p>
              <p>I agree 100% that faith is important and necessary for salvation; the bible certainly stresses that. But that is not all that the bible stresses. If good works is really "not needed for salvation", "not part of salvation"; and if good works really doesn't make an iota of difference whether we make it to heaven or not, then I wonder why the bible bothers telling us so much about the importance of good works, the <em>consequences of not doing good works</em> (hell) and the possibility of <em>losing one's salvation</em>. Hmmm ... maybe, just maybe good works is not as insignificant as some modern day Christians make it out to be ...</p>
              <p>(Note: To make it clear, by 'salvation', I have always meant 'making it to heaven', <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> the point when I first became a Christian by 'accepting Christ'. As I have previously explained, salvation is not a one-time event but a <em>process </em>that is complete only if and when I reach God's heavenly kingdom.)</p>

              <p>You asked about your quotes from Galatians, Acts and Ezekiel. Impressive quoting I must say, albeit rather long <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png">.</p>
              <p>To sum them all up, in Galatians, Paul is preaching against the belief that one is saved solely by observing the <em>Law of Moses</em> (works of the Law). The Council of Jerusalem as told in Acts illustrates this nicely when they decided on whether one needs to be circumcised (a Mosaic Law requirement) to be saved and the answer was no. Well and good ! We can throw out observance of the Mosaic Law as a requirement for salvation <em>but when did good works come into the picture and get thrown out as well</em> ? Especially when other bible passages tell us otherwise. We have to be careful in differentiating 'good works' from 'works of the Mosaic Law' when we read Paul, James etc.</p>
              <p>And as for Ezekiel, I might have mis-read you but am I right to understand that your reasoning is that just because we can't stop from doing bad, therefore the passage is ... wrong perhaps ? But no matter. I agree with you that we all sin (although we would sin less if we grow in holiness). But we always have a loving God waiting to forgive us our sins if we but turn back to him with a contrite heart. That's all we need to regularly do to avoid the consequences of sin as told by Ezekiel.</p>

              <p>article 1996: Our justification comes from the grace of God. Grace is <em>favor</em>, the free and undeserved help that God gives us to respond to his call to become children of God, adoptive sons, partakers of the divine nature and of eternal life.</p>

              <p>article 1997: Grace is a <em>participation in the life of God.</em> It introduces us into the intimacy of Trinitarian life: by Baptism the Christian participates in the grace of Christ, the Head of his Body. As an "adopted son" he can henceforth call God "Father," in union with the only Son. He receives the life of the Spirit who breathes charity into him and who forms the Church.</p>

              <p>Yes, good works are about loving God and neighbour. But the point is that St.Paul was <em>not</em> preaching against good works. He was preaching against the belief system that observing the works of the Mosaic Law was necessary and sufficient to be put right with God (when it was neither) - that one gets eternal salvation by being circumcised, by not working on the sabbath, by abstaining from this food and that, and by complying with hundreds if not thousands of other requirements under the Mosaic Law.</p>

              <p>I would put to you that faith and works are like body and spirit. Faith is analogous to the body and works are analogous to the spirit. Just as we need <em>both</em> body and spirit for physical life, we too need <em>both</em> faith and good works for spiritual life, for salvation.</p>
              <p>And just as we don't say that spirit is not necessary or not part of physical life, we too cannot say that good works is not necessary or not part of spiritual life.</p>
              <p>And if anyone is wondering, I did not create this analogy, the bible did (James 2:26).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If we define faith as being <em>'faith accompanied by good works'</em>, then I will not have that much of a problem accepting the notion that we are saved (go to heaven) by faith alone. But unfortunately, we can have faith and <em>not</em> bear fruit as warned by the bible; and we <em>can</em> lose our salvation if that's the case. That is why I reject the notion that works done in love through faith play no role in our salvation, as does the bible and the Catholic Church.   <br></p>

              <p>oh.. i finally understand.</p>

              <p>and it rubs off on me, maybe it becomes jumping at shadows, but if there's a sign that is a milestone in the end times theory, i am naturally curious and attentive. but she just shrugged it off like end times isn't going to happen, it's a fairy tale etc.</p>

              <p>Agree that the thread is out of topic. For that, I apologise to the threadstarter. I was merely responding to earlier assertions that good works play no role whatsoever in our salvation. I feel that it is important that readers understand that this is a protestant teaching (presumably taught by CHC as well), which is not held by a large proportion of Christians, including the Catholic Church.</p>
              <p>Chin Eng, the statement would not seem so oxymoronic if you try to understand what is being said. Jesus' death and resurrection is our sole source of justification, but we need to respond to and 'access' (for lack of a better word) that source through our faith and good works. <em>If</em> we do that, the source is more than sufficient. <em>If</em> we don't, then Jesus' death and resurrection would be of no benefit to us.</p>

              <p>1. the percentage of Christians having different views and what such percentages are remains a unaccountable.... so your claim that a "large proportion of Christians" is simply unprovable.</p>
              <p>2. while it is not difficult to clarify one's stand, stating it as a theological truth is something else.</p>
              <p>3. i still stand by my stand that your explain (including this one) is oxymoronic.... but it is my personal opinion. "sole source of justification"... the word "SOLE" is self-explanatory.</p>
              <p>4. the issue is NOT whether i UNDERSTAND your explanation or not.... the issue is whether i AGREE with your explanation or not.</p>
              <p>having said all that.... i am not quarrelling with your RIGHT to believe in this theology... which i have stated many times in this thread that it does not matter either way to me....</p>
              <p>i am also not attempting to change your opinion to agree with mine...</p>
              <p>to me it is unimportant which way we swing with regards to this issue, i've said before - it is a matter of technicality....</p>
              <p>if the purpose of your posts are to "clarify", i think it's done. both you and smarty boy have done that already. let's move on.</p>

              <p>hmm. it's a rather tricky issue.</p>
              <p>i'm not so concerned about it - firstly, salvation comes from believing in the truth, not what the preacher says, but what the bible says.</p>
              <p></p><ol>
              <li>we are all sinners</li>
              <li>we cannot save ourselves</li>
              <li>Jesus lived a sinless life, died a sinner's death and ressurected again, conquering death on our behalf</li>
              <li>salvation comes only through faith in Christ alone</li>
              </ol>
              <div>this is what chc preaches. sure some of the things they do are controversal, but the bible says, a good tree does not bear bad fruits, a bad tree does not bear good fruits. i've some friends from chc who turned out God loving people, full of grace and love. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>they might not have been saved if they weren't invited into chc. so something good did happen (even if the church is bad). ultimately, God is the one in control. He can use rotten churches in His will too. so don't worry about what they're doing with their bankbooks, worry about your own salvation (if you haven't believe in Jesus)</div>

              <p><br>that's just one way of looking at it..... red eyes??? not necessarily true.</p>
              <p>CHC has plenty of affiliation with preachers of controversial background, yet they continue the affiliation....</p>
              <p>number of people does not indicate anything... look at the Moonies, they also have huge following.....</p>
              <p>rich folks like the owner of 77th street? look at the Scientologists, movie stars are in their membership.....</p>
              <p>my own humble church has Indonesian tycoons, successful business people, so what!</p>
