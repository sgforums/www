              <p><br>here's where i said that such verses are ignored by those who are pro-works and faith.</p>
              <p>... and when two portions of the scripture conflicts each other, the assumption is that at least one of these portions must be relooked....</p>
              <p>... plus when reading scripture, one must also aware of the general theme of the Bible... this, in my opinion, is one of reconciliation and forgiveness.... where's the point if this reconciliation and forgiveness is laced with other secondary conditions?</p>
              <p>... but as i'd said.... i think we are all arguing on the technicalities of salvation.</p>
              <p>people holding different views cannot prove one way or the another to the other side.</p>
              <p>i think it need to be emphasized again, dumb2, in case our other brethens misread us again... that we, you and I, NEVER EVER SAID that good works is not important.... we only believe that good works is not important in salvation.... you think this is simple enough for people to understand???</p>

              <h5 style="font-size: 100%; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The Law and the Promise</h5>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"> <span>15</span>Brothers, let me take an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established, so it is in this case. <span>16</span>The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. The Scripture does not say "and to seeds," meaning many people, but "and to your seed,"<sup style="vertical-align: text-top;">[<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #5d5ebc;" title="See footnote g" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=55&amp;amp;chapter=3&amp;amp;version=31#fen-NIV-29103g">g</a>]</sup> meaning one person, who is Christ. <span>17</span>What I mean is this: The law, introduced 430 years later, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise. <span>18</span>For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on a promise; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"> <span>19</span>What, then, was the purpose of the law? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was put into effect through angels by a mediator. <span>20</span>A mediator, however, does not represent just one party; but God is one.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"> <span>21</span>Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law. <span>22</span>But the Scripture declares that the whole world is a prisoner of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"> <span>23</span>Before this faith came, we were held prisoners by the law, locked up until faith should be revealed. <span>24</span>So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ<sup style="vertical-align: text-top;">[<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #5d5ebc;" title="See footnote h" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=55&amp;amp;chapter=3&amp;amp;version=31#fen-NIV-29111h">h</a>]</sup> that we might be justified by faith. <span>25</span>Now that faith has come, we are no longer under the supervision of the law.</p>
              <h5 style="font-size: 100%; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Sons of God</h5>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"> <span>26</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus,</span> <span>27</span>for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. <span>28</span>There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. <span>29</span>If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.</p>

              <h5 style="font-size: 100%; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The Council at Jerusalem</h5>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"> <span>1</span>Some men came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the brothers: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by Moses, you cannot be saved</span>."<span>2</span>This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question. <span>3</span>The church sent them on their way, and as they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria, they told how the Gentiles had been converted. This news made all the brothers very glad. <span>4</span>When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and elders, to whom they reported everything God had done through them.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"> <span>5</span>Then some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, "The Gentiles must be circumcised and required to obey the law of Moses."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"> <span>6</span>The apostles and elders met to consider this question. <span>7</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them: "Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe. <span>8</span>God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us. <span>9</span>He made no distinction between us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith. <span>10</span>Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of the disciples a yoke that neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear?<span>11</span>No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are."</span></p>

              <p>I guess it is better that you and your gf enjoy your time together and both looking forward..... Girls usually are not so interested with technology etc.....like guys who are less interested in shopping.....</p>
              <p>But like what you gf said, "can't you for once stop talking about the bible and just enjoy"? I mean, relax lah... why would everything that your gf said or do be link back to is that what Catholics is about or just her?</p>
              <p>Wait your gf don't want you then you know.....</p>
              <p>Anything you want to know about the Catholic faith, you go to the source....and in your case, it will be good to go to RCIA with your gf. No obligation for conversion and you can speak to a priest and let him know your background and grill him with all your difficult questions.</p>
              <p>If you have a chance or come across Brother Michael Broughton  (the Brother President of SJI) during RCIA or any of his talk, I suggest you make an effort to go.... He is a very interesting teacher and very knowledgeable about the Bible and Church history as well as the teachings of other faiths. Grill him with all your difficult questions too.</p>
              <p>Like I said to you before, you don't have to become a Catholic if the teachings is not convincing to you.... but you will at least know many of the misconceptions that are told to you and floating around.....</p>
              <p>So, enjoy your time with your gf lah...</p>

              <p>What's the point of explaining Catholic Catechism to you? We are already trying to explain why we believe that salvation is by faith and works and causing so much heat.</p>

              <p>i really don't need the long version, just the part these two articles:</p>
              <p>article 1996: Our justification comes from the grace of God. Grace is <em>favor</em>, the free and undeserved help that God gives us to respond to his call to become children of God, adoptive sons, partakers of the divine nature and of eternal life.</p>
              <p>article 1997: Grace is a <em>participation in the life of God.</em> It introduces us into the intimacy of Trinitarian life: by Baptism the Christian participates in the grace of Christ, the Head of his Body. As an "adopted son" he can henceforth call God "Father," in union with the only Son. He receives the life of the Spirit who breathes charity into him and who forms the Church.</p>
              <p>... but granted you may not be able to answer it....  so if you don't know i can accept an "i don't know" answer.....</p>

              <p>It applies both ways....isn't it?</p>

              <p>i certainly am NOT trying to convince you to agree to my arguments.... as i'd said, i don't really care about your personal convictions.</p>
              <p>all i am saying is you keep quoting James to support your view, but you have totally disregarded Paul's writings.... i can offer you what i think of James in terms of interpret what he said.... are you willing to read Paul's writing and offer your thoughts on these "conflicting" verses?</p>
              <p>i can certainly take you view as a personal opinion, if you can take my view (or dumb2) as a personal opinion. no where can you find me saying that i am absolutely correct? but the moment you throw me a verse or two... i can't help thinking that you think that your stand is absolute.... in your mind. </p>
              <p>i certainly hope that this thread is closed, but this forum has been without a moderator for ages.... and i don't believe admin is checking on us.</p>
