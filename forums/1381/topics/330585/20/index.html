              In bible study 101, we must not only take note of what that is
              mentioned but also what that is not mentioned. OK.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>as for evil and suffering.. why does God allow it, </p>
              <p style="padding-right: 12px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 8px 0px; line-height: 1.7em; padding-top: 0px;"><span>Various answers have been given but permanently settling the issue is impossible because so many of our answers raise further questions. Nevertheless, our lack of ability to answer the question perfectly does not mean that we cannot offer solutions. Of course, I do not assume to be able to answer these questions definitively, but I can offer some solutions.</span></p>
              <p style="padding-right: 12px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 8px 0px; line-height: 1.7em; padding-top: 0px;">First of all, it is possible that God has reasons for allowing evil to exist that we simply cannot understand. In this the Christian can have confidence in God knowing that His ways are above our ways (<a style="color: #2998d8; text-decoration: underline;" rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Isaiah%2055.8-9">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). As the Bible says, the just shall live by faith (<a style="color: #2998d8; text-decoration: underline;" rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Hab.%202.4">Hab. 2:4</a>).</p>
              <p style="padding-right: 12px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 8px 0px; line-height: 1.7em; padding-top: 0px;">Second, God may be letting evil run its course in order to prove that evil is evil and that suffering, which is the unfortunate product of evil, is further proof that anything contrary to God’s will is bad, harmful, painful, and leads to death.</p>
              <p style="padding-right: 12px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 8px 0px; line-height: 1.7em; padding-top: 0px;">God gave Adam dominion over the world (<a style="color: #2998d8; text-decoration: underline;" rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Gen.%201.28">Gen. 1:28</a>). When he rebelled against God, he set in motion an entire series of events and changed the very nature of man and creation. Both were affected by sin. Creation was no longer a paradise, but bore thorns and thistles (<a style="color: #2998d8; text-decoration: underline;" rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Gen.%203.17-18">Gen. 3:17-18</a>; <a style="color: #2998d8; text-decoration: underline;" rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Rom.%208.22">Rom. 8:22</a>). People became sinful (<a style="color: #2998d8; text-decoration: underline;" rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Rom.%205.12">Rom. 5:12</a>; <a style="color: #2998d8; text-decoration: underline;" rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Eph.%202.3">Eph. 2:3</a>), who were haters of God (<a style="color: #2998d8; text-decoration: underline;" rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Rom.%203.19-12">Rom. 3:19-12</a>), etc. The only conclusion to such a situation is death. Jesus said, "And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened" (<a style="color: #2998d8; text-decoration: underline;" rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Matt.%2024.22">Matt. 24:22</a>).</p>
              <p style="padding-right: 12px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 8px 0px; line-height: 1.7em; padding-top: 0px;">Sin is rebellion against God and His created order. But God has not left us alone in this fallen world. He continued to enter this world, pointing us to Himself, to truth, to morality, purity, and love. He used the evil of the world (liars, perjurers, the envious, etc), to bring His Son to the cross so that we might have the opportunity of eternal life. In this, God has not stepped away from fallen creation, but has stepped into it by becoming Jesus. God works within the fallen world to affect change and He uses fallen people to accomplish His will. In this, He is proving His sovereignty over evil, suffering, and rebellious people, proving that sin and evil are utterly futile, and that He is worthy of honor and glory.</p>
              <p style="padding-right: 12px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 8px 0px; line-height: 1.7em; padding-top: 0px;">A third possible reason that God is letting evil occur is so that on the day of judgment, the condemned will have no right to say that their sentence is unjust. God is not stopping people from exercising their free will. Think about this: If someone said that God should stop evil and suffering, then should God then stop <strong>all</strong> evil and suffering? If God only stopped some of it, then we would still be asking the same question of why it exists. So, if we want God to stop evil and suffering, then He must stop all of it. We have no problem with this when it means stopping a catastrophe, or a murder, or a rape. But what about when someone thinks of something evil? Evil is evil whether it is acted out or not. Hatred and bigotry in someone’s heart is wrong. If it is wrong, and if God is to stop all evil, then He must stop that person from thinking his own thoughts. To do that, God must remove his freedom of thought. Furthermore, which person on the earth has <strong>not</strong> thought something evil? God would be required, then, to stop all people from exercising their free will. This is something God has chosen not to do. Therefore, we could say that one of the reasons that God permits evil and suffering is because of man’s free will.</p>
              <p style="padding-right: 12px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 8px 0px; line-height: 1.7em; padding-top: 0px;">Fourth, it is quite possible that God uses the suffering to do good. In other words, He produces patience through tribulation (<a style="color: #2998d8; text-decoration: underline;" rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Rom.%205.3">Rom. 5:3</a>). Or He may desire to save someone through it. Take for example, the account of Joseph who was sold into slavery by His brothers. What they did was wrong and Joseph suffered greatly for it. But, later, God raised up Joseph in Egypt to make provisions for the people of that land during the coming drought of seven years. But not only was Egypt saved, but also so was his family and brothers who originally sold him into slavery. Joseph finally says to them, "You meant it for evil, but God meant it for good" (<a style="color: #2998d8; text-decoration: underline;" rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Gen.%2050.15-21">Gen. 50:15-21</a>). Of course, the greatest example of God using evil for good is the death of Christ. Evil people brought him to the cross, but God used that cross as the means to save the world.</p>
              <p style="padding-right: 12px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 8px 0px; line-height: 1.7em; padding-top: 0px;">But then we must ask, if this is true, are we working against God by working against evil and suffering? No, we are not. God says he does not want us to sin and suffer. But it is simply true that God can use evil despite of its apparent despicable nature.</p>
              <p style="padding-right: 12px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 8px 0px; line-height: 1.7em; padding-top: 0px;">God is <strong>in</strong> the world using the world and its failures for His glory and the benefit of those who listen to Him.</p>
              <p style="padding-right: 12px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 8px 0px; line-height: 1.7em; padding-top: 0px;">But then, what about those who seem to innocently suffer with no benefit resulting? What about the woman who is raped, or the innocent by stander who is killed by a stray bullet. In both cases, the victims and families suffer nothing but pain and loss. What good can this possibly be?</p>
              <p style="padding-right: 12px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 8px 0px; line-height: 1.7em; padding-top: 0px;">I think that the answer is two-fold. One, ultimately, no one is innocent. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (<a style="color: #2998d8; text-decoration: underline;" rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Rom.%203.23">Rom. 3:23</a>) and are by nature children of wrath (<a style="color: #2998d8; text-decoration: underline;" rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Eph.%202.3">Eph. 2:3</a>). There is none innocent. Though this is biblically accurate, it does not satisfy the question emotionally. Why do little babies suffer for things they have not done? I must acknowledge that I do not know. Ultimately, we must trust God who knows the beginning from the end and sees the grand picture. He will have the final word and He will be vindicated.</p>
              <h2 style="padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; padding-bottom: 1px; margin: 0px; color: #303030; padding-top: 17px;">Conclusion</h2>
              <p style="padding-right: 12px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 8px 0px; line-height: 1.7em; padding-top: 0px;">Suffering is the result of human sin. The world is not the way that God created it and because of that, all are vulnerable to the affects of sin in the world. Why does one person suffer and another does not? Why do catastrophes happen to some and no others? It is because sin is in the world. But there will come a day when the Lord will return and cleanse this world of all sin and all suffering.</p>

              <p>uh oh, sounds like that train of thought is derailing... tsk</p>
              <p>let me tell you why the word evil in that verse don't just mean moral evil, as you suggest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>because you're such a poseur, let me tell you:</p>
              <p>it's "×¨×©×¢", pronounced as "rah". it occurred in the bible how many </p>
              <p>times, do you know? no you don't because you're such a poseur, let me tell you:</p>
              <p>it occurred 663 times in the KJV.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>do you know it's meaning was translated differently in each part </p>
              <p>of the KJV bible (since you used KJV as reference), to emphasis different things? </p>
              <p>no you don't, because you're such a poseur, so let me tell you:</p>
              <p>it was translated 431 times as "evil", and the other 232 times, it </p>
              <p>was translated to mean other stuff, like "trouble", "calamity", </p>
              <p>"mischief", "adversity", "sorrow", "harm", "disaster" etc etc.</p>
              <p>so you can see, that the word "rah", isn't just translated as </p>
              <p>"moral evil".</p>
              <p>let me show you the verse in context:</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; line-height: normal;">
              </span></p><h3 style="font-size: 16px;">Isaiah 45:5-7 (King James Version)</h3>
              <div class="result-text-style-normal" style="font-family: 'Charis SIL', charis, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
              <p> </p>
              <p> <sup id="en-KJV-18567" class="versenum" style="font-size: 0.65em; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: text-top; line-height: normal;">5</sup>I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:</p>
              <p> <sup id="en-KJV-18568" class="versenum" style="font-size: 0.65em; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: text-top; line-height: normal;">6</sup>That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there is none else.</p>
              <p> <sup id="en-KJV-18569" class="versenum" style="font-size: 0.65em; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: text-top; line-height: normal;">7</sup>I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.</p>

              </div>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>do you see the context here? i bet you don't, so let me further explain. In this 3 verses, the bible contextually was talking about natural phenomena and natural disasters, where only God is able to create light and darkness, to create peace, or disaster.</p>
              <p>Why can i safely say that the hebrew word for evil, "rah" can be translated here as "calamity" or "disaster" rather than "moral evil"?</p>
              <p>because this verse is consistant with other verses in scripture.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; line-height: normal;">

              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as you can see from these 2 verses, God can create natural disasters and involving Himself in problems and disasters on earth.</p>
              <p>The verse in exodus talks about human's frail weaknesses and limitations</p>
              <p>and the verse in amos is talking about calamity and distress. I underlined the word "disaster", because in KJV, it's translated as "evil" (not moral evil, because when a trumpet sound in a city, it's usually because of an invasion, or warning to take cover) -  just like the verse in isaiah. </p>
              <p>so you can see, the word "evil" do not just mean moral evil, it can be other meanings too.</p>
              <p>so since you're just an amateurish jewish wannabe, don't try to act act la. "G_d" here, "G_d" there.. zzz</p>

              <p>reading all these posts makes me laugh!<br>I will relate to you my personal experience and realizations.  Each topic is described in what I thought or felt before and after my 5-6 month stint there as a member of the congregation.</p>
              <p>Giving ($):</p>
              <p>Before -- "no matter how much money I had left in my wallet, i gave as a sign and demonstration of my faith.  I gave something dear to me, something I needed badly at times.  Sometimes I gave all I had in my wallet at the time, and hoped and prayed that god would bless me with sustenance"</p>
              <p>After -- "man, i'm hungry and thirsty.  I think i'll keep my $6 and go to subway for that $5.90 sandwich deal after service"</p>
              <p>Prayer:</p>
              <p>Before -- "my personal prayer to god is mine and mine alone.  No matter how I speak to him, he listens.  Whether I pray silently, or whisper, or yell, or blabber, he will listen.  Every christian has a special, personal way of communicating with the lord"</p>
              <p>After -- "i thought speaking in tongues was unique to every individual?  I thought that it was supposed to come from within every individual's spirit, unique in his or her personal experience with god?  then why does everyone say 'shiggity abba baba'??"</p>
              <p>That's all so far that's meaningful.  All the rest are minor qualms, like hero woship, reservations about the opposite sex, sexy and skimpy outfits at church, that sorta thing.</p>
