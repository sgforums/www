              <p>are you sure it's not as serious as you think? let's see what the bible says -</p>
              <h4>Ezekiel 18</h4>
              <h5>The Soul Who Sins Will Die <strong>(seems quite clear cut here right?)</strong></h5>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Want to see what God says about work-based righteousness?</p>
              <p> <span id="en-NIV-20871" class="sup">21</span> "But if a wicked man
                  turns away from all the sins he has committed and keeps all my decrees
                  and does what is just and right, he will surely live; he will not die. <span id="en-NIV-20872" class="sup">22</span> None of the offenses he has committed will be remembered against him.
                  Because of the righteous things he has done, he will live. <span id="en-NIV-20873" class="sup">23</span> Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the
                  Sovereign LORD. Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways
                  and live?</p>
              <p> <span id="en-NIV-20874" class="sup">24</span> "But
                  if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits sin and
                  does the same detestable things the wicked man does, will he live? None
                  of the righteous things he has done will be remembered. Because of the
                  unfaithfulness he is guilty of and because of the sins he has
                  committed, he will die.</p>
              <p>the tricky part is. can anyone keep God's law 100% of the time? remember, it's not that we can't do good. our problem is that we can't stop from doing bad.</p>

              <p>unless you think that what the bible says is wrong. what inpired paul said is wrong. then i can't say anything about it.</p>
              <p>but this is what the bible says about salvation. in just 4 chapters from romans, with plenty more from all over the bible.</p>
              <p>i'm not saying your quote from james is wrong. but i am saying that you could have interpreted his meaning wrongly. i don't want to beat anyone down, or prove that i am right or you are wrong etc. but i want to show you that, your logic has flaws.</p>
              <p>your defination of salvation is as flakey as my ability to stop sinning completely. you don't know where you stand with God. you're not sure whether what you've done is enough or not. sure, you're better than some people, but are you within the top 10% of His people?</p>
              <p>heck, are you even near the 50%?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that will be your problem if you think that God wants you to earn your salvation.</p>

                      <em>can lose our salvation</em>. We are deluding ourselves if
                      we believe that our salvation is <em>guaranteed</em> just because
                      we have 'accepted Jesus Christ as our personal lord and saviour' at
                      an 'altar call' once before, regardless of how we live out the rest
                      of our lives. Both the bible and the Catholic Church are quite

              <p>yes, good works is in the picture. i never said that good work won't be in my equation. but where is it in my equation? it's after faith in Christ.<strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>faith in Christ = salvation = desire to do good = doing good. (it is the fruit)</strong></p>
              <p>but your equation is</p>
              <p><strong>faith in christ (God's provision not enough, you think you need to perfect Christ's finished work) + good works (you feel better about your stand with God because you've done something which you feel good about) = salvation</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>we're not deluding ourselves by knowing that our salvation is not by works and totally attained by faith in Jesus' finished work. after all, it's what the bible stresses</p>
              <p>but you are deluding yourself in believing that if you do more good works, you have a better chance at being righteous. God said, so what if you do a million good deeds, the moment you sin, all your good deeds are forgotten and you will die. Read Ezekiel 18.</p>
              <p>nobody is righteous. we have all sinned. christian, non-christian. all of us, the entire human race sinned. we are all condemned to die. but a righteousness from God, apart from the law is given to us, through Jesus Christ, we are justfied freely (i really can't stress this enough) through faith.</p>

                  the promise of the Spirit.</strong></span></p>
              <h5>The Law and the Promise</h5>
              <p> <span id="en-NIV-29102" class="sup">15</span>Brothers,
                  let me take an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside
                  or add to a human covenant that has been duly established, so it is in
                  this case. <span id="en-NIV-29103" class="sup">16</span>The promises
                  were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. The Scripture does not say "and
                  to seeds," meaning many people, but "and to your seed,"<sup>[<a title="See footnote g" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=55&amp;chapter=3&amp;version=31#fen-NIV-29103g">g</a>]</sup> meaning one person, who is Christ. <span id="en-NIV-29104" class="sup">17</span>What
                  I mean is this: The law, introduced 430 years later, does not set aside
                  the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the
                  promise. <span id="en-NIV-29105" class="sup">18</span>For if the
                  inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on a promise;
                  but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise.</p>
              <p> <span id="en-NIV-29106" class="sup">19</span>What,
                  then, was the purpose of the law? It was added because of
                  transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come.
                  The law was put into effect through angels by a mediator. <span id="en-NIV-29107" class="sup">20</span>A mediator, however, does not represent just one party; but God is one.</p>
              <p> <span id="en-NIV-29108" class="sup">21</span>Is
                  the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For
                  if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness
                  would certainly have come by the law. <span id="en-NIV-29109" class="sup">22</span>But
                  the Scripture declares that the whole world is a prisoner of sin, so
                  that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ,
                  might be given to those who believe.</p>
              <p> <span id="en-NIV-29110" class="sup">23</span>Before this faith came, we were held prisoners by the law, locked up until faith should be revealed. <span id="en-NIV-29111" class="sup">24</span>So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ<sup>[<a title="See footnote h" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=55&amp;chapter=3&amp;version=31#fen-NIV-29111h">h</a>]</sup> that we might be justified by faith. <span id="en-NIV-29112" class="sup">25</span>Now that faith has come, we are no longer under the supervision of the law.</p>
              <h5>Sons of God</h5>
              <p> <span id="en-NIV-29113" class="sup">26</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus, </span><span id="en-NIV-29114" class="sup">27</span>for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. <span id="en-NIV-29115" class="sup">28</span>There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. <span id="en-NIV-29116" class="sup">29</span>If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.</p>

              <p>if you are still not convinced. let's see what happened when someone tried to add conditions to salvation other than just placing their faith in the grace of God through Jesus Chrst</p>
              <h4>Acts 15</h4>
              <h5>The Council at Jerusalem</h5>
              <p> <span id="en-NIV-27432" class="sup">1</span>Some
              men came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the brothers:
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by Moses,
              you cannot be saved</span>." <span id="en-NIV-27433" class="sup">2</span>This
              brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. So
              Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along with some other believers, to
              go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question. <span id="en-NIV-27434" class="sup">3</span>The
              church sent them on their way, and as they traveled through Phoenicia
              and Samaria, they told how the Gentiles had been converted. This news
              made all the brothers very glad. <span id="en-NIV-27435" class="sup">4</span>When
              they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the
              apostles and elders, to whom they reported everything God had done
              through them.</p>
              <p> <span id="en-NIV-27436" class="sup">5</span>Then
              some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood
              up and said, "The Gentiles must be circumcised and required to obey the
              law of Moses."</p>
              <p> <span id="en-NIV-27437" class="sup">6</span>The apostles and elders met to consider this question. <span id="en-NIV-27438" class="sup">7</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After
              much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them: "Brothers, you know
              that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might
              hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe. <span id="en-NIV-27439" class="sup">8</span>God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us. <span id="en-NIV-27440" class="sup">9</span>He made no distinction between us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith. <span id="en-NIV-27441" class="sup">10</span>Now
              then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of the
              disciples a yoke that neither we nor our fathers have been able to
              bear? <span id="en-NIV-27442" class="sup">11</span>No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are." </span></p>

              <p>I don't understand your point because I just said that I did not say "one can be a Christian without

              <p>There are many people who does good works and yet are not Christians but why do they do good works? Because they worship Satan and Devil, false gods etc...and that prompted them to do good?</p>
              <p>Do you think people (non-Christians) do good works because they are guided by satan??</p>

              <p><em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em></p>
              <p>article 1996: Our justification comes from the grace of God. Grace is <em>favor</em>, the free and undeserved help that God gives us to respond to his call to become children of God, adoptive sons, partakers of the divine nature and of eternal life.</p>

              <p>article 1997: Grace is a <em>participation in the life of God.</em> It introduces us into the intimacy of Trinitarian life: by Baptism the Christian participates in the grace of Christ, the Head of his Body. As an "adopted son" he can henceforth call God "Father," in union with the only Son. He receives the life of the Spirit who breathes charity into him and who forms the Church.</p>

              <p>... seems that according to article 1997.... a person becomes a Christian and then the Spirit breathes charity into him....</p>
              <p>... it must be said that i am not familiar with the Catholic Catechism to comment more.</p>

              <p>And salvation is by faith and good works is what the Bible teaches which of course I will not quote since you won't believe it.</p>

              <p>as i'd said... we all do good works sometime or other, and many
              times without thinking.... i helped an old lady cross the road,
              bought lunch for a blind man, gave a couple of bucks to a disable
              busker... all without thinking....</p>
              <p>so all that said.... many people do good stuff without major
              consideration... (or in your definiton - prompted by God)....</p>
              <p>so no argument what.... that will fit into your mindset and
              definition... and if these people have Jesus then they are
              saved.....</p>
              <p>however, i don't believe doing good works is part of
              salvation..... yet i still do it (like you said - a commandment of
              God).</p>
              <p>at the end of the day....</p>
              <p>you do good work because you think that it is part of salvation
              - and you said you are NOT doing it because of salvation but it's a
              command of God - you go to heaven</p>
              <p>i don't believe good works is part of salvation - and i still do
              it because it's a command of God - i still go to heaven</p>
              <p>everybody wins...</p>
              <p>we are all arguing on technicalities and perhaps to fan our own
              ego or to prove a point...</p>
              <p>.... and i won't leave you a verse... quite pointless to do
              that.....(not being sarcastic, just my personal stand on use of

              <p><em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em></p>
              <p>article 1996: Our justification comes from the grace of God.
              Grace is <em>favor</em>, the free and undeserved help that God
              gives us to respond to his call to become children of God, adoptive
              sons, partakers of the divine nature and of eternal life.</p>

              <p>article 1997: Grace is a <em>participation in the life of
              God.</em> It introduces us into the intimacy of Trinitarian life:
              by Baptism the Christian participates in the grace of Christ, the
              Head of his Body. As an "adopted son" he can henceforth call God
              "Father," in union with the only Son. He receives the life of the
              Spirit who breathes charity into him and who forms the Church.</p>

              <p>... seems that according to article 1997.... a person becomes a
              Christian and then the Spirit breathes charity into him....</p>
              <p>... it must be said that i am not familiar with the Catholic

              <p>so the issue is:</p>
              <p>A.  First viewpoint - good works are needed for salvation.</p>
              <p>B. Second viewpoint - good works are not needed for salvation.</p>
              <p>and then these following common assumptions:</p>
              <p>1. Universally accepted viewpoint - good works are done because of the command of God.</p>
              <p>2. Everyone does (maybe except Hannibal Lector or Idi Amin) good work sometime or other... and many times without knowing or have any hidden agenda.</p>
              <p>3. All Christians will do good work sometime or other (seeing that quantity and quality is not the issue)</p>
              <p>4. Whether one takes on viewpoint A or B, it does not matter because whether one thinks good work is part of salvation or not, as long as good works are done, every Christian goes to heaven.... with the exception of those who does good works with poor intention (who is known only to God).</p>
              <p>5. No one knows who has poor intention except God...</p>
