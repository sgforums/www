              <p>CHC member testimonial taken from another forum</p>
              <div>
              <p>"I was a member of CHC few years back and I was brainwashed by
              them. Brainwashed, as in, really brainwashed. During that time
              family ties and friendships were strained badly because I kept
              preaching to them. Whenever my father forbid me to go to church, I
              would find all means to get out of the house, even resorting to
              lying just to "be close to God" and "with all brothers and sisters,
              experience God's presence".</p>
              <p>One day a friend screamed at me, "You aren't the person I once
              knew." Then I realised how terrible my mindset was being distorted.
              I kept my distance from my cell group mates and stopped going to
              church. Changed a couple of phone numbers and blog URLs. All
              contact has been broken off."</p>

              <p>Who is this person? Why did he had to lie to experience God's presence or to be with brothers and sisters in Christ? To Christians, God is omnipresent.</p>

              <p>I believe the govt is monitoring such churches.   They are doing their part to maintain religious harmony.   Govt may have already sent people there to spy.    Such group is big and can be threatening to the govt, too.   Few years back, think it was the lhl or the father speaking subtlely about displeasure on group of religious people.   </p>

              <p>i could also suggest many other ways</p>
              <p>1. take over the presidency, like Lee Myung Bak, then you can issue order 66 to those pesky Buddhist monks</p>
              <p>2. for those who legally defend those heretic unbelievers, send letters to the Law Scoiety</p>
              <p>3. become NMP and attack the national newspapers if they support those annoying militant secularists</p>

              <p>http://www.pfo.org/four-die.htm<br><br>FOUR DIE AT HINN’S KENYA CRUSADE<br><br>Four
              people, including two young children, died while attending healing
              evangelist Benny Hinn’s crusade in Nairobi, Kenya, last May. The report
              from the Reuters news service said police told a local newspaper, the
              Kenya Times, that “the four had been released from a hospital to be
              cured at Benny Hinn’s ‘Miracle Crusade.’”<br><br><br>http://blog.au.org/2007/01/24/gospel-of-greed-evangelist-benny-hinn-comes-to-washington/<br><br>But
              perhaps even more alarming than Hinn’s “prosperity gospel” is his faith
              healing. Over the years, NBC and other news outlets have interviewed
              several people whom Hinn claims to have healed of afflictions like
              diabetes, cancer and blindness. Follow-up visits showed that many were
              not truly healed. Some had even died.<br><br>A 2003 investigation by
              the Los Angeles Times told the story of William Vandenkolk of Las
              Vegas, then 11 years old and legally blind, who attended a Hinn healing
              crusade in 2001. Vandenkolk was brought up on stage and “healed” by
              Hinn, but there’s just one problem: He’s still blind.<br><br>“It’s pretty sad when you mess with a little boy’s mind,” Randy Melthratter, the boy’s uncle and guardian, told the Times.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sidenote - city harvest is a strong supporter of benny hinn and invites him to singapore to preach in their church.</p>
