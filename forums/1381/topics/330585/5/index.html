              <p>First things first, the Pastor you are referring to, is not paid by the church, Not on CHURCH PAYROLL. So mind your words when you say the church pays the pastors a lot.</p>
              <p>during the services the pastor encourage people to give for offering, Not a single intention to force. besides the bible also mention that you can give without loving but you can never love without giving. Thus if you love the house of God you will not bear not to give.</p>
              <p>Like any houses, if you have an addition to your family you will go into larger homes to house these people in. likewise if the church is growing, it is natural to get a larger place to seat all the members. imagine going home to find out that you don't have a place to even sleep. how sad is that!</p>
              <p>beside the case, the word of God says that anything that is not bearing fruit will be cut off from the branch. how can you as an individual, talk about the growth of the church and yet denying this part of the word.</p>
              <p>Read the word of God in its entirety before coming with all the murmurings.</p>
              <p>and before you start talking again about the church or the pastor and his wife, think about yourself, are you anywhere near them to criticize them?</p>
              <p>how many people have you lead to christ? how many people have you help even though they are not christians. how many schools have you built? have you lived your life that at the end of it people will cry at your demise? or people rejoice over your demise?</p>
              <p>a thought to ponder. watch the tongue, for it is a dangerous weapon. it can make you or do you in....</p>
              <p>As an individual, the word says that the old man shall see visions, the young man shall dream dreams. if thats the case, having vision and dreams for the sake of having it? living out the visions and dreams is what we should be doing.</p>

              <p>Down market is a trend as being said in the bible. Just happened to notice</p>
              <p>4 horse men in the book of revelation also in Matthew 24:3 about all refers to the same thing with similar order. If you have notice this happens in our time as in order as well.</p>
              <p>first we have false doctrine floating in the 80s then gulf war in 1994 then market crisis in 1997 and then Sars around 2002 then we have theory about Jesus is married, "gospal" of judah then we have wars with here and there in middle east then now market crisis again... probably another outbreak coming...</p>
              <p>Anyway, there's solution to this in the bible but it's another subject all together.</p>
              <p>Back to Money -</p>
              <p><span id="en-NKJV-30067" class="sup">Hebrew 7:8</span> Here <strong>mortal men receive tithes</strong>, but there He <em>receives them,</em> of whom it is <strong>witnessed that He lives</strong>. Even Levi, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham, so to speak, for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.</p>
              <p><strong></strong>Malachi 3:10 Bring all the <strong>tithe</strong>s
                  into the storehouse, That there may be food in My house, And <strong>try Me now
                  in this</strong>,” Says the LORD of hosts, “ If I will not open for you the
                  windows of heaven And pour out for you such blessing That there will
                  not be room enough to receive it.</p>
              <p>Now God gave a challenge, will you accept it? I wonder how many here tithes to a church...</p>

              <p>Ok this is my personal take on mega churches,no intention to offend anyone.</p>
              <p>Churches should be reminded what are Jesus’s teachings and should mirror what He stands for, like humility, self sacrifice, and other virtues.</p>
              <p>Jesus could have all the $$ in the world to build mega and beautiful churches for his flocks but instead he usually choosed humble venues like wilderness or mountains etc etc.</p>
              <p><strong>Churches should never engage in any business or profit making activities unless it’s for charity or other good causes.</strong> Remember Jesus himself chase out those greedy merchants from the temples angrily didnt he?</p>
              <p>Even if a church is rich and successful, the extra monies, should be used to set up trusts for or donate direct into charities where $$$ would be use more meaningfully.</p>
              <p>Lastly, Jesus said very clearly like many will come in His name and much of these are wolves in sheep skins. So people should look beyond the glamour and flashy lights and see the real god that the church is subscribing to.</p>
              </div>

              <p>Yes i agree the money they earn should help others. but i don't agree that c<strong>hurches should never engage in any business or profit making activities unless it’s for charity or other good causes. if that is the case, then what about abraham, jacob, solomon? they are all powerful and rich people in their times especially solomon. he is not a businessman but a king. a political. but God allow him to be super rich before he turn away from Him.</strong></p>

              <p>one thing you have to know, pastor Kong is not being paid by CHC. he has his own business yet he make time to do great things for the kingdom of God. somtimes he don't even have the time to rest properly because he had to go to churches overseas to preach.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and besides, if there are pastors who took the money to indulge themselves, they will be punished by God in due time.</p>

              <p>Wow! These are the very famous verses often quoted by tithing teachers that will frighten the shits out of many believers to give. </p>
              <p>  "Will a man rob God? Yet you rob me.<br>      "But you ask, 'How do we rob you?'<br>      "In tithes and offerings.  You are under a curse—the whole nation of you—because you are robbing me. Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this," says the LORD Almighty, "and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that you will not have room enough for it.  Malachi 3:8-10 (NIV).</p>

              <p>Its like u lend people $100 and only wants him/her to return you back $10 but he/she refuse. don't you feel robbed? and will you will lend the person anymore $$? its the same logic.</p>

              also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap
              generously. Each man should give what he <strong>has decided in his
              heart</strong> to give, <strong>not reluctantly or under
              compulsion</strong>, for God loves a <strong>cheerful
              giver</strong>. And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so
              that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will
              abound in every good work. 9As it is written:"He has scattered
              abroad his gifts to the poor;</p>
              <p>his righteousness endures forever."Now he who supplies seed to
              the sower and bread for food <strong>will also supply and
              increase</strong> your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest
              of your righteousness. <strong>You will be made rich in every way
              so that you can be generous on every occasion</strong>, and through

              <h5>Be Generous and Do Good</h5>
              <h4>Galatians 6:<span>6</span> Let him who is taught the

              <p>Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows,
              that he will also reap. For he who sows to his flesh will of the
              flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the
              Spirit reap everlasting life. And let us not grow weary while doing
              good, <strong>for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose
              heart</strong>. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good

              <p>Personally i don't buy into the quota of percentages. From another perspective, i think Jesus abolished hard numbers percentages after the event of the old woman donating at the temple. 10% or any percent is easy after you have killed yourself into giving it as a forced obligation, but any amount with your heart is equally welcomed in the eyes of the Lord.</p>
              <p>That is to say that the hearts of those who give freely without coersion will be truely blessed. Be it 1 % or 10% or 100%</p>
              <p>The same cannot be said for those who receive these offerings physically and use them for their own selfish gains.</p>

              <p>Jesus never intended that making $$$ as a part
              of the church's function, so why should it spend time and
              resources to engage in any businesses other then
              fundraising activities for charities or good causes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sorry, I also find it very strange that you would compare a
              church to abraham, jacob and even solomon as they are very
              different entities all together.</p>

              <p>erm.. how to say.. because alot people feel that church pastor should not be rich 4 wad reason i don't know. because they should be serving God? i compare with 'em is because i want to say God not only wants us to serve Him, but he also wants us to be the top and not the bottom. that how abraham they all are. if just because pastor are being running a succssful biz, they are said not a good pastor?  thus, the church is not a gd church?</p>

              <p>Perhaps U may like to read the whole book of malachi and then
                  answer the following questions:</p>
              <p>1. Who are the people that are involved in the discussions in
                  the book of malachi.</p>
              <p>2. What are the issues?  Is it regarding temple worship
                  under the Law of Moses, or is it regarding  $$$.?</p>
              <p>For your benefits and study, i will highlight the following
                  verses:</p>
              <p>"And now this commandment is for you, O priests.  Malachi
                  2:1 (NASB)</p>
              <p>"Then you will know that I have sent this commandment to you,
                  that My covenant may continue with Levi," says the LORD of
                  hosts  Malachi 2:4 (NASB)</p>
              <p>"You are presenting defiled food upon My altar But you say, 'How
                  have we defiled You?' In that you say, 'The table of the LORD is to
                  be despised.'</p>
              <p> "But when you present the blind for sacrifice, is it not
                  evil? And when you present the lame and sick, is it not evil? Why
                  not offer it to your governor? Would he be pleased with you? Or
                  would he receive you kindly?" says the LORD of hosts. Malachi 1:7-8
                  (NASB)</p>
              <p>"But you are profaning it, in that you say, 'The table of the
                  Lord is defiled, and as for its fruit, its food is to be
                  despised.'</p>
              <p> "You also say, 'My, how tiresome it is!' And you
                  disdainfully sniff at it," says the LORD of hosts, "and you bring
                  what was taken by robbery and what is lame or sick; so you bring
                  the offering! Should I receive that from your hand?" says the
                  LORD.</p>
              <p> "But cursed be the swindler who has a male in his flock
                  and vows it, but sacrifices a blemished animal to the Lord, for I
                  am a great King," says the LORD of hosts, "and My name is feared
                  among the nations."  Malachi 1:12-14 (NASB)</p>
              <p>"Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, so that there may be
                  food in My house, and test Me now in this," says the LORD of hosts,
                  "if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for
                  you a blessing until it overflows.</p>
              <p>"Then I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will not
                  destroy the fruits of the ground; nor will your vine in the field
                  cast its grapes," says the LORD of hosts.  Malachi 3:10-11
                  (NASB)</p>
              <p>BTW are U aware that it is Hashem, Blessed is He Adonai
                  Elohin King of the Universe, that take care and sustain both
                  believers and unbelievers till the end of the age. There is no pre
                  conditions.  Hashem is G-d of all the nations.  Let me
                  ask u, who is god in the NT. The god of the NT bless and sustain
                  only those who tithes $$$? How sad.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The God of the OT is the same as the God in the NT... He is the same Yesterday, Today and Tommorrow. The verses in Malachi talks of God pouring out the blessings of Heaven on his poeple who obey his commandment to tithe. God never said that He would not sustain the unbelievers. Indeed He does that too. BUT there's a difference between sustaining a person, and blessing a person with overflowing abundance. That's the difference the Malachi verses expounded on.</p>
              <p>In short, it means this:</p>
              <p>Tithe= God pours his blessings upon you and let's you walk in abundance and not in lack. And God will ensure your blessings stay with you and not get taken away from you by force.</p>
              <p>No Tithe= God WON'T omit his blessings and sustains you, but He will juz stop at the sustaining level, it will not move on to abundance, just that you have enough to get by. And little protection against forces that may come against you to snatch away what little you have.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And Malachi was expounding on the church in general, encompassing $$, temple worship, everything, NOT limiting to a single issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>regarding that church thing i think i got somthing wrong. i lataer home then read again. btw, tks for pointing out the malachi verses. nv really read that detail in OT. &gt;.&lt;</p>

              <p>Personally i don't buy into the quota of percentages. From another perspective, i think Jesus abolished hard numbers percentages after the event of the old woman donating at the temple. 10% or any percent is easy after you have killed yourself into giving it as a forced obligation, but any amount with your heart is equally welcomed in the eyes of the Lord.</p>

              <p>Shalom, May the peace of Hashem be with you.  Although tithing is compulsory under the Law of Moses during/before the 1st and 2nd temple period.  Tithes, under the Law of Moses only applies to livestocks and certain crops.  It is not about $$$.   Under the Law of Moses, Jesus, a carpenter, don't  tithes cos there is no tithes on $$$.  His followers who were fishermen also don't  tithes, cos there is no tithes on fish under the Law of Moses. </p>

              <p><br>Ok it seems that there are some serious misconception here:</p>
              <p>"erm.. how to say.. because alot people feel that church pastor should not be rich 4 wad reason i don't know. because they should be serving God?"</p>
              <p>I should think that any respectable pastor would not want to draw more funds then he needs. The church I used to go paid the pastor barely 3k even tho the church can afford more (the church published the accounts on monthly basis so everyone knows how the $$ were used and thats how I know his salary). Anyway, during one of his services, he said, even if the church paid him more, the $$ will end up in the bank and he rather use the $$$ to fund missions, print more tracts or other ways that can bring glory to His name. </p>
              <p>You see, it is not we want the pastor to be poor, as along as the needs of the pastor and his family are taken care of comfortably, the extra $$$ can be channelled for better use.</p>
              <p>In addition, if a pastor is living the expensive lifestyle, isnt he being the exact opposite of Jesus who lived a humble life?? Personally, I think its a serious breach of conduct because I have seen many potential souls being pushed away from the Lord. These souls claimed that Christians are hypocrites and cited examples of pastors not doing what the bible teaches, "to be humble".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"i compare with 'em is because i want to say God not only wants us to serve Him, but he also wants us to be the top and not the bottom. that how abraham they all are"</p>
              <p>Let me ask you, why do you have to compare to Abraham, Solomon they all, why not you compare with the leapers, the beggers, the whores???? Jesus died to save ALL not just the elites.</p>
              <p>Whether u r top or bottom on the social ladder has no meaning to Him. God only wants you to follow His ways and to be successful in whatever plans He has for you, be it if you are a king or a farmer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"if just because pastor are being running a succssful biz, they are said not a good pastor?  thus, the church is not a gd church?"</p>
              <p>The role of a pastor is to lead, to educate, to guide God's children and to spread His Words. I never come across a single verse in the bible that tells a church leader to go do biz and earn $$$. Quite the opposite, Jesus in many occassions told us not to bother about earthly weath.</p>
              <p>If a pastor is busy running a biz, strictly speaking he is wasting God's time as he could have gone out and win more souls for the Lord isnt it???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS. This is a longest post I ever made and I hope its worth the effort, esp if it is able to correct your misconceptions. Cheers</p>

              <p>The issue is not about giving10% of your income for charity or good works etc, the issue is about the  misuse of scriptures to collect $$$. </p>
              <p>Please also consider Hashem command on how the poor are to be provided for under the Law of Moses.</p>
              <p>For your benefits and study i will highlight the following verses:</p>
              <p>"When you reap your harvest in your field and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, you shall not go back to get it; it shall be for the alien, for the orphan, and for the widow, in order that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.</p>
              <p>"When you beat your olive tree, you shall not go over the boughs again; it shall be for the alien, for the orphan, and for the widow.</p>
              <p> "When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not go over it again; it shall be for the alien, for the orphan, and for the widow.</p>
              <p>"You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt; therefore I am commanding you to do this thing.  Deuteronomy 24:19-22 (NASB)</p>
              <p>'Now in case a countryman of yours becomes poor and his means with regard to you falter, then you are to sustain him, like a stranger or a sojourner, that he may live with you. Leviticus 25:35 (NASB)</p>
              <p>"If there is a poor man with you, one of your brothers, in any of your towns in your land which the LORD your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart, nor close your hand from your poor brother;</p>
              <p> but you shall freely open your hand to him, and shall generously lend him sufficient for his need in whatever he lacks.</p>
              <p> "Beware that there is no base thought in your heart, saying, 'The seventh year, the year of remission, is near,' and your eye is hostile toward your poor brother, and you give him nothing; then he may cry to the LORD against you, and it will be a sin in you.</p>
              <p> "You shall generously give to him, and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him, because for this thing the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in all your undertakings.</p>
              <p> "For the poor will never cease to be in the land; therefore I command you, saying, 'You shall freely open your hand to your brother, to your needy and poor in your land.'   Deuteronomy 15:7-11 (NASB)</p>
              <p>The main purpose of tithes is for temple worship and also the Levites; cos they will have no inheritance among the tribes of Isreal in the promised Land.  The poor living among them will be cared for in other provisions in the Law of Moses. So please do yourself a favour- don't misuse Hashem scriptures.</p>
