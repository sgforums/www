              <p>The growing prevalence of the prosperity gospel around the world, and particularly in Africa, has prompted a group of theologians to release a statement of concern and a call for further reflection.</p>
              <p>While recognising that "there are some dimensions of prosperity teaching that have roots in the Bible", the Lausanne Theology Working Group says its overall view is that "the teachings of those who most vigorously promote the 'prosperity gospel' are false and gravely distorting of the Bible".</p>
              <p>The statement was released this month through Christianity Today and is derived from a number of papers that were discussed at the group's meetings in October 2008 and September 2009.</p>
              <p>The theology group, which includes the Revs Dr Chris Wright and Dr John Azumah, makes clear that its intent is not to be "exclusively negative" regarding the health and wealth gospel and recognises the social realities within which the teaching flourishes. But the group finds the overall impact of the teachings on churches pastorally damaging, spiritually unhealthy and may even deflect people from the message and means of eternal salvation.</p>
              <p>"We ... request the Lausanne movement to be willing to make a very clear statement rejecting the excesses of prosperity teaching as incompatible with evangelical biblical Christianity," the statement reads.</p>
              <p>Prosperity gospel, as defined by the Lausanne theologians, is the teaching that "believers have a right to the blessings of health and wealth and that they can obtain these blessings through positive confessions of faith and the 'sowing of seeds' through the faithful payments of tithes and offerings".</p>
              <p>Pentecostal churches are largely associated with the teaching. In a 2006 Pew Forum survey, a majority of Pentecostals in the 10 countries surveyed said they believed God would grant good health and relief from sickness to believers who had enough faith. In nine of the countries, most Pentecostals say that God will grant material prosperity to all who have enough faith. Higher majorities of African believers were found to embrace the teachings.</p>
              <p>The prosperity gospel, however, is a phenomenon that cuts across denominational barriers, the Lausanne group acknowledges, and can be found in charismatic as well as mainstream Protestant churches.</p>
              <p>Among some of the prosperity teachings the theologians reject is the notion that "God's miraculous power can be treated as automatic, or at the disposal of human techniques, or manipulated by human words, actions or rituals".</p>
              <p>They also "deplore the clear evidence that many of them have in practice moved away from key and fundamental tenets of evangelical faith, including the authority and priority of the Bible as the Word of God, and the centrality of the cross of Christ".</p>
              <p>While recognising the phenomenal growth of the numbers of professing Christians and the testimonies of those who have been positively impacted by prosperity teachings, the group observes equally the many people who have been "duped" by the teachings into false faith and false expectations.</p>
              <p>The Lausanne group also points out the flamboyant lifestyle and manipulative behavior of many leaders who promote prosperity teachings as unethical and idolatrous.</p>
              <p>While the prosperity gospel enriches those who preach it, multitudes of people, particularly the poor, are left no better off than before and with the added burden of disappointed hopes, the statement adds.</p>
              <p>The statement notes that much of the teaching comes from North American sources.</p>
              <p>In the United States, six ministries that promote the prosperity gospel are being investigated by Senator Chuck Grassley following media reports and allegations of opulent spending and possible abuse of nonprofit status. They have been asked to submit financial records and answer questions regarding organisational and personal spending.</p>
              <p>The ministries being probed include Joyce Meyer Ministries, World Healing Center Church, Without Walls International Church, New Birth Missionary Baptist Church/Eddie L Long Ministries, Kenneth Copeland Ministries, and World Changers Church International/Creflo Dollar Ministries.</p>
              <p>The Lausanne Theology Working Group serves the Lausanne Movement, a Christian movement focused on world evangelisation.</p>

              <p><br>hmm i think you're missing out the part where the wise men from the east offered Jesus boxes of gold, frankincense and myrrh? Its not that the family couldn't afford the rentals; the problem is, there is no vacancy.</p>
              <p>How about the part when Judas was stealing a hugh amount of money and bought a piece of land?  No one was aware of it and the ministries were not affected. I mean it must be a really small portion that no one realised it, right?... If 0.1% of the fund can buy land... imagine 100% of it?</p>
              <p>If Jesus was ever poor, you think the roman soldiers would be so hard up for His undergarments and tunic? i mean it must really good stuff for the soldiers to be wanting it so badly right?</p>
              <p>Jesus is a humble person, i agree with that part. But definitely not a Person who is in the lack.... He's a rich man! Think again! Thanks! :)</p>

              <p><br> hmm i think you're missing out the part where the wise men from the
              east offered Jesus boxes of gold, frankincense and myrrh? Its not
              that the family couldn't afford the rentals; the problem is, there
              is no vacancy.</p>
              <p>How about the part when Judas was stealing a hugh amount of
              money and bought a piece of land?  No one was aware of it
              and the ministries were not affected. I mean it must
              be a really small portion that no one realised it, right?...
              If 0.1% of the fund can buy land... imagine 100% of it?</p>
              <p>If Jesus was ever poor, you think the roman soldiers would be
              so hard up for His undergarments and tunic? i mean it must

              <p>So Jesus accepted the boxes of gold and etc.? Or maybe his parents?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why would roman soldiers want his undergarments and tunic? Who knows? Maybe theirs are worn and torn, think about it they are bloody soldiers. Roman Empire was often at war.</p>
              <p>So going by your logic on the story of Judas, stealing is okay if no one finds out? Good for you, which Church you go to?</p>

Every single person are going through different facet of their life. You should love yourself, to look for the church that suits you than keep arguing what's should be done and end up with ANGER &amp; FRUSTRATING. GO seek yourself with <strong>RIGHT WORD</strong>. You'll know when you found it (When you find yourself in peace &amp; calm)</div>
              <div>I can see NCC's clan and CHC's clan or even outsiders are discussing what's right and what's wrong about their way of preaching. <strong>I personally view it as different messages reaching out to different people. We should be united to get more people to know more about Jesus. Isn't it, right?? </strong>Bare in mind human fail, but not Jesus. As long we are clear about this, we will never regret or dissapointed, because Jesus is perfect.<br><br>The thing is both are also right in their preaching. It doesn't matter who is better or who wrongs more or who is nearer to Jesus. <strong>In fact, BOTH churches have SAVED a lots of SOULS</strong> that's for sure and these souls are on their journey to know their saviour the "JESUS". <br><br>My point here is, <strong>as long as the person got saved in any of the church</strong>, it is the right church for him/her at that time. And that person has allowed Jesus entered into his life to FREE himself from burden/resentment/unforgiveness. We should shout "REJOICE! REJOICE!

              <div>Guard our heart (Peace/Calm/Listen), that is for sure we can control ourself if we have the WILL+Jesus' in the midst; But not the EXTERNAL (which is unpredictable factor). Spend time meditate on God's word which I think it is utmost important.</div>

              <p>Hmmm i hear many versions... Generally...</p>
              <p>Some say Cell group behaves exactly like you mentioned.</p>
              <p>Some say even after they left CHC the people still keep in touch and still in good relationship. The Cell group still helps them out when they have financial need though they are not with CHC.</p>
              <p>Many people in CHC and the people in there behaves differently too. So do we use 1 pole to hit the whole boat people? Similarly 1 singaporean drug trafficking oversea. Do we assume All singaporean do Drug trafficking too?</p>

              <p>Ok this is my personal take on mega churches,no intention to offend anyone.</p>
              <p>Churches should be reminded what are Jesus’s teachings and should mirror what He stands for, like humility, self sacrifice, and other virtues.</p>
              <p>Jesus could have all the $$ in the world to build mega and beautiful churches for his flocks but instead he usually choosed humble venues like wilderness or mountains etc etc.</p>
              <p>Churches should never engage in any business or profit making activities unless it’s for charity or other good causes. Remember Jesus himself chase out those greedy merchants from the temples angrily didnt he?</p>
              <p>Even if a church is rich and successful, the extra monies, should be used to set up trusts for or donate direct into charities where $$$ would be use more meaningfully.</p>
              <p>Lastly, Jesus said very clearly like many will come in His name and much of these are wolves in sheep skins. So people should look beyond the glamour and flashy lights and see the real god that the church is subscribing to.</p>

              <p>yeah, agree with you. kwan imm hood cho temple (temple of goddess of mercy) at waterloo street (bugis) is also very rich. instead of expanding the temple, it builds a kidney dialysis centre to help the poor who can't afford to pay for the medical service.</p>
              <p>in fact, the temple is not big enough to contain the devotees especially during festive seasons, many devotees got to pray outside the temple because it is too crowded.</p>
