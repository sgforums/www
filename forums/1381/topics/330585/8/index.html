              <p>hmm, christians generally believe that the gifts of the holy spirit, one of the most common one is tongues.</p>
              <p>u know the jews have this candlestand with 7 or 9 candles on it? it's symbolizing the different gifts of the spirit. and u use one candle to light the other candles. that candle lighting the rest, symbolize the gifts of tongues. tts what my mentor shared la.</p>
              <p>speaking in tongues happened during the book of Acts, when Jesus was still alive, he told his disciples to remain in the city, and wait for the councillor whom he will send to them. he said he will not leave them as orphans, but send someone to be with them. that was the holy spirit</p>
              <p>so one day the disciples were praying, then suddenly tongues of fire appear</p>
              <p>and came onto the disciples, and they started speaking in a different language. </p>
              <p>there are generally 2 types of tongues, one of which is human language - the ability to speak another language without having learnt it before, and another is utterance and groans. because in the bible, it is also said, that the holy spirit will intercede for us, pray for us in groans (citation needed)</p>
              <p>so ya lor. i can testify tongues are real, because my dad could speak it, without having heard of it, or even know what it's about.</p>
              <p>one night he was praying over my sis (new believer), suddenly he started uttering noises. he never knew what was tongues at that point of time. until our cell leader explained to us what happened to him.</p>

              <p><br> <strong>(1)</strong> The bible said it, but it's not specifically about money. It can be
              your sacrifice, your time, your skills....</p>
              <p>Hinn will always only go the money way...</p>
              <p><strong>(2)</strong> In the first place, why should Christians desire to give more
              money in order to blessed with (specifically)
              <strong>riches</strong>??? Where in the Bible is that stated? Isn't
              that greed?</p>
              <p>To me, it goes against the grain of Biblical teachings to desire
              wealth.</p>

              <p>(1) Cannot agree with you more....</p>
              <p>(2) Because they play with the human emotions and psychology (to want more) by twisting the Bible messages..... They have a few quotes and it is in the bible (wrong context to us though).</p>
              <p>Example, I once read someone who said that when Jesus asked Simon (Peter) to cast his net into the sea and pull it out, it was full of fishes.....but ignore the fact later that Jesus said he wants Simon to be "fisher of men". They said it was a proof that God wants us to be rich and will reward us with riches if we follow Jesus....just that they use fishes instead of notes at that time.....</p>
              <p>You termed it as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>GREED</strong></span>....but they have a "better" word for it - "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>GRACE</strong></span>" ministry - same 5 letters G word.</p>
              <p>Beside the teaching of Greed (oops Grace...?) they also have many other dubious teachings....so it is good that people should really think tiwce and search before going....</p>
