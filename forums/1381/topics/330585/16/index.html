              <p>hmm. it's a rather tricky issue.</p>
              <p>i'm not so concerned about it - firstly, salvation comes from
              believing in the truth, not what the preacher says, but what the
              bible says.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>we are all sinners</li>
              <li>we cannot save ourselves</li>
              <li>Jesus lived a sinless life, died a sinner's death and
              ressurected again, conquering death on our behalf</li>
              <li>salvation comes only through faith in Christ alone</li>
              </ol>
              <div>this is what chc preaches. sure some of the things they do are
              controversal, but the bible says, a good tree does not bear bad
              fruits, a bad tree does not bear good fruits. i've some friends
              from chc who turned out God loving people, full of grace and
              love. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>they might not have been saved if they weren't invited into
              chc. so something good did happen (even if the church is bad).
              ultimately, God is the one in control. He can use rotten churches
              in His will too. so don't worry about what they're doing with their
              bankbooks, worry about your own salvation (if you haven't believe
              in Jesus)</div>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>True...But will you consider a chc a good tree knowing the kind of negative views they get from Christians and non-Christians alike?</p>
              <p>Salvation is not the only thing about being Christians....and salvation comes about only when one has true faith in Christ and live a life of love and charity.</p>
              <p>In chc, you only need to visit them once, raise your hand and the pastor will say "You are saved" and then give you a small booklet and a CD (with Sun Ho's song of course).....that's salvation? Saved liao?</p>

              <p>So did I make any absolute decision on chc as you said I did?</p>
              <p>And for salvation, I am asking you - do you seriously think that by going to chc once, putting up my hand and the pastor said "You are saved" and I am saved?</p>
              <p>What good news is preached? That I need to pay 10% of my income to buy God's blessings? The more I "pay", the more He gives? And in monetary terms?</p>
              <p>You seriously think that is the same as what you described as "you only need to hear the good news, receive
                                                  Jesus, by faith, into your life as Lord and Savior, and you are

              <p>You are wrong to say that I "don't even believe that the bible is
                                                  historically accurate and authoratative" - that is not what I meant. Of course I am a Catholic Christain and I believed in God and trust the bible teachings 100%.</p>
              <p>Current chc status as compared to corrupt Pope is comparing current events with history. Nobody said that history did not happen. You should compare current Catholic Church status with current chc. And you know since you attend Mass and maybe going to chc too will help....</p>
              <p>So, do you think we should hate the Japanese, take revenge, boycott their products, don't watch their programme, don't visit Japan and kick all Japanese out of Singapore because of what they did during world war II?</p>
              <p>Or do you think God teaches us to forgive and reconcile?</p>
              <p>Singapore government have corrupt ministers before....does that means they are still corrupted and will be corrupted forever? NKF have bad CEO and management in the past, does it means that NKF is still corrupted and cheating doners of money?</p>
              <p>Then how do you want to brand protestant based on Jack Chick and co?</p>

              <p>The act of selling church positions and indulgences should be condemned. It is debatable whether the commissioning of the crusades was necessarily evil intentioned. These human failings do not affect the official teachings of the Catholic Church which I consider to be the repository of the fullness of the Christian faith as taught by Jesus and his apostles.  </p>

              <p><strong>Question: "What does the Bible say about the prosperity gospel?"<br><br> Answer: </strong> In the prosperity gospel, also known as the “Word of Faith,” the
              believer is told to use God, whereas the truth of biblical Christianity
              is just the opposite—God uses the believer. Word Faith or prosperity
              theology sees the Holy Spirit as a power to be put to use for whatever
              the believer wills. The Bible teaches that the Holy Spirit is a Person
              who enables the believer to do God's will. The prosperity gospel
              movement closely resembles some of the destructive greed sects that
              infiltrated the early church. Paul and the other apostles were not
              accommodating to or conciliatory with the false teachers who propagated
              such heresy. They identified them as dangerous false teachers and urged
              Christians to avoid them.<br><br> Paul warned Timothy about “constant friction between men of depraved
              mind and deprived of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means
              of gain.... But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a
              snare and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into ruin
              and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil,
              and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and
              pierced themselves with many griefs. But flee from these things, you
              man of God, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love,
              perseverance and gentleness.” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/1%20Timothy%206.5">1 Timothy 6:5</a>, <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/1%20Timothy%206.9-11">9-11</a>.)<br><br> Paul said covetousness is idolatry (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Ephesians%205.5">Ephesians 5:5</a>) and instructed the Ephesians to avoid anyone who brought a message of immorality or covetousness (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Ephesians%205.6-7">Ephesians 5:6-7</a>).
              Prosperity teaching prohibits God from working on His own, meaning that
              God is not Lord of all because He cannot work until we release Him to
              do so. Faith, according to the Word of Faith doctrine, is not
              submissive trust in God; faith is a formula by which we manipulate the
              spiritual laws prosperity teachers believe govern the universe. As in
              the name “Word of Faith” implies, this movement teaches that faith is a
              matter of what we say more than who we trust or what truths we embrace
              and affirm in our hearts.<br><br> A favorite term in the Word of Faith movement is “positive confession.”
              It refers to the teaching that words have creative power. What you say,
              Word of Faith teachers claim, determines everything that happens to
              you. Your confessions, especially the favors you demand of God, must
              all be stated positively and without wavering. Then God is required to
              answer (as though man could require anything of God!). Thus God's
              ability to bless us supposedly hangs on our faith. <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/James%204.13-16">James 4:13-16</a> clearly contradicts this teaching, “Come now, you who say, Today or
              tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, and spend a year there and
              engage in business and make a profit. Yet you do not know what your
              life will be like tomorrow. You are just a vapor that appears for a
              little while and then vanishes away. Instead, you ought to say, If the
              Lord wills, we will live and also do this or that. But as it is, you
              boast in your arrogance; all such boasting is evil.”<br><br> Far from stressing the importance of wealth, the Bible warns against pursuing it. Believers, especially leaders in the church (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/1%20Timothy%203.3">1 Timothy 3:3</a>), are to be free from the love of money (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Hebrews%2013.5">Hebrews 13:5</a>). The love of money leads to all kinds of evil (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/1%20Timothy%206.10">1 Timothy 6:10</a>).
              Jesus warned, “Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed;
              a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Luke%2012.15">Luke 12:15</a>).
              In sharp contrast to the Word of Faith emphasis on gaining money and
              possessions in this life, Jesus said “Do not lay up for yourselves
              treasures upon earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves
              break in and steal” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Matthew%206.19">Matthew 6:19</a>).
              The irreconcilable contradiction between prosperity teaching gospel and
              the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ is best summed up in the words of
              Jesus in <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Matthew%206.24">Matthew 6:24</a>, “You cannot serve God and riches.”</p>

              <p>rich folks like the owner of 77th street? look at the
              Scientologists, movie stars are in their membership.....</p>

              <p>Here's my one-way traffic opinion...CHC rules like "everyone have to donate 10% of their salary to the church COMPULSORY" every month is absolute rubbish! You donate at your own free will &amp; capabilities. CHC is not a church, It's an entertainment centre using "christianity" as an excuse to do their dirty work &amp; it's ruining the name of catholic churches. Most of the public thinks that the catholic also seek converts at MRT stations, bus stops &amp; shopping malls. Catholics don't "pulled" people into their faith, you join at your own free will.</p>
              <p>Catholics still stick to the traditional way of praying. Don't believe go to a catholic mass(aka service) &amp; see for urselves.</p>

              <p>City harvest preaches a doctrine known as the prosperity gospel:</p>
              <p>Donnie Swaggart, a notable <a class="mw-redirect" title="Pentecostal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecostal">Pentecostal</a> minister, has preached strongly against the prosperity gospel. He has
              gone on record for saying, "The modern-day greed gospel is one of the
              worst cancers and blights on the present-day Church. I don't apologize
              for saying that, I'm not gonna back up for saying that, and I'm not
              gonna apologize saying that. It is evil, it is a cancer, and it leads
              to covetousness, and it leads to destruction. There is no difference
              between the evil of that message and the evil of Las Vegas, Atlantic
              City, or any other place of gambling. Actually, Las Vegas and Atlantic
              City and any other casino is more holy than that demonic greed gospel,
              because casinos do not bring God into their lives."</p>

              <p>lol, yesterday at cell we were discussing this. we came to this conclusion. if the message preached focuses on Jesus, the giver, and not the gifts, and it benefits you, makes you more confident about your future, makes you draw closer to God, makes you desire to know God more, gives you peace, then it is a good gospel.</p>
              <p>i can't really find fault in a message which essentially says, "In whatever situation you are in, God loves you, He will see you through, trust Him."</p>
