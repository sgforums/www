              <p>as for a verse about money, i'm not sure if this sounds pathetic, but there's no specific quote about the Holy Trinity either.</p>
              <p>But the bible does speak alot about God's abundant provision, would that count as "money"?</p>

              <p><strong>Question: "What does the Bible say about the prosperity gospel?"<br><br> Answer: </strong> In the prosperity gospel, also known as the “Word of Faith,” the
              believer is told to use God, whereas the truth of biblical Christianity
              is just the opposite—God uses the believer. Word Faith or prosperity
              theology sees the Holy Spirit as a power to be put to use for whatever
              the believer wills. The Bible teaches that the Holy Spirit is a Person
              who enables the believer to do God's will. The prosperity gospel
              movement closely resembles some of the destructive greed sects that
              infiltrated the early church. Paul and the other apostles were not
              accommodating to or conciliatory with the false teachers who propagated
              such heresy. They identified them as dangerous false teachers and urged
              Christians to avoid them.<br><br> Paul warned Timothy about “constant friction between men of depraved
              mind and deprived of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means
              of gain.... But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a
              snare and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into ruin
              and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil,
              and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and
              pierced themselves with many griefs. But flee from these things, you
              man of God, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love,
              perseverance and gentleness.” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/1%20Timothy%206.5">1 Timothy 6:5</a>, <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/1%20Timothy%206.9-11">9-11</a>.)<br><br> Paul said covetousness is idolatry (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Ephesians%205.5">Ephesians 5:5</a>) and instructed the Ephesians to avoid anyone who brought a message of immorality or covetousness (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Ephesians%205.6-7">Ephesians 5:6-7</a>).
              Prosperity teaching prohibits God from working on His own, meaning that
              God is not Lord of all because He cannot work until we release Him to
              do so. Faith, according to the Word of Faith doctrine, is not
              submissive trust in God; faith is a formula by which we manipulate the
              spiritual laws prosperity teachers believe govern the universe. As in
              the name “Word of Faith” implies, this movement teaches that faith is a
              matter of what we say more than who we trust or what truths we embrace
              and affirm in our hearts.<br><br> A favorite term in the Word of Faith movement is “positive confession.”
              It refers to the teaching that words have creative power. What you say,
              Word of Faith teachers claim, determines everything that happens to
              you. Your confessions, especially the favors you demand of God, must
              all be stated positively and without wavering. Then God is required to
              answer (as though man could require anything of God!). Thus God's
              ability to bless us supposedly hangs on our faith. <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/James%204.13-16">James 4:13-16</a> clearly contradicts this teaching, “Come now, you who say, Today or
              tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, and spend a year there and
              engage in business and make a profit. Yet you do not know what your
              life will be like tomorrow. You are just a vapor that appears for a
              little while and then vanishes away. Instead, you ought to say, If the
              Lord wills, we will live and also do this or that. But as it is, you
              boast in your arrogance; all such boasting is evil.”<br><br> Far from stressing the importance of wealth, the Bible warns against pursuing it. Believers, especially leaders in the church (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/1%20Timothy%203.3">1 Timothy 3:3</a>), are to be free from the love of money (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Hebrews%2013.5">Hebrews 13:5</a>). The love of money leads to all kinds of evil (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/1%20Timothy%206.10">1 Timothy 6:10</a>).
              Jesus warned, “Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed;
              a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Luke%2012.15">Luke 12:15</a>).
              In sharp contrast to the Word of Faith emphasis on gaining money and
              possessions in this life, Jesus said “Do not lay up for yourselves
              treasures upon earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves
              break in and steal” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Matthew%206.19">Matthew 6:19</a>).
              The irreconcilable contradiction between prosperity teaching gospel and
              the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ is best summed up in the words of
              Jesus in <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Matthew%206.24">Matthew 6:24</a>, “You cannot serve God and riches.”</p>

                  godliness, faith, love, perseverance and gentleness.” (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/1%20Timothy%206.5">1 Timothy 6:5</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/1%20Timothy%206.9-11">9-11</a>.)<br> <br> Paul said covetousness is idolatry (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Ephesians%205.5">Ephesians 5:5</a>) and instructed the Ephesians to avoid
                  anyone who brought a message of immorality or covetousness
                  (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Ephesians%205.6-7">Ephesians 5:6-7</a>). Prosperity teaching
                  prohibits God from working on His own, meaning that God is not Lord
                  of all because He cannot work until we release Him to do so. Faith,
                  according to the Word of Faith doctrine, is not submissive trust in
                  God; faith is a formula by which we manipulate the spiritual laws
                  prosperity teachers believe govern the universe. As in the name
                  “Word of Faith” implies, this movement teaches that faith is a
                  matter of what we say more than who we trust or what truths we
                  embrace and affirm in our hearts.<br> <br> A favorite term in the Word of Faith movement is “positive
                  confession.” It refers to the teaching that words have creative
                  power. What you say, Word of Faith teachers claim, determines
                  everything that happens to you. Your confessions, especially the
                  favors you demand of God, must all be stated positively and without
                  wavering. Then God is required to answer (as though man could
                  require anything of God!). Thus God's ability to bless us
                  supposedly hangs on our faith. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/James%204.13-16">James 4:13-16</a> clearly contradicts this teaching,
                  “Come now, you who say, Today or tomorrow we will go to such and
                  such a city, and spend a year there and engage in business and make
                  a profit. Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow.
                  You are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then
                  vanishes away. Instead, you ought to say, If the Lord wills, we
                  will live and also do this or that. But as it is, you boast in your
                  arrogance; all such boasting is evil.”<br> <br> Far from stressing the importance of wealth, the Bible warns
                  against pursuing it. Believers, especially leaders in the church
                  (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/1%20Timothy%203.3">1 Timothy 3:3</a>), are to be free from the
                  love of money (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Hebrews%2013.5">Hebrews 13:5</a>). The love of money leads to all kinds
                  of evil (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/1%20Timothy%206.10">1 Timothy 6:10</a>). Jesus warned, “Watch out! Be on
                  your guard against all kinds of greed; a man's life does not
                  consist in the abundance of his possessions” (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Luke%2012.15">Luke 12:15</a>). In sharp contrast to the Word of Faith
                  emphasis on gaining money and possessions in this life, Jesus said
                  “Do not lay up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and
                  rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal” (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Matthew%206.19">Matthew 6:19</a>). The irreconcilable contradiction
                  between prosperity teaching gospel and the gospel of our Lord Jesus
                  Christ is best summed up in the words of Jesus in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Matthew%206.24">Matthew 6:24</a>, “You cannot serve God and riches.”</p>

              <p>ah i understand.</p>
              <p>the impt part is that God uses the believer, and not the believer "uses" God.</p>
              <p>but one thing i think u should understand.. <span style="font-weight: bold;">God is sovereign.. Nobody uses Him</span>, He does as He pleases. He blesses who He wish to bless, nothing changes that, even if we're children of God.</p>
              <p>but the fact still stand is this, the message that God loves us, and it wouldn't matter how bad the situation, God will supply our needs, God will give us everything we need to see through our bad situations - is a good message.</p>
              <p>God gave us His son, while we were still sinners, what good things wouldn't He keep from us.</p>
              <p>If God feels that some believers may not be ready for great wealth, I know He will withhold it from them until the time is right, when the believer is ready to be responsible and be a good steward.</p>
              <p>I agree, the love of money is evil, but money isn't. God blessed so many ppl in the bible with riches. And the thing about riches is - Paul says that it's important to know how to live when you're rich, and how to live when you're poor. My family isn't exactly rich, but we're doing pretty well, and my dad is so fired up about God, that he's always using money to hold alpha gatherings. Being rich isn't a bad thing. But we must have the right attitude to riches. Would CHC be doing a better (morally) job by not preaching about God's blessing.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure how else they should preach - either by avoiding the topic about God's blessings on finances altogether, or preaching that it's not right to be rich.</p>
              <p>Either way, it would seem wrong. </p>
              <p>in the end, it's about your perspective of God, who do you see God as, a loving Father, who does what is best for His children, an everpresent help in trouble, who blesses and blesses abundantly, or a taskmaster who withholds good things from His children. I'm not sure what chc preaches exactly, but I've got a friend from there, and apparently he lives life with so much joy and positiveness. I'm sure God did that. And that's what the Gospel does, what Jesus did to bring to each and every one of us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One clue I think helps to see if a message's effect on the believer is good or bad is to see how someone from chc prays for someone who is in financial need (of course, it's also impt to act upon that prayer)</p>
              <p>do they pray that the ppl be rich, or do they pray that God will meet their needs, where is the focus in their prayers, God, or material wealth? The Giver or the gifts.</p>

              <p>it's all about the attitude towards riches la. Jesus is against coveting what isn't yours, and self reliance, but not about being rich, or seeking blessing.</p>
              <p>if i understand, coveting means desiring to possess what belongs to others?</p>

              <p>in the end, as long as the message encourages your walk with Jesus, focuses on Jesus, magnifies Jesus, and is biblical, it's a good message.</p>
              <p>if it condemns you, it shames you, gives you uncertainty, gives you fear, incites you to do things which God condemns in the bible, then reject that message.</p>

              <p>God does indeed bless most of us richly in this life, but there are
              many Christians who remain impoverished in spirit and in finances
              despite their faith. A theology that focuses too much on blessings in
              this life does not speak to those who suffer in this world and await
              their blessings in the next life. While the prosperity gospel's focus
              on the positive aspects of faith can be inspirational to many
              Christians, it strikes me as particularly incomplete as we are about to
              enter Holy Week. <br> <br> I once had a pastor observe how easy it is for Christians to move
              seamlessly from the “hosannas” of Palm Sunday to the “alleluias” of
              Easter morning without pausing to note the darkness and grief of Good
              Friday. Likewise, when we overemphasize a God who doles out prosperity
              in this world, we can lose sight of the God who suffered on the cross,
              the God who allows suffering in the world, the God who stands by us
              through our pain and poverty, the God who gives us hope beyond this
              life, or the God who tells us to take up our cross and follow him.</p>
              <p>Churches like city harvest is preaching only one side of the gospel and does not preach it in its entirety</p>
