              <p>actually. i enjoyed the anglican service more. don't get me wrong, i think.. it's up to my mood. sometimes i like songs which are abit "war-cry", songs like - this is how we overcome, or i've got the joy, exaltation songs such as -  Blessed be the name, no other name etc.</p>
              <p>because sometimes i feel really down and frustrated, singing out really loud helps relieve me of that burden.</p>
              <p>but my nature is that i've always enjoyed worship more than praise, and i quite enjoyed the peace and serenity of quiet worship too.</p>
              <p>last week for some reason, i couldn't concentrate at worship, i think it was the lack of sleep, and the songs were so jumpy and all, and i was getting a headache. but it doesn't really matter what style of worship it is, after all, worship isn't about us, it's about God.</p>
              <p>there is no "right" form of worship - since we are worshipping in spirit and in truth.</p>

              <p>Should try go to the Cathedral as the choir there is the best. They are called the Cathedral choir of the Risen Christ though I have not been there myself....</p>
              <p>The songs are new to you because you have only recently open your heart to hear them out....but listen hard to the words....</p>
              <p>Ave Maria is a beautiful songs performed by many great artist past, present and I know for sure future.....</p>
              <p>As for Novena, you need to know what it is about and I do know it may not be easy for you (knowing a little of your background) because you need some explanations in order to know what it is about and what they are doing etc....but leave that to later cause the important issue is the Mass and understanding what the Catholic Church is preaching and DOING.....first.</p>
              <p>Novena is not a must and not going does not make you a lesser Catholic. Knowing what it is will make you want to go.......</p>
              <p>No matter what, it's a good start for you and hope you have a plesant journey on discovery....like I said before, even if you finally cannot accept it, you will at least know why....</p>

              <p>I don't go to NCC too but have friends who do.....and their grace is not what you think it is. Got money means got grace, no money, no got grace.</p>
              <p>No grace means never tithe or never tithe enough, not enough faith.....tithe and give more and grace or rather money will come.....because god wants you to be rich just like how he made me (the pastor) prosperous.....</p>
              <p>They says believe right and live right and yet, look at the korean styled self proclaimed pastor and I wonder how he even remotely resemble any of the apostles and their followers.... let alone Jesus.</p>
              <p>The guy whom I says wanted to start a cyber church used to go to NCC and now stopped because he no longer wants to be the punter (hopping to get rich) but he wants to be the bookie (the one who really got rich). He hope that setting up a cyber church can make him a "pastor" and he can start collecting tithes and being on line make his market global.</p>
              <p>and why worry if that is right or wrong?

              <p>I don't go to NCC too but have friends who do.....and their
                  grace is not what you think it is. Got money means got grace, no
                  money, no got grace.</p>
              <p>No grace means never tithe or never tithe enough, not enough
                  faith.....tithe and give more and grace or rather money will
                  come.....because god wants you to be rich just like how he made me
                  (the pastor) prosperous.....</p>
              <p>They says believe right and live right and yet, look at the
                  korean styled self proclaimed pastor and I wonder how he even
                  remotely resemble any of the apostles and their followers.... let
                  alone Jesus.</p>
              <p>The guy whom I says wanted to start a cyber church used to go to
                  NCC and now stopped because he no longer wants to be the punter
                  (hopping to get rich) but he wants to be the bookie (the one who
                  really got rich). He hope that setting up a cyber church can make
                  him a "pastor" and he can start collecting tithes and being on line
                  make his market global.</p>

              <p>no leh. my understanding about grace came from NCC, though not directly.</p>
              <p>previously, i led quite a burdened life, always thinking God's gonna be pissed at me etc, because i keep doing wrong things. I even pray before, right before the exam, i'd pray to God telling Him that i didn't sin today, so please let me pass the exams etc, and even prayed that God can take away some of my riches in heaven if i pass this exam etc. if anything bad happened to me, i felt that it must be some kind of karma of sort, or God punishing me for something i did etc.</p>
              <p>that's how immatured i was, until i understood how much God loves me, that while i was his enemy, while i was depraved and while i hated him, He left all that is good in heaven, and came to this broken world just for me.</p>
              <p>tts only because someone explained what grace really is to me. it doesn't make me less.. sensitive to sin, i still know what's right and wrong, and i still choose to do right, but for the right reasons now. not because i fear i'd get punished, but because i love God back for He loves me first. that's why i said, good works is a fruit which bore from God's love, and not part of attaining salvation.</p>
