              <p>when u are involved in an accident, its your own mistake in calculations on the road, not the old 'God wants u to go, then u will have to go' bullcrap</p>

              <p>Church leaders are but mere servants of Christ, appointed to take care of Christ's people. They do not in someway or another become super human, or free from sins. It is important therefore to fix our eyes on the bible teachings instead of following the teachings of a church leader blindly.</p>
              <p>Time and again I am reminded of the Bereans in the bible (Acts 17:11), they do not just follow the teachings of Paul blindly, but examine the scriptures to see if they are right.</p>
              <p>I reckon that the forum is a good place to put what we were told by the church leaders, and discuss it among ourselves. At least we can have a better view of the sermon that is delievered. By doing so, not only are we examining the truth of a scripture, but also drawing lost souls into the kingdom of God.</p>
              <p>The reason why people are defending their churches so defensively is the prideful nature they build up. But that doesn't mean that we can start attacking them personally because they are defensive.</p>
              <p>Always speak the truth in Love (Ephesians 4:15) and it is always good to quote scriptures so that we know that it is true. Rather than coming out with justifications that are irrational and controversial, I rather see that the scripture tells us this or say that.</p>
              <p>That way, we discuss in Christian style and come to a conclusion in Christian style.</p>

              <p>Jesus on his financial state:<br>And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes
              have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man
              hath not where to lay his head.<br>Matthew 8:20<br><br>Jesus on where the rich men are:<br>And
              as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning
              John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with
              the wind? But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft
              raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.<br>Matthew 11:7-8<br><br>Jesus on what his apostles should do:<br>Provide
              neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, 10 Nor scrip for
              your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the
              workman is worthy of his meat.<br>Matthew 10:9-10<br><br>Jesus on what Christians should do:<br>Lay
              not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth
              corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for
              yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth
              corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: For where
              your treasure is, there will your heart be also.<br>Matthew 6:19-21<br><br>Jesus on how loving the things of the world will do to Christians:<br>He
              also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word;
              and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the
              word, and he becometh unfruitful.<br>Matthew 13:22<br>Apostle Paul on his state of being as a Christian:<br>Even
              unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and
              are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace; And labour, working
              with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we
              suffer it: Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the
              world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day. 14 I write
              not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.<br>1 Corinthian 4:11-14<br><br>Apostle Peter had no money:<br>Then
              Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I
              thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.<br>Act 3:6<br><br>Christians should strive for contentment, not riches as warned by Paul:<br>If
              any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the
              words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according
              to godliness;<br>He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about
              questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings,
              evil surmisings,<br>Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and
              destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such
              withdraw thyself.<br>But godliness with contentment is great gain.<br>For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.<br>And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.<br>But
              they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many
              foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.<br>For
              the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted
              after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through
              with many sorrows.<br>But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.<br>Fight
              the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art
              also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.<br>1 Timothy 3:6-12<br><br>Apostle Paul gave up his riches as a Pharisee to be poor for Christ:<br>But
              what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. Yea
              doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the
              knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of
              all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, And be
              found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law,
              but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which
              is of God by faith: That I may know him, and the power of his
              resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made
              conformable unto his death.<br></p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">like, there used to be a time when everyone thought the world was flat, it was intellegent to think that the world was flat, and it was unintellegent to think that the world is round.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">until it was discovered that the earth had always been round.</p>
