              <p>Hi Rafeash, since u brought up Genesis 14:20, i would like
              to give u a cut n paste answer from this christian
              website:</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1381/topics/">http://www.tithingdebate.com/DeJongRebuttal.html</a> </p>
              <p>KELLY: DeJong is placing words into Abraham’s mouth which are
              not found in Scripture. From my essay:</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;">For the
              following reasons, Genesis 14:20 cannot be used as an example for
              Christians to tithe. (1) The Bible does not say that Abraham
              "freely" gave this tithe. (2) Abraham’s gift was NOT a holy tithe
              from God’s holy land gathered by God’s holy people under God’s holy
              Old Covenant. (3) Abraham’s tithe was only from pagan spoils of war
              common to many nations. (4) In Numbers 31, God only required 1% of
              spoils of war. (5) Abraham’s tithe to Melchizedek was a one-time
              recorded event. (6) Abraham’s tithe was not from his own personal
              property. (7) Abraham kept nothing for himself; he gave everything
              back. (8) Abraham’s tithe is not quoted anywhere in the Bible to
              endorse tithing. (9) Genesis 14, verse 21, is the key text. Since
              most commentaries explain verse 21 as an example of pagan Arab
              tradition, it is contradictory to explain the 90% of verse 21 as
              pagan, while insisting that the 10% of verse 20 was God’s will.
              (10) If Abraham is an example for Christians to give 10% to God,
              then he should also be an example for Christians to give the other
              90% to Satan, or to the king of Sodom! (11) Since neither Abraham
              nor Jacob had a Levitical priesthood to support, they had no place
              to bring tithes and probably left food for the poor at their
              altars.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p>We refers to G-d as Hashem cos we dun want to
              transgress Hashem commandment:</p>
              <p> 'You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain,
              for the LORD will not leave him unpunished who takes His name in
              vain.  Deu 5:11 (NASB).</p>

              <p>sorry to say this..but you guys think that when your God is wronged by others either by ignorance or by false charges and you speak up for your God..it is still considered a misuse of God's holy name??and in conflict with the 10 laws??it is that thinking that prevented humans now to really know how to even address God's name..is that the way it should be??to not even know how to say the name of the one you should love and worship with all your mind,soul,heart and strength??</p>
              <p>humans.. you should wake up by now..traditions will be meaningless and come to a pass soon..</p>
