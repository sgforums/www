              <p>reading all these posts makes me laugh!<br>I will relate to you my personal experience and realizations.  Each topic is described in what I thought or felt before and after my 5-6 month stint there as a member of the congregation.</p>
              <p>Giving ($):</p>
              <p>Before -- "no matter how much money I had left in my wallet, i gave as a sign and demonstration of my faith.  I gave something dear to me, something I needed badly at times.  Sometimes I gave all I had in my wallet at the time, and hoped and prayed that god would bless me with sustenance"</p>
              <p>After -- "man, i'm hungry and thirsty.  I think i'll keep my $6 and go to subway for that $5.90 sandwich deal after service"</p>
              <p>Prayer:</p>
              <p>Before -- "my personal prayer to god is mine and mine alone.  No matter how I speak to him, he listens.  Whether I pray silently, or whisper, or yell, or blabber, he will listen.  Every christian has a special, personal way of communicating with the lord"</p>
              <p>After -- "i thought speaking in tongues was unique to every individual?  I thought that it was supposed to come from within every individual's spirit, unique in his or her personal experience with god?  then why does everyone say 'shiggity abba baba'??"</p>
              <p>That's all so far that's meaningful.  All the rest are minor qualms, like hero woship, reservations about the opposite sex, sexy and skimpy outfits at church, that sorta thing.</p>

              <p>How much do you know about David Yonggi Cho? You only know he is pastor to the largest church in the world. Have you done any research on him? Have you checked his doctrines to see if they are sound?</p>
              <p>Week after week city harvest invites frauds and false prophets to preach in their church.</p>
              <p>Its indeed sad that SO MANY city harvest members are ignorant on the true Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;"> "Beware of the
                              false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but
                              inwardly are ravenous wolves (Matt. 7:15). The warning was
                              important because Jesus later said to them: "Behold, I send
                              you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; therefore be shrewd as
                              serpents, and innocent as doves" (Matt. 10:16). The apostle
                              Paul, with a deeply troubled spirit and in tears, penned a
                              similar warning: "I know that after my departure savage
                              wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock" (Acts
                              20:29). Throughout church history these warnings concerning
                              professing Christians who deceive even the elect have seldom
                              been taken seriously.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Modern Pastors who preach the prosperity doctrine are the false prophets that God had warned us against. Their Love of Money and material desires are clearly the acts of satan. </strong></p>

              <p>BY the way, a christian friend who is out of job was told by a christian friend that she is not blessed by god becos she does not tithe.  ha h aha.  Why make god so money minded?  ha ha ha.  the fact is she did give tithe, but out of job how to give, she even have prob coping financially</p>
