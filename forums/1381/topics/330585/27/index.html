              <p>Greed?</p>
              <p>Boring, trying to find excitement in life?</p>
              <p>or</p>
              <p>He steal cos he got kids, wife and parents to fed and he went into the extreme measure such as stealing?</p>

              <p>but the fact that he gets arrested in the first place says alot. that stealing is wrong, regardless of the reason.</p>

              <p>I am not against christians preaching gospel as they are commanded to do so.   depends on how one does it.   Preaching gospel with love of god is good, preaching gospel without love of god  .... . .    ummm  </p>
