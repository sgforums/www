              <p>Yes, only God knows your heart.....and it is by our works that we show our faith....as in the last judgement, Jesus is asking: did you feed me when I am hungry, did you clothe me when I am naked, visit me when I am sick etc.....</p>

              <p>i think what min min is saying, that, God view good works as filthy rags, compared to His standards.</p>
              <p>good works don't... matter if you're not even part of His family. or rather, it's not that God isn't loving to non believers, it's just the mechanics of it. God is holy, we're not.</p>
              <p>He wants us to be in His family, but we're unable to, in our current situation. He wants to reward us for good works, but we don't even meet the criteria to even be in His presence.</p>
              <p>Only by paving the way to allow us to be part of His family, then our good works can be rewarded.</p>
              <p>it's like this. someone is sentenced to death row for murder, no matter how sweet he is to the guards and other inmates, it doesn't absolve him from his crime.</p>
              <p>even if the judge is really compassionate, he can't just set the death row inmate free, because the law is still the law. you murder someone, you pay for your life. you don't get credit for being sweet and kind to everyone in prison.</p>

              <p>Yes, we need to trust His words and and we do but you and I
                      simply look at it differently.</p>
              <p>God provided what is needed for salvation by sending His only
                      Son to die so that we can be saved. We all agreed to that.</p>
              <p>But there are conditions in order to be saved and we need to
                      meet them.....</p>
              <p>Both your equation brings in good works....why? Because it is
                      needed and if left out, there will be no salvation.</p>
              <p>If I may quote Chin Eng's view which you seems to agree,
                      salvation is unconditional yet you must have faith (which is a
                      condition and to you only condition) sound self defeating .....to
                      me at least.</p>
              <p>Works should not be in your equation if you say salvation is by
                      faith alone. Yet it is there....why? Because it is needed.</p>
              <p>Catholic churches do not teach us to "desire to produce good
                      works" but good works is a commandment of Jesus. If we belief in
                      God, we try to follow Him and do what He asked us to do.....and
                      live out our faith by following God's word. It is not the same as
                      faith = love of God.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>my equation says that faith produces good works. it is the result of faith.</p>
              <p>your equation says good works is not part of faith, it's a different element which must be added on top of faith, to equate salvation</p>
              <p>it's different.</p>
              <p>that's why i disagree. because good works is a different element, it has nothing to do with faith in your salvation equation.</p>
              <p>you believe that good works will give ppl the chance to be saved (even if that person rejects Jesus's gift of salvation)</p>
              <p>but God says that good works is filthy rags to His standards.</p>

              <p>God does not require us to do anything for Him, because He already have everything. He just wants us to make a choice to believe in Him and to have a relationship with Him.</p>
              <p>i tell you. all of us fall short under His law.  what is your definition of works then?</p>
              <p>you knoe some people's life can be so good and so righteous but then so what? what can it really prove? have you ever heard of the parable of the weeds?</p>
              <h5>The Parable of the Weeds</h5>
              <p> <span id="en-NIV-23564" class="sup">24</span>Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. <span id="en-NIV-23565" class="sup">25</span>But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. <span id="en-NIV-23566" class="sup">26</span>When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.</p>
              <p> <span id="en-NIV-23567" class="sup">27</span>"The owner's servants came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?'</p>
              <p> <span id="en-NIV-23568" class="sup">28</span>" 'An enemy did this,' he replied. <br>      "The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?'</p>
              <p> <span id="en-NIV-23569" class="sup">29</span>" 'No,' he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may root up the wheat with them. <span id="en-NIV-23570" class="sup">30</span>Let
              both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the
              harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be
              burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.' "</p>
              <h5>The Parable of the Weeds Explained</h5>
              <p> <span id="en-NIV-23576" class="sup">36</span>Then
              he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him
              and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."</p>
              <p> <span id="en-NIV-23577" class="sup">37</span>He answered, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man. <span id="en-NIV-23578" class="sup">38</span>The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one, <span id="en-NIV-23579" class="sup">39</span>and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.</p>
              <p> <span id="en-NIV-23580" class="sup">40</span>"As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age. <span id="en-NIV-23581" class="sup">41</span>The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. <span id="en-NIV-23582" class="sup">42</span>They will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <span id="en-NIV-23583" class="sup">43</span>Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.</p>

              <p>It is true that everybody can and will do good work at some point in their life no matter how "bad" they are.....even if they have never accepted Christ. That is why there is hope of salvation outside the Church because people are "prompted" by God to do good works and satan cannot prompt people to do good works, can they?</p>
              <p>You seems to suggest that Christians good works have a "higher quality" than non-Christian?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Now are you saving that one can be a Christian without faith.... because God can prompt an unbeliever to do good works (hope of salvation outside the church)....???</p>

              <p>Yes, there are doctrines differences....I am not asking you to prove yours but merely stating why I think the Catholic Churches teaching is correct. And to dispel the misconceptions raised.</p>

              <p>Dispelling misconceptions and proving that the Catholic churches' doctrines are correct are two different things.</p>

              <p>I don't see your point (for the parable) and the relationship with salvation by faith and works or salvation by faith alone. We as Christians are still sinners.....and we do and still sin.</p>
              <p>Christ died so that we can be saved. Having a relationship with God by calling Him Father means that we need to obey Him and be a true disciple of Jesus. Jesus commandment to us is to love God and our neighbour. If we have faith in God and beleived in Him, we will live out our faith by listening to Jesus (to love God and love our neighbour) and act on it (by our works). Then, we can call ourselves faithful and</p>
              <p><strong>"</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is by my deeds
                                      that I will show you my faith."</strong></span></p>
              <p>It is not about the number of times but it is from our heart that we are doing because we want to be follower of Christ. Only then we are ready to face the last judgement as Jesus has told us in Mt 25.</p>
              <p>I don't remember Jesus saying the He will saved us (first) if we profess our faith and then let us do good works later ...and if not saved, no need to do.</p>
              <p>Salvation is not about works but faith and works.</p>

              <p>i understand that there are issues and circumstances which seems ambiguous. like someone who nv heard the gospel before, or he's mentally incapble etc. but i really do find a logic-fail. when <span style="font-weight: bold;">you believe that someone who is sound who has heard the gospel, rejected it, died and still has a chance</span>, when the bible did say no chance. (i asked this question before, very clearly, and a catholic said yes, very clearly too.)</p>
              <p>but you believe it, because you say that the person's work may reach God's passing mark, which we all know there is no such thing, because all of man's work is like filthy rags, and there is only one way to the Father, Jesus is the way, the truth and the life, and for all man has sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. (see what i mean by if you quote the bible half as much as you quote from the writings of man?)</p>
              <p>see what i mean by logic fail?</p>
              <p>someone rejects Christ's salvation. but you sincerely believe that he has a chance because he may be a good person</p>
              <p>isn't that saying the value of works is &gt; than Christ's death on the cross in God's eye?</p>

              <p>So do you or do you not agree that a person who has never heard the gospel before through no fault of his own, or is mentally incapable, <em>may</em> still obtain eternal salvation through the mercy of God, if they seek God with a sincere heart and <em>moved by grace</em>, try in their actions to do his will through the dictates of their conscience, as taught by the Catholic Church ?</p>
              <p>But what about a Christian who rejects his faith ? I did not address this previously because it wasn't in your original query. For this group, it is more difficult to say that they are blameless and 'didn't know better' (although there might be extenuating circumstances). For this group, the Catholic Church does teach that there is no salvation outside of Jesus Christ and his Church. BUT the Church stops short of pronouncing with certainty that any specific individual will go to hell. Why ? Because she leaves that to God. Only God knows a person's heart, whether the person repents at the moment of his death with perfect contrition, etc. It's not about 'a person's work reaching God's passing mark' (can't remember where I ever said such a thing in my previous posts).</p>
              <p>Separately, I find it amusing, having one Protestant tell me I should quote more of the bible and another saying not to throw bible verses around. Sigh, I guess you can't please everyone. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"><br></p>

              <p><br>this, in my opinion, is why i cannot factor in "good works" into salvation. solely because you cannot quantify or measure it.... and when is enough, when is not enough... measured by minute, measured by day, or measured by lifetime?</p>
              <p>and if we factor in "God is the only judge for us all" my natural conclusion is: salvation is NOT guaranteed.</p>

              <p>Yes. Both the bible and the Catholic Church teaches that salvation is indeed <em>not</em> guaranteed. We can lose it by our own choice, that is why we <em>hope</em> for salvation. As I mentioned previously, salvation is not a one time event but a process. As Christians, we have been saved, we are being saved and we will be saved (if we endure to the very end).</p>

              <p>I still see good works in the picture. But more important than whether good works is part of salvation or not is the point that we <em>can lose our salvation</em>. We are deluding ourselves if we believe that our salvation is <em>guaranteed</em> just because we have 'accepted Jesus Christ as our personal lord and saviour' at an 'altar call' once before, regardless of how we live out the rest of our lives.

              <p>i think the crux of the argument so far is not whether salvation can be lost, but whether good works is part of salvation.... of course, now you have chosen to move away from this argument and focus on something else.</p>

              <p>I don't see your point (for the parable) and the relationship
              with salvation by faith and works or salvation by faith alone. We
              as Christians are still sinners.....and we do and still sin.</p>
              <p>Christ died so that we can be saved. Having a relationship with
              God by calling Him Father means that we need to obey Him and be a
              true disciple of Jesus. Jesus commandment to us is to love God and
              our neighbour. If we have faith in God and beleived in Him, we will
              live out our faith by listening to Jesus (to love God and love our
              neighbour) and act on it (by our works). Then, we can call
              ourselves faithful and</p>
              <p><strong>"</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is by my deeds that I will
              show you my faith."</strong></span></p>
              <p>It is not about the number of times but it is from our heart
              that we are doing because we want to be follower of Christ. Only
              then we are ready to face the last judgement as Jesus has told us
              in Mt 25.</p>
              <p>I don't remember Jesus saying the He will saved us (first) if we
              profess our faith and then let us do good works later ...and if not
              saved, no need to do.</p>
