              <p>it's usually the opposite, remember that we became christians,

              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>About the process taking a long time, i beg to differ. The people who were converted in the Bible experienced INSTANTANEOUS transformation and not gradual change. Jesus did not tell the adulteress whom he rescued from a mob to "go and reduce your sinning gradually", he said "go, and sin no more". Saul did not take years to become Paul - his change was immediate except fort he days where he was temporarily blinded by the scales in his eyes. Come on, he was an active pharisee thirsty for Christian blood, and he was dead sure he was doing it for God, can anyone today get any worse than that for a converted Christian? Look at Zacchaeus. Anything else can only be explained as the person not being truly repentant and regenerate, thus not truly saved and not a real Christian.</p>
              <p>Sanctification is gradual, by regeneration is immediate. Bearing fruits of the Spirit is gradual, but rejection of old faults is immediate. It should not be an excuse for bad behaviour. look at how Jesus reacted to insults during His trials.</p>

              <p>Pls read up the bible and ask that your eyes be open and you be filled with the spirit before you do that so that you can understand it. Reseach yourself and read the bible dun follow blindly.</p>
              <p>Majority of CHC members they are led on blindly. I attend CHC for nearly a year in serach of God but before soon I realised I was led to materialism instead!</p>
              <p>Why the prosperity gospel?? Cos when you are blessed in richness you can bless unto others?? Are you trying to say without wealth one cant bless others?</p>
              <p>Jesus said also said, "If anyone wishes to come after Me, let him deny
              himself, and take up the cross, and follow Me. For whoever wishes to
              save his life shall lose it; but whoever loses his life for my sake
              shall find it. For what will a man be profited, if he gains the whole
              world, and forfeits his soul?"</p>
              <p><em>" He will see my sacrifice and give back 30 folds, 60 folds, and a 100 folds as promised in the Bible'????</em></p>
              <p>Show me where in the bible does it say that? Quite clearly, if you
              give with the expectation of receiving, you are the biggest anti-christ.</p>
              <p>Pls read what is a true christian here: If you suspect you are not then seek the "Truth"</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">1. True Christianity must
              line up with the Bible, the word of God. True Christianity pronounces
              Jesus Christ to be the son of God and believes that He is the only way
              to salvation and forgiveness. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">2. True Christianity will
              be rejected by the vast majority. This has always been the case
              throughout history. In Noah's time only 8 people were saved in the
              whole world. In Lot's time only Lot and his family were saved in two
              cities. The Bible says that our time will be similar to Noah and Lot's
              time so it is very likely that the percentage of people saved could be
              similar.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">3. True Christianity will
              be considered radical by most people. Jesus, the apostles and the
              prophets were considered radical. The Bible says that Christians are a
              peculiar people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">4. True Christianity will
              boldly rebuke and hate evil to such a large extent that those who
              preach the truth will greatly upset those who are evil. Those who
              preach truth will suffer persecution as a result.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">5. True Christianity will
              be controversial and cause divisions (Luke 12: 51,52). To cause these
              divisions major change would have to occur in someone's life which
              would upset others.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">6. True Christianity will testify that almost everything that almost everyone does is evil.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">7. True Christianity will
              be about true love, which is sharing and caring for others, where the
              main focus is to proclaim or aid the proclamation of the Gospel.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">8. True Christianity will
              not be conformed to the world by accepting or desiring materialism,
              money and commercialism as a good thing or a part of life.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">9. True Christianity will
              not be able to be proved wrong, although people may appear to make it
              sound untrue by arguing against it by using false statements.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">10. True Christianity will
              not be deceptive or misleading or cause people to believe a lie. It
              will be about honesty and truth. People today are saying misleading
              things such as that the church is fine. They say people are supposed to
              be getting healed everywhere and saying they are healed when they are
              not. This could be compared to a dishonest salesman who says something
              is great when it does not work in order to get people to accept their
              product or system.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">11. True Christianity is
              positive about good things and doing God's will, but it hates evil. It
              is not like the mainstream that is positive about many evil things.
              Saying that something evil is good is only leading people to do evil.
              Many people say that things are fine and that many people are being
              saved and doing God's will when this is not true. This is only
              suppressing the fact that the world is almost totally evil and causing
              people not to repent.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">12. True Christianity has
              the fruits of commitment to doing God's will and it will follow the
              historical example of those who did God's will such as Jesus, the
              Apostles and the Prophets. Using your time and money to do God's will
              is the purpose of life. The majority don't do God's will by working for
              the corrupt system or spending their money and time on unnecessary
              things. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Where does this leave the
              mainstream Church and the millions of people who think they are
              Christians. Although the mainstream churches have a lot of true Bible
              teaching, it appears that they probably will not fit into the category
              of the minority of saved believers. Therefore they may be rejected and
              considered lukewarm if they don't repent. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">The Bible promises that
              God will help His chosen people who obey Him by answering their prayers
              and leading them. Those who disobey him are promised curses (Duet 28).
              Obedient people should therefore receive a greater percentage of
              desirable outcomes and a lower percentage of undesirable outcomes than
              the ungodly. God should help His people to think or work more
              efficiently, remember better, make the correct decisions, and find what
              they need with less frustrating problems, inconveniences or accidents
              than unbelievers.</span></p>
              <p>Repent and seek a real church if you call yourself a christian! Stop polluting the Christian name!</p>

              <p>Pls read up the bible and ask that your eyes be open and you be
              filled with the spirit before you do that so that you can
              understand it. Reseach yourself and read the bible dun follow
              blindly.</p>
              <p>Majority of CHC members they are led on blindly. I attend CHC
              for nearly a year in serach of God but before soon I realised I was
              led to materialism instead!</p>
              <p>Why the prosperity gospel?? Cos when you are blessed in richness
              you can bless unto others?? Are you trying to say without wealth
              one cant bless others?</p>
              <p>Jesus said also said, "If anyone wishes to come after Me, let
              him deny himself, and take up the cross, and follow Me. For whoever
              wishes to save his life shall lose it; but whoever loses his life
              for my sake shall find it. For what will a man be profited, if he
              gains the whole world, and forfeits his soul?"</p>
              <p><em>" He will see my sacrifice and give back 30 folds, 60 folds,
              and a 100 folds as promised in the Bible'????</em></p>
              <p>Show me where in the bible does it say that? Quite clearly, if
              you give with the expectation of receiving, you are the biggest
              anti-christ.</p>
              <p>Pls read what is a true christian here: If you suspect you are
              not then seek the "Truth"</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">1. True
              Christianity must line up with the Bible, the word of God. True
              Christianity pronounces Jesus Christ to be the son of God and
              believes that He is the only way to salvation and
              forgiveness.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">2. True
              Christianity will be rejected by the vast majority. This has always
              been the case throughout history. In Noah's time only 8 people were
              saved in the whole world. In Lot's time only Lot and his family
              were saved in two cities. The Bible says that our time will be
              similar to Noah and Lot's time so it is very likely that the
              percentage of people saved could be similar.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">3. True
              Christianity will be considered radical by most people. Jesus, the
              apostles and the prophets were considered radical. The Bible says
              that Christians are a peculiar people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">4. True
              Christianity will boldly rebuke and hate evil to such a large
              extent that those who preach the truth will greatly upset those who
              are evil. Those who preach truth will suffer persecution as a
              result.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">5. True
              Christianity will be controversial and cause divisions (Luke 12:
              51,52). To cause these divisions major change would have to occur
              in someone's life which would upset others.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">6. True
              Christianity will testify that almost everything that almost
              everyone does is evil.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">7. True
              Christianity will be about true love, which is sharing and caring
              for others, where the main focus is to proclaim or aid the
              proclamation of the Gospel.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">8. True
              Christianity will not be conformed to the world by accepting or
              desiring materialism, money and commercialism as a good thing or a
              part of life.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">9. True
              Christianity will not be able to be proved wrong, although people
              may appear to make it sound untrue by arguing against it by using
              false statements.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">10. True
              Christianity will not be deceptive or misleading or cause people to
              believe a lie. It will be about honesty and truth. People today are
              saying misleading things such as that the church is fine. They say
              people are supposed to be getting healed everywhere and saying they
              are healed when they are not. This could be compared to a dishonest
              salesman who says something is great when it does not work in order
              to get people to accept their product or system.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">11. True
              Christianity is positive about good things and doing God's will,
              but it hates evil. It is not like the mainstream that is positive
              about many evil things. Saying that something evil is good is only
              leading people to do evil. Many people say that things are fine and

              almost totally evil and causing people not to repent.</span></p>

              money and time on unnecessary things.</span></p>

              this leave the mainstream Church and the millions of people who

              <p>Yes, there's gold cups, elaborate finery, grand altars etc in the Vatican City and Catholic churches worldwide. Wouldn't you want to offer your best for the worship of the God that we love?</p>
              <p>We have to be clear here. These 'rich' symbols of worship pay tribute to the divine and royal nature of our Most High. The pope, bishops and priests certainly don't 'own' all these things and can't profit from them. In fact, based on a survey about a couple of years ago about the pay of the ministers from different religions in S'pore, Catholic priests' salary emerged last (a few hundred $ per month). If they belong to a specific Catholic order (eg Franciscans), they may even be required to swear a vow of poverty and receive hardly anything.</p>
              <p>None of the church's material 'riches' belong to the priests and they can never exercise personal ownership over them as they don't need to.     </p>

In fact, based on a survey about a couple of years ago about the pay of the ministers from different religions in S'pore, Catholic priests' salary emerged last (a few hundred $ per month). If they belong to a specific Catholic order (eg Franciscans), they may even be required to swear a vow of poverty and receive hardly anything.</p>
              <p>None of the church's material 'riches' belong to the priests and they can never exercise personal ownership over them as they don't need to.     </p>

              <p>Main difference is that the funds can only be used on church matters eg building maintenance, replacement of church items, events etc. Certainly not to spend on themselves or to pay the other church helpers (coordinators, wardens, choirs etc) as 99% of them are volunteers. </p>

              <p>Pls read up the bible and ask that your eyes be open and you be
              filled with the spirit before you do that so that you can
              understand it. Reseach yourself and read the bible dun follow
              blindly.</p>
              <p>Majority of CHC members they are led on blindly. I attend CHC
              for nearly a year in serach of God but before soon I realised I was
              led to materialism instead!</p>
              <p>Why the prosperity gospel?? Cos when you are blessed in richness
              you can bless unto others?? Are you trying to say without wealth
              one cant bless others?</p>
              <p>Jesus said also said, "If anyone wishes to come after Me, let
              him deny himself, and take up the cross, and follow Me. For whoever
              wishes to save his life shall lose it; but whoever loses his life
              for my sake shall find it. For what will a man be profited, if he
              gains the whole world, and forfeits his soul?"</p>
              <p><em>" He will see my sacrifice and give back 30 folds, 60 folds,
              and a 100 folds as promised in the Bible'????</em></p>
              <p>Show me where in the bible does it say that? Quite clearly, if
              you give with the expectation of receiving, you are the biggest
              anti-christ.</p>
              <p>Pls read what is a true christian here: If you suspect you are
              not then seek the "Truth"</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">1. True
              Christianity must line up with the Bible, the word of God. True
              Christianity pronounces Jesus Christ to be the son of God and
              believes that He is the only way to salvation and
              forgiveness.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">2. True
              Christianity will be rejected by the vast majority. This has always
              been the case throughout history. In Noah's time only 8 people were
              saved in the whole world. In Lot's time only Lot and his family
              were saved in two cities. The Bible says that our time will be
              similar to Noah and Lot's time so it is very likely that the
              percentage of people saved could be similar.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">3. True
              Christianity will be considered radical by most people. Jesus, the
              apostles and the prophets were considered radical. The Bible says
              that Christians are a peculiar people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">4. True
              Christianity will boldly rebuke and hate evil to such a large
              extent that those who preach the truth will greatly upset those who
              are evil. Those who preach truth will suffer persecution as a
              result.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">5. True
              Christianity will be controversial and cause divisions (Luke 12:
              51,52). To cause these divisions major change would have to occur
              in someone's life which would upset others.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">6. True
              Christianity will testify that almost everything that almost
              everyone does is evil.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">7. True
              Christianity will be about true love, which is sharing and caring
              for others, where the main focus is to proclaim or aid the
              proclamation of the Gospel.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">8. True
              Christianity will not be conformed to the world by accepting or
              desiring materialism, money and commercialism as a good thing or a
              part of life.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">9. True
              Christianity will not be able to be proved wrong, although people
              may appear to make it sound untrue by arguing against it by using
              false statements.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">10. True
              Christianity will not be deceptive or misleading or cause people to
              believe a lie. It will be about honesty and truth. People today are
              saying misleading things such as that the church is fine. They say
              people are supposed to be getting healed everywhere and saying they
              are healed when they are not. This could be compared to a dishonest
              salesman who says something is great when it does not work in order
              to get people to accept their product or system.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">11. True
              Christianity is positive about good things and doing God's will,
              but it hates evil. It is not like the mainstream that is positive
              about many evil things. Saying that something evil is good is only
              leading people to do evil. Many people say that things are fine and
              that many people are being saved and doing God's will when this is
              not true. This is only suppressing the fact that the world is
              almost totally evil and causing people not to repent.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">12. True
              Christianity has the fruits of commitment to doing God's will and
              it will follow the historical example of those who did God's will
              such as Jesus, the Apostles and the Prophets. Using your time and
              money to do God's will is the purpose of life. The majority don't
              do God's will by working for the corrupt system or spending their
              money and time on unnecessary things.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Where does
              this leave the mainstream Church and the millions of people who
              think they are Christians. Although the mainstream churches have a
              lot of true Bible teaching, it appears that they probably will not
              fit into the category of the minority of saved believers. Therefore
              they may be rejected and considered lukewarm if they don't
              repent.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">The Bible
              promises that God will help His chosen people who obey Him by
              answering their prayers and leading them. Those who disobey him are
              promised curses (Duet 28). Obedient people should therefore receive
              a greater percentage of desirable outcomes and a lower percentage
              of undesirable outcomes than the ungodly. God should help His
              people to think or work more efficiently, remember better, make the
              correct decisions, and find what they need with less frustrating
              problems, inconveniences or accidents than unbelievers.</span></p>
              <p>Repent and seek a real church if you call yourself a christian!
              Stop polluting the Christian name!</p>
