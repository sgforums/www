              <p><br> So you rather they go indoor stadium and pay 3 to 6 time the

              <p>Those churches are big not in terms of building size, but
              member size.</p>
              <p>There's alot of churches expending but many can't match the size
              of those. If you are a pastor and you have soo many member what you
              do?</p>
              <p>They are doing the great work. The Lord will take away
              their candle stick if they are not going by the gospel. I have more
              concern with churches that don't grow at all.</p>
              <p>Not ppl donate and do charities are good. Yet you found
              porn in their computer...Jesus sees the heart.</p>
              <p>Do look at the members will determin the maturity of the
              church. If it's all children it a sunday school, if majority is

              <p>ask yourself this, are you so agitated because someone has insulted your church,your beloved pastor or is it someone has insulted the true God you profess to love.or is it just some gods that man had made to worship and recruited more people to join?</p>
              <p>if the word of God is in you,would you have said such a thing??where is the mild-temperness of Jehovah God that should have being in you if you are his true follower?where is the love for the enemy?perharps when u dwell more in scriptural truth, you will understand more.</p>
              <p>btw, i did see much anger frm a fellow chc boy,even harsh language to a mentally unsound old lady at the coffeeshop opp the jurong west chc back den when i was attending chc services.</p>

              <p>hey, guys, if you have not yet to grasp the facts in the bible of who Jesus is during his earthly ministry then don't use any of it.</p>
              <p>Jesus is the Son of God, (everyone who believe knows) But Jesus was a carpenter before his ministry got started. at that point of time, carpentry is considered as one of the professional jobs if brought into modern context. Seamless was His robe that he wore, and if the robe is not precious or expensive, why would the roman soldiers cast lot over it?</p>
              <p>all of his disciples were rich men, fishermens, unlike now, they were professionals. and same goes to the rest. when Jesus told the disciples to feed the congregation or the crowd of thousands, have he thought of it" will they have the money to pay for it?", No, He just gave the orders to do so. because he knew that they have the money to do so.</p>
              <p>Our God is heaven is El Shaddai, God of all sufficiency, or simple said, God of more than enough. He is never El "Cheapo". so Don't you dare go around and claim that christian should be poor or living a just enough lifestyle. if Abraham have so much of property and herds that he cannot stay in the same land as his nephew Lot, then we of the modern world of today should use all our creativity to think of being the "head and not the tail" being a leader in the society now! instead of whinning or mocking at something that you will never get to establish, why not do something constructive to your future and for your children and your children's children.</p>
              <p>and if you claim that christian's should not want to have material wealth, then tommorrow, first thing in the morning, go sell your every thing and give everything away and try to live a non material life.. i can say not even 3 days you will not be able to take it. in this material world, you want to say something, you got to be a someone in your net worth, only then people want to listen.</p>
              <p>understand the facts and the reality of this broken world now! open your eyes to see now.</p>
              <p>and don't verbally abuse the church, when you don't see the real things happening.</p>

              <p>Exodus 12:35 The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of <strong>silver and gold</strong> and for clothing.</p>
              <p>Exodus 35:21 and <strong>everyone who was willing</strong> and <strong>whose heart moved him</strong> came and brought an offering to the LORD for the work on the Tent of Meeting, for all its service, and for the sacred garments.</p>
              <p><br>You statement not only attacked the church but also implied that the members are stupid... They gave because they are willing and who heart is moved by God. And they know that it is the Lord that give them the power to get wealth. Unless they are forced to, it's a different story.</p>
              <p>Deuteronomy 8:18 “And <strong>you shall remember the LORD your God</strong>, for it is He who <strong>gives you power to get wealth</strong>, that He may establish His covenant which He swore to your fathers, as it is this day.</p>
              <p>Deuteronomy 15:10 Give generously to him and do so without a <strong>grudging heart</strong>; then because of this the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to.</p>
              <p>Give if you believe, don't give if you do not believe. We have seen those who do "charity" got axed and I believe it's not coincident.</p>
