              <p>It will take some revelation for the person to see the meaning of holding Christianity in contempt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And certainly some churches are practicing that. But it is not up to us to judge them. We have our own problems to deal with. Too much to bother about what wrong have the others done. We can only steer far away from their main stream activities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The more we try to convince the more resistant they will be. Let them find out the truth themselves and realise it themselves. Let God conduct the discipline. We are not qualified to do it.</p>

              <p>Jesus could have all the $$ in the world to build mega and

              humble venues like wilderness or mountains etc etc.</p>
              <p>Churches should never engage in any business or profit making
              activities unless it’s for charity or other good causes. Remember
              Jesus himself chase out those greedy merchants from the temples
              angrily didnt he?</p>
              <p>Even if a church is rich and successful, the extra monies,
              should be used to set up trusts for or donate direct into charities
              where $$$ would be use more meaningfully.</p>
              <p>Lastly, Jesus said very clearly like many will come in His name
              and much of these are wolves in sheep skins. So people should look
              beyond the glamour and flashy lights and see the real god that the

              <p>but when we do know the bible,it is our duty and responsibility to spread the word and bring as many people back to the truth as possible isnt it? though we are not qualified to judge, but we can be God's sower of seeds..God himself will do the growing.</p>

It was worth a year's wages."

              <p><br>So you rather they go indoor stadium and pay 3 to 6 time the amount?</p>
              <p>Those churches are big not in terms of building size, but member size.</p>
              <p>There's alot of churches expending but many can't match the size of those. If you are a pastor and you have soo many member what you do?</p>
              <p>They are doing the great work. The Lord will take away their candle stick if they are not going by the gospel. I have more concern with churches that don't grow at all.</p>
              <p>Not ppl donate and do charities are good. Yet you found porn in their computer...Jesus sees the heart.</p>
              <p>Do look at the members will determin the maturity of the church. If it's all children it a sunday school, if majority is teens it's a youth church...etc</p>
