              <div id="post_message_1997786">Evangelical faith healer Pastor Benny
              Hinn claims he can cure the sick, make the crippled walk and rid
              terminally ill patients of cancer.<br> <br> But Hinn’s supposed spiritual powers were no match for Brisbane’s peak-hour traffic.<br> <br> The multi-millionaire was 50 minutes late for his Australian “miracle
              crusade” after his limo became stuck in traffic on a notorious stretch
              of the Gateway Arterial Freeway.When Hinn eventually arrived at the
              Brisbane Entertainment Centre at Boondall, in Brisbane’s north, he wore
              a white shot silk suit. Standing in front of a 350-piece choir, the
              televangelist, whose sermons are broadcast in 192 countries, strutted
              the stage, his brass buttons flashing and Madonna-style microphone
              headset firmly in place.<br> <br> The 10,000-strong crowd reacted. Young children, teens, adults and the
              elderly rose to their feet. They wept, rocked and chanted, cried silent
              tears, spoke in tongues and smiled as the Californian preacher, who
              lives in an $8 million waterfront mansion in Orange County, performed a
              20-minute rendition of the hymn I Love To Praise Him.<br> <br> In a roped-off section of the entertainment centre, faithful in
              wheelchairs, unwell elderly and other infirm waited for a “miracle”.<br> <br> Kelly Smith, a paraplegic, travelled from Ipswich. The 43-year-old
              recently suffered two strokes and a blood clot, and her husband Gavin
              has cataracts on his eyes.<br> <br> “We’ve tried everything,” Ms Smith said. “Feng shui, wind chimes,
              crystals and positive thinking. We really wanted to give this a go.”<br> <br> Nearby sat seven-year-old Bernie Hudson. The bright-eyed Cairns local,
              who was born with spina bifida and now suffers scoliosis, begged
              parents Ken and Karen to bring her along. She sat in her small
              wheelchair and waited, excited about the possibility of being able to
              walk.<br> <br> “She gets up every morning at 5.30am to watch Benny’s show This Is Your Day!” Ms Hudson said.<br> <br> “She watches the pastor healing other people, and thought maybe he could do something for her.”<br> <br> But business comes before miracles when Pastor Hinn is in the building, it seems.<br> <br> After an hour of songs, Hinn preached a recurring topic. Gold and
              silver. Silver and gold. The flamboyant non-denominational preacher,
              who receives an estimated $A110 million in donations per annum, used
              scripture to encourage crowd members to give. “Do you know how much
              gold the children of Israel gave Moses to build a tabernacle?” he
              asked. “Fifty thousand ounces of gold, 150,000 ounces of silver. In
              today’s prices that’s over 40 million US dollars in gold alone. I don’t
              know how much that is in Australian dollars, but that’s a lot of gold .
              . . and God blessed them.”<br> <br> Hinn, who owns a $36 million private jet, continued in the same “rich”
              vein. For 90 minutes he talked dollars. The term “wealth transfer” was
              uttered 20 times in 10 minutes. “Gold” and “silver” was said 35 times
              in six minutes alone.<br> <br> The man believed to be the world’s richest evangelist, who has
              repeatedly refused to join the Evangelical Council for Financial
              Accountability, continued his focus on the almighty dollar.<br> <br> “If God tells you to give $5000, obey him,” Hinn said.<br> <br> “If God speaks and says give $10,000, obey him. Do not argue with God.”<br> <br> Yet, as he talked of God’s love, the pastor couldn’t hide his quick
              temper. The 56-year-old became angry when a crying child interrupted
              the sermon.<br> <br> “People came to hear God’s word, not children crying,” he snapped,
              singling out a distressed mother. “Do something with that baby.”<br> <br> Seconds later Hinn’s security guards, former gridiron players in
              pinstripe suits and dark glasses, distributed donation envelopes to the
              crowd.<br> <br> What’s your view on Benny Hinn? Perth student Amy Andrews, 25, gave $1000 and pledged to donate more.<br> <br> “Pastor Hinn says the more you give, the more wealth and love you receive,” she said.<br> <br> Then came the healing – a surprisingly hands-off affair administered by Hinn’s Australian volunteers.<br> <br> People were stripped of canes and Zimmer frames, those in wheelchairs
              helped to their feet. One man, in his late 50s, cried with what looked
              more like pain than relief.<br> <br> For Ms Smith, the Friday night event was a disappointing affair.<br> <br> “There was too much talk about money, about the more you gave the more God loved you,” she said.<br> <br> “I feel drained, let down and let’s face it, I still can’t walk.”<br> <br> Hinn held two more miracle crusades in Brisbane yesterday. He flew to
              Auckland for the New Zealand leg of his world tour last night.<br> <br> Side note: <span class="highlight">City</span> <span class="highlight">harvest</span> church in singapore invites benny hinn every year to come and preach at their church.</div>

              <p>Truth be told, using the bible to 'validate' preachings is easier said than done. Those attending CHC will swear that their doctrines and teachings are in accordance with the bible, so would those from NCC, jehovah witnesses, baptists, anglicans, lutherans ... ; and these 'biblical' teachings all differ to varying degrees, sometimes even contradicting one another. So how can the bible as interpreted by you and me be the 'final' word on the truths of the Christian faith ?</p>

              <p>Good question. Fortunately, Jesus Christ (God) was smart enough to form a core group of disciples to whom he gave authority to preach to all mankind the truths that he had revealed to them, to whom he promised the Holy Spirit to prevent the teaching of error.</p>
              <p>In other words, Jesus Christ established an organisation - a <em>church</em>, which although led by less than perfect men, would preserve and spread God's truths to all, an infallible church which the gates of hell would not prevail against.</p>
              <p>This church had been preaching the good news of Jesus Christ even <em>before</em> the bible was fully written and it continues to do so today. And CHC is not that church <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png">.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>When pastor kong preached at CHC in Sydney recently he raved on about how they had raised $43 million (in cash) to pay for their new building in Singapore. He trying to make the point that inspite of sars, asian economic crises etc their dream (in a business sense) was still able to be achieved. What he failed to highlight is that in times of economic hardship (or hardship otherwise which affects population), people often turn to religion for hope and direction. Now given the various crises affecting st east asia have been long lasting ...one would assume that many people turning to religion and insodoing filling the offering tins on a regular basis ....that a logical cause can be found behind CHC raking in so much money money. These kind of organisations I believe are skimming a great deal off for themselves...the fact that Konh Hee makes a case in point about not being on the payroll only further heighten's suspicion.</p></div>

              Praise Him.<br> <br> In a roped-off section of the entertainment centre, faithful in
              wheelchairs, unwell elderly and other infirm waited for a
              “miracle”.<br> <br> Kelly Smith, a paraplegic, travelled from Ipswich. The 43-year-old
              recently suffered two strokes and a blood clot, and her husband
              Gavin has cataracts on his eyes.<br> <br> “We’ve tried everything,” Ms Smith said. “Feng shui, wind chimes,
              crystals and positive thinking. We really wanted to give this a
              go.”<br> <br> Nearby sat seven-year-old Bernie Hudson. The bright-eyed Cairns
              local, who was born with spina bifida and now suffers scoliosis,
              begged parents Ken and Karen to bring her along. She sat in her
              small wheelchair and waited, excited about the possibility of being
              able to walk.<br> <br> “She gets up every morning at 5.30am to watch Benny’s show This Is
              Your Day!” Ms Hudson said.<br> <br> “She watches the pastor healing other people, and thought maybe he
              could do something for her.”<br> <br> But business comes before miracles when Pastor Hinn is in the
              building, it seems.<br> <br> After an hour of songs, Hinn preached a recurring topic. Gold and
              silver. Silver and gold. The flamboyant non-denominational
              preacher, who receives an estimated $A110 million in donations per
              annum, used scripture to encourage crowd members to give. “Do you
              know how much gold the children of Israel gave Moses to build a
              tabernacle?” he asked. “Fifty thousand ounces of gold, 150,000
              ounces of silver. In today’s prices that’s over 40 million US
              dollars in gold alone. I don’t know how much that is in Australian
              dollars, but that’s a lot of gold . . . and God blessed
              them.”<br> <br> Hinn, who owns a $36 million private jet, continued in the same
              “rich” vein. For 90 minutes he talked dollars. The term “wealth
              transfer” was uttered 20 times in 10 minutes. “Gold” and “silver”
              was said 35 times in six minutes alone.<br> <br> The man believed to be the world’s richest evangelist, who has
              repeatedly refused to join the Evangelical Council for Financial
              Accountability, continued his focus on the almighty dollar.<br> <br> “If God tells you to give $5000, obey him,” Hinn said.<br> <br> “If God speaks and says give $10,000, obey him. Do not argue with
              God.”<br> <br> Yet, as he talked of God’s love, the pastor couldn’t hide his quick
              temper. The 56-year-old became angry when a crying child
              interrupted the sermon.<br> <br> “People came to hear God’s word, not children crying,” he snapped,
              singling out a distressed mother. “Do something with that
              baby.”<br> <br> Seconds later Hinn’s security guards, former gridiron players in
              pinstripe suits and dark glasses, distributed donation envelopes to
              the crowd.<br> <br> What’s your view on Benny Hinn? Perth student Amy Andrews, 25, gave
              $1000 and pledged to donate more.<br> <br> “Pastor Hinn says the more you give, the more wealth and love you
              receive,” she said.<br> <br> Then came the healing – a surprisingly hands-off affair
              administered by Hinn’s Australian volunteers.<br> <br> People were stripped of canes and Zimmer frames, those in
              wheelchairs helped to their feet. One man, in his late 50s, cried
              with what looked more like pain than relief.<br> <br> For Ms Smith, the Friday night event was a disappointing
              affair.<br> <br> “There was too much talk about money, about the more you gave the
              more God loved you,” she said.<br> <br> “I feel drained, let down and let’s face it, I still can’t
              walk.”<br> <br> Hinn held two more miracle crusades in Brisbane yesterday. He flew
              to Auckland for the New Zealand leg of his world tour last
              night.<br> <br> Side note: <span>City</span> <span>harvest</span> church in singapore invites benny hinn every year to come and

              <p>I wonder if the church is brave enough to touch this verse this is taken from John 2</p>
              <p><sup id="en-KJV-26119">23</sup>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the
              passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw
              the miracles which he did.</p>
              <p>   <sup id="en-KJV-26120">24</sup>But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,</p>
              <p>   <sup id="en-KJV-26121">25</sup>And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nevertheless
              saying, I dont have the right to judge what kind of church CityHarvest
              is. Although, frankly speaking, my own opinion says that this church is
              not really a church that will teach you how to fear the Lord. I myself
              is a Catholic, and I have been raised throuh presbyterian teaching
              following Lutheran and Calvinism way of reformation of catholic
              teachings.</p>
              <p>However, I also knew how Charismatic teachings are.
              I dont say they are wrong, but I am quite disappointed on how our
              congegration seems to love the topic on how Jesus has died and brought
              to us the salvation, and because of his death they seem to have this
              thing that is easily grabbed - They are saved - no matter what. Then
              some of them even seem to think that the old testament is no longer
              relevant. Well, I dont like to make such a long argument on how they
              think.</p>
              <p>I really see that none of them like to see the flip of
              the whole argument, which is laid in the Holy Bible itself. The Bible
              contains all the words of wisdom. I do love and fell happy for Jesus
              comes and dies as the Son of Man. as well as the Son of Lord. But it
              does not men all human shall have their redemption just by saying ' I
              believe '  Let me share some of the things that we may miss -This is
              taken from the book of John 5</p>
              <p> <sup id="en-KJV-26236">25</sup>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The
              hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the
              Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</p>

              shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of
              life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.</p>
              <p>   <sup id="en-KJV-26241">30</sup>I can of mine own self do
              nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek
              not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.</p>
              <p>And I even feel frightened when I listen to the book of Matthew 7</p>
              <p> <sup id="en-KJV-23330">13</sup>Enter ye in at the strait gate: for
              wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction,
              and many there be which go in thereat:    <sup id="en-KJV-23331">14</sup>Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it</p>
              <p>Will some of you think Jesus preaches that every one of you will be with Him. He says it, 'Few there be that find it'. and he follows</p>
              <p><sup id="en-KJV-23338">21</sup>Not every one that saith unto me,
              Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth
              the will of my Father which is in heaven.</p>
              <p>   <sup id="en-KJV-23339">22</sup>Many
              will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy
              name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many
              wonderful works?</p>
              <p>   <sup id="en-KJV-23340">23</sup>And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</p>
              <p>So many of us has forgotten how to fear the Lord. 'Fear of Lord is
              the beginning of knowledge, but fools despised teaching and
              instruction'. If only we have a feeling of fear to the Lord that is
              larger that our love of money and happiness. We may seek and try to
              find the truth and the living.</p>

              <p>Some
              of you who may want to study more about bible and follow what the
              teachings of the light, of the truth and the living. Some of you who
              want to start to deny oneself and be with the Lord and follow his
              teaching and do what his commands and willingness. We can have a group
              of it. I do believe it is hard to put the cross unto our shoulder and
              start follow our Jesus Christ path. But we shall try. do email me at</p>

              <p>When Paul seems not being acceptable to the fact Jesus has to die and be crucified, Jesus says to him - Satan! Go away from me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please Lord helps us to learn your teaching and forgive us for being stubborn. For we are sinners.</p>

              <p>suffering and humility is taught when you're thrown into the deep pool i guess. ultimately everyone knows that life isn't easy, and when you're knee deep and sinking, it's the hope of a good God which was preached week after week which keeps them kicking in the water.</p>

              <p>I dun think City harvest church is guilty as charged.  No Sir, they are not guilty.  Have u tried to read your christian bible that change its meaning completely? If u can change your bible to preach things that people like to hear, can u also blame city harvest church for doing the same?</p>
              <p>For example:</p>
              <p><em>I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create <span style="color: #0000ff;">evil</span>: I the LORD do all these things</em>.  Isaiah 45:7 KJV. </p>
              <p>This same verse is translated in the NKJV:</p>
              <p><em>I form the light and create darkness,  I make peace and create <span style="color: #0000ff;">calamity</span>; I, the LORD, do all these things.’</em>  Isaiah 45:7 NKJV</p>
              <p>G-d creates evil?  Oh no, how can it be?, let us change the word <span style="color: #0000ff;">evil</span> to <span style="color: #0000ff;">calamity.  <br></span> </p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>because God created everything and He said it is good.</p>
              <p>and calamity is a mirror of peace. makes sense. if he said, "I make good, and create evil"</p>
              <p>it would make sense then</p>
