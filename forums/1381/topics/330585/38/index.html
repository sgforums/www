              <p> You are in no good position to talk to me that I have the wrong answer when as a christian you are not capable of explaining the bible verses but come here with a mission to attack the non christians.</p>
              <p>YOU hate peace.   I welcome credible christians who love peace to talk to me, as for you you are just the opposite.  You are the black sheep from the family of God.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I can put up many examples of your posts that can potentially inspire morons to hate Chrisitans if you want to go on.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Don't you know that christianity has withstood thousands of years of attacks by critics? The bible has outlasted many government that sought to ban or destroy it.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">What stupid questions have you got? The answers to any stupid question you may havecan be found by wiki or google or obtained from the bible itself.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">If you can't find the true answer and quote the right source, go back to the university you've graduated from and return your degree.</p>

              <p>Asking about bible verses is stupid question to you?  This is the best joke in the christian world.    HA HA HA HA!</p>
              <p>If you are not capable of answering the question just admit, God will forgive you.  Resort to attacking is a sin to God.</p>
