              <p>They people means may be they will become the beliver later if things happen to them later. Dont always so fast catories them into non believer. When times come nobody can escape from fate. If we afriad of going to hell, then who go. Everybody make mistakes, telling lies, excuses, buy shares, 4D, quarrel with parents and regreted. Its is just time for them to find a proper guidian. When people grow older they grow wiser and start to rethink what they had done in the past and start to correct thenselve in the way. Heaven will be very crowded with 1 type of people only.</p>

              <p>but the truth is this. people don't believe because they simply will themselves not to believe. you can produce all kinds of evidences, they still won't believe just to prove a point that they can be as obstinate even if they are wrong.</p>

              <p>i think the root problem is pride. nobody likes to know that they are wrong. so even if they are proven wrong, their reaction is to be a hardcore obstinate. at least can save face and piss the other party off.</p>

              <p>i'm not talking about showing God's love - because it is so subjective. why is it subjective? because everyone wants to be treated only in the way they want to be treated.</p>
              <p>to a christian, they want to share because they love you (not everyone of course, some do it because they are asked to do it). if they sincerely believe that you are doomed without Jesus, or to sugarcoat it - they sincerely believe your life would be better off with Jesus, wouldn't it be unloving not to share with you?</p>
              <p>but to a non believer, it is "unloving" because they feel uncomfortable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>let me ask you a question. if you have a friend who just discovered he's a diabetic and is uneducated about living life as a diabetic, and you are a diabetic and you know about insulin shots and all that. and he needs that insulin shot to live.</p>
              <p>is it unloving to share what you know with your newly diabetic friend, introducing him to insulin shots and all that.</p>
              <p>but that diabetic friend says you are unloving because you kept trying to convince him to poke himself with the syringe and it hurts.</p>
              <p>so what is being "loving" or "unloving"?</p>
