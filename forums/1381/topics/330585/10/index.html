              <p>tts only because someone explained what grace really is to me.
              it doesn't make me less.. sensitive to sin, i still know what's
              right and wrong, and i still choose to do right, but for the right
              reasons now. not because i fear i'd get punished, but because i
              love God back for He loves me first. that's why i said, good works
              is a fruit which bore from God's love, and not part of attaining
              salvation.</p>

              <p>Good for you.....but good works is not done just by christians.....</p>
              <p>In my opinion, everyone is capable of doing good works regardless of faith. We don't need God to "save us first" to do His good works.</p>
              <p>And good works is not part of attaining salvation but a must in order to be saved. Salvation is by faith and deeds and faith without deeds is dead. Dead faith do not save.....</p>
              <p>The bible teaches us love and charity and it is something that all Christians must follows.... In order to be His true disciple, Jesus said that we must listen to His Words and act on it. Jesus did not say that I will save you so that you can follow me.....</p>
              <p>Salvation is free and available for everyone but we need to accept and cooperate with Christ so that we will have faith and deeds - not faith alone.</p>
              <p>But that's not the point we are looking at here......</p>
              <p>For NCC, the feeling I get is that they uses grace to create a sense of security, selfishness and greed. You don't have to worry and you just tithe and ask for $$$$ from god..... and problems around you, don't worry because there is nothing you can do (how can you save the straving people alone?)  leave that to god almighty. You just be kind (to who?) and give $$$ (to who?) and that's all - grace will flow......</p>
              <p>Why are you not giving and help the poor and needy? I don't have to because I alone can't solve their problem (sound like love your neighbour?). I leave that to god and he will do his work (that's faith?) and I just enjoy the blessings he showers upon me (sound like selfishness?).</p>

              <p>I have heard NCC people saying that by "giving money to god", they "get rewarded" with a better job next week, promoted, pay increase a few times etc.....</p>
              <p>and don't give, bad things will happen....because you rob god?</p>
              <p>I wonder if we are talking about the same God....and is God so greedy, petty and is He selling His blessings? Are 'pastors" His salesman or what?</p>

              <p>i'm not saying catholics who do good works aren't driven by love which comes from faith. i believe they do, but just that i believe they didn't know that it's their faith which produces the desire to do good works, that's why they're doing good works. i believe all these while, they thought that doing good works comes along with the faith for salvation, but what's really happening, is that their faith in God brings about the love of God, which causes them to love others, and thus doing good works. in short, faith with deeds. fulfiling james' message</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guarantee of Salvation ?</span></p>
              <p>Salvation (going to heaven) is indeed conditional; conditional upon our faith and good works. We may not like to hear this but there is no guarantee or 100% assurance of salvation whilst in this life. We can however, have confident expectation of making it to heaven if we maintain a good standing with God, or by sincere repentence when we fall away.</p>
              <p>Salvation (making it to heaven) is not a one-time "accept Jesus as your personal lord and saviour" event, but a continuous process where we accept God's graces and grow spiritually. God freely offers his graces and salvation to us but we are certainly free to reject them if we so choose. We need to <em>cooperate</em> with God's graces.</p>
              <p>You are right in saying that we should read the bible as a whole in understanding God's word. The bible does indeed talk about being saved through faith but it also talks about the necessity of good works (and not works of the Mosaic Law) in our salvation. The letter of James is one of several examples but a prime one. So if we do look at Scriptures as a whole, we have to conclude that salvation is not by faith <em>alone</em> OR by good works <em>alone</em>, but by faith AND good works.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">James Chapter 2</span></p>
              <p>And I don't see how one can conclude that the main point of James Chapter 2 is about works coming naturally to one who has faith. It's more than that. James is very clear that faith must come with works if one is to be saved, "faith of itself, if it does not have works, is dead." and how we are justified "not by faith alone." It's hard to get any clearer than this.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your Article</span></p>
              <p>Your article differentiates between true faith that leads to works and (let's call it) 'bad' faith where you merely acknowledge God's existence without any fruits to show for it. The article then concludes, "<em>it is not merely enough to say you believe in Jesus. You must actually believe and trust in Him. If you actually do, then you will demonstrate that faith by a changed and godly life. If not, then your profession is of no more value than the same profession of demons: "We believe Jesus lived."</em></p>
              <p>I can agree with this (more or less) but would like to point out that this too does not guarantee one of salvation. Why do I say that ? We may have been baptised, we may have sworn to the whole world that we accept Jesus but how do we know (for sure) that our professed faith is 'true' and not 'bad' ? Can we be sure that we have led a godly life, one that stems from 'true' faith ?  </p>
              <p>According to your article at least, true faith is demonstrated by leading a changed and godly life. This brings us back once again to good works. Salvation IS about faith <strong><em>and</em> </strong>good works. Take away good works and your faith is "dead" (according to James) or "of no more value than the same profession of demons" (according to your article).</p>

              <p>... with faith, comes love, which drives us to do good works. good works, without love is merely superficial - trying to score points etc.</p>
              <p>i'm not saying catholics who do good works aren't driven by love which comes from faith. i believe they do, but just that i believe they didn't know that it's their faith which produces the desire to do good works, that's why they're doing good works. i believe all these while, they thought that doing good works comes along with the faith for salvation, but what's really happening, is that their faith in God brings about the love of God, which causes them to love others, and thus doing good works. in short, faith with deeds. fulfiling james' message</p>

              <p>Yes, I can agree with this (more or less). Doesn't change the point though that without good works, one is putting one's salvation in jeopardy.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I am sorry to say that, i don not have a good impression of some christians..because of what i found out about them and experienced before. I know some chrsitians just go church for the sake of going to church! now whats the point of that? Also, i noticed that some christians reacted in a aggressive manner when facing criticism.. maybe this is the new breed of 'Ah Beng Christians'.</p></div>

              <p>u know, hmm.. catholics generally believe works is part of salvation. no works, no salvation.</p>
              <p>but on the other hand they also don't believe that you may not need to receive Jesus Christ to be saved, or in another words - even if someone dies without receiving Christ, they still got chance.</p>
              <p>so in terms of logic... they see <span style="font-weight: bold;">works &gt; Jesus death on the cross</span>, in God's eye regarding salvation.</p>
              <p>can someone explain?</p>

              <p>The Catholic Church teaches that the usual and expected means of salvation is being united with Christ.</p>
              <p>But there is a problem. What do we do with people who have never heard of Jesus Christ and his message of salvation through no fault of their own ? Or people who are turned off from Christianity by the bad behaviour of Christians whom they meet ? Or the mentally retarded who aren't able to comprehend what Jesus is all about ? Or babies who die before they are able to understand anything ?</p>
              <p>Are they all destined for hell ? We know from the bible that the Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and that he desires that all men be saved. We don’t know what God will do for those outside of Christ or his Church through no fault of their own, so it’s best not to presume to judge. We can only hope and pray that God will have mercy on them. Which is why the Catholic Church also teaches that</p>
              <p>"<em>Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel of Christ or his Church, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and, moved by grace, try in their actions to do his will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too <span style="text-decoration: underline;">may</span> achieve eternal salvation."</em> (CCC 847).</p>
              <p>Nothing to do with works &gt; Jesus' death on the cross.</p>
