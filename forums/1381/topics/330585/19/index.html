              <p>But your point is that everything G-d created is good.  It is not about things that G-d created that is not good.  Like most christians, i think u are unable to accept the concept of good and evil in the bible.  I will quote u another verse from the OT to show that both good and evil came from G-d.</p>
              <p><em>And it came to pass, when the <span style="color: #0000ff;">evil spirit from God</span> was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him</em>.  1 samuel 16:23 KJV</p>
              <p>Evil spirit from G-d??  How can it be, do u want to change or modify this verse also?? </p>

              <p>yup, but you contested that not everything that God created was good. but the bible says that God created the heaven and earth, and with each creation, God saw that it was good.</p>
              <p>so that's why i ask you, if there's a verse which specifically says that there were any creation which God created and said that it was evil.</p>
              <p>From what i understand, even satan and his angels were created good, but they fell. and bad things came into the world after adam and eve disobeyed God by eating the fruit of good and evil.</p>
              <p>from your verse, i wouldn't say that God specifically sent an evil spirit, but allowed the spirit to oppress saul. we can see this in job's encounter, when satan asked God's permission to attack job.</p>
              <p>the bible isn't specific point by point at every chapter (like exactly how creation came about), so we can see the bigger picture by taking everything into context.</p>

              <p>Hi dumbdumb, u said that the bible says that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with each creation, God saw that it was good. </span>  Let us examine the scriptures closely if your statement is correct.  In bible study 101, we must not only take note of what that is mentioned but also what that is not mentioned. OK.</p>
              <p>First Day.</p>
              <p><em>And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And <span style="color: #0000ff;">God saw the light, that it was good</span>: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day</em>.  Genesis 1:2-5 KJV.</p>
              <p>Second Day.</p>
              <p><em>And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. And <span style="color: #0000ff;">God called the firmament Heaven</span>. And the evening and the morning were the second day</em>.  Genesis 1:6-8 KJV</p>
              <p>Please take note, the Heaven was created, G-d did not say "it was good". This phrase was not used to descride the second day of creation.</p>
              <p>Third Day:</p>
              <p><em>And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and <span style="color: #0000ff;">God saw that it was good.</span> And the evening and the morning were the third day.</em> Genesis 1:9-13 KJV</p>
              <p>Forth Day:</p>
              <p><em>And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and <span style="color: #0000ff;">God saw that it was good.</span> And the evening and the morning were the fourth day</em>  Genesis 1:14-19 KJV</p>
              <p>Fifth Day:</p>
              <p><em>And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and <span style="color: #0000ff;">God saw that it was good</span>. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. And the evening and the morning were the fifth day</em>.  Genesis 1:20-23 KJV</p>
              <p>Sixth Day:</p>
              <p><em>And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and<span style="color: #0000ff;"> God saw that it was good</span>. And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. <span style="color: #0000ff;">And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.</span> And the evening and the morning were the sixth day</em>.  Genesis 1:24-31 KJV</p>
              <p>Please take note that when G-d created the beast, cattle and things that creeps on the earth, it was GOOD.  However when G-d created man, it was GOOD is not mentioned.  Please also take note, It is only after G-d saw that every thing that he had made (i.e Day One to Day Six) that it was VERY GOOD. (i.e when everything is taken together, including day two when heaven was created and G-d did not mention that  IT WAS GOOD).  Unless u have the Oral Torah, there will be gaps in your understanding of scriptures. </p>

              creation, God saw that it was good. </span>  Let us
              examine the scriptures closely if your statement is correct. 
              In bible study 101, we must not only take note of what that is
              mentioned but also what that is not mentioned. OK.</p>
              <p>First Day.</p>
              <p><em>And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was
              upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the
              face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was
              light. And <span style="color: #0000ff;">God saw the light, that it
              was good</span>: and God divided the light from the darkness. And
              God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the
              evening and the morning were the first day</em>.  Genesis
              1:2-5 KJV.</p>
              <p>Second Day.</p>
              <p><em>And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the
              waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made
              the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the
              firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it
              was so. And <span style="color: #0000ff;">God called the firmament
              Heaven</span>. And the evening and the morning were the second
              day</em>.  Genesis 1:6-8 KJV</p>
              <p>Please take note, the Heaven was created, G-d did not
              say "it was good". This phrase was not used to descride
              the second day of creation.</p>
              <p>Third Day:</p>
              <p><em>And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered
              together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was
              so. And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together
              of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. And God
              said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and
              the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in
              itself, upon the earth: and it was so. And the earth brought forth
              grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding
              fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and <span style="color: #0000ff;">God saw that it was good.</span> And the evening
              and the morning were the third day.</em> Genesis 1:9-13 KJV</p>
              <p>Forth Day:</p>
              <p><em>And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the
              heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs,
              and for seasons, and for days, and years: And let them be for
              lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth:
              and it was so. And God made two great lights; the greater light to
              rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the
              stars also. And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give
              light upon the earth, And to rule over the day and over the night,
              and to divide the light from the darkness: and <span style="color: #0000ff;">God saw that it was good.</span> And the evening
              and the morning were the fourth day</em>  Genesis 1:14-19
              KJV</p>
              <p>Fifth Day:</p>
              <p><em>And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the
              moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the
              earth in the open firmament of heaven. And God created great
              whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters
              brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl
              after his kind: and <span style="color: #0000ff;">God saw that it
              was good</span>. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and
              multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in
              the earth. And the evening and the morning were the fifth
              day</em>.  Genesis 1:20-23 KJV</p>
              <p>Sixth Day:</p>
              <p><em>And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature
              after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth
              after his kind: and it was so. And God made the beast of the earth
              after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that
              creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and <span style="color: #0000ff;">God saw that it was good</span>. And God said,
              Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have
              dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air,
              and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every
              creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in
              his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female
              created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be
              fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and
              have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the
              air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. And
              God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which
              is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is
              the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And
              to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to
              every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I
              have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. <span style="color: #0000ff;">And God saw every thing that he had made, and,
              behold, it was very good.</span> And the evening and the morning
              were the sixth day</em>.  Genesis 1:24-31 KJV</p>
              <p>Please take note that when G-d created the
              beast, cattle and things that creeps on the earth, it was
              GOOD.  However when G-d created man, it was GOOD is not
              mentioned.  Please also take note, It is only after G-d saw
              that every thing that he had made (i.e Day One to Day Six) that it
              was VERY GOOD. (i.e when everything is taken together, including
              day two when heaven was created and G-d did not mention that
               IT WAS GOOD).  Unless u have the Oral Torah, there will
              be gaps in your understanding of scriptures. </p>

              <p>Let me ask u about the official doctrine of your church regarding Satan.  Did Satan rebelled against G-d?  If Satan is in rebellion against G-d, did he need to have G-d's permission if he wants to do something???  Just think, OK??  From your post, it looks like Satan is a faithful servant of G-d, he needs G-d's permission whenever he wants to do something.  And u quoted the book of Job to support this view???</p>

              <p>yes. our doctrine is that satan was lucifer, one of the greatest angels God created. But his pride led him to want to be like God, and he rebelled and fell.</p>

              <p>U quoted Isaiah 14:12-14.  Do u really know who was this bright morning star/star of the morning?  Please do read the context of this prophecy by Isaiah.  In fact,  most christian, they will say that the bright morning star/star of the morning in this prophecy refers to Satan.  Please do read and understand the context of this prophecy, is it about Satan or some other character in the bible?  Please dun disregard the context of this prophecy in order to suit your theology that the bright morning star is Satan.</p>

              <p>from what the bible says, God didn't create disease, there was no disease, AIDS, cancer, and death. God created everything good.</p>
              <p>All these bad stuff came about, when sin was introduced into the world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as for evil and suffering.. why does God allow it, </p>
              <p><span style="border-collapse: collapse; color: #3a3a3a; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;  ">
              </span></p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 12px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px; line-height: 1.7em;">Various answers have been given but permanently settling the issue is impossible because so many of our answers raise further questions. Nevertheless, our lack of ability to answer the question perfectly does not mean that we cannot offer solutions. Of course, I do not assume to be able to answer these questions definitively, but I can offer some solutions.</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 12px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px; line-height: 1.7em;">First of all, it is possible that God has reasons for allowing evil to exist that we simply cannot understand. In this the Christian can have confidence in God knowing that His ways are above our ways (<a class="lbsBibleRef" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #2998d8;" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Isaiah%2055.8-9">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). As the Bible says, the just shall live by faith (<a class="lbsBibleRef" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #2998d8;" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Hab.%202.4">Hab. 2:4</a>).</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 12px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px; line-height: 1.7em;">Second, God may be letting evil run its course in order to prove that evil is evil and that suffering, which is the unfortunate product of evil, is further proof that anything contrary to God’s will is bad, harmful, painful, and leads to death.</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 12px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px; line-height: 1.7em;">God gave Adam dominion over the world (<a class="lbsBibleRef" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #2998d8;" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Gen.%201.28">Gen. 1:28</a>). When he rebelled against God, he set in motion an entire series of events and changed the very nature of man and creation. Both were affected by sin. Creation was no longer a paradise, but bore thorns and thistles (<a class="lbsBibleRef" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #2998d8;" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Gen.%203.17-18">Gen. 3:17-18</a>; <a class="lbsBibleRef" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #2998d8;" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Rom.%208.22">Rom. 8:22</a>). People became sinful (<a class="lbsBibleRef" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #2998d8;" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Rom.%205.12">Rom. 5:12</a>; <a class="lbsBibleRef" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #2998d8;" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Eph.%202.3">Eph. 2:3</a>), who were haters of God (<a class="lbsBibleRef" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #2998d8;" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Rom.%203.19-12">Rom. 3:19-12</a>), etc. The only conclusion to such a situation is death. Jesus said, "And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened" (<a class="lbsBibleRef" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #2998d8;" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Matt.%2024.22">Matt. 24:22</a>).</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 12px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px; line-height: 1.7em;">Sin is rebellion against God and His created order. But God has not left us alone in this fallen world. He continued to enter this world, pointing us to Himself, to truth, to morality, purity, and love. He used the evil of the world (liars, perjurers, the envious, etc), to bring His Son to the cross so that we might have the opportunity of eternal life. In this, God has not stepped away from fallen creation, but has stepped into it by becoming Jesus. God works within the fallen world to affect change and He uses fallen people to accomplish His will. In this, He is proving His sovereignty over evil, suffering, and rebellious people, proving that sin and evil are utterly futile, and that He is worthy of honor and glory.</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 12px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px; line-height: 1.7em;">A third possible reason that God is letting evil occur is so that on the day of judgment, the condemned will have no right to say that their sentence is unjust. God is not stopping people from exercising their free will. Think about this: If someone said that God should stop evil and suffering, then should God then stop <strong>all</strong> evil and suffering? If God only stopped some of it, then we would still be asking the same question of why it exists. So, if we want God to stop evil and suffering, then He must stop all of it. We have no problem with this when it means stopping a catastrophe, or a murder, or a rape. But what about when someone thinks of something evil? Evil is evil whether it is acted out or not. Hatred and bigotry in someone’s heart is wrong. If it is wrong, and if God is to stop all evil, then He must stop that person from thinking his own thoughts. To do that, God must remove his freedom of thought. Furthermore, which person on the earth has <strong>not</strong> thought something evil? God would be required, then, to stop all people from exercising their free will. This is something God has chosen not to do. Therefore, we could say that one of the reasons that God permits evil and suffering is because of man’s free will.</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 12px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px; line-height: 1.7em;">Fourth, it is quite possible that God uses the suffering to do good. In other words, He produces patience through tribulation (<a class="lbsBibleRef" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #2998d8;" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Rom.%205.3">Rom. 5:3</a>). Or He may desire to save someone through it. Take for example, the account of Joseph who was sold into slavery by His brothers. What they did was wrong and Joseph suffered greatly for it. But, later, God raised up Joseph in Egypt to make provisions for the people of that land during the coming drought of seven years. But not only was Egypt saved, but also so was his family and brothers who originally sold him into slavery. Joseph finally says to them, "You meant it for evil, but God meant it for good" (<a class="lbsBibleRef" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #2998d8;" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Gen.%2050.15-21">Gen. 50:15-21</a>). Of course, the greatest example of God using evil for good is the death of Christ. Evil people brought him to the cross, but God used that cross as the means to save the world.</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 12px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px; line-height: 1.7em;">But then we must ask, if this is true, are we working against God by working against evil and suffering? No, we are not. God says he does not want us to sin and suffer. But it is simply true that God can use evil despite of its apparent despicable nature.</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 12px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px; line-height: 1.7em;">God is <strong>in</strong> the world using the world and its failures for His glory and the benefit of those who listen to Him.</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 12px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px; line-height: 1.7em;">But then, what about those who seem to innocently suffer with no benefit resulting? What about the woman who is raped, or the innocent by stander who is killed by a stray bullet. In both cases, the victims and families suffer nothing but pain and loss. What good can this possibly be?</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 12px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px; line-height: 1.7em;">I think that the answer is two-fold. One, ultimately, no one is innocent. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (<a class="lbsBibleRef" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #2998d8;" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Rom.%203.23">Rom. 3:23</a>) and are by nature children of wrath (<a class="lbsBibleRef" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #2998d8;" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/Eph.%202.3">Eph. 2:3</a>). There is none innocent. Though this is biblically accurate, it does not satisfy the question emotionally. Why do little babies suffer for things they have not done? I must acknowledge that I do not know. Ultimately, we must trust God who knows the beginning from the end and sees the grand picture. He will have the final word and He will be vindicated.</p>
              <h2 style="padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; color: #303030; padding-top: 17px; padding-bottom: 1px; margin: 0px;">Conclusion</h2>
              <p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 12px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px; line-height: 1.7em;">Suffering is the result of human sin. The world is not the way that God created it and because of that, all are vulnerable to the affects of sin in the world. Why does one person suffer and another does not? Why do catastrophes happen to some and no others? It is because sin is in the world. But there will come a day when the Lord will return and cleanse this world of all sin and all suffering.</p>

              <p>but the point is, God did not create evil, so there was nothing wrong in changing the word "evil" to "calamity" in verse <span style="color: #333333; font-family: arial; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">  Isaiah 45:7<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Charis SIL'; font-size: 16px; line-height: normal;"> which would be more accurate in this time and age. </span></span></p>
              <p>of course, evil, at that time, would have been understood as "calamity".</p>
