              <p>Yes that's no perfect idea.</p>
              <p>Hence, everyone have their own defination and limit of
                  "unloving" and "loving".</p>
              <p>For example like, "oh, this person is loving" commented by a
                  person mean there's something the person might or have done to
                  deserve the comments from someone ma.</p>
              <p>It does not need to be "approve" by others that "nah, that's not
                  even loving" which in this case might be the defination of loving
                  of the person who commented.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Love is complex so dun make it even more complex by analzying
                  till one go paralzye lol.</p>

              <p>lol. bad habit.</p>
              <p>but i think it's a bad idea to use your own definition to determine what is considered to be "loving" or "not loving".</p>
              <p>because firstly, your own definition is going to be flawed.</p>
              <p>if christians are going to be forever labelled as "unloving" because of their desire to share the gospel, then so be it. i think it borderlines as pathetic to need to appeal to them just so they can listen to what they need to hear. like cajoling a kid to study hard because it's good for his future</p>
              <p>but, i know. that's unloving. lol, it's just my own conclusion</p>

              <p>hmm, honestly, i'd love to buy into that, really.</p>
              <p>if you don't mind me being blunt (some people here can't take it),</p>
              <p>in christianity, we believe in an ultimate right and wrong, and the consequences of wrong isn't really comfortable.</p>
              <p>and if we really believe that, it's very hard to... not offend you and to be sincerely loving you.</p>
              <p>i mean, i can only either, respect you enough to leave you alone, and feel really awful and full of regret that if you missed the chance to hear the gospel, when something bad happens.</p>
              <p>or love you enough to tell you what you need to hear, and be labelled with all kinds of nasty labels as a result of my desire to share with you.</p>
              <p>and to be honest, it is especially difficult, when people have their own conditions and definitions thrown in to what is considered "respect" and "loving". that pretty much ties our feet and hands together. </p>
              <p>"you are only respecting me, if i don't feel insulted". With a condition like that, it's so hard to work with. Especially if someone's really sensitive and touchy. </p>
              <p>i really can't see how i can balance these 2 issues. heck, Jesus spoke what people needed to hear, and was crucified as a result.</p>

              <p>hmm, honestly, i'd love to buy into that, really.</p>
              <p>if you don't mind me being blunt (some people here can't take
              it),</p>
              <p>in christianity, we believe in an ultimate right and wrong, and
              the consequences of wrong isn't really comfortable.</p>
              <p>and if we really believe that, it's very hard to... not offend
              you and to be sincerely loving you.</p>
              <p>i mean, i can only either, respect you enough to leave you
              alone, and feel really awful and full of regret that if you missed
              the chance to hear the gospel, when something bad happens.</p>
              <p>or love you enough to tell you what you need to hear, and be
              labelled with all kinds of nasty labels as a result of my desire to
              share with you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i really can't see how i can balance these 2 issues. heck, Jesus
              spoke what people needed to hear, and was crucified as a
              result.</p>

              <p>yeah. it's all great you know, but when push comes to shove, are you going to keep quiet, or stand up? so far, i've only seen you stood up to believers, not for them.</p>

              <p>so what i do now, is analyse it, and see how flawed their statements are, and put it out there for themselves to see.</p>
              <p>and usually the reaction i get are well, what you just saw from fatagf. lol.</p>

              <p><br>Okay, you are right all the way , even to point fingers nastily without love, all you need to do as a christian is to allow god to speak to you on such matters.  go read the bible and consult mature growing christians about it. </p>
              <p>Oh ya , i am a great sinner to you, ha ha ha hah, that is only according to your own context, do consult god about it okie.    ha ha ha ah ha ha ha</p>

              <p>Hi, you're not a Christian are you? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/satisfied.png" alt="satisfied.png"></p>
              <p>Hope you forgive the limitations of the online forum, being not able to express my sincerest apologies to you if anyone of the Christians here have offended you in anyways...</p>
              <p>But I guess, it is good if we can have constructive discussions about the bible or doctrinal issues here since its a (so-call again) Christian Forum <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>You interested in the Gospel? Can I share my faith with you then?</p>
