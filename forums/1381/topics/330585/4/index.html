              <p>One thing it's true for people who goes to church, they are sinners.</p>
              <p>People who have sinned goes to church to seek for redemption. People who goes to church and act guai and perfect are indeed the most evil ones of all. Many guys go to church to seek and tackle girls, these guys goes to the church for the wrong reasons.</p>
              <p>It's true that Christians will have their sins forgiven by GOD when they die. BUT they will still need to pay for their sins when they are ALIVE. So this is absolutely no horse run for people who does evil after they have accepted Christ.</p>
              <p>As for the money part, it's very true that most churches...in fact all of the churches which I have the luxury of attending, are all greedy churches. But think of it as a temptation trap setup by the devil to destroy your very newfound faith in Christ when your faith in Christ is still in an infant stage. New Christians with little faith in Christ has very little hope to guard against the discouraging plans of the devil to break the bonds between you and Christianity. I'm well-aware of this temption and I always take every single evil/bad things that others have done onto me as a challenge to gain stronger faith in Christ.</p>
              <p>In SgForums, I have no trouble finding trouble-makers easily who can flame me, insult me or ridiculed me. But it is always up to me if I can stand firm to my own faith and beliefs at such critical times. Should I forgive them? Should I allow myself to be upset by them? Should I even feel bad about myself just because these people have the intentions to offend?</p>
              <p>The answer that I'm going to give you all is "NO".</p>
              <p>Why not? It's the perfect opportunity for me to express my graces and practise forgiveness. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>I know my faith in my GOD is true and GOD has always loved me, even before I believed in HIM.</p>
              <p>So it doesn't matter to me when I am going to die and I will gladly go to HELL if GOD needs me to be in HELL for his greater glory.</p>

No point in telling those who are blinded by the promises of wealth and good life by following the quacks and offering them supply of money in the hope of getting something in return.

              <p>let me ask you the definition of money?</p>
              <p>In financial terms, it is a tool to enable a greater number of trades to take place. if not barter trade have yo take place.</p>
              <p>up till now you may be wondering what is all these barter trade got to do with this.</p>
              <p>how did we get hold of the money that we have in our pockets? it is from our service at work. therefore, you can say that time equals money, and money is also equal to life.</p>
              <p>the reason for us giving is because when we come before God at Salvation, we pray that we place this life that we have on the altar and allow christ to rule and reign in our lives. And how we place this life as a sacrifice, with actions. it is mention in the bible that words without works are dead. thus we use the money that we earn with the time in our lives to sacrifice on the altar.</p>
              <p>i don't deny that some newer members come to church with wrong intentions initially. but if such things are being thought through in the older members, how big can a church grow?</p>

              <p>  "Will a man rob God? Yet you rob me. <br>      "But you ask, 'How do we rob you?' <br>      "In tithes and offerings.  You are under a curse—the whole nation of you—because you are robbing me. Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this," says the LORD Almighty, "and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that you will not have room enough for it.  Malachi 3:8-10 (NIV).</p>

              it.</p>
              <p>Jesus is the Son of God, (everyone who believe knows) But Jesus
              was a carpenter before his ministry got started. at that point of
              time, carpentry is considered as one of the professional jobs if
              brought into modern context. Seamless was His robe that he wore,
              and if the robe is not precious or expensive, why would the roman
              soldiers cast lot over it?</p>
              <p>all of his disciples were rich men, fishermens, unlike now, they
              were professionals. and same goes to the rest. when Jesus told the
              disciples to feed the congregation or the crowd of thousands, have
              he thought of it" will they have the money to pay for it?", No, He
              just gave the orders to do so. because he knew that they have the
              money to do so.</p>
              <p>Our God is heaven is El Shaddai, God of all sufficiency, or
              simple said, God of more than enough. He is never El "Cheapo". so
              Don't you dare go around and claim that christian should be poor or
              living a just enough lifestyle. if Abraham have so much of property
              and herds that he cannot stay in the same land as his nephew Lot,
              then we of the modern world of today should use all our creativity
              to think of being the "head and not the tail" being a leader in the
              society now! instead of whinning or mocking at something that you
              will never get to establish, why not do something constructive to
              your future and for your children and your children's children.</p>
              <p>and if you claim that christian's should not want to have
              material wealth, then tommorrow, first thing in the morning, go
              sell your every thing and give everything away and try to live a
              non material life.. i can say not even 3 days you will not be able
              to take it. in this material world, you want to say something, you
              got to be a someone in your net worth, only then people want to
              listen.</p>
              <p>understand the facts and the reality of this broken world now!
              open your eyes to see now.</p>
              <p>and don't verbally abuse the church, when you don't see the real
              things happening.</p>

              <p>How would you expect us to see what it is you want us to see when all that appears evident is a voracious and unending appitie.

              <p>These monetary worldly things was what Jesus tried to clear away. Yet, it still happened in modern christianity. If Jesus was still living today, and these churches built in the name of him, you think he's gonna be happy or frustrated with all the material worldy items?</p>

              <p>The authorities have proven their record clean and those "Where has all the money
              gone?" have been exposed...so be careful where you put your money into. It's up to individual to know if they shall give to the Church. <strong>Your</strong> Selection of Church. Don't like this church give to next... unless you don't give at all, then it's all up to you.</p>
              <p>2 Corinthians 9:6 Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously. Each man should give what he <strong>has decided in his heart</strong> to give, <strong>not reluctantly or under compulsion</strong>, for God loves a <strong>cheerful giver</strong>. And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work. 9As it is written:"He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor;</p>
              <p>his righteousness endures forever."Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food <strong>will also supply and increase</strong> your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness. <strong>You will be made rich in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion</strong>, and through us your generosity will result in <strong>thanksgiving to God</strong>.</p>
              <h5>Be Generous and Do Good</h5>
              <h4>Galatians 6:<span id="en-NKJV-29189" class="sup">6</span> Let him who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches.</h4>
              <p>Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he
              who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life. And let us not grow weary while doing good, <strong>for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart</strong>. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.</p>
