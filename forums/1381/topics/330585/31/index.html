              <p>My 2nd point is when u mentioned "no christian has not proven yet as to why god, being the creator of humans and being omnipotent, is to be held blameless", and wat im trying to say here is dat no human being can ever prove this as long as we are mortals. Only an angel or someone with celestial powers(aka immortal) can provide the truth. Sadly humans can never prove anything abt God.</p>
