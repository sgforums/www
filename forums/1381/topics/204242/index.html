God created the world in 6 days, on the 7th He rested. Creation of Adam was on the 6th day. Plants were created before the 6th day.<br><br>2. Hmm ..

            <div class='col-md body'>To those who pose such questions as those at the start of this thread, may I suggest that if your motive is really to understand and not attempt to discredit Christianity, to do some reading on your own first.<br><br>The questions may only consist of a few sentences, but the answers are invariably longer, because hidden behind the few words of those questions are a lot of hidden assumptions and premises which need to be deconstructed, clarified or analysed before any sensible answer can occur.<br><br>A quick read of less than 200 pages would be Theology for Beginners by Frank Sheed, which was written with the average lay person in mind.<br><br>For a more detailed exposition and which deal with the usual questions of free will/predestination, suffering, what is God doing outside time etc, Theology and Sanity by the same author is highly recommended.<br><br>It is quite obvious, after looking at so many different threads, that the answers here will at best be partial due to constraints of time and space.  Some effort is required if you really want some solid answers.<br><br>If buying a laptop is a process requiring market research, why should anyone think that looking for answers to the ultimate questions of Life be just a matter of posting a few questions on a bulletin board?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>regards,<br>obiterdicta</div>
