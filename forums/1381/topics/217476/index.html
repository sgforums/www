Exceptional use of logic!~<br><br>But the thing is christians have a view that the devil may disguise himself as someone intelligent with infallible logic (like us  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ) to challenge their faith and they must stand firm against those challenges.<br><br>Blind faith won't stand very firm against logical debates, that's why you need to understand your religion more.</div>
