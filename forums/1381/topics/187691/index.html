            <div class='col-md body'>I've read about her misfortune and the stage which she is undergoing right now. I thought my condition is already very painful and difficult to go through, but after reading her blog, I realise that she is undergoing something even more painful than what I've gone through. Treatment for cancer is really tiring and it's sad to see someone like her in her prime to undergo this situation. The agony and pain she and her family is undergoing cannot be imagined.<br><br>But I'm really glad that Christian have united to come and pray for her.I sincerely pray that she will pull through this tough patch and be strong. For God is our Strength and that when we're weak, He make us strong. Maybe we can pray for her in unison here. As Brother &amp; Sister in Christ, may we continue praying for her each day.<br><br>I'm thinking if we should organise to attend the Mass at her church this coming Saturday at 9am. Here's more information of her and the Mass.<br><br><a href="http://joanchanshufang.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://joanchanshufang.blogspot.com/</a></div>

Like your question: why do so many people still suffer?<br><br>It is like those who offer food to the dead ancestors, they hope that after they themselves die, their children will follow their example and offer food to them.<br><br>This kind of superstitions, pray to Jesus, offer food to dead ancestors are very difficult to get rid of because it does no harm to anybody; but if the person is of a weak mind, he feels bad not doing it.</div>
