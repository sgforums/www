That would be a conditional relationship between man and God.  But that is not so. God's love for man is unconditional.  The sad thing is, some people like to consistently place a condition to His love. Example: "If God shows me a miracle, i will believe."  God doesnt work that way - He works this way: "No matter if you believe - i already showed you miracles and working wonders in your life".<br><br>I pray in hope, in trust and in God's will. Not to insist that God must do something. My trust in the Lord say for this context - is based on the faith that God will do the best for her. And this does not necessarily mean that she must be cured. What is the best then ? Of course, in our human minds - let her be cured of cancer. But God always has something better and this something is not always understood by the selfish nature of man. Let me share with you a personal example.<br><br>i lost a brother quite recently.  He has a history of depression. Before that, we have been praying for him to get out of it, admist numerous counselling sessions and visits to doctors.  But sometime last year - we lost him. The cause of his death is still not known - the Police are not able to establish either it was through an accident or self willed suicide.<br><br>We mourned.  Some of us, questioned God. Yeah - even to the extent of wanting to resurrect him.  On a human level - yes, we can all understand that - the process of mourning - questioning God - where is our faith ? But what happened thereafter didnt work out according to our expectations.<br><br>1. His father, who has previously not cared for his family even when they are sick, turned 360 degree. He is a completely changed man overnight. His son died. But he became the unlikely candidate to care and mend the hearts of his other children and wife.<br><br>2. His mother, who suffered from a mental illness - turned for the better day by day.  A hope which we thought has faded away.<br><br>Well, going by a "pattern" here - some people would definitely say the above behaviour could be explained psychologically.   I would say - be my guest. I am not a psychological expert, nor a biological expert or what not.  But i know where my belief is and that is personal.  I can share, you can dont believe.<br><br>The point is this. In this forum, nobody insisted that anyone that saw what we write, should believe in the faith that we have, and in the experiences that we have with our Lord.   i mean, how could we insist ? You are not us who have experienced it !<br><br>Photoseeker cared enough to post a thread to ask for prayers. If someone do not believe in prayers, so be it. One can comment about why we are doing this - but to question on a first assumption, that we have asked you to believe - doesnt do justice to the threadstarter.<br><br>You commented, "No one knows the human structure 100%" -  Precisely - as much as some would like to insist that "solid" evidences need to be given to prove about a theory - but in so far, the ones who question, doesnt seem sure, of where they are coming from.

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks klydeer. It's alright. While we do sincerely pray for Joan, we bound to face people who aren't for it.<br><br>Christ have said, those who have decided to pick up the cross to follow Him will face percecution just like He have been percecuted. But we can seek for His strength to carry us through.<br><br>I've gone through days of misery, gone through times which I wonder why God seems to have abandoned me. But actually I'm the one who've drifted from Him. Due to my selfish nature, I took Him for granted. But now I've recovered and looking back, I realised how many times I've forsaken God in my life and how far away I was from Him.<br><br>Those who've prayed for Joan, I would like to thank you.

So your question: "How you know?" is already answered - "i know according to what i have experienced."  But of course, that is just me sharing here, am not trying to sell you something.</span><br><br>&gt;&gt; Yes.... for many others like you, have prayed that she'll get well n cured, so i do pray for her, but not praying that she'll get well or cured becoz based on the condition she's in now and the sufferings and pains she's enduring, a stage before terminal illness, i hope your God will take her as soon as possible to end her pains and sufferrings. Many of you have otherwise hopes and thinkings compared to me. Many see me as a heartless or bo liao or finding troubles in such threads, but then i really don't give a damn...Anyway, back to it, i stand firm in hoping your God will take her as soon as possible.<br><br><span style="color: red;">So be it. Your prayer is based on what you believed as well. Good to stand firm anyways. Believing in God needs that at times.</span><br><br>&gt;&gt; My thinking n belief on your brother's case: I believe your God did the right thing by taking your brother away and to his side. Like you've mentioned earlier,which your belief in your God is such that your God don't work that way in which what your God has done has not worked out to be what you all have been expecting and hoping for.<br><br><span style="color: red;">What i was saying is that God blessed the family more than we would hope to deserve. Whether God "did" the right thing or not, not up to me to judge. It could have been self willed, and God allow it to happen for good reasons. </span><br><br>&gt;&gt;For your info..360 degree turn makes one complete round/turn and it'll be still left unchanged. It shld be either 90/180 degrees.<br><br><span style="color: red;"> OK. if you insist. Thanks for the correction.</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>&gt;&gt; Neither do i have insisted anyone to support or in mind with me. Also, i do not need to have any experience or go thru what you've gone thru in order to understand your problems/worries/troubles/sadness/etc.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Did i say you need any experience to go through ? Nope i didnt. I wonder where your comments are inspired from. Perhaps you would like to share more on this aspect.</span><br><br>&gt;&gt; Becoz they do not know or unsure of where they're coming from (for some), that's why they questioned. Becoz some have been over-protective of their beliefs and fellow siblings of the same beliefs, and when someone will to question on your beliefs n religion or to the event of going against their beliefs/religions, some of your believers will get irritated/annoyed/buey song...and will keep addressing, emphasizing to non-believers that their God is true/real and tehy shld believe in it. Note: I mentioned "some of your believers"....why i said so is becoz i've experienced and encountered at least 80% of your believers in emphasizing to believe in their God or religion and to join them. And i've made very clear that i do believe in every God of all religions and i do not see a need to join which religion.. I believe means i believe. Everyone has a God in themselves.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Unsure of where they coming from - yes, some questioned like you did, but some did not. Some just wish to create chaos for their own pleasure. Thats my point. Your experiences in your life, with so called 80% of the believers is what so far i have seen as a rare phenomemon here, if any at all. Taking something you experienced somewhere esle and accrue to here, seems unfair. While i was a pre-believer, someone did also invite me to church . The reaction is the same as many of course - "what ? want me to join ar?" On hindsight, its just my own human defensive assumptions.  Asking one to go to church, does not equate to insisting that you must join.  An intention to share what they think is good is still good intention. Similar to a situation when you discovered a pool of water in a desert, and went 10 miles to inform strangers to come share it.  Beliving in this fellow or not, is always up to you to decide.  Although, of course, i am not denying that there are some self professed Christians who did what is not desirable.</span><br><br></div>

That would be a conditional relationship between man and God.  But that is not so. God's love for man is unconditional.  The sad thing is, some people like to consistently place a condition to His love. Example: "If God shows me a miracle, i will believe."  God doesnt work that way - He works this way: "No matter if you believe - i already showed you miracles and working wonders in your life".<br><br>I pray in hope, in trust and in God's will. Not to insist that God must do something. My trust in the Lord say for this context - is based on the faith that God will do the best for her. And this does not necessarily mean that she must be cured. What is the best then ? Of course, in our human minds - let her be cured of cancer. But God always has something better and this something is not always understood by the selfish nature of man. Let me share with you a personal example.<br><br>i lost a brother quite recently.  He has a history of depression. Before that, we have been praying for him to get out of it, admist numerous counselling sessions and visits to doctors.  But sometime last year - we lost him. The cause of his death is still not known - the Police are not able to establish either it was through an accident or self willed suicide.<br><br>We mourned.  Some of us, questioned God. Yeah - even to the extent of wanting to resurrect him.  On a human level - yes, we can all understand that - the process of mourning - questioning God - where is our faith ? But what happened thereafter didnt work out according to our expectations.<br><br>1. His father, who has previously not cared for his family even when they are sick, turned 360 degree. He is a completely changed man overnight. His son died. But he became the unlikely candidate to care and mend the hearts of his other children and wife.<br><br>2. His mother, who suffered from a mental illness - turned for the better day by day.  A hope which we thought has faded away.<br><br>Well, going by a "pattern" here - some people would definitely say the above behaviour could be explained psychologically.   I would say - be my guest. I am not a psychological expert, nor a biological expert or what not.  But i know where my belief is and that is personal.  I can share, you can dont believe.<br><br>The point is this. In this forum, nobody insisted that anyone that saw what we write, should believe in the faith that we have, and in the experiences that we have with our Lord.   i mean, how could we insist ? You are not us who have experienced it !<br><br>Photoseeker cared enough to post a thread to ask for prayers. If someone do not believe in prayers, so be it. One can comment about why we are doing this - but to question on a first assumption, that we have asked you to believe - doesnt do justice to the threadstarter.<br><br>You commented, "No one knows the human structure 100%" -  Precisely - as much as some would like to insist that "solid" evidences need to be given to prove about a theory - but in so far, the ones who question, doesnt seem sure, of where they are coming from.  So is there even a basis to question our belief and our willigness to love a fellow brother, sister or stranger according to our prayers and our faith ?<br><br></div></blockquote>whatever happens after the prayers have nothing to do with the prayers.<br><br></div>
