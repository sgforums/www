It is a method of equipping them with the necessary social skiils that when these children grow up they can cope with life better.<br>While disciplining may have involved the cane at some point in time, it does not have to be that way all the time.

Whatever disciplining should be done indoors. No point in the parent screaming his/her head off in a public place. Break the bad habit, not the spirit of the child.<br>One important issue to note: when discipline is meted out, the parent concern should NOT FEEL RAGE within him. Once there is rage, the discipline process has lost it's meaning. It will evolved to just beating the crap out of the child for the sake of releasing the pent out frustration. However, this is not a simple emotion to overcome or control. I'd advice walking away the moment the anger turns to rage.<br>If a parent loses control of his child at a tender kindergarten-going age what other influence can he claim to have when this child turns into a teenager.<br>Instill enough self-discipline in a child at a young age, you will never have to worry too much about him when he grows up.<br>My children and me?

No books either.<br>Just examples from my personal experience growing up at home, at school, at work and from the Bible. Personal experience - trash out the bad and take in the good.<br><br>Disciplining is just one side to the entire bringup process. The other one is motivating. Once a child knows how to moderate his behaviour, we need to know how to push him to achieve more base on his capabilities. <strong>The trick is how to discipline without demotivating. </strong></div>
