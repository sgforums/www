            <div class='col-md body'>One time at Ngee Ann city, I saw couple of kids picking the little stones from the large flower pots and throwing the stones from basement 1 down to basement 2, at the escalator well. I went after them, who obviously ran off to their parents. Went up to their mom(s), and told the ladies what had happened. Kids got bashed up real good.<br>Sad thing in life is that most parents do not take discipline seriously enough. Hence, they raise up children who are disrespectful to everything and everyone.<br>My own children were told to even pick up merchandise they find lying on the floor of any departmental stores, even though they are not responsible for them falling onto the floor.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For the ones who talked and talked behind you, I guess its really not good of them to do so.  But I also would to encourage you to be patient. Once my pastor told me that in a previous congregation, he saw a very interesting thing.  A man was worshipping God very intimately and singing with all his might and his eyes closed. THis man seems to be a man deeply in love with God but suddenly the woman beside him accidentally knocked his elbow. This man immediately opened his eyes and gave a very stern and disapproving look.  My pastor's found it contradicting and his point was that we as christians while worshipping God should be aware that God is more concern how we are inside rather than outside and if we are so easily agitated by people and could not show love to people, then we are not practicing what Jesus taught us, to love.  Having said that, not saying those people are right, I do get irritated many times too but well I guess God wants us to be a bigger person or else how we react to them may just put us in the same category as them.<br><br>About the children thingy, I do not know that child you are talking about but let me share one incident concerning myself.  I worship in a congregation full of children because many parents there.  Once I was worshipping, this particular girl around 7 or 8 started dancing right in front of the worship leader and singing loudly.  I was irritated of cos, its like hey this girl is so distracting, how can we worship God this way.  But later on I found out that this little girl has Down's Syndrome and that she is like this, very active and very oblivion to people around her.  But what struck me was her act of worship.  She was oblivion to people around her, it doesnt matter that her dance was bad, her singing off key but she just sang and danced just like DAVID did!!! He danced shamelessly in front of everyone!  It brought me to a realisation that sometimes we adults when worshipping God could not bring ourselves to abandon all and worship God but are always so aware of how people look at us.  That little girl taught me a lesson in worshipping God with all your heart, all your strength, all your mind and all your soul.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by gasband:</div><div class="quote_body">For the ones who talked and talked behind you, I guess its really not good of them to do so.  But I also would to encourage you to be patient. Once my pastor told me that in a previous congregation, he saw a very interesting thing.  A man was worshipping God very intimately and singing with all his might and his eyes closed. THis man seems to be a man deeply in love with God but suddenly the woman beside him accidentally knocked his elbow. This man immediately opened his eyes and gave a very stern and disapproving look.  My pastor's found it contradicting and his point was that we as christians while worshipping God should be aware that God is more concern how we are inside rather than outside and if we are so easily agitated by people and could not show love to people, then we are not practicing what Jesus taught us, to love.  Having said that, not saying those people are right, I do get irritated many times too but well I guess God wants us to be a bigger person or else how we react to them may just put us in the same category as them.<br><br>About the children thingy, I do not know that child you are talking about but let me share one incident concerning myself.  I worship in a congregation full of children because many parents there.  Once I was worshipping, this particular girl around 7 or 8 started dancing right in front of the worship leader and singing loudly.  I was irritated of cos, its like hey this girl is so distracting, how can we worship God this way.  But later on I found out that this little girl has Down's Syndrome and that she is like this, very active and very oblivion to people around her.  But what struck me was her act of worship.  She was oblivion to people around her, it doesnt matter that her dance was bad, her singing off key but she just sang and danced just like DAVID did!!! He danced shamelessly in front of everyone!  It brought me to a realisation that sometimes we adults when worshipping God could not bring ourselves to abandon all and worship God but are always so aware of how people look at us.  That little girl taught me a lesson in worshipping God with all your heart, all your strength, all your mind and all your soul.</div></blockquote>I am sure the Down Syndrome child is more of an exception than the rule. Obviously, members within a congregation is aware if there are special need children in the midst and will definitely show grace in such a situation. The more common occurence are parents who when worshipping turns a blind eye to what their children are doing, including ignoring them when these children run up and down the aisle and throwing hymnals on the floor, just for kicks.<br>I for one will not prevent my own children praising God in the top of their lungs during praise and worship, but I will ensure when the message is given or prayer is recited, they remain at the utmost best. As long as my children were old enough to read, they are to follow the ritual of worship in it's entirety when they are present during the service.<br>I think we are talking about ill-disciplined NORMAL children here.<br><br>As to the adults, I think that the trend of this discussion is not really about people who are genuinely worshipping God inspite of their out of tune singing. It is about people who do not turn off their mobile or put them at silent mode. It is also about people who carry on their personal conversation when it is time to worship.

            <div class='col-md body'>Its true that corporate worship must be in order and not disturbed by those small things like chatting over phones and inconsiderate behavior. We can choose to remind and admonish in the love of God and never to pour judgement on the offender as if we ourselves are holy and blameless. We may not behave in such a manner..but outside of church, in our daily lives do we live our lives as a good testimony to others? The Bible says clearly that worship is not on Sundays alone....everyday, every second of your life is to be an act of worship......</div>
