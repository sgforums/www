To urge, edify, strengthen, exhort, encourage, to build the fellow believers.<br><br>I respect your reservation on giving an account, however, consider that if your testimony might have a greater purpose for the body of church.<br>How will the praise of man would have cause God to withdraw His rewards from you? It all depends what you're looking at.<br><br>If you're right...then i think D.L Moody, Charles Finney, Smith Wigglesworth, Thomas Aquinas, Jim Elliot, A.W Tozer, Tommy Barnett, Billy Graham would have lost their rewards?<br><br>Which is more important? Well it's your call. </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">2<br>Like i've stated in the previous post.<br>The Original(emphasis) blueprint of men is the Great commandment.<br>It is not the same. But it works hand in hand.<br><br>Innate nature of a Christian/men is to worship, not spreading the good news - Great Commission.<br>Thru the Great commandment, the complusion to act on Great commission is effective.<br>Acting upon the Great commission is one of the prove for the Love for God, hence fulfilment of the greatest commandment.<br>True. Jesus did not give a choice since it's a commandment(!).<br>Then maybe you may want to sound the catholics out?<br><br></span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">3<br>More importantly, do you think those occurances are of God's judgement or favour?<br></span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">4<br>Your theory of Sin is somewhat loopsided. Sin is everywhere, Grace is abounds.<br>Does it mean that certain states of America have less sin, God will protect the state from harm? Likewise, i support what you've claimed - sin is sin. And that God is indifferent from any time and dispensation.<br><br>So could you explain - Are every single person who died in the tsunami and hurricane hardcore sinners and beyod redemption?<br><br>We need to look into the works of Grace and Mercy(characters of God) before we conclude that it is the judgement of God.<br><br>Like what others have posted.<br>Men might have been to quick to judge these incidents.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">5<br>I suppose all believers who truly have read the bible and stayed on with it, does have the right sense to understand that they have to be vigilant and watchful.<br><br>By saying 'we have to live each day as though Jesus would be coming back and soon....'<br>What would a ideal life for a christian to live by each day?<br>Does it have to be seen by men of their deeds to prove that they are ready for the second coming?<br>What quantifies vigilance? Of readiness?<br><br>The purpose of such incidents(disasters and diseases) - if was said by the article(unknown) you've posted.<br>Then state repentance would have effected. Since if it is inspired by the spirit.<br><br>We will see the result soon....hope you'll stick with me in this case.<br><br></span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">6<br>Since it has been written that you won't know when and how Christ will return. Why look into the Jewish calendar?</span><br></div></blockquote>On the issue of the Great Commandment and The Great Commission, we will agree to disagree? In regards to the Catholics, I think that they have done a lot already, Mother Theresa? the Jesuit priests etc. They have followed the Great Commandment... but it may not be so obvious in Singapore.<br><br>My deeds speak for themselves, God knows what I am doing for His kingdom... He sees. That is enough. If someday I become know for what I do then so be it, if not, then so be it as well. God knows and I know and that is enough.<br><br>If you refer back to the article, the writer was saying that the reason why God chose New Orleans is because there is a great concentration of sin there. I do not think that my theory is lopsided as even in the bible, God specifically targeted certain cities in the OT... eg sodom and gomorrah... the city of nineveh etc.<br><br>If you want to look to the Grace and Mercy of God, then we have been getting a lot of it already... but you have to remember also that God is the same God whether in the NT or OT... so He is also a God of Judgement.<br><br>Personally, I think that these natural disasters which have been increasing in intensity and ferocity are warning signs for all of us. God used similar warning signs in the OT as well.<br><br>Why I say in a state of readiness, I mean that one should always live each day as though it may be your last, too often and too many of us take life for granted. We often forget about God during the course of the week and only focus on Him briefly on Sundays... I know  I was like that too.. but then if you read Matt 6:24-33...

TYhat article, I din even read it lar. Actually for the "spiritualizing" the events is juz speculating lo. As long as we know our scipture well, we will be able to recognise what is right teachings and what is wrong teachings lor.

It does not represent all Christians and neither does it represent my church. I have seen too many articles circulated by well-meaning Christians trying to show the works of the Lord, or testimonies of Christians, while some are true, some are simply stupid or even false. That being the case, what is the difference between the boy who cried wolf? Here's where I mean when I said, that sometimes we kill our own credibility in our zeal to spread the good word.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>How do you decide what the Lord has spoken to you and what is not? How do we recognise that is the correct God's voice? People can also misinterpret it as God's voice. People may argue that please don't link everything to God.<br></strong></blockquote>This to me, is a very personal issue. I personally have almost never make a statement like: the lord has spoken to me. (I did it once and kinda of regretted it). I have heard my own church members making such declarations, but for most parts, it seems to be their own voice talking. Of course, I would not openly confront someone over this, at least this person has the gumption to state that it is HIS OWN experience, not someone elses.<br>What do you do when you choke of food? Declare that God is no happy with your love for buffet?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>There are many ways as in people want to interpret the scripture in that way. If they have a motive in interpreting it in this way, God will know. There is no judge to tell us what is right and wrong interpretations, right now. But there is one thing as commonly accepted interpretations by some groups. Be it right or wrong, it is between them and God lo.<br></strong></blockquote>Personal interpretation can go haywire, which is why I do not do that. In reading any passage, and I need further clarification I would read the entire chapter, or context. I would also subsequently consult the various concordances and cross reference any thing that I might be able to find.  Most Bible scholars do not deviate greatly in their interpretative writing, which also take into consideration of the context of any passage.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Okay lar, never expect to have a debate with you lar.

Can a person experience what other people experience becos he/she has first-hand contact with that person?  If that person experience it and trust in the sharer, wouldn't he/she be allow to share it to other people becos he is convicted it is true? Just listen to other people testimony/witness -- would you believe them? Or just treat it as a story-telling time? I dunno how most other people do.<br><br>Regards</div>
