            <div class='col-md body'>I actually quoted the verses to encourage Christians to be watchful, the things that are going on around the world are a good indication of what is to come... and I am encouraging all Christians to judge themselves and to remain forever at the ready... Christ can return at any time.<br><br>also we ask for signs that God is true and real and that the bible speaks the truth, but when they are given many do not believe, therefore this world will also be given the sign of Jonah... if you understand, you understand, if not, gain understanding and wisdom...<br><br>I have not misquoted... they were intentional.<br><br>We as Christians should never be comfortable... if you are, you are lukewarm... and you know what God will do. We are always to be at the ready... so many of us play Church and never stand up for what counts, we go about our lives without the sense of urgency that Jesus is coming again and that the end times are near... God has called us to do one thing and one thing alone, to make known the Good news. It is our mandate and our life... God and Jesus is our mandate and our life.</div>

God is giving us a sign... we as Christians should be more aware of these things and not just discount them as natural occurances.. who created the earth? Who controls the weather? God does. He will use all things to accomplish His will, be it for favour or judgement.<br><br>Do you think that God changes? Just like in the old testament times, He detests sin. Do you think He would think any different today? Sin is sin and God cannot stand sin.<br><br>I am saying that as Christians we cannot just be idle... when I quoted those verses, I mean that we should be vigilant and always vigilant, don't let satan lull you into a false sense of security by thinking that we don't know when Jesus is coming again, we have to live each day as though Jesus would be coming back and soon...<br><br>According to the Jewish calendar, it is the year 5766, that is we are now in the 6th millenium, and Jesus is supposed to come back in the seventh millenium... so if the Jewish calendar is correct, we have another 234 years to go at most... if it is wrong... then we have less time than that! </span></div>
