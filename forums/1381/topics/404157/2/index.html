              <p>If God told you that you were DEFINITELY going to hell
              regardless of anything that you can possibly do in your physical or
              spiritual life and that this was not a test...</p>

              <p>This is what God word</p>
              <p>Ephesians 2: 8-9 (edited to suit the level of this forum)" By grace, ye (you) are saved through faith, not by works, lest anyone shall boast"</p>
              <p>Hence, it is God will to save us, not other, and our spiritual life and secular life are classified as works. Hence, if God do not want to save me, it is useless to do all things as they will CERTAINLY not let me gain entry.</p>
              <p>But i believe i am saved, and have faith in Jesus Christ as my personal saviour (John 3:16, 20:31, Romans 6:23). Hence, i go to church and worship his name and to built my house with gems and precious stones + doing daily devotion and so on just as God had commanded me to do so (1 Con 3, 2 Con 5)</p>
