However, they also acknowledged that bad and evil things did happen (eg, wars with other tribes, death, murder, famine etc) to them and they had to explain why this was so.  Since they believed that Yahweh was omnipotent (almighty and all knowing) and was "good" by nature, they had to explain where this "evil" came from.  And since there cannot be another "god" (they believed there was only ONE true God), satan was created by the OT writers for this purpose.  Note that satan was part of God and had to do God's bidding eg to inflict harm onto Job, satan had to ask God for permission before it could do anything.<br><br>However, the role of the devil/satan evolved over the years.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Kismet:</div><div class="quote_body">To cut a very very long story short:<br><br>In the Old Testament, satan was an angel who did the bidding of God and wasn't exactly considered good or bad.<br><br>The creation of satan was mainly to explain the dual nature of God.<br><br>Back then in the times of the OT, the Israelites believed that the one true god was Yahweh (there were many other gods that other tribes worshipped) and that He was infinitely good.  However, they also acknowledged that bad and evil things did happen (eg, wars with other tribes, death, murder, famine etc) to them and they had to explain why this was so.  Since they believed that Yahweh was omnipotent (almighty and all knowing) and was "good" by nature, they had to explain where this "evil" came from.  And since there cannot be another "god" (they believed there was only ONE true God), satan was created by the OT writers for this purpose.  Note that satan was part of God and had to do God's bidding eg to inflict harm onto Job, satan had to ask God for permission before it could do anything.<br><br>However, the role of the devil/satan evolved over the years.  By the time of the New Testament, the role of the devil/satan was one of opposition to God.<br>Jesus Christ came to save humanity from sin/evil and these were  attributed to temptations from the devil.  Hence, the devil slowly became a separate entity from God (as opposed to its role in the OT).<br><br>This is just a very brief and simplistic explanation.  If you have any questions, you might want to check with your local priest/ pastor to provide a clearer picture.<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>T</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> ......</div>
