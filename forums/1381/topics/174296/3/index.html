Christians who don't like Catholics is another reason why I had no wish to convert. I am brought up in Singapore, where religious and racial harmony is deeply rooted in me. I have no wish to be with these groups of people (surprisingly, there's a lot). It is going against my principles of maintaining harmony within religious and racial groups. At the least, I have not met anybody in my own religion (buddhism) to be that extreme. The last reason is there is too many conflicting information. One says this, the other one says that. Not only so, one book have this version, another book have another version. The Internet also offers lots of interpretations for Christianity. All of them are correct in their own way (they are not occult, I have to clarify, but it's their conflicting views that is confusing me)</div>

Christians who don't like Catholics is another reason why I had no wish to convert. I am brought up in Singapore, where religious and racial harmony is deeply rooted in me. I have no wish to be with these groups of people (surprisingly, there's a lot). It is going against my principles of maintaining harmony within religious and racial groups. At the least, I have not met anybody in my own religion (buddhism) to be that extreme. The last reason is there is too many conflicting information. One says this, the other one says that. Not only so, one book have this version, another book have another version. The Internet also offers lots of interpretations for Christianity. All of them are correct in their own way (they are not occult, I have to clarify, but it's their conflicting views that is confusing me)</div></blockquote>The real reason why Christians are like that, and Buddhists aren't, is 'cos the Christian place Truth as number one. If you believe in the wrong truth .. you still go to hell .. so you see the importance of truth?<br><br>Buddhists emphasises on compassion. There is no historical truth to grapple with.

I'd say HP's mother is the ultimate sacrifice, Gryffindor is the lion, nothing in the book is considered real in the real world, the only on real practical "sorcery" is divination/tea leave reading and it is being made fun of in the person of Prof Trelawney.<br><br>My point, brey, is we need to be <strong>consistent</strong>. I don't read too much into HP and neither do I read too much into Narnia.</div>

Time and again, in the book, love, sacrifice, as well as wisdom is featured constantly.<br><br>Unfortunately, detractors always seem to focus on the "magical" elements.<br><br>If I were to fault Narnia, then I am really offended at the Father Christmas character in the story. To me, the inclusion of this character is an insult to Christianity. In any Christmas celebration in any country, the Father Christmas character continues to dilute the true Christian message: one of sacrificial love of God.<br><br>It must also be pointed out, from the literary sense, what is allegory to Lewis:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">C.S. Lewis used a very strict definition of the word 'allegory' - after all, one of his most important academic books was a study of this subject. He wrote to some Maryland fifth graders in 1954:<br><br>'I did not say to myself 'Let us represent Jesus as He really is in our world by a Lion in Narnia'; I said 'Let us suppose that there were a land like Narnia and that the Son of God, as he became a Man in our world, became a Lion there, and then imagine what would happen'. </span><br><br>Another point that is important is: The entire Chronicles series were not meant to be Christian literature per se, as compared to, say, Lewis' Screwtape Letters.<br><br>Are there good "magical" imagery in Narnia, of course! The magic healing portion, the bow and arrow set.....<br><br>Again, I wish to state that I am not pro HP or magic. I only ask for consistency in our judgement over such genres.</div>
