            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Deut 18:9 When you enter the land the LORD your God is giving you, do not learn to imitate the detestable ways of the nations there. 10 Let no one be found among you who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, 11 or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. 12 Anyone who does these things is detestable to the LORD, and because of these detestable practices the LORD your God will drive out those nations before you. 13 You must be blameless before the LORD your God.</span><br><br>The context of this verse is that it is addressed to the Israelites entering into foreign lands so that the Israelites do not embrace the religious culture found in the newly occupied territory. This is not to say that the warning is applicable to only to the Israelites at that time. It also serves as a warning to modern day believers who may not be aware of the danger of what the occult bring.<br><br>However, in understanding the warning, we also need to define the dangers more specifically. To pronounce a blanket denounciation over anything remotely occultic (or even perceived to be occultic) is dangerous and irresponsible.<br><br>When we look at the genres, something that is being defined as occultic may not really be occultic after all, similarly, just because an individual feels that a particular title or genre is occultic does not represent that this title is truly occultic.<br><br><strong>SO WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF OCCULT:</strong><br>The word "occult" is generally associated with secret knowledge and practices dealing with the supernatural or "psychic" phenomena often for the purpose of obtaining personal power. Some occult practices rely on demons or "spirits" to achieve their goals.<br><a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-occult-defn.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-occult-defn.html</a><br><br>A simple definition for occult is, "of or pertaining to magic, astrology, and other alleged sciences claiming use or knowledge of secret, mysterious, or supernatural agencies"<br><a href="http://www.biblequestions.org/Archives/BQAR402.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblequestions.org/Archives/BQAR402.htm</a><br><br><strong>WHAT IS NOT OCCULT:</strong><br>Reading stories or articles about occult Â– the key word is READING.<br>Playing computer games Â– computer games are designed to react to commands, the gameÂ’s A.I. takes over in a preset sequence.<br>Watching TV programmes on occult Â– in itself, it is no different from watching a murder movie or a crime caper. If this is untrue, than we should not watch a murder mystery because that will be constituted as committed murder.<br><br><strong>DO THE ABOVE ACTIVITES LEAD TO THE OCCULT?</strong><br>It depends entirely on the individual watching/engaging in such activities. If the individualÂ’s mind is weak and is susceptible to influences than, yes, it will lead to the occult. This being the case, the problem is not the activity, but the individual.<br>If the individual is now the problem, the media is NOT at fault.<br><br>In my collection of books at home, I have many books on occult and comparative religion Â– all written from the non-Christian perspective. My family reads Harry Potter, plays Pokemon, discusses witchcraft. Non of us are affected by the occult, either supernaturally or psychologically. My boys are heavily involved in their church ministries, get along well with their peers, get good school results.<br><br>My point is: occult involvement is dangerous, but the lack of understanding of what is and what is not occult is equally dangerous.<br>Occult activity can be strong, but the individual has to be stronger. If the individual is overwhelmed, the problem may not lie with the external forces, but with the internal fortitude.<br></div>

They say that the Bible is wordless.

This is not to say that the warning is applicable to only to the Israelites at that time. It also serves as a warning to modern day believers who may not be aware of the danger of what the occult bring.<br><br>However, in understanding the warning, we also need to define the dangers more specifically. To pronounce a blanket denounciation over anything remotely occultic (or even perceived to be occultic) is dangerous and irresponsible.<br><br>When we look at the genres, something that is being defined as occultic may not really be occultic after all, similarly, just because an individual feels that a particular title or genre is occultic does not represent that this title is truly occultic.<br><br>[b]SO WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF OCCULT:</strong><br>The word "occult" is generally associated with secret knowledge and practices dealing with the supernatural or "psychic" phenomena often for the purpose of obtaining personal power. Some occult practices rely on demons or "spirits" to achieve their goals.<br><a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-occult-defn.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-occult-defn.html</a><br><br>A simple definition for occult is, "of or pertaining to magic, astrology, and other alleged sciences claiming use or knowledge of secret, mysterious, or supernatural agencies"<br><a href="http://www.biblequestions.org/Archives/BQAR402.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblequestions.org/Archives/BQAR402.htm</a><br><br><strong>WHAT IS NOT OCCULT:</strong><br>Reading stories or articles about occult Â– the key word is READING.<br>Playing computer games Â– computer games are designed to react to commands, the gameÂ’s A.I. takes over in a preset sequence.<br>Watching TV programmes on occult Â– in itself, it is no different from watching a murder movie or a crime caper. If this is untrue, than we should not watch a murder mystery because that will be constituted as committed murder.<br><br><strong>DO THE ABOVE ACTIVITES LEAD TO THE OCCULT?</strong><br>It depends entirely on the individual watching/engaging in such activities. If the individualÂ’s mind is weak and is susceptible to influences than, yes, it will lead to the occult. This being the case, the problem is not the activity, but the individual.<br>If the individual is now the problem, the media is NOT at fault.<br><br>In my collection of books at home, I have many books on occult and comparative religion Â– all written from the non-Christian perspective. My family reads Harry Potter, plays Pokemon, discusses witchcraft. Non of us are affected by the occult, either supernaturally or psychologically. My boys are heavily involved in their church ministries, get along well with their peers, get good school results.<br><br>My point is: occult involvement is dangerous, but the lack of understanding of what is and what is not occult is equally dangerous.<br>Occult activity can be strong, but the individual has to be stronger. If the individual is overwhelmed, the problem may not lie with the external forces, but with the internal fortitude.<br>[/b]</blockquote>Like what you said, we are told to detest the occultic mediums etc in the bible. So even in the early church of Ephesus, they burn all their occultic books &amp; witchcraft. We can't have one feet in the occult &amp; one feet in Christianity. I don't agree with your interpretation of what is not occult. Like i said, not everyone as strong as you. &amp; even so are you sure you are in the real Christianity? Blessings need not come from God but can come as a natural gifting or from the devil or from the occult.</div>
