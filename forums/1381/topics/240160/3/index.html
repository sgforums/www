Of course it isn't such a simplistic answer. According to the Augustinian thought, we fall on something called a formed and informed conscience. You reflect, read scripture and formed your conscience. From there, u ask yourself whether whatever you're partaking in, whether it goes against your conscience.<br><br></div>

The key here is moderation and self control.<br>(to be frank, our work and even our ministries involvement can also become an obsession which may leads our focus away from God).<br><br>Hence, here personal conviction applies<br>1) So is gambling permissible? probably yes. Is it benefical? most likely not.<br>2) Will this cause a weaker brethern to stumble? yes, there is a high chance a younger, impressionable brethern who lacks understanding and/or self control may get stumble.<br><br>so with these, let each make your own decision based on your own conviction, whether you want or you don't want to do it.<br><br>cheers ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div></blockquote>Hrmm....but when we start to gamble, no matter if it is about money or anything esle "at stake" - what is it that we believe in ? Ourselves ? Chance? Luck ? GOD ?<br><br>I wonder how do we account to God in this aspect of our life that we do ? Simply said, if we draw a monthly salary of 2k, use $2 to bet on Toto - what is it that we want out of that piece of action ?  Since we profess that everything that we have belongs to God, are we sure that God wants us to use that $2 (be it not leading to greed) to gamble for a pot of larger gold ? Or are we saying that we enter into for example - a lucky draw, pray to God for us to win, and if we win, we attribute it to God's work ?  Of course, we dont go to hell for all these things....but are we doing these in His glory ?<br><br>Perhaps i see the word "gamble" as "taking chances". So the itch to frown at it.  When in doubt, i would rather pray and seek God for His guidance....rather than to gamble.....it reminded me of using my own flesh to do what i want.<br><br>And ...I dont quite agree that it may cause weaker brethen to stumble, but rather of the opinion, that it can cause anyone to stumble...even right from the start.  And Christianity should not be based on a personal conviction but a conviction with what our Lord wants us to do.<br><br></div>
