            <div class='col-md body'>my personal view falls slightly in tandem with Vince's. I bet on soccer quite often and it doesn't affect my spiritual journey. at least, i dun think it does. In retrospect, i remember during one of the european cups, i got carried away and starting betting in the hundreds. that really messed me up. i started getting edgy when i lost and it affected not only my spiritual life but my family life. Toto might seem like a harmless game and in most cases it is (i acknowledge asking my brother to buy for me quickpicks for the recent hong bao draw). However i have seen people getting carried away with Toto and 4D and it really messed up their lives. I guess, my summative view is that as long as you don't get carried away, it's fine</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Icemoon:</div><div class="quote_body">investment is different from speculation right?</div></blockquote>This is a really good point. How do we draw a line between what is investment and speculation? My uncle does investing full time and ppl seem to think of it as speculation and gambling. He even had Christians telling him that its wrong.<br><br>That's why i tend to sway towards Vince's arguement</div>
