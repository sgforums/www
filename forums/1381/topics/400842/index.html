              <p>Greetings,</p>
              <p>There have been much concerns over the use of church funds by city harvest.</p>
              <p>there have been much unhappiness over the abuse of church funds to buy a stake in suntec city . This is especially so when the money could be used to help the poor instead of enriching kong hee and his cronies.</p>
              <p>there have been many instances where ex-CHC have stepped forward to expose the church's wrong doings. Unfortunately, the truth have been snuffed out.</p>
              <p>Today, another courageous ex-CHC member have stepped forward to speak the truth.</p>
              <p>I would like to invite all to discuss on the possible legal implications and social reprecussion of the abuse of church funds by kong hee and cronies.</p>

              <p>It's a big SCANDAL all along. It's just amazing that it took so long for people to realise it. The koreans are using this formula in the late eighties &amp; early ninties.</p>
              <p>If the goverment don't check on them, soon these so-called "christian" will filling up in parliament seats and running the country. Power simply corrupts.</p>

              <p>They did make a few forays, like handing out Chick's tracts or taking over AWARE</p>

              <p>Honestly as a Christian I do not agree with some of the practices of City Harvest and the lavish use of funds. I have ever described how everything gives me a feeling of "Tower of Babbel".</p>
              <p>In any case, I think it is good that we know of the possibility of such investigations. I hope that it is just, fair and transperant.</p>
