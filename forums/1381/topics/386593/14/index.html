              <p>It would be easier for u to focus on ur studies.</p>
              <p>Not even the church dares to challenge scientists when they discover dinosaurs nor for major astronomical findings because they have no evidence to proof them wrong. Besides making alot of noise for research regarding humans and using humans test subjects, the church remains very silent against most of the other research that are going against what they preach since they can't find any proof to go against science.</p>
