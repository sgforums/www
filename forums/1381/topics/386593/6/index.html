              <p>You must also remember that political systems that tried to
                  exterminate religion and calling it a scumb bag of our modern
                  civilisation also didnt last very long either</p>
              <p>In the reign of the Tsar's time in Russia,
                  many Russians were strong believes of
                  othrodox Christianity before the takeover by
                  the Bolsheviks. When communism had its firm hold, religion was
                  banned, religious books destroyed. In 70 years after the fall of
                  the monarchy, the entire soviet union disintegrated and people who
                  once had their faith removed could now openly worship. </p>
              <p>The taleban when they removed or blew up the Buddha at banyan
                  were cursed, resulting in their loss of power from 2001 to the
                  US-led Afghanistan forces. Is it not so that god has a
                  play in it?</p>
              <p>Even countries that still practice "communism" and the northern
                  country that is a die hard communist all know that it is better to
                  keep religion alive and not to desecrate religious
                  artefacts for they know they shall be cursed.</p>

              <p>Its a theory yes that is being research on. What is religion? A
                  belief that is passed on that has no scientific proof etc that can
                  be verified but is slowly being proven wrong with advancement in
                  science.</p>
              <p>Do we need further research into the theory of evolution? How
                  many fossils have been dug out? You might as well catalog all the
                  plants and animals in this world and then make a
                  conclusion. </p>
              <p>A belief that is passed on that has no scientific proof etc that
                  can be verified but is slowly being proven wrong with advancement
                  in science.</p>
              <p>Is religion wrong in everything? The bible has for once quoted
                  scientific arguments in some chapters. for example, the existence
                  of lightning, the tides the days. </p>
              <p>Major religious texts do have quotations on Scientific concepts.
                  True, maybe their concepts like Aristotle is wrong, but you also
                  have to consider the amount of scientific knowledge present in
                  those days and the people who copied the scriptures of the bibles
                  hand by hand. Mistakes were made by man. not by god.</p>
              <p>---------------------</p>
              <p>If you didn't know how to read, species that did not survive
                  would have died out. Furthermore, there are still millions of
                  different species of birds, insects etc etc and not just 1. Please
                  explain that as well. If your world, there is only 1 bird, 1
                  insect, 1 fish etc, i really wonder where you came from.</p>
              <div>How do you know they died out? Where is the fact? Fossils?
                  Even the big asteroid crash 65 million years ago is just a theory.
                  How do you know they didnt survive? Maybe some manage to hide? Like
                  the 300 million year old fish? Not adpated into its environment but
                  still found in the world? </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Who said chemistry, physics, biology etc are not against
                  religion? How did people start astronomy? It came from advancement
                  in physics to allow people to view the world, how did people
                  started the big bang theory and how elements etc came about? That
                  comes from chemistry by analysing the contents of space matter.
                  Without biology, how do people start evolution theory and show that
                  virus etc are mutating and evolving to be resistant to drugs etc.
                  Its a fact that every branch of science is helping to deprove
                  religion in their respective ways just that they don't all link to
                  it directly and its clear you fail to see how the sciences are all
                  link together and each science is not a seperate entitiy.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Does anywhere in the bible deny the existence of chemical
                  reactions? elements? None. </div>
              <div>What i'm saying here is that science and religion are
                  intertwined. Not religion against Science or Science against
                  religion. They're hand in hand </div>

              <p>It can't be changed too easily because too many people still chooses to believe in it. People have believed in god for 2000+ yrs yet science is only progressiing and starting to disprove alot of stuff in the past 100 yrs or less so obviously it takes more time to wakeup ppl who have sunk too deep into their beliefs.</p>
              <p>What evidence do you have that it was even god who write the 1st bible and not just a work of a man? There can be prove of its existance but what proof is there of who wrote it?</p>
              <p>There are evidence of species being extinct and endangered. We don't even need go back millions of years. In the past 100 years, animals like the dodo bird, the tasmanian tiger etc have become extinct and they are real enough.</p>
              <p>Fossils shows many different lifeforms in the past, way before human beings existed. Explain why human beings came about so late and how did those fossils came about? Its too much to evidence and findings all over the world to be made by a group of people who are lying. There may not be alot of fossil evidence but more than enough to prove of live before humans and where do god appear in those times?</p>
              <p>Astronomy is a science, evolution theory is also a branch of science and these are researching into areas that contrict what many religious text talks about. The reason simply because there is no evidence to prove what religion says is true and does the bible explains the purpose of the moon or the other planets, stars etc that we see? Its because theres a lack of knowledge that drives scientist to research the field and by going into the field, their findings start to contridict religious writings. In that sense, you can say religion has driven science but into a direction to contridict the religious stuff.</p>
              <p>BTW, i assume u are not blind and know how to read my nick. If you are blind to notice your mistakes, that will perhaps explain why you are blindly beliving in religion as well.</p>

Since you say that evolution is taking place all the time, and since bacteria has so many generations, why do after 10 or 100 generations do i not see a mutation. Everything's coordinated so perfectly, it doesn't seem to have occurred by chance. the mathematics do not prove it. And secondly I do not see any trial and error bacteria and viruses being created after many generations too </p>

              generations do i not see a mutation. Everything's coordinated so
              perfectly, it doesn't seem to have occurred by
              chance. the mathematics do not prove it. And secondly I do not see
              any trial and error bacteria and viruses being created after many
              generations too </p>

              <p>Who says everything is working perfectly? Explain birth defects, cancers etc which are caused by defective genes and problems be it in the DNA itself or during the process of DNA replication. Please study more bio before you talk.</p>
              <p>U sure there is no mutation? Please explain how H1N1 came about? Why was it non existent or not harmful 10 yrs ago or 100 yrs ago and only decide to spread and kill only last year?</p>
              <p>SARS in 2003, where did it come from? Why did it suddenly appear then? Same with all the epidemics like black death etc in the past. Did they appear out of nowhere? How did they come about? How do u know the harmeless virus etc now won't evolve into something deadly in time to come?</p>

              yet science is only progressiing and starting to disprove alot of
              stuff in the past 100 yrs or less so obviously it takes more time
              to wakeup ppl who have sunk too deep into their beliefs.</p>
              <p>What evidence do you have that it was even god who write the 1st
              bible and not just a work of a man? There can be prove of its
              existance but what proof is there of who wrote it?</p>
              <p>There are evidence of species being extinct and endangered. We
              don't even need go back millions of years. In the past 100 years,
              animals like the dodo bird, the tasmanian tiger etc have become
              extinct and they are real enough.</p>
              <p>Fossils shows many different lifeforms in the past, way before
              human beings existed. Explain why human beings came about so late
              and how did those fossils came about? Its too much to evidence and
              findings all over the world to be made by a group of people who are
              lying. There may not be alot of fossil evidence but more than
              enough to prove of live before humans and where do god appear in

              no evidence to prove what religion says is true and does the bible
              explains the purpose of the moon or the other planets, stars etc
              that we see? Its because theres a lack of knowledge that drives
              scientist to research the field and by going into the field, their
              findings start to contridict religious writings. In that sense, you
              can say religion has driven science but into a direction to

              <p>They died because they could not adapt to their new environment just like everything else. Nothing stays the same forever so any species that cannot adapt will just die out. Human influence is just like the influence of any other species. A new species evolved and take over the environment from other species that could not adapt to the new change.</p>
              <p>There were many factors why science only progress recently. If it just took a day to arrive from stone age to today, religion would be over tomorrow. Progress takes time. How many years in school did you study before you know enough stuff to know? In the past without proper education, its already amazing we got to where we were. Did god come down 1 day and taught us how to build a computer? Did god teach us how to build concrete buidlings etc?</p>
              <p>As we have said, science is still progressing, what it has not found out now doesn't mean it doesn't exist. In 2000 years from now, there might be little that science has not found out just like it how long the belief of god has lasted. Given time, things will change as they are slowly changing now.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333;">There are
                  evidence of species being extinct and endangered. We don't even
                  need go back millions of years. In the past 100 years, animals like
                  the dodo bird, the tasmanian tiger etc have become extinct and they
                  are real enough.</span></p>
              <p>The dodo bird wasn't extinct because of natural
                  causes. It became extinct because of human interference.
                  The Tasmanian tiger;s extinction is because of similar
                  causes too. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Astronomy is
                  a science, evolution theory is also a branch of science and these
                  are researching into areas that contrict what many religious text
                  talks about. The reason simply because there is no evidence to
                  prove what religion says is true and does the bible explains the
                  purpose of the moon or the other planets, stars etc that we see?
                  Its because theres a lack of knowledge that drives scientist to
                  research the field and by going into the field, their findings
                  start to contridict religious writings. In that sense, you can say
                  religion has driven science but into a direction to contridict the
                  religious stuff.</span></p>
              <p>But what intiated the Scientist to find out more about the world
                  around us and to actually investigate about our world? If modern
                  Science has only stuck around for 100 years why didnt humans start
                  earlier? is there a reason? Was religion an obstacle? </p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Fossils shows
                  many different lifeforms in the past, way before human beings
                  existed. Explain why human beings came about so late and how did
                  those fossils came about? Its too much to evidence and findings all
                  over the world to be made by a group of people who are lying. There
                  may not be alot of fossil evidence but more than enough to prove of
                  live before humans and where do god appear in those
                  times?</span></p>
              <p>But many lifeforms do not show a trend. A theory is still a
                  theory and isnt 100% correct, in that strange lifeforms with no
                  apparent ancestors still are around. Like the jellyfish. Where did
                  it come from? </p>

              <p>I believe the period you are looking for is the Renaissance, i think we can safely say it's the point where the more secular way of thinking, or the scientific revolution started. Not more than a 100 years ago. </p>
              <p>There are alot of contributing factors to how it started, the Black Death that swept through Europe for one devastated the priesthood as hard as the peasantry, resulting in doubt and distrust of the Roman Catholic Church which had claimed to be the ultimate representative of God.</p>
              <p>There are also claims that Zheng He's Voyages resulted in Chinese artifacts flowing to Italy, shocking the European worldview that there was actually a prospering civilization that matched their own, triggering the Renaissance.</p>
              <p>Considering that the Roman Catholic Church had direct control of the religion, philosophy, morals, politics, art and education of Europe i think we can safely say religion was the main obstacle, though i'd be fair to say that the only way then to be able to study such matters was to join the clergy so the Church did contributed.</p>
              <p>There has been fossils found that dated back to 580 million years ago, jellyfishes belong to the Cnidaria family of organisms. But considering that the Jellyfish dwell in the oceans and consists of 95% water it's going

              <p> Frankly i'd like to see the evidence that Life did not come about through evolution, all i see from Creationism is the holes in Evolution but little proof on we were created besides a dusty book more than a thousand years old.</p>
