              <p>But I think when presenting the gospel the christian doing this
              to tell them about what jesus said that not all who called him lord
              will go heaven.   </p>
              <p>Besides, christianity claims that it is not through good work
              that one receives salvation, it is through jesus.   That
              is why most christians don't bother to be nice.   To
              them they already accept jesus have free passport go
              heaven and since no need do good work to attain this they
              don't care.</p>

              <p>Yeah they are stupid to think of that. The bible has warned that saying ''YOU FOOL!'' will bring you danger to going to hell no matter what. Jesus also said not to bear false witness against neighbours, to help the poor, and also to help a neighbour in need. But christians think they can go scott-free from breaking those rules.</p>

              <p>from my experience, i personally find there are many good christians from methodist. they really practice what is being taught, kind hearted  and conservative in their dressing. whenever  i met evil christians ,who do not believe in retribution, i will know they are definitely not from methodist.</p>
              <p>however, whether the evil christians believe in retribution or not, i always see retribution happen to them. just be patient, you will see retribution happen to them, it is just a matter of time.</p>
              <p>catholics are also not bad because their teachings are quite strict.</p>

              <p>Retribution is not up to you guys to decide. You may not see it , but it happens. Thier mum may die, they may get done over by the very things they themselves do to others. Or worse, burn in hell to suffer for millenia over a few million bucks.</p>
              <p>So, please dont be so shallow as to being stupid about lumping them all together. This world has no place for innocent and nice people. Yup, they mostly die horrible deaths, at least on this earth they suffer, so its fair to say that, at least they will be rewarded in heaven.</p>

              <p>the retribution i am talking about here is what the evil christians had done to others, they will receive the same treatment from others the next time, which i have seen them. sometimes i have left the place but someone will tell me what had happened to those evil christians.</p>
              <p>they should not be rewarded in heaven, god should teach these evil christians personally if there is really a god. these evil christians  did not know what they had done wrong even when retribution happend to them.</p>
