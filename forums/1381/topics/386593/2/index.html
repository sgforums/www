              <p>so what if the prophecies is true? how u get the figures that
              2000 prophecies are true? what source did you obtained from? pardon
              me for my cynicism, as I dun trust when people quoted figures and
              stats to me. you cant trust people words these days. then what
              happened to the 500 prophecies if 2000 are correct?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so what of everyone is correct, does it help to prevent people
              from dying, does it help with poverty in some poor countries? as
              mentioned earlier, if your prophesy can save 200,000 lives lost
              from the 2004 tsunamis, then its a good prophesy as its purpose
              saves lives. of the 2000 prophecies, how many of them did save
              lives and improve the quality of the people? if it did not serve a
              purpose, then whats the use of it? its just like seeing a fortune
              teller, he told me to avoid driving in december, but never tell me
              how to drive without any incident in december. whats the use of
              telling me that?  if I drive in december, can he accurately
              tell me the exact date and time where the incident occur so that I
              can avoid driving that day, save the problem once and for all, isnt
              it.</p>

              <p>Oh is that so? Then can you explain why every prophecy about
              Israel from being a nation again to a prosperous land has come
              true? And can you explain why is that when Jesus said the temple of
              jerusalem will be destroyed, not one stone left, and 40 years after
              he resurrected and went up to heaven, the romans really destroyed
              the temple, with no one stone left, and for your info, the chances
              of the temple being torn apart are 1/4000.</p>
              <p>there are 2500 prophecies in the bible, and 2000 have been
              fulfilled. And fulfilling of the bible prophecy obviously means
              matching the case exactly as described in the bible, so your

Is it god sent them halfway decided oh shit i sent wrong person, u have to die cos u have no purpose. Babies who die serves the purpose of coming to earth so that they can die by crying a few days/months/yrs of their life?</p>
              <p>You're as naive as the kids that believed that by commiting suicide, they can become savers of the world to think everyone has a purpose to be born.

              <p>Omnipotence- The person who is omnipotent is able to do anything.</p>
              <p>-But the contradiction is, the person who is omnipotent can't think of a time when he cannot lift a rock.</p>
              <p>The topic of omnipotence (the ability of God to do anything, i.e., God is
                all-powerful) is frequently
                cited by atheists as proof that the God of the Bible cannot exist. The claim
                has been made that if there is <em>anything</em> that God cannot do, then God
                cannot be omnipotent and, therefore, does not exist.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.godandscience.org/images/rock.jpg" border="0" alt="Can God create a rock so heavy He can't lift it?" width="290" height="221" align="right">Some of the arguments against omnipotence are plain silly and stupid. Can God create a
                spherical triangle? Saying that omnipotence
                requires the ability to do logically impossible things is stupid. God cannot
                turn truth into a lie. If humans define a triangle as a two dimensional object
                formed by the intersection of three lines, it makes no sense to ask if God
                could make one that was spherical. When one says that God is all-powerful, one
                means that God is able to accomplish all that He desires to do. Even an all-powerful being cannot
                do what is impossible by definition. God can do many things that are humanly
                impossible. However, there are some things that even an all-powerful being
                cannot do.</p>
              <p>Can God create a rock He cannot lift? Since an all-powerful being will
                always be able to accomplish whatever He sets out to do, it is impossible for
                an all-powerful being to fail. The above atheistic argument is arguing that
                since God is all-powerful He can do anything - even fail. This is like saying
                that since God is all-powerful He can be not all-powerful. Obviously, this is
                absurd. An all-powerful being cannot fail. Therefore, God can create a rock of
                tremendous size, but, since He is all-powerful, He will always be able to lift
                it. The ability to fail is not a part of omnipotence. The Bible makes it clear 
                that God is able to do anything He wants to, and that nothing He wants to do 
                is too difficult for Him to accomplish.<sup><a href="http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/rock.html#n04">4</a></sup> This is 
                the true meaning of omnipotence.</p>
              <p>Could God think of a time
                when He was not omnipotent? If He can't think of it, He isn't omnipotent, but if
                He does think of it then there was a time when He wasn't omnipotent? This
                question is quite similar to the rock question above. The answer, of course,
                is that God can never think of a time when He wasn't omnipotent. God has
                always been omnipotent. His inability to contradict His divine character does
                not mean that He isn't omnipotent.</p>
              <p>The atheist distorts the biblical definition of omnipotence in order to
                "prove" that God cannot exist. Contrary to their claims, omnipotence
                does not include the ability to do things that are, by definition, impossible.
                Neither does omnipotence include the ability to fail. By defining omnipotence
                as requiring one to have the ability to fail, atheists have defined
                omnipotence as being impossible. Of course, an omnipotent God would never
                fail.</p>
              <p>These kinds of arguments are clearly illogical and even silly, although
                they are commonly used by inexperienced atheists. Most intelligent atheists
                have dropped these kinds of arguments long ago.</p>

              <p>I guess you study too little science to know how science esp chemistry can be used to fake alot of 'artefacts'.</p>
              <p>Original is just said but what evidence of it is the original? Its alot of words of people so just like they can say its true, i can say its fake.</p>
              <p>How could u verify it has not been altered by the later people who pass it on?</p>
              <p>You just need every single generation to change even a word in it and after a few thousand years, you got a totally new product.</p>
              <p>Go study history of human beings, how long have the 1st human been living and why some1 call jesus only appear 2000+ yrs ago? Hes taking a vacation in the past few tens of thousand of years and suddenly decided time for me to show off so he appears?</p>
              <p>If there really is such a 'god' why are there so many beliefs, religion and culture all over the world? Today he happy hes jesus, yesterday he was thor, last week he was zues, last month he was jade emperor?</p>

              <p>Omnipotence- The person who is omnipotent is able to do
                  anything.</p>
              <p>-But the contradiction is, the person who is omnipotent can't
                  think of a time when he cannot lift a rock.</p>
              <p>The topic of omnipotence (the ability of God to do anything,
                  i.e., God is all-powerful) is frequently cited by atheists as proof
                  that the God of the Bible cannot exist. The claim has been made
                  that if there is <em>anything</em> that God cannot do, then God
                  cannot be omnipotent and, therefore, does not exist.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.godandscience.org/images/rock.jpg" alt="Can God create a rock so heavy He can't lift it?" width="290" height="221">Some of the arguments against omnipotence are plain silly
                  and stupid. Can God create a spherical triangle? Saying that
                  omnipotence requires the ability to do logically impossible things
                  is stupid. God cannot turn truth into a lie. If humans define a
                  triangle as a two dimensional object formed by the intersection of
                  three lines, it makes no sense to ask if God could make one that
                  was spherical. When one says that God is all-powerful, one means
                  that God is able to accomplish all that He desires to do. Even an
                  all-powerful being cannot do what is impossible by definition. God
                  can do many things that are humanly impossible. However, there are
                  some things that even an all-powerful being cannot do.</p>
              <p>Can God create a rock He cannot lift? Since an all-powerful
                  being will always be able to accomplish whatever He sets out to do,
                  it is impossible for an all-powerful being to fail. The above
                  atheistic argument is arguing that since God is all-powerful He can
                  do anything - even fail. This is like saying that since God is
                  all-powerful He can be not all-powerful. Obviously, this is absurd.
                  An all-powerful being cannot fail. Therefore, God can create a rock
                  of tremendous size, but, since He is all-powerful, He will always
                  be able to lift it. The ability to fail is not a part of
                  omnipotence. The Bible makes it clear that God is able to do
                  anything He wants to, and that nothing He wants to do is too
                  difficult for Him to accomplish.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/rock.html#n04">4</a></sup> This is the true meaning of omnipotence.</p>
              <p>Could God think of a time when He was not omnipotent? If He
                  can't think of it, He isn't omnipotent, but if He does think of it
                  then there was a time when He wasn't omnipotent? This question is
                  quite similar to the rock question above. The answer, of course, is
                  that God can never think of a time when He wasn't omnipotent. God
                  has always been omnipotent. His inability to contradict His divine
                  character does not mean that He isn't omnipotent.</p>
              <p>The atheist distorts the biblical definition of omnipotence in
                  order to "prove" that God cannot exist. Contrary to their claims,
                  omnipotence does not include the ability to do things that are, by
                  definition, impossible. Neither does omnipotence include the
                  ability to fail. By defining omnipotence as requiring one to have
                  the ability to fail, atheists have defined omnipotence as being
                  impossible. Of course, an omnipotent God would never fail.</p>
              <p>These kinds of arguments are clearly illogical and even silly,
                  although they are commonly used by inexperienced atheists. Most
                  intelligent atheists have dropped these kinds of arguments long
                  ago.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>the reply to that article is this. since you say god is omnipotent and cannot fail to create anything he wishes and he cant fail, then there lies this paradox. is there anything he cant create? the answer is no. but is there something he can create which he cant lift it up? so the answer to that is yes or no, just answer to this question. the writer is avoiding the question it seems. if this is not a paradox, I wonder what is. whats witholding you back from answering to this direct question.</p></div>
