              <p>the reply to that article is this. since you say god is
                  omnipotent and cannot fail to create anything he wishes and he cant
                  fail, then there lies this paradox. is there anything he cant
                  create? the answer is no. but is there something he can create
                  which he cant lift it up? so the answer to that is yes or no, just
                  answer to this question. the writer is avoiding the question it
                  seems. if this is not a paradox, I wonder what is. whats witholding
                  you back from answering to this direct question.</p>

              <p>To you, anything regarding God is a parodox of course, since you live in self-denial.</p>
              <p>AND LOL READ THIS FROM A CHRISTIAN SITE AIMED AT JOKING ABOUT ATHEISTS[Please note that some of the content is offensive to atheists.]</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff93ff; font-size: large;"><strong><em>Atheists</em></strong></span></p>

              <p><strong>Psalm 52</strong><br> <sup>5</sup>   God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he
                    shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee
                    out of the land of the living. Selah.<br> <sup>6</sup>   The righteous also shall see, and fear, and
                    shall laugh at him:<br> <sup>7</sup>   Lo, this is the man that made not God his
                    strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself
                    in his wickedness.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff93ff; font-size: xx-small;">(If you don't trust in God,
                    he'll kill you and while you're dying the "righteous" will laugh at
                    you.)</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff93ff; font-size: large;">What are Atheists? What do
                    They Believe?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>1.)</strong> Myth: Atheists have no belief in the Christian God or any of the false god of
                  the other religions.  It has nothing to do with hate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Reality:
                  Everyone including atheists know the Christian god, God is real. We know he is
                  real since we call him God with a capital "G" -- that proves it right
                  there. The more than 2,500 accounted for "gods" are all made up to
                  attempt to draw Christians away from the one True god, God. All these non-Christians
                  hate Christians, as well as God.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>2.)</strong> Myth: Atheists  are very socially conscious and strive for humans to live
                  in peace.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Reality: Atheists are
                  all anarchist who hate everything and everyone. All atheists are out to forcibly
                  remove God from the world and take Him out of the History of His Earth.</span></p>
              <p><br> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>3.)</strong> Myth: On average atheists have higher IQs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Reality:
                  They are demons, meaning they are slaves to Satan. Since of this they don't
                  think so thus have an IQ of 0.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>3.)</strong> Myth: Atheists can live high moral lives. They can raise wonderful children,
                  help the needy, provide food and shelter for the poor. They love to help humans
                  since they don't believe in a god, so they instead turn to humanity for love and
                  compassion. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Reality:
                  Atheists live highly sinful lives and fill our state prisons. It's no wonder
                  that 100% of our prisons our full of atheists. Any atheist who claims to be good
                  is trying to act good to draw people to their religion. They will try to enter
                  organizations to help the needy but rightfully will be turned down since
                  everyone knows atheists are hateful and filthy bigots. When atheists start
                  organizations for the needy us True Christians come along and dismember, and
                  destroy their idolaterous buildings. These atheists enforce the Religion of
                  Evolutionism onto these needy people before they give them food, demanding that
                  they confess their alliegance to Satan. What kind of sick moran leaves a needy
                  person in a cold like that with no solid help?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>4.)</strong> Myth: Atheists are people to.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Reality:
                  THEY ARE EVIL DEMONS! WRATHFUL AND HATEFUL NIGGER LOVERS!</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>5.)</strong> Myth: Atheists believe in Logic and Reason.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Reality:
                  Firstly, I don't like how atheists use those words. They capitalize Logic and
                  Reason since that's the lies they worship. We use God and Truth since they are
                  things we posses and we prove this by using capital letters. Atheists who do the
                  same thing are mocking Christianity.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff93ff; font-size: large;">Atheists
                  are the Vast Majority in the Public Education System and in the Judicial System.
                  What do We do about that?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffeb0e;">Firstly,
                  never take your children to public school since you don't want them to be
                  brainwashed by religious beliefs. Home school them and teach them only about the
                  Bible and God's Love for all. Tell them the truth about atheism and they're
                  religion: <a href="http://www.truechristian.com/evolutionstupid.html">Evolutionism</a>. Satan planted them in
                  schools and things to make atheists look smart and appealing when the truth is
                  they are all communists who wallow in their own vomit and lick the rectums of
                  dogs. Since that's all atheists are, filthy stinky homosexuals who hate
                  everyone. They should all die, as God orders us to kill them all:</span></p>
              <p><strong>Exodus
                  31</strong><br> <sup>14</sup>   Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is
                  holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for
                  whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his
                  people.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff93ff; font-size: x-small;">(Note: Sabbath is the
                  Sunday of each week you must attend Christian Church. Any dictionary will give
                  you this definition). So if you miss a Sunday of Church you are to be killed
                  since you are a filthy atheist then.)</span></p>
              <p><strong>Exodus 35</strong><br> <sup>2</sup>   Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh
                  day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever
                  doeth work therein shall be put to death.</p>

                  his face.<br> <span style="color: #ff93ff; font-size: x-small;">(If you hate God, he will KILL YOU!! HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!)</span></p>

                  worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I
                  have not commanded;<br> <sup>4</sup>   And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it,
                  and enquired diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain, that
                  such abomination is wrought in Israel:<br> <sup>5</sup>   Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that
                  woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or
                  that woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die.<br> <sup>6</sup>   At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses,
                  shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one

                  to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou shalt
                  put the evil away from among you.</p>
              <p><strong>Psalm 52</strong><br> <sup>5</sup>   God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall
                  take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of
                  the land of the living. Selah.<br> <sup>6</sup>   The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall
                  laugh at him:<br> <sup>7</sup>   Lo, this is the man that made not God his
                  strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself
                  in his wickedness.</p>
              <p><br> <strong>Deuteronomy 17</strong><br> <sup>12</sup>   And the man that will do presumptuously, and will
                  not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy
                  God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put away the
                  evil from Israel.<br> <sup>13</sup>   And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do
                  no more presumptuously.</p>
              <p><strong>Psalm 59</strong><br> <sup>8</sup>   But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt

              <p><span style="color: #ffeb0e;">So the answer is simple. Kill all
                  atheists immediately.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff93ff;">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff93ff; font-size: large;">Is
                  There a Rise in the Amounts of Atheists?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffeb0e;">Yes.
                  The reason for this is because of all the new laws outlawing the slaying of the
                  atheists by the Liberal Lawmakers in Washington. The Judicial system has been
                  America's big enemy in the battle on establishment of the atheist religion of
                  hating God. Back in the day we would hang them, set them on fire, poison them,
                  enslave them, or just FORCE them to convert by threatening to kill their young.
                  We do all of this in Love. We are Christians, and Love is our main goal.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff93ff;">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff93ff; font-size: large;">Why
                  Don't Atheists Just Get it?</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.truechristian.com/img/missing1.gif" alt="" width="600" height="360"></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffeb0e;">Guess what the bridge is? Is it
                    atheism or Christianity? Think hard.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff93ff;">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff93ff;">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff93ff; font-size: large;">Why Do Atheists Try to Take God
                  Out of Everything and Destroy Christmas?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffeb0e;">Well the reason is since they are so
                  hateful. All atheists hate Christmas. Godless countries like Japan with the
                  population of atheists being 90% don't even CELEBRATE Christmas. Luckily the
                  population of atheists in America is 0.000000000000000000001% so the odds of us
                  finding one is still slim. The Truth is, atheists hate happiness and want to
                  steal the love of Jesus away from children. This is what the atheist is, a cold
                  and evil grinch who wallows in her own vomit. Atheists in America try saying
                  there is a seperation of church and state in American, but the fools don't
                  realize that God says in the Bible we are to colonize all nations to be
                  Christian and run theocracies. America is a theocracy and the proof of this
                  since the word God is on our money and pledge. They will never take these away
                  from us since God is an American.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff93ff;">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff93ff; font-size: large;"><strong><em>For Those Who Say America
                  Isn't a Christian Nation</em></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Are you worried about the attacks
                  against the Pledge of Allegiance?</em></span></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #ffeb0e;">I'm a little nervous about it yes,
                  but I know God will get revenge for all the Fags in the government for giving
                  those atheists chances to change Christian Law. The old pledge of alliegance was
                  written by Francis Bellamy (1855 - 1931), a "Baptist" minister. He
                  wrote the original Pledge in August 1892. He was a "Christian"
                  Socialist. In his Pledge, he is expressing the ideas of his first cousin, Edward
                  Bellamy, author of the American socialist utopian novels, <strong>Looking Backward</strong> (1888) and <strong>Equality </strong>(1897). Because of this they DIDN'T include the name
                  of God!!! Well duh! That's what you get for letting commies for doing things for
                  our country! The original pledge of 1892 went like this:</span></p>
              <p>I Pledge Allegiance to the flag of the United States of
                  America<br> and to the Republic for which it stands,<br> indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffeb0e;">Where is God?!!? This country was
                  founded on CHRISTIAN values and they let a filthy communist write the thing
                  without involving the most important American of all, God! Not only is America
                  Under God, but God himself is a citizen of the United States. We know this since
                  we are Under Him. Jesus to was also an American.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.truechristian.com/img/jesus%20holding%20flag.jpg" alt="" width="338" height="439"></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffeb0e;">Jesus WASN'T Italian or French or
                  British or Thai or a Metrosexual, NO He was American. THAT'S WHY AMERICA IS <span style="font-size: large;">UNDER
                  GOD</span>!!!</span></p>

              <p>Don't you always talk about evidence? But there is no evidence that the original hebrew bible was faked. After all, only Judaism, Christianity, and Islam supports the physics of 'cause and effect'. Almost every other God I know of says that the Universe had always been and will always be. After all, I am too tired of speaking to someone as narrow-minded as you. Atheists like you always claim that God was always the concept of this and that. But aren't atheists also the same? Atheists always say 'chance' are the concept of this and that. So what atheists say are pretty ironic. If there really is such a 'god' , the reason why there are so many beliefs are obviously because the works of Satan to lure people away from the real God. But you will never understand what I am trying to say anyway, because you are narrow-minded, and then you say christians are narrow-minded. Another thing is because you hold on to a closed mindset, thus you give many weird reasons to this and that. To think atheists say they are logical,but are actually more of illogical.</p>

              <p>In science, things have to be proven true. Something that has not been proven to be true is not to be taken as true until proven. Its only that alot of ppl choose to avoid the truth and believe what they want to be true to be the absolute truth until proven wrong before they find a new excuse.</p>
              <p>U just haven't study hard and long enough in school to understand how things in this world come about and choose to beleive in all these beliefs that others instill into you. Still to young to know all the scientific proof of evolution, big bang etc etc.</p>
              <p>Close your mind to science and its unlikely your education journey will come far. The universe has an age and a lifespan. All astronomers have observed and seen stars grow and die. To think the universe and even our earth is eternal is just like a frog in a well thinking the whole world is as big as the well hole. I guess astronomy and all complex sciences are too complex for someone who has been brainwashed into believing the non existent.</p>
              <p>Too many people chooses to ignore scientific proof of evolution and stuff just because they worry that all their fake beliefs will be exposed and they will feel lost. Don't bother posting crap written by christians cos its all stuff they create to make themselves feel at ease and their imaginary god exist while others are fools, they are just hiding the fact that scientific proof exist that contridicts everything they believe in and thus chooses to be hermits hiding from the truth.</p>
              <p>Its so obvious the poster is worried cos too much facts are proving that gods don't exist and the very people who even make your life what it is today, may not have believe in religion. I really wonder whos the 1 with 0 IQ.</p>
              <p>Religion talks about humans being created by gods, please explain the SCIENTIFIC proof and findings of early humans who share similiarities with apes and how evolution has taken place. If god really created humans, why have humans only existed for a few thousand years when our earth is already 4.5 billion years old? Why were dinosaurs created and destroyed?</p>
              <p>Please use all ur 'beliefs' to answer these questions that science has already answered yet contridicts everything religion teaches and thus do not dare to answer.</p>

              <p>Evolution has been proven, if you choose to ignore it and lie to yourself, you are just the biggest fool there is. Something that has been found and can be dated is false then i wonder what about this so called god you have that cannot be seen, cannot be heard, cannot be felt etc etc but just appears in beliefs.</p>
              <p>Don't give me story writers, give me scientist especially astronomers who are the 1s who are discovering the life of the universe etc who still believes that the universe is eternal? Please find evolution scientist who still believes it was 'god' who created mankind? How many of the people who actually are researching and making discoveries that goes against religious beliefs are still religious and chooses to work everyday to contridict their beliefs?</p>

              <p>Ahem, so evolution is a proven theory eh? Just because you are a uni student does not make you any smarter. You may be taught about more shit and educated more about shit and crap, which means you can expertise on crap. In other words, if you educated in evolution, of course you will be an expertise on that. So other uni students who are christians are ignorant too? Just because I am a christian, I am ignorant? Please don't ego around here.</p>
              <p>Science estimates are inaccurate, and has been proven to be in the recent findings. A few years back, a few planes were found to be buried under the thick ice of the North Pole, these planes are WW2 planes. They were buried under hundreds of feets of ice. And coincidentally, those few feets of ice meet the estimates of the age of ice, which is 4000years old. Isn't it stupid? So those planes are 4000 years old then?</p>

              was brought up that evolution is only theory but supported by Science
              and that
              no Creation can be supported as such....so lets see. <br> <br> Please lets keep it civil, (ME INCLUDED)</strong> <br> <br> <br> The body and soul of Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution was his idea
              that evolution was made possible through natural selection. This
              concept is
              based on the suggestion that those members of a species that are a
              little stronger, a little larger, or run a little faster will live
              longer to
              procreate offspring with these superior adaptations. Darwin's theory
              suggests that millions of generations later the changes will result in
              new
              species. These adaptations are called links or intermediates. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <strong>Scientific Fact No. 1 - Birds Prove Natural Selection is Naturally Wrong</strong> <br> <br> <a href="http://www.biblelife.org/tweety.gif"><img src="http://files.abovetopsecret.com/images/externalimage.png" border="0" alt="" width="343" height="40"></a> <br> Help! I can't fly. My head is too big, and my wings are too small. <br> <br> <br> The idea of natural selection sounds great when considering deer. The
              deer that can sense danger the quickest and run the fastest are able to
              escape
              the <a id="KonaLink0" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread163678/pg1#"><span style="color: #d0d060;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #d0d060 ! important; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; position: static;">predator</span></span></a> on a more consistent basis. However, other examples on the evolutionary
              tree have many laughable flaws. One of the best is the thought
              that a bird began to evolve a wing. Why this would occur is not
              answered by evolutionists. The wing stub did not make the bird more
              adaptable in his
              environment. The wing was much too small for the bird to fly. Why would
              a bird evolve a wing that was useless? This is backwards from the
              evolutionary
              natural selection concept that birds adapt and change in order to
              survive better in their environment. The bird with a half-size wing is
              placed at a
              disadvantage in its environment. Why would the bird continue for
              millions of generations improving a wing that was useless? The theory
              of evolution is
              based on natural selection of the most adaptable member of a species. A
              bird with a useless wing is at a severe disadvantage and the opposite
              from
              natural selection. According to natural selection the members of the
              bird species with the smallest useless wing would be the most adaptable
              and most
              likely to survive in the largest numbers. According to the theory of
              natural selection birds could never evolve to fly. Evolution is simply
              nonsense.
              This is so funny. We are then led to believe that some birds got tired
              of carrying around a worthless half-size wing so they grew fingers on
              the end
              to help climb trees. The wings became arms and a new species was
              developed. Evolutionists actually believe this nonsense. <br> <br> <br> <br> <strong>Scientific Fact No. 2 - Species Without a Link Proves Evolution is Wrong</strong> <br> <br> The evolutionist will claim that the presence of many individual
              species proves evolution. This shallow statement is devoid of reason,
              logic and
              scientific proof. Evolutionists line up pictures of similar looking
              species and claim they evolved one to another. Humans are a great
              example. There
              are hundreds of species of extinct monkeys and apes. Petrified skulls
              and bones exist from these creatures. Evolutionists line up the most
              promising
              choices to present a gradual progression from monkey to modern man.
              They simply fill in the big gaps with make-believe creatures to fit the
              picture.
              This procedure can be done with humans only because there are many
              extinct monkey and ape species. They never do this with giraffes and
              elephants.
              These pictures are placed in all evolutionists' text books to teach
              kids this nonsense. The picture is simply a grouping of individual
              species that
              does not prove evolution. <br> <a href="http://www.biblelife.org/evolution-coelacanth.jpg"><img src="http://files.abovetopsecret.com/images/externalimage.png" border="0" alt="" width="343" height="40"></a> <br> <br> <strong>Scientific Fact No. 3 - Single Cell Complexity Proves Evolution is Wrong</strong> <br> <br> Scientists a century ago believed the smallest single living cell was a
              simple life form. The theory developed that perhaps lightning struck a
              pond of
              water causing several molecules to combine in a random way which by
              chance resulted in a living cell. The cell then divided and evolved
              into higher
              life forms. This view is now proven to be immature to the degree of
              being ridiculous. The most modern laboratory is unable to create a
              living cell. In
              fact, scientists have been unable to create a single left-hand protein
              molecule as found in all animals. <br> <br> <br> <strong>Scientific Fact No. 4 - Human Egg and Sperm Proves Evolution is Wrong</strong> <br> <br> The evolutionist ignores the problem surrounding the human female egg
              and the male sperm in the evolutionary theory. The female egg contains
              the
              X-chromosome and the male sperm contains either an X-chromosome for the
              reproduction of a male or a Y-chromosome for the reproduction of a
              female. The
              female eggs all develop within the ovaries while she is a baby (fetus)
              within her mother's womb. Evolutionists claim environmental factors
              cause
              small changes in the offspring in the evolutionary chain. However, the
              environmental experience of the female cannot change the chromosomes
              within her
              eggs and cannot have any effect upon her offspring. Her body cannot go
              into the eggs contained within her ovaries at her birth to make an
              intelligent
              change. Females cannot be a part of the evolutionary theory for these
              reasons. <br> <br> <br> <strong>Scientific Fact No. 5 - DNA Error Checking Proves Evolution is Wrong</strong> <br> <br> <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Ecbbc/courses/bio4/bio4-1997/images/m&amp;s.GIF"><img src="http://files.abovetopsecret.com/images/externalimage.png" border="0" alt="" width="343" height="40"></a> <br> <br> The scientific fact that DNA replication includes a built-in error
              checking method and a DNA repair process proves the evolutionary theory
              is wrong.
              The fact is that any attempt by the DNA to change is stopped and
              reversed. <br> <br> <br> <strong>Scientific Fact No. 6 - Chaos From Organization Proves Evolution is Wrong</strong> <br> <br> The second law of thermodynamics proves that organization cannot flow
              from chaos. Complex live organisms cannot rearrange themselves into an
              organism
              of a higher form as claimed by evolutionists. This is scientifically
              backwards according to the second law of thermodynamics that has never
              been
              proven wrong. Scientists cannot have it both ways. The second law of
              thermodynamics is proven to be correct. Evolution lacks any scientific
              proof.
              Evolution is simply an empty theory. <br> <br> <br> <strong>Scientific Fact No. 7 - Chromosome Count Proves Evolution is Wrong</strong> <br> <br> There is no scientific evidence that a species can change the number of
              chromosomes within the DNA. The chromosome count within each species is
              fixed.
              This is the reason a male from one species cannot mate successfully
              with a female of another species. Man could not evolve from a monkey.
              Each species
              is locked into its chromosome count that cannot change. If an animal
              developed an extra chromosome or lost a chromosome because of some
              deformity, it
              could not successfully mate. The defect could not be passed along to
              the next generation. Evolving a new species is scientifically
              impossible.
              Evolutionists prove that getting a college education does not impart
              wisdom. <br> <br> <br> <strong>Scientific Fact No. 8 - Origin of Matter and Stars Proves Evolution is Wrong</strong> <br> <br> Evolutionists just throw up their hands at the question of the origin
              of matter because they know something cannot evolve from nothing. They
              stick
              their heads in the sand and ignore the problem. The fact that matter
              exists in outrageously large quantities simply proves evolution is
              wrong. The
              "Big Bang" theory doesn't solve the problem either. Matter and energy
              have to come from somewhere. <br> <br> <br> <br> <strong>Scientific Fact No. 9 - Lack of Life on Mars Proves Evolution is Wrong</strong> <br> <br> Two NASA two land rovers named Spirit and Opportunity explored Mars
              during 2004. The topography shows obvious signs of past liquid rivers
              flowing in
              numerous places. The rovers have proven that water was once abundant on
              the surface of Mars, but they have not been able to find any signs of
              life or
              any signs of past life on the planet. Mars has a proven history of
              flowing water on the surface and an atmosphere suitable to support life
              forms. The
              planet has had all of the conditions necessary to provide the "spark"
              of life according to the evolutionary theory, yet there is no life on
              Mars.
              The river beds and river banks show no signs of vegetation or trees.
              The ground has no fossils and no organisms. The place is absolutely
              sterile.<br> <br> <br> <strong>Scientific Fact No. 10 - Radio Silence from Space Proves Evolution is Wrong</strong> <br> <br> Mars is not the only place that shows no signs of life. The entire universe lacks any sign of life. There are no <a id="KonaLink1" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread163678/pg1#"><span style="color: #d0d060;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #d0d060 ! important; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; position: static;">radio</span></span></a> signals that can be related to
              intelligent life forms. None of the billions of galaxies has been found
              to emit any intelligent radio signals. Scientists have been pointing
              every
              type of radio telescope possible into space for several decades in
              hopes of finding an intelligent signal. No signs of life beyond Earth
              have been
              found. We are alone. <br> <br> <br> <br> <a class="postlink" href="http://www.biblelife.org/evolution.htm">Top Ten Scientific Facts Proving Evolution is False and Impossible</a> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <strong>Now as a side note, I would like to present this article for

              into as I do not
              quite follow this as I should even though I took Introductory Geology.

              maybe this way they will actually READ it before responding.</strong> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> Absolute Scientific Proof the Evolutionary Theory is Dead <br> <br> <br> <strong>A story about two friends from day one.</strong> <br> <br> Once upon a
              time there was a Polonium 218 element of the family of radioactive
              isotopes. Nuclear chemists classify Polonium 218 as radioactive
              because the nuclei of the atom continually emit alpha, beta and gamma
              radiation. This radiation loss causes the atom to disintegrate or decay
              into a
              smaller atom. Eventually the material will become lead, which we
              commonly use for fishing weights and lead-acid batteries in our cars. <br> <br> Polonium 218 would be classified in elementary school as being
              "hyperactive." It can't sit still very long. In only three minutes,
              half of the
              atoms decay into a lighter element, and in only one day it is all
              changed. <br> <br> Polonium 218 can be created by the decay of a parent atom such as
              Uranium 238 or some other element below Uranium 238 in the chain. It
              can also be
              created as the parent without having come from the decay of a heavier
              atom. This is very important, so remember this fact. <br> <br> Once upon a time there was granite rock. Granite is a very unique rock
              but at the same time is very common and plentiful. It can easily be
              found
              in mountain areas such as the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Granite is
              easily identified by its hard crystalline structure and light color.
              The
              crystals are large enough to be easily seen with the eye. It has an
              interesting structure with a mixture of light-colored quartz and
              feldspar
              crystals, and darker crystals of mica and hornblende. Granite is solid
              and hard without cracks or seams, and it is very strong. <br> <br> Granite has another very unique <a id="KonaLink2" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread163678/pg1#"><span style="color: #d0d060;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #d0d060 ! important; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; position: static;">property</span></span></a> in that it cannot be created by scientists. It is considered to be an
              "original" material in the Earth.
              When melted and allowed to harden, it does not return to the original
              granite crystalline structure. The new smaller crystalline material is
              called
              rhyolite. Granite cannot be made by cooling the initial molten
              materials. This is very important, so remember this fact. <br> <br> Granite never contains fossils such as are found in sedimentary rocks.
              All of these properties have led many scientists to refer to granite as
              a
              creation rock, since it could not have solidified from molten material
              according to the evolutionary theory. <br> <br> Evolution cannot explain the presence of granite in its present
              structure. And where is this granite? Everywhere. Granite is the
              bedrock shell
              which encloses the entire Earth. Its exact thickness is unknown, but
              scientists have speculated that it forms a layer about 4.35 miles (7
              km) thick,
              and in some areas possibly 20 miles (32 km) thick. It occurs on every
              continent. <br> <br> These are the two friends from day one. We know they were friends
              because they lived together. The Polonium 218 lived only a very short
              time (3
              minutes), but he left his mark on his friend, granite, in that short
              time. Polonium emitted alpha particles which left a very distinct mark
              in the
              granite. These marks are called Polonium halos. These halos are tiny
              colored concentric circles which must be viewed with a microscope. The
              concentric
              circles are actually concentric spherical marks which appear as circles
              after the rock is cut open. "How many halos are there?" you may ask.
              One
              trillion times 10 billion are present on every continent around the
              world. They are everywhere. <br> <br> The Polonium 218 was the parent radioactive isotope because other
              distinct halos which are created by other isotopes are not present. The
              Polonium
              halos are not accompanied by Uranium 238 halos. <br> <br> One
              minute there was nothing. The next minute there were parent Polonium
              218 radioactive atoms locked in the center of solid granite. The
              granite
              rock could not have formed from cooling molten rock. Granite will not
              form that way. In fact, scientists cannot make granite by any method.
              They can
              make <a id="KonaLink3" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread163678/pg1#"><span style="color: #d0d060;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #d0d060 ! important; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; position: static;">diamonds</span></span></a> but not granite. Granite is solid. The Polonium could not penetrate
              existing granite because it is not porous or cracked. This was day
              one. <br> <br> These friends are absolute scientific proof that
              evolution is dead. First, the granite could not have been produced by
              evolutionary theories, the
              Earth cooling, etc. Second, the Polonium locks the entire time period
              into an instantaneous event proven by nuclear chemistry. The time is
              not
              "millions and millions and millions" of years. The granite was produced
              as a solid with the Polonium parent elements inside at that instant.
              Within
              the first three minutes, half of the Polonium had decayed into a lower
              element. The Earth, granite and Polonium were created by God together
              in an
              instant. <br></p>

              <p><strong>Scientific Fact No. 3 - Single Cell Complexity Proves Evolution is Wrong </strong> <br> <br> The scientific study of complex biological structures has made enormous
              strides in revealing intelligent design in nature. One example is the
              motor
              and propeller propulsion system called a bacterial flagellum found in
              many bacteria including the common E. coli. The propulsion system of
              the
              bacteria has 40 moving parts made from protein molecules including a
              motor, rotor, stator, drive shaft, bushings, universal joint and
              flexible
              propeller. The motor is powered by ions and can rotate at up to 100,000
              rpm. It can reverse direction in only 1/4 of a revolution and has an
              automatic
              feedback control mechanism. The size is 1/100,000 of an inch (1/4,000
              mm) in width, much to small to see with the human eye. One cannot deny
              the
              obvious conclusion that this system has an Intelligent Designer. <br> <br> <strong>I had always heard that the smallest living thing has 23 parts, and
              it could not exist without all 23 and therefore could not have evolved.
              It made
              sense and I am sorry I do not remember where I heard this but the text
              directly above is darn near the same thing. How can evolution explain
              this?<br> <br> How can these smallest of parts that need to be there in number evolve?
              It doesnt make sense. Just as the deeper you go into Space, when you
              travel to
              the smallest parts of creation, it gets MORE complicated, not less. <br> <br> <br> <br> It would seem that some scientists at least believe that evolution can not explain this complexity in the world. </strong> <br> <br> <br> <br> CONTENTS: Scientists Speak about the Cell  <br> - Overconfidence in Evolution the Problem - Get rid of that fairy tale,

              <p><br> <strong>Scientific Fact No. 8 - Origin of Matter and Stars Proves Evolution is Wrong</strong> <br> <br> Evolutionists just throw up their hands at the question of the origin
              of matter because they know something cannot evolve from nothing. They
              stick
              their heads in the sand and ignore the problem. The fact that matter
              exists in outrageously large quantities simply proves evolution is
              wrong. The
              "Big Bang" theory doesn't solve the problem either. Matter and energy
              have to come from somewhere. <br> <br> <br> <br> <strong> Well this one sure does put a halt to evolution in the grand scheme
              of things. I mean adaptation can explain a bunch but you can not adapt
              matter
              from nothing. <br> <br> Its a real paradox, but to be fair, it can legitimately be asked, then who created God? <br> <br> <br> It is one that my mind is to minuscule to understand I am sure as I
              have always wondered how something could have no beginning and no end. <br> <br> But there is a saying that I say quite a lot that sums it up. <br> <br> As it was in the Beginning, is now, and ever will be. God always was.
              Then again I am limited to my 4 dimensional mind, I can not think in 14
              dimensions and mathematically we know there are many. Time does not
              'bind' God for He created it.... <br> </strong></p>

              see.<br> <br> Please lets keep it civil, (ME INCLUDED)</strong><br> <br> <br> The body and soul of Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution was his
              idea that evolution was made possible through natural selection.
              This concept is based on the suggestion that those members of a
              species that are a little stronger, a little larger, or run a
              little faster will live longer to procreate offspring with these
              superior adaptations. Darwin's theory suggests that millions of
              generations later the changes will result in new species. These
              adaptations are called links or intermediates.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <strong>Scientific Fact No. 1 - Birds Prove Natural Selection is
              Naturally Wrong</strong><br> <br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.biblelife.org/tweety.gif"><img src="http://files.abovetopsecret.com/images/externalimage.png" alt="" width="343" height="40"></a><br> Help! I can't fly. My head is too big, and my wings are too
              small.<br> <br> <br> The idea of natural selection sounds great when considering deer.
              The deer that can sense danger the quickest and run the fastest are
              able to escape the <a style="text-decoration: underline ! important;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread163678/pg1"><span style="color: #d0d060;"><span style="color: #d0d060 ! important; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px;"> predator</span></span></a> on a more consistent basis. However,
              other examples on the evolutionary tree have many laughable flaws.
              One of the best is the thought that a bird began to evolve a wing.
              Why this would occur is not answered by evolutionists. The wing
              stub did not make the bird more adaptable in his environment. The
              wing was much too small for the bird to fly. Why would a bird
              evolve a wing that was useless? This is backwards from the
              evolutionary natural selection concept that birds adapt and change
              in order to survive better in their environment. The bird with a
              half-size wing is placed at a disadvantage in its environment. Why
              would the bird continue for millions of generations improving a
              wing that was useless? The theory of evolution is based on natural
              selection of the most adaptable member of a species. A bird with a
              useless wing is at a severe disadvantage and the opposite from
              natural selection. According to natural selection the members of
              the bird species with the smallest useless wing would be the most
              adaptable and most likely to survive in the largest numbers.
              According to the theory of natural selection birds could never
              evolve to fly. Evolution is simply nonsense. This is so funny. We
              are then led to believe that some birds got tired of carrying
              around a worthless half-size wing so they grew fingers on the end
              to help climb trees. The wings became arms and a new species was
              developed. Evolutionists actually believe this nonsense.<br> <br> <br> <br> <strong>Scientific Fact No. 2 - Species Without a Link Proves
              Evolution is Wrong</strong><br> <br> The evolutionist will claim that the presence of many individual
              species proves evolution. This shallow statement is devoid of
              reason, logic and scientific proof. Evolutionists line up pictures
              of similar looking species and claim they evolved one to another.
              Humans are a great example. There are hundreds of species of
              extinct monkeys and apes. Petrified skulls and bones exist from
              these creatures. Evolutionists line up the most promising choices
              to present a gradual progression from monkey to modern man. They
              simply fill in the big gaps with make-believe creatures to fit the
              picture. This procedure can be done with humans only because there
              are many extinct monkey and ape species. They never do this with
              giraffes and elephants. These pictures are placed in all
              evolutionists' text books to teach kids this nonsense. The picture
              is simply a grouping of individual species that does not prove
              evolution.<br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.biblelife.org/evolution-coelacanth.jpg"><img src="http://files.abovetopsecret.com/images/externalimage.png" alt="" width="343" height="40"></a><br> <br> <strong>Scientific Fact No. 3 - Single Cell Complexity Proves
              Evolution is Wrong</strong><br> <br> Scientists a century ago believed the smallest single living cell
              was a simple life form. The theory developed that perhaps lightning
              struck a pond of water causing several molecules to combine in a
              random way which by chance resulted in a living cell. The cell then
              divided and evolved into higher life forms. This view is now proven
              to be immature to the degree of being ridiculous. The most modern
              laboratory is unable to create a living cell. In fact, scientists
              have been unable to create a single left-hand protein molecule as
              found in all animals.<br> <br> <br> <strong>Scientific Fact No. 4 - Human Egg and Sperm Proves
              Evolution is Wrong</strong><br> <br> The evolutionist ignores the problem surrounding the human female
              egg and the male sperm in the evolutionary theory. The female egg
              contains the X-chromosome and the male sperm contains either an
              X-chromosome for the reproduction of a male or a Y-chromosome for
              the reproduction of a female. The female eggs all develop within
              the ovaries while she is a baby (fetus) within her mother's womb.
              Evolutionists claim environmental factors cause small changes in
              the offspring in the evolutionary chain. However, the environmental
              experience of the female cannot change the chromosomes within her
              eggs and cannot have any effect upon her offspring. Her body cannot
              go into the eggs contained within her ovaries at her birth to make
              an intelligent change. Females cannot be a part of the evolutionary
              theory for these reasons.<br> <br> <br> <strong>Scientific Fact No. 5 - DNA Error Checking Proves Evolution
              is Wrong</strong><br> <br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Ecbbc/courses/bio4/bio4-1997/images/m&amp;amp;s.GIF"><img src="http://files.abovetopsecret.com/images/externalimage.png" alt="" width="343" height="40"></a><br> <br> The scientific fact that DNA replication includes a built-in error
              checking method and a DNA repair process proves the evolutionary
              theory is wrong. The fact is that any attempt by the DNA to change
              is stopped and reversed.<br> <br> <br> <strong>Scientific Fact No. 6 - Chaos From Organization Proves
              Evolution is Wrong</strong><br> <br> The second law of thermodynamics proves that organization cannot
              flow from chaos. Complex live organisms cannot rearrange themselves
              into an organism of a higher form as claimed by evolutionists. This
              is scientifically backwards according to the second law of
              thermodynamics that has never been proven wrong. Scientists cannot
              have it both ways. The second law of thermodynamics is proven to be
              correct. Evolution lacks any scientific proof. Evolution is simply
              an empty theory.<br> <br> <br> <strong>Scientific Fact No. 7 - Chromosome Count Proves Evolution
              is Wrong</strong><br> <br> There is no scientific evidence that a species can change the
              number of chromosomes within the DNA. The chromosome count within
              each species is fixed. This is the reason a male from one species
              cannot mate successfully with a female of another species. Man
              could not evolve from a monkey. Each species is locked into its
              chromosome count that cannot change. If an animal developed an
              extra chromosome or lost a chromosome because of some deformity, it
              could not successfully mate. The defect could not be passed along
              to the next generation. Evolving a new species is scientifically
              impossible. Evolutionists prove that getting a college education
              does not impart wisdom.<br> <br> <br> <strong>Scientific Fact No. 8 - Origin of Matter and Stars Proves
              Evolution is Wrong</strong><br> <br> Evolutionists just throw up their hands at the question of the
              origin of matter because they know something cannot evolve from
              nothing. They stick their heads in the sand and ignore the problem.
              The fact that matter exists in outrageously large quantities simply
              proves evolution is wrong. The "Big Bang" theory doesn't solve the
              problem either. Matter and energy have to come from
              somewhere.<br> <br> <br> <br> <strong>Scientific Fact No. 9 - Lack of Life on Mars Proves
              Evolution is Wrong</strong><br> <br> Two NASA two land rovers named Spirit and Opportunity explored Mars
              during 2004. The topography shows obvious signs of past liquid
              rivers flowing in numerous places. The rovers have proven that
              water was once abundant on the surface of Mars, but they have not
              been able to find any signs of life or any signs of past life on
              the planet. Mars has a proven history of flowing water on the
              surface and an atmosphere suitable to support life forms. The
              planet has had all of the conditions necessary to provide the
              "spark" of life according to the evolutionary theory, yet there is
              no life on Mars. The river beds and river banks show no signs of
              vegetation or trees. The ground has no fossils and no organisms.
              The place is absolutely sterile.<br> <br> <br> <strong>Scientific Fact No. 10 - Radio Silence from Space Proves
              Evolution is Wrong</strong><br> <br> Mars is not the only place that shows no signs of life. The entire
              universe lacks any sign of life.

              life forms. None of the billions of galaxies has been found to emit
              any intelligent radio signals. Scientists have been pointing every
              type of radio telescope possible into space for several decades in
              hopes of finding an intelligent signal. No signs of life beyond
              Earth have been found. We are alone.<br> <br> <br> <br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.biblelife.org/evolution.htm">Top Ten Scientific Facts Proving Evolution is False and

              link, maybe this way they will actually READ it before
              responding.</strong><br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> Absolute Scientific Proof the Evolutionary Theory is Dead<br> <br> <br> <strong>A story about two friends from day one.</strong><br> <br> Once upon a time there was a Polonium 218 element of the family of
              radioactive isotopes. Nuclear chemists classify Polonium 218 as
              radioactive because the nuclei of the atom continually emit alpha,
              beta and gamma radiation. This radiation loss causes the atom to
              disintegrate or decay into a smaller atom. Eventually the material
              will become lead, which we commonly use for fishing weights and
              lead-acid batteries in our cars.<br> <br> Polonium 218 would be classified in elementary school as being
              "hyperactive." It can't sit still very long. In only three minutes,
              half of the atoms decay into a lighter element, and in only one day
              it is all changed.<br> <br> Polonium 218 can be created by the decay of a parent atom such as
              Uranium 238 or some other element below Uranium 238 in the chain.
              It can also be created as the parent without having come from the
              decay of a heavier atom. This is very important, so remember this
              fact.<br> <br> Once upon a time there was granite rock. Granite is a very unique
              rock but at the same time is very common and plentiful. It can
              easily be found in mountain areas such as the Rocky Mountains of
              Colorado. Granite is easily identified by its hard crystalline
              structure and light color. The crystals are large enough to be
              easily seen with the eye. It has an interesting structure with a
              mixture of light-colored quartz and feldspar crystals, and darker
              crystals of mica and hornblende. Granite is solid and hard without
              cracks or seams, and it is very strong.<br> <br> Granite has another very unique <a style="text-decoration: underline ! important;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread163678/pg1"><span style="color: #d0d060;"><span style="color: #d0d060 ! important; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px;"> property</span></span></a> in that it cannot be created by
              scientists. It is considered to be an "original" material in the
              Earth. When melted and allowed to harden, it does not return to the
              original granite crystalline structure. The new smaller crystalline
              material is called rhyolite. Granite cannot be made by cooling the
              initial molten materials. This is very important, so remember this
              fact.<br> <br> Granite never contains fossils such as are found in sedimentary
              rocks. All of these properties have led many scientists to refer to
              granite as a creation rock, since it could not have solidified from
              molten material according to the evolutionary theory.<br> <br> Evolution cannot explain the presence of granite in its present
              structure. And where is this granite? Everywhere. Granite is the
              bedrock shell which encloses the entire Earth. Its exact thickness
              is unknown, but scientists have speculated that it forms a layer
              about 4.35 miles (7 km) thick, and in some areas possibly 20 miles
              (32 km) thick. It occurs on every continent.<br> <br> These are the two friends from day one. We know they were friends
              because they lived together. The Polonium 218 lived only a very
              short time (3 minutes), but he left his mark on his friend,
              granite, in that short time. Polonium emitted alpha particles which
              left a very distinct mark in the granite. These marks are called
              Polonium halos. These halos are tiny colored concentric circles
              which must be viewed with a microscope. The concentric circles are
              actually concentric spherical marks which appear as circles after
              the rock is cut open. "How many halos are there?" you may ask. One
              trillion times 10 billion are present on every continent around the
              world. They are everywhere.<br> <br> The Polonium 218 was the parent radioactive isotope because other
              distinct halos which are created by other isotopes are not present.
              The Polonium halos are not accompanied by Uranium 238 halos.<br> <br> One minute there was nothing. The next minute there were parent
              Polonium 218 radioactive atoms locked in the center of solid
              granite. The granite rock could not have formed from cooling molten
              rock. Granite will not form that way. In fact, scientists cannot
              make granite by any method. They can make <a style="text-decoration: underline ! important;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread163678/pg1"><span style="color: #d0d060;"><span style="color: #d0d060 ! important; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px;"> diamonds</span></span></a> but not granite. Granite is solid. The
              Polonium could not penetrate existing granite because it is not
              porous or cracked. This was day one.<br> <br> These friends are absolute scientific proof that evolution is dead.
              First, the granite could not have been produced by evolutionary
              theories, the Earth cooling, etc. Second, the Polonium locks the
              entire time period into an instantaneous event proven by nuclear
              chemistry. The time is not "millions and millions and millions" of
              years. The granite was produced as a solid with the Polonium parent
              elements inside at that instant. Within the first three minutes,
              half of the Polonium had decayed into a lower element. The Earth,
              granite and Polonium were created by God together in an
              instant.</p>

              <p>Did you get all your facts from VALID scientific sources or from some christians who are worried about lossing their faith? Most of the 'facts' you posted have major flaws in their arguements which shows a deep lack of scientific knowledge and words by laymen.</p>
              <p>Science is still progressing so obviously there are gaps which are being filled in very quickly. Every year there are new major discoveries in the different fields of science. If science isn't progressive, you won't have new technology etc to use and everyone would still be a farmer planting vegetables to live.</p>
              <p>To put in simple, if there was no evolution, explain the simple things like H1N1, H5N1 etc etc, why are there so many variations of a flu virus and if there is no evolution, why are people so worried these virus will change and make drugs ineffective? Virus etc are very small organisms and they are continously proving their mutation/evolution by becoming resistant to current drugs and requires continous research and improvement.</p>
              <p>How about we just make it simple and talk about some things you should know. Please use any of your religious knowledge to explain the presence of the moon, the planets, stars, our sun and meteors?</p>
              <p>Did god have additional play doh after he finish creating earth so he made more planets but didn't have enough power to create life on them? Are stars just lights in the sky because god is afraid if theres no source of light, ppl will be too scared at nights so he created starlight? Was the sun created by god because we needed a source of warmth? If that was so, why is the sun firing off harmful UV rays at us and not just what is good for us? Are meteors etc left over crumbs from his making process that he just left flying around in space n let them occasionally come into earth's atmosphere to burn letting us see a meteor shower performance?</p>

              explain everything, that clearly shows how flawed your arguement is
              when others can explain and give an answer to what you cannot.</p>
              <p>Nothing online is considered reliable unless its from a
              reputation journal. If you just read from random websites, i can
              find just as many websites saying religion is false.</p>
              <p>Regarding evolution, just use my example about the flu virus,
              don't bother saying god only created humans cos if god created us,
              he can't have not created everything else unless you are hinting
              that god is not all powerful and it was others that created
              everything else.</p>

              <p>Viruses are made purposely to kill people, well, hinting from the fact that God sent plaques to Egypt to kill the the evil. About animals, they are for the amusement of humans, and also to provide humans with food and clothing. And of course some animals which you see as of no use to humans are made to sustain the eco-system.</p>

              <p><strong>Scientific Fact No. 3 - Single Cell Complexity Proves
              Evolution is Wrong</strong><br> <br> The scientific study of complex biological structures has made
              enormous strides in revealing intelligent design in nature. One
              example is the motor and propeller propulsion system called a
              bacterial flagellum found in many bacteria including the common E.
              coli. The propulsion system of the bacteria has 40 moving parts
              made from protein molecules including a motor, rotor, stator, drive
              shaft, bushings, universal joint and flexible propeller. The motor
              is powered by ions and can rotate at up to 100,000 rpm. It can
              reverse direction in only 1/4 of a revolution and has an automatic
              feedback control mechanism. The size is 1/100,000 of an inch
              (1/4,000 mm) in width, much to small to see with the human eye. One
              cannot deny the obvious conclusion that this system has an
              Intelligent Designer.<br> <br> <strong>I had always heard that the smallest living thing has 23
              parts, and it could not exist without all 23 and therefore could
              not have evolved. It made sense and I am sorry I do not remember
              where I heard this but the text directly above is darn near the
              same thing. How can evolution explain this?<br> <br> How can these smallest of parts that need to be there in number
              evolve? It doesnt make sense. Just as the deeper you go into Space,
              when you travel to the smallest parts of creation, it gets MORE
              complicated, not less.<br> <br> <br> <br> It would seem that some scientists at least believe that evolution
              can not explain this complexity in the world.</strong><br> <br> <br> <br> CONTENTS: Scientists Speak about the Cell<br> - Overconfidence in Evolution the Problem - Get rid of that fairy

              <p><br> <strong>Scientific Fact No. 8 - Origin of Matter and Stars Proves
              Evolution is Wrong</strong><br> <br> Evolutionists just throw up their hands at the question of the
              origin of matter because they know something cannot evolve from
              nothing. They stick their heads in the sand and ignore the problem.
              The fact that matter exists in outrageously large quantities simply
              proves evolution is wrong. The "Big Bang" theory doesn't solve the
              problem either. Matter and energy have to come from
              somewhere.<br> <br> <br> <br> <strong>Well this one sure does put a halt to evolution in the
              grand scheme of things. I mean adaptation can explain a bunch but
              you can not adapt matter from nothing.<br> <br> Its a real paradox, but to be fair, it can legitimately be asked,
              then who created God?<br> <br> <br> It is one that my mind is to minuscule to understand I am sure as I
              have always wondered how something could have no beginning and no
              end.<br> <br> But there is a saying that I say quite a lot that sums it up.<br> <br> As it was in the Beginning, is now, and ever will be. God always
              was. Then again I am limited to my 4 dimensional mind, I can not
              think in 14 dimensions and mathematically we know there are many.
              Time does not 'bind' God for He created it....<br></strong></p>

              <p>For the 1st example, you clearly lack bio knowledge to talk about that. Only thing 23 is 23 pairs of chromosomes and even that is for humans only. I'm not bio expert since i'm a chemist but having intelligent design does not mean it can't be due to evolution.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, science is progressing day by day, what can't be solve now doesn't mean it can't be solved but our scientific capabilities are not at that level yet. There are more things science can explain that religion cannot who simply pushes it around by saying thats created by god yet they have to shutup when science starts to prove they are wrong.</p>
              <p>The big bang theory DOES explain how matter and energy etc come about. Whoever wrote that clearly never read and study the big bang theory or has chosen to mislead himself on purpose.</p>
