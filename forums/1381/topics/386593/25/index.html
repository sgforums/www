              <p>from my experience, i personally find there are many good christians from methodist. they really practice what is being taught, kind hearted  and conservative in their dressing. whenever  i met evil christians ,who do not believe in retribution, i will know they are definitely not from methodist.</p>
              <p>however, whether the evil christians believe in retribution or not, i always see retribution happen to them. just be patient, you will see retribution happen to them, it is just a matter of time.</p>
              <p>catholics are also not bad because their teachings are quite strict.</p>

              <p>To check whether the bible you read is authentic, use Bible Numerics. The bible has this special mathematical code inside, that once the bible is edited an no loner in order, the numbers will also not in a certain order. Google Ivan pannin, the agnostic who became a christian overnight after realising the numerics.</p>
