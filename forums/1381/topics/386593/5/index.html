              <p>You must also remember that the theory of evolution is just a theory. It hasn't been made a law, just a hypothesis that Charles Darwin made about animals and life around it. What Charles Darwin did on the Galapagos islands was just to study species of birds that lived in different ecosystems. Intelligent design has made it possible that certain traits fit their environment harmoniously and not over centuries that after a lot of trial and error that things happen that way. If evolution existed, we would be seeing so many types of animals and plants in just one species alone. </p>

              <p>What has technology got to do with the existence of god? Religious text have encourged progress in scientific thought. That is a fact. In the 1500s to 1900s there were many die hard believes of god and big religious feverousity among the people then. If they knew that Science was going to believe their very faith, why would they do something against it? </p>
              <p>Science is never against religion. It is people who use to speak the devil's lingo who use Science against religion. </p>

              <div>Why does religion has to protect itself? Why do many people in the world choose to believe in religion?

              <div>Please find SCIENTIFIC proof that religion affects science. As
              a religion trying to protect itself, it will obviously say that
              others depend on it but only when others admit/agree that it was
              due to that could it be valid.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Why does religion has to protect itself? Why do many people in
              the world choose to believe in religion? If so, why don't people
              just burn down places of worship and choose to build more biopolis
              and laboratories to further the advance of Science? Why do people
              choose to keep them? After all, land in our world is so scarce
              where poverty and war plague the world. </div>

              <p>Science is not something by itself. It may look like physics chemistry biology etc are totally different thing to u because at ur level, they split the content so that they become very very distinct from each other but as you progress, you will realise all branches of science are linked together and they continue to support and help each other to achieve greater heights.</p>
              <p>Without chemistry, alot of biological theories cannot be proven, studied and tested. Without physics, alot of chemistry experiments cannot be done nor explained since physics knowledge is required to build chemical equipment. Without maths, alot of physics theories won't be solved since alot of physics theories were already solved by mathematicians before physicist works out the equation and apply it to their use.</p>
              <p>Thats just a small sample of how the sciences are link and such links are endless as you go further and further into higher level science.</p>

              <p>Is religion wrong in everything? The bible has for once quoted scientific arguments in some chapters. for example, the existence of lightning, the tides the days. </p>
              <p>Major religious texts do have quotations on Scientific concepts. True, maybe their concepts like Aristotle is wrong, but you also have to consider the amount of scientific knowledge present in those days and the people who copied the scriptures of the bibles hand by hand.

              <p>Major religious texts do have quotations on Scientific concepts.
              True, maybe their concepts like Aristotle is wrong, but you also

              <p>If you didn't know how to read, species that did not survive
              would have died out. Furthermore, there are still millions of
              different species of birds, insects etc etc and not just 1. Please
              explain that as well. If your world, there is only 1 bird, 1
              insect, 1 fish etc, i really wonder where you came from.</p>
              <div>How do you know they died out? Where is the fact? Fossils?
              Even the big asteroid crash 65 million years ago is just a theory.
              How do you know they didnt survive? Maybe some manage to hide? Like
              the 300 million year old fish? Not adpated into its environment but
              still found in the world? </div>

              <div>Who said chemistry, physics, biology etc are not against
              religion? How did people start astronomy? It came from advancement
              in physics to allow people to view the world, how did people
              started the big bang theory and how elements etc came about? That
              comes from chemistry by analysing the contents of space matter.
              Without biology, how do people start evolution theory and show that
              virus etc are mutating and evolving to be resistant to drugs etc.
              Its a fact that every branch of science is helping to deprove
              religion in their respective ways just that they don't all link to
              it directly and its clear you fail to see how the sciences are all
              link together and each science is not a seperate entitiy.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Does anywhere in the bible deny the existence of chemical
              reactions? elements? None. </div>
              <div>What i'm saying here is that science and religion are
              intertwined. Not religion against Science or Science against

              <p>evolution is generally accepted as a scientific fact by most
