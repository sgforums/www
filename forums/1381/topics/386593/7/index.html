              <p>Animals and viruses all function according to their genetic code, that is to go forth and multiply.</p>
              <p>On a genetic level there's no difference between that of an animal and a virus. A virus mutating is no different from the mutation of animals, it's just a matter of scale.</p>

              <p>I guess you have been hiding too long to know whats happening in the world. Inter species breeding is happening among animals which is where some new species of animals come from.</p>
              <p>The only reason why this area of science is not progressing is simply due to alot of human rights groups and animal rights groups preventing science from doing experiments on animals and humans and this restricts the advances of science. 1 of the biggest groups that forms this rights groups are all the religious groups so its you very people who are afraid science will prove evolution and thus are creating obstacles for its progress.</p>
              <p>Even the food you eat, quite a number of been cross breed, genetically modified etc such as all your seedless fruits and many other fruits and vegetables been changed to make them more resistant to pest and such. This is human involvement but it does shows that genes can be change and altered  and not set in stone, never changing.</p>
              <p>You're just a kid, how many years have even lived? When we talk about evolution, we talk about thousands and even millions of years. If you think every generation will have drastic changes, you must be a bigger fool than i originally thought.</p>
              <p>Since you say everything is created by god, please do not get married, nor have sex etc. You are not god so you are not allowed to create life. Let your family line die out and please do not aid the evolution cycle by reproducing anymore of you. You might lead to a new species of self delusion human beings that would be easily wipeout and extinct anyway.</p>

              </a><p></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Meteoritic dust falls on the earth continuously, 
                adding up to thousands, if not millions, of tons of dust per year. Realizing 
                this, and knowing that the moon also had meteoritic dust piling up for what 
                they thought was millions of years, N.A.S.A. scientists were worried that the 
                first lunar ship that landed would sink into the many feet of dust which 
                should have accumulated. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">However, only about one-eight of an inch of dust 
                was found, indicating a young moon. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Meteoritic material contributes nickel to the 
                oceans. Taking the amount of nickel in the oceans and the supply from 
                meteoritic dust yields an age figure for the earth of just several thousand 
                years, not the millions (or billions) expressed by evolutionists. This, and 
                the lack of meteoritic dust piles on the earth, lend to the belief in a young 
                earth. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The earth's magnetic field is decaying rapidly, 
                at a constant (if not decreasing) rate. At this rate, 8000 years ago the 
                earth's magnetism would have equaled that of a magnetic star, a highly 
                unlikely occurrence. Also, if electric currents in the earth's core are 
                responsible for the earth's magnetism, the heat generated by these currents 
                20,000 years ago would have dissolved the earth. </span></p>

              <p><a name="3"> </a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Charles Darwin stated, in his Origin of Species, 
                "The geological record is extremely imperfect and this fact will to a large 
                extent explain why we do not find intermediate varieties, connecting together 
                all the extinct and existing forms of life by the finest graduated steps. He 
                who rejects these views on the nature of the geological record, will rightly 
                reject my whole theory." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Now, 130 years and billions of fossils later, we 
                can rightly reject the view of an incomplete fossil record or of one 
                "connecting together all . . . forms of life by the finest graduated steps." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Out of the millions of fossils in the world, not 
                one transitional form has been found. All known species show up abruptly in 
                the fossil record, without intermediate forms, thus contributing to the fact 
                of special creation. Let's take a look at Archeopteryx, a fossil that some 
                evolutionists claim to be transitional between reptile and bird. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Archeopteryx is discussed in evolutionist Francis 
                Hitching's book, The Neck of the Giraffe - Where Darwin Went Wrong. Hitching 
                speaks on six aspects of Archeopteryx, following here. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">(The following six points are quoted from Luther 
                Sunderland's book, Darwin's Enigma: Fossils and Other Problems, pp. 74-75, the 
                facts of which points he gathered from Hitching's book.) </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">1. It had a long bony tail, like a reptile's. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">In the embryonic stage, some living birds have 
                more tail vertebrae than Archeopteryx. They later fuse to become an upstanding 
                bone called the pygostyle. The tail bone and feather arrangement on swans are 
                very similar to those of Archeopteryx. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">One authority claims that there is no basic 
                difference between the ancient and modern forms: the difference lies only in 
                the fact that the caudal vertebrae are greatly prolonged. But this does not 
                make a reptile. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">2. It had claws on its feet and on its feathered 
                forelimbs. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">However, many living birds such as the hoatzin in 
                South America, the touraco in Africa and the ostrich also have claws. In 1983, 
                the British Museum of Natural History displayed numerous species within nine 
                families of birds with claws on the wings. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">3. It had teeth. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Modern birds do not have teeth but many ancient 
                birds did, particularly those in the Mesozoic. There is no suggestion that 
                these birds were transitional. The teeth do not show the connection of 
                Archeopteryx with any other animal since every subclass of vertebrates has 
                some with teeth and some without. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">4. It had a shallow breastbone. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Various modern flying birds such as the hoatzin 
                have similarly shallow breastbones, and this does not disqualify them from 
                being classified as birds. And there are, of course, many species of nonflying 
                birds, both living and extinct. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Recent examination of Archeopteryx's feathers has 
                shown that they are the same as the feathers of modern birds that are 
                excellent fliers. Dr. Ostrom says that there is no question that they are the 
                same as the feathers of modern birds. They are asymmetrical with a center 
                shaft and parallel barbs like those of today's flying birds. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">5. Its bones were solid, not hollow, like a 
                bird's. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">This idea has been refuted because the long bones 
                of Archeopteryx are now known to be hollow. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">6. It predates the general arrival of birds by 
                millions of years. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">This also has been refuted by recent 
                paleontological discoveries. In 1977 a geologist from Brigham Young 
                University, James A. Jensen, discovered in the Dry Mesa quarry of the Morrison 
                formation in western Colorado a fossil of an unequivocal bird in Lower 
                Jurassic rock. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">This deposit is dated as 60-million years older 
                than the Upper Jurassic rock in which Archeopteryx was found. He first found 
                the rear-leg femur and, later, the remainder of the skeleton. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">This was reported in Science News 24 September 
                1977. Professor John Ostrom commented, "It is obvious we must now look for the 
                ancestors of flying birds in a period of time much older than that in which 
                Archeopteryx lived." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">And so it goes with the fossil that many 
                textbooks set forth as the best example of a transitional form. No true 
                intermediate fossils have been found. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">In a letter to Luther Sunderland, dated April 10, 
                1979, Dr. Colin Patterson, of the British Museum of Natural History, wrote: </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">"...I fully agree with your comments on the lack 
                of direct illustration of evolutionary transitions in my book. If I knew of 
                any, fossil or living, I would certainly have included them. You suggest that 
                an artist should be used to visualise such transformations, but where would he 
                get the information from? I could not, honestly, provide it, and if I were to 
                leave it to artistic licence, would that not mislead the reader?" </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Just think of it! Here is a man sitting amidst 
                one of the greatest fossil collections ever and he knows of absolutely NO 
                transitional fossils. So convincing I believe this quote to be that it will 
                sum up this discussion on fossil evidence. </span></p>

              <h4><a name="4"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">4. EMBRYONIC RECAPITULATION</span></a></h4>
              <p><a name="4"> </a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Darwin said that embryological evidence was 
                "second to none in importance." The idea of embryonic recapitulation, or the 
                theory that higher life forms go through the previous evolutionary chain 
                before birth, was popularized by Ernst Haeckel in 1866. It was later found 
                that Haeckel forged the diagrams which he used is evidence for the theory. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The main arguments for embryonic recapitulation 
                are the supposed "gill slits" (left over from fish), "yolk sac" (left over 
                from the reptile stage), and "tail" (from the monkeys) in the human embryo. 
                The gill slits, so called, are never slits, nor do they ever function in 
                respiration. They are actually four pairs of pharyngeal pouches: the first 
                pair become germ-fighting organs; the second, the two middle ear canals; the 
                third and fourth pairs become the important parathyroid and thymus glands. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The yolk sac does not store food because the 
                mother's body provides this to the embryo. In fact, the "yolk sac" is not a 
                yolk sac at all, but its true function is to produce the first blood cells. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The "tail" is just the tip of the spine extending 
                beyond the muscles of the embryo. The end of this will eventually become the 
                coccyx, which is instrumental in the ability to stand and sit as humans do. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Also arguing against recapitulation is the fact 
                that different higher life forms experience different stages in different 
                orders, and often contrary to the assumed evolutionary order. </span></p>

              <p><a name="5"> </a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The science of probability has not been favorable 
                to evolutionary theory, even with the theory's loose time restraints. Dr. 
                James Coppedge, of the Center for Probability Research in Biology in 
                California, made some amazing calculations. Dr. Coppedge </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">"applied all the laws of probability studies to 
                the possibility of a single cell coming into existence by chance. He 
                considered in the same way a single protein molecule, and even a single gene. 
                His discoveries are revolutionary. He computed a world in which the entire 
                crust of the earth - all the oceans, all the atoms, and the whole crust were 
                available. He then had these amino acids bind at a rate one and one-half 
                trillion times faster than they do in nature. In computing the possibilities, 
                he found that to provide a single protein molecule by chance combination would 
                take 10, to the 262nd power, years." (That is, the number 1 followed by 262 
                zeros.) "To get a single cell - the single smallest living cell known to 
                mankind - which is called the mycroplasm hominis H39, would take 10, to the 
                119,841st power, years. That means that if you took thin pieces of paper and 
                wrote 1 and then wrote zeros after (it), you would fill up the entire known 
                universe with paper before you could ever even write that number. That is how 
                many years it would take to make one living cell, smaller than any human 
                cell!" </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">According to Emile Borel, a French scientist and 
                expert in the area of probability, an event on the cosmic level with a 
                probability of less than 1 out of 10, to the 50th power, will not happen. The 
                probability of producing one human cell by chance is 10, to the 119,000 power. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Sir Fred Hoyle, British mathematician and 
                astronomer, was quoted in Nature magazine, November 12, 1981, as saying "The 
                chance that higher life forms might have emerged in this way (evolution) is 
                comparable with the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junk-yard might 
                assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">As one can readily see, here is yet one more test 
                that evolution theory has flunked. </span></p>

              <h4><a name="6"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">6. SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS</span></a></h4>
              <p><a name="6"> </a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The second law of thermodynamics states that 
                although the total amount of energy remains constant, the amount of usable 
                energy is constantly decreasing. This law can be seen in most everything. 
                Where work is done, energy is expelled. That energy can never again be used. 
                As usable energy decreases, decay increases. Herein lies the problem for 
                evolution. If the natural trend is toward degeneration, then evolution is 
                impossible, for it demands the betterment of organisms through mutation. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Some try to sidestep this law by saying that it 
                applies only to closed environments. They say the earth is an open 
                environment, collecting energy from the sun. However, Dr. Duane Gish has put 
                forth four conditions that must be met in order for complexity to be generated 
                in an environment. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">1. The system must be an open system.<br> 2. An adequate external energy force must be available.<br> 3. The system must possess energy conversion mechanisms.<br> 4. A control mechanism must exist within the system for directing, maintaining 
                and replicating these energy conversion mechanisms.<br> The second law clearly presents another insurmountable barrier to evolutionary 
                idealism. </span></p>

              <h4><a name="7"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">7. VESTIGIAL ORGANS</span></a></h4>
              <p><a name="7"> </a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Vestigial organs are supposed organs in the body 
                which are useless, left over from evolutionary development. The following 
                arguments for vestigial organs are based on those taken from the "Bible 
                Science Newsletter," August 1989, p. 16. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">1. Just because we don't yet know the role of an 
                organ does not mean it is useless and left over from previous stages of 
                evolution. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">2. This view is plain false. In the 1800's, 
                evolutionists listed 180 vestigial organs in the human body. The functions for 
                all have now been found. Some of these were the pituitary gland (oversees 
                skeletal growth), the thymus (an endocrine gland), the pineal gland (affects 
                the development of the sex glands), the tonsils, and appendix (both now known 
                to fight disease.) </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">3. The fact that an organ must sometimes be 
                removed does not make it vestigial. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">4. The fact that one can live without an organ 
                (appendix, tonsils) does not make it vestigial. You can survive without an arm 
                or a kidney but these are not considered vestigial. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">5. Organs are not vestigial based upon your need 
                or use of them. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">6. According to evolution, if an organ has lost 
                its value, it should, over time, vanish completely. There has been enough time 
                to lose these "vestigial" organs, but we still have them. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">7. If organs do become useless, this would back 
                up the second law of thermodynamics and the degenerative process, not 
                evolution, which requires adaptation of organs for new purposes. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">8. Vestigial organs prove loss, not evolutionary 
                progression. Evolution theory requires new organs forming for useful purposes, 
                not "old ones" dying out. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">9. Evolutionists have, for the most part, given 
                up the argument over vestigial organs. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Evolutionists like to tell us that at least 
                thousands of years are needed to form the fossils and fuels (such as coal and 
                oil) that we find today. However, objects must be buried rapidly in order to 
                fossilize. This, bearing also in mind the billions of fossils and fossil fuels 
                buried around the world, seems to indicate a worldwide catastrophe. None other 
                than, you guessed it, Noah's flood. </span></p>

                Science Foundation, presents some interesting facts in seminars which he 
                gives. Oil can now be made in a few minutes in a laboratory. Black coal can 
                also be formed at an astonishing rate. Ham also has in his overlay 
                presentation a photograph of a fossilized miner's hat, about fifty years old. 
                All that is necessary for fossilization is quick burial and the right

              <p><a name="9"> </a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Seeing the problem of gradual evolution with the 
                fossil record, and the obvious abrupt appearances of species, Drs. Stephen Jay 
                Gould and Niles Eldredge have formed the theory of punctuated equilibria. 
                Punctuated equilibria, is, by example, a bird giving birth to a mammal, thus 
                leaving no transitional fossils in the geological record. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Many top evolutionists disagree with this 
                position. And punctuated equilibria has its problems, too. For instance, in 
                the above case, of a bird bearing a mammal, another mammal of the same kind of 
                the opposite sex must be born at the same approximate time in the same area in 
                order for the new species to continue. The odds of just one organism appearing 
                this way, let alone two fulfilling the circumstances above, are astronomical. </span></p>

              <h4><a name="10"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">10. HOMOLOGY/MOLECULAR BIOLOGY</span></a></h4>
              <p><a name="10"> </a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Homology is the similarity of structures between 
                different types of organisms. Some have argued that these similarities are 
                evidence of one common ancestor. However, as Sunderland points out, when the 
                concentration of red blood cells is used, utilizing the ideas of homology, man 
                is more closely related to frogs, fish, and birds than to sheep. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">But now, with the development of molecular 
                biology we are able to make a comparison of the same cells in different 
                species, which adds a whole new dimension to homology. Unfortunately, for the 
                evolutionists, molecular biology does as all other evidences do: presents 
                greater argument against evolution theory. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">In molecular biology, proteins of the same type 
                in different organisms can be tested for difference in amino acid makeup. The 
                figure resulting is converted into a percentage. The lower the percentage, the 
                less difference there is between the proteins. Dr. Michael Denton, in 
                experiments with Cytochrome C, a protein that converts food into energy, and 
                hemoglobin, found the following. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Dr. Denton states, "There is not a trace at a 
                molecular level of the traditional evolutionary series: fish to amphibian to 
                reptile to mammal. Incredibly man is closer to lamprey than are fish." The 
                evidence is clear; evolution is struck another hard blow! </span></p>

              <p><a name="11"> </a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Many of the radiometric dating methods used for 
                determining the age of fossils are quite unreliable. Carbon-14 dating is 
                usually sound within a few hundred years span of time. But there are 
                exceptions to this. For example, a living mollusk was dated using the 
                carbon-14 method. The readings said it had been dead for 3000 years. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Lava rocks from a volcano in Hawaii which erupted 
                in 1801 were tested, using the potassium-argon method. The readings showed 
                them to be nearly 3 billion years old. Moon rocks were tested by various 
                radiometric methods, yielding dates ranging from 700 million to 28 billion 
                years. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Dating methods such as potassium-argon, 
                uranium-lead, and rubidium-strontium, are based on assumptions. These methods 
                are based on chemical change (uranium to lead, etc.) where the parent material 
                (ie., uranium) is converted to the daughter material (ie., lead) at a known 
                rate, called a half-life. These methods cannot be trusted on the basis that 
                too little is known. In order to come up with a correct date, you must know: </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">1. how much of the parent material was in it at 
                the start,<br> 2. how much of the daughter material was in it at the start, &amp;<br> 3. if there has been some type of contamination since.<br> In obtaining dates now, scientists assume the answers to or ignore these 
                questions. The fact is that we cannot know how old a specimen is unless we 
                were there when it was formed. </span></p>

              <h4><a name="12"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">12. DINOSAURS</span></a></h4>
              <p><a name="12"> </a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Evolutionists insist that dinosaurs died out 
                millions of years before man appeared. However, there are many reasons to 
                disbelieve this. There are the stories of animals much like dinosaurs in the 
                legends of many lands. These creatures were called dragons. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Many times in the recent past, explorers have 
                recorded sightings of flying reptiles much like the pterodactyl. Human 
                footprints were found along with those of a dinosaur in limestone near the 
                Paluxy River in Texas. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Also not to be tossed aside is the possibility of 
                dinosaurs living today. Consider the stories such as the Loch Ness monster (of 
                which many convincing photographs have been taken). Some have claimed to see 
                dinosaur-like creatures in isolated areas of the world. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Recently, a Japanese fishing boat pulled up a 
                carcass of a huge animal that intensely resembled a dinosaur. A group of 
                scientists on an expedition into a jungle looking for dinosaur evidence claims 
                that they witnessed one, but their camera was damaged. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">However, they tape recorded the roar of the 
                beast. This recording was checked. The voice patterns on it did not resemble 
                those of any other roaring. You decide. At any rate, the evidence that man and 
                dinosaur did live together at one time poses another problem for the 
                evolutionists. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">"But if the dinosaurs lived at the same time as 
                man, they would have had to have been on the Ark, and that's impossible!" Is 
                it? The ark was about one and one-half football fields long, 75 feet wide, and 
                45 feet tall. It had a cubic footage of 1,518,750. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">There would have been plenty of room on the Ark 
                for the dinosaurs (especially considering that only a few were of the enormous 
                size of Tyrannosaurus or "Brontosaurus.") Also, the Bible states that Noah was 
                to take two of every kind onto the Ark. Many dinosaurs and reptiles were of 
                the same kind, but much smaller. Dinosaurs pose no problem for creation 
                science. </span></p>

              <p>Actually, I would appreciate it if you stop flaunting here and there that you are a uni student. There is nothing special about being a uni student, since in Singapore, if i throw a stone in the crowd, I can easily hit the head of a university graduate. If you would like it, go and get a PHd or a doctorate before you start flaunting here and there. And if evolution is really right, Why do I also see people who get doctorates, science degrees, going into creationism?</p>
              <p>I don't think people are worried about losing their faith. If they stay in religion, they are constricted by many laws. Anyone would want to break free. So I say evolutionists are the ones who are engaging in massive cover-ups, because if religion is true, they have to follow the restrictions of religion. Evolutionists like this freedom and stay in it forever. You are biased in your claims.</p>

              <h4><a rel="nofollow" name="1"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">1. MOON DUST</span></a></h4>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Meteoritic dust falls
                      on the earth continuously, adding up to thousands, if not millions,
                      of tons of dust per year. Realizing this, and knowing that the moon
                      also had meteoritic dust piling up for what they thought was
                      millions of years, N.A.S.A. scientists were worried that the first
                      lunar ship that landed would sink into the many feet of dust which
                      should have accumulated.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">However, only about
                      one-eight of an inch of dust was found, indicating a young
                      moon.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Meteoritic material
                      contributes nickel to the oceans. Taking the amount of nickel in
                      the oceans and the supply from meteoritic dust yields an age figure
                      for the earth of just several thousand years, not the millions (or
                      billions) expressed by evolutionists. This, and the lack of
                      meteoritic dust piles on the earth, lend to the belief in a young
                      earth.</span></p>

              <p><a rel="nofollow" name="2"></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The earth's magnetic
                      field is decaying rapidly, at a constant (if not decreasing) rate.
                      At this rate, 8000 years ago the earth's magnetism would have
                      equaled that of a magnetic star, a highly unlikely occurrence.
                      Also, if electric currents in the earth's core are responsible for
                      the earth's magnetism, the heat generated by these currents 20,000
                      years ago would have dissolved the earth.</span></p>

              <p><a rel="nofollow" name="3"></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Charles Darwin stated,
                      in his Origin of Species, "The geological record is extremely
                      imperfect and this fact will to a large extent explain why we do
                      not find intermediate varieties, connecting together all the
                      extinct and existing forms of life by the finest graduated steps.
                      He who rejects these views on the nature of the geological record,
                      will rightly reject my whole theory."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Now, 130 years and
                      billions of fossils later, we can rightly reject the view of an
                      incomplete fossil record or of one "connecting together all . . .
                      forms of life by the finest graduated steps."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Out of the millions of
                      fossils in the world, not one transitional form has been found. All
                      known species show up abruptly in the fossil record, without
                      intermediate forms, thus contributing to the fact of special
                      creation. Let's take a look at Archeopteryx, a fossil that some
                      evolutionists claim to be transitional between reptile and
                      bird.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Archeopteryx is
                      discussed in evolutionist Francis Hitching's book, The Neck of the
                      Giraffe - Where Darwin Went Wrong. Hitching speaks on six aspects
                      of Archeopteryx, following here.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">(The following six
                      points are quoted from Luther Sunderland's book, Darwin's Enigma:
                      Fossils and Other Problems, pp. 74-75, the facts of which points he
                      gathered from Hitching's book.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">1. It had a long bony
                      tail, like a reptile's.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">In the embryonic stage,
                      some living birds have more tail vertebrae than Archeopteryx. They
                      later fuse to become an upstanding bone called the pygostyle. The
                      tail bone and feather arrangement on swans are very similar to
                      those of Archeopteryx.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">One authority claims
                      that there is no basic difference between the ancient and modern
                      forms: the difference lies only in the fact that the caudal
                      vertebrae are greatly prolonged. But this does not make a
                      reptile.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">2. It had claws on its
                      feet and on its feathered forelimbs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">However, many living
                      birds such as the hoatzin in South America, the touraco in Africa
                      and the ostrich also have claws. In 1983, the British Museum of
                      Natural History displayed numerous species within nine families of
                      birds with claws on the wings.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">3. It had
                      teeth.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Modern birds do not
                      have teeth but many ancient birds did, particularly those in the
                      Mesozoic. There is no suggestion that these birds were
                      transitional. The teeth do not show the connection of Archeopteryx
                      with any other animal since every subclass of vertebrates has some
                      with teeth and some without.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">4. It had a shallow
                      breastbone.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Various modern flying
                      birds such as the hoatzin have similarly shallow breastbones, and
                      this does not disqualify them from being classified as birds. And
                      there are, of course, many species of nonflying birds, both living
                      and extinct.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Recent examination of
                      Archeopteryx's feathers has shown that they are the same as the
                      feathers of modern birds that are excellent fliers. Dr. Ostrom says
                      that there is no question that they are the same as the feathers of
                      modern birds. They are asymmetrical with a center shaft and
                      parallel barbs like those of today's flying birds.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">5. Its bones were
                      solid, not hollow, like a bird's.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">This idea has been
                      refuted because the long bones of Archeopteryx are now known to be
                      hollow.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">6. It predates the
                      general arrival of birds by millions of years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">This also has been
                      refuted by recent paleontological discoveries. In 1977 a geologist
                      from Brigham Young University, James A. Jensen, discovered in the
                      Dry Mesa quarry of the Morrison formation in western Colorado a
                      fossil of an unequivocal bird in Lower Jurassic rock.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">This deposit is dated
                      as 60-million years older than the Upper Jurassic rock in which
                      Archeopteryx was found. He first found the rear-leg femur and,
                      later, the remainder of the skeleton.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">This was reported in
                      Science News 24 September 1977. Professor John Ostrom commented,
                      "It is obvious we must now look for the ancestors of flying birds
                      in a period of time much older than that in which Archeopteryx
                      lived."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">And so it goes with the
                      fossil that many textbooks set forth as the best example of a
                      transitional form. No true intermediate fossils have been
                      found.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">In a letter to Luther
                      Sunderland, dated April 10, 1979, Dr. Colin Patterson, of the
                      British Museum of Natural History, wrote:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">"...I fully agree with
                      your comments on the lack of direct illustration of evolutionary
                      transitions in my book. If I knew of any, fossil or living, I would
                      certainly have included them. You suggest that an artist should be
                      used to visualise such transformations, but where would he get the
                      information from? I could not, honestly, provide it, and if I were
                      to leave it to artistic licence, would that not mislead the
                      reader?"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Just think of it! Here
                      is a man sitting amidst one of the greatest fossil collections ever
                      and he knows of absolutely NO transitional fossils. So convincing I
                      believe this quote to be that it will sum up this discussion on
                      fossil evidence.</span></p>

                      RECAPITULATION</span></a></h4>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" name="4"></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Darwin said that
                      embryological evidence was "second to none in importance." The idea
                      of embryonic recapitulation, or the theory that higher life forms
                      go through the previous evolutionary chain before birth, was
                      popularized by Ernst Haeckel in 1866. It was later found that
                      Haeckel forged the diagrams which he used is evidence for the
                      theory.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The main arguments for
                      embryonic recapitulation are the supposed "gill slits" (left over
                      from fish), "yolk sac" (left over from the reptile stage), and
                      "tail" (from the monkeys) in the human embryo. The gill slits, so
                      called, are never slits, nor do they ever function in respiration.
                      They are actually four pairs of pharyngeal pouches: the first pair
                      become germ-fighting organs; the second, the two middle ear canals;
                      the third and fourth pairs become the important parathyroid and
                      thymus glands.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The yolk sac does not
                      store food because the mother's body provides this to the embryo.
                      In fact, the "yolk sac" is not a yolk sac at all, but its true
                      function is to produce the first blood cells.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The "tail" is just the
                      tip of the spine extending beyond the muscles of the embryo. The
                      end of this will eventually become the coccyx, which is
                      instrumental in the ability to stand and sit as humans
                      do.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Also arguing against
                      recapitulation is the fact that different higher life forms
                      experience different stages in different orders, and often contrary
                      to the assumed evolutionary order.</span></p>

              <p><a rel="nofollow" name="5"></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The science of
                      probability has not been favorable to evolutionary theory, even
                      with the theory's loose time restraints. Dr. James Coppedge, of the
                      Center for Probability Research in Biology in California, made some
                      amazing calculations. Dr. Coppedge</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">"applied all the laws
                      of probability studies to the possibility of a single cell coming
                      into existence by chance. He considered in the same way a single
                      protein molecule, and even a single gene. His discoveries are
                      revolutionary. He computed a world in which the entire crust of the
                      earth - all the oceans, all the atoms, and the whole crust were
                      available. He then had these amino acids bind at a rate one and
                      one-half trillion times faster than they do in nature. In computing
                      the possibilities, he found that to provide a single protein
                      molecule by chance combination would take 10, to the 262nd power,
                      years." (That is, the number 1 followed by 262 zeros.) "To get a
                      single cell - the single smallest living cell known to mankind -
                      which is called the mycroplasm hominis H39, would take 10, to the
                      119,841st power, years. That means that if you took thin pieces of
                      paper and wrote 1 and then wrote zeros after (it), you would fill
                      up the entire known universe with paper before you could ever even
                      write that number. That is how many years it would take to make one
                      living cell, smaller than any human cell!"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">According to Emile
                      Borel, a French scientist and expert in the area of probability, an
                      event on the cosmic level with a probability of less than 1 out of
                      10, to the 50th power, will not happen. The probability of
                      producing one human cell by chance is 10, to the 119,000
                      power.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Sir Fred Hoyle, British
                      mathematician and astronomer, was quoted in Nature magazine,
                      November 12, 1981, as saying "The chance that higher life forms
                      might have emerged in this way (evolution) is comparable with the
                      chance that a tornado sweeping through a junk-yard might assemble a
                      Boeing 747 from the materials therein."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">As one can readily see,

                      THERMODYNAMICS</span></a></h4>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" name="6"></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The second law of
                      thermodynamics states that although the total amount of energy
                      remains constant, the amount of usable energy is constantly
                      decreasing. This law can be seen in most everything. Where work is
                      done, energy is expelled. That energy can never again be used. As
                      usable energy decreases, decay increases. Herein lies the problem
                      for evolution. If the natural trend is toward degeneration, then
                      evolution is impossible, for it demands the betterment of organisms
                      through mutation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Some try to sidestep
                      this law by saying that it applies only to closed environments.
                      They say the earth is an open environment, collecting energy from
                      the sun. However, Dr. Duane Gish has put forth four conditions that
                      must be met in order for complexity to be generated in an
                      environment.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">1. The system must be
                      an open system.<br> 2. An adequate external energy force must be available.<br> 3. The system must possess energy conversion mechanisms.<br> 4. A control mechanism must exist within the system for directing,
                      maintaining and replicating these energy conversion
                      mechanisms.<br> The second law clearly presents another insurmountable barrier to
                      evolutionary idealism.</span></p>

              <h4><a rel="nofollow" name="7"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">7. VESTIGIAL ORGANS</span></a></h4>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" name="7"></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Vestigial organs are
                      supposed organs in the body which are useless, left over from
                      evolutionary development. The following arguments for vestigial
                      organs are based on those taken from the "Bible Science
                      Newsletter," August 1989, p. 16.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">1. Just because we
                      don't yet know the role of an organ does not mean it is useless and
                      left over from previous stages of evolution.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">2. This view is plain
                      false. In the 1800's, evolutionists listed 180 vestigial organs in
                      the human body. The functions for all have now been found. Some of
                      these were the pituitary gland (oversees skeletal growth), the
                      thymus (an endocrine gland), the pineal gland (affects the
                      development of the sex glands), the tonsils, and appendix (both now
                      known to fight disease.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">3. The fact that an
                      organ must sometimes be removed does not make it
                      vestigial.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">4. The fact that one
                      can live without an organ (appendix, tonsils) does not make it
                      vestigial. You can survive without an arm or a kidney but these are
                      not considered vestigial.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">5. Organs are not
                      vestigial based upon your need or use of them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">6. According to
                      evolution, if an organ has lost its value, it should, over time,
                      vanish completely. There has been enough time to lose these
                      "vestigial" organs, but we still have them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">7. If organs do become
                      useless, this would back up the second law of thermodynamics and
                      the degenerative process, not evolution, which requires adaptation
                      of organs for new purposes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">8. Vestigial organs
                      prove loss, not evolutionary progression. Evolution theory requires
                      new organs forming for useful purposes, not "old ones" dying
                      out.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">9. Evolutionists have,
                      for the most part, given up the argument over vestigial
                      organs.</span></p>

                      tell us that at least thousands of years are needed to form the
                      fossils and fuels (such as coal and oil) that we find today.
                      However, objects must be buried rapidly in order to fossilize.
                      This, bearing also in mind the billions of fossils and fossil fuels
                      buried around the world, seems to indicate a worldwide catastrophe.

                      interesting facts in seminars which he gives. Oil can now be made
                      in a few minutes in a laboratory. Black coal can also be formed at
                      an astonishing rate. Ham also has in his overlay presentation a
                      photograph of a fossilized miner's hat, about fifty years old. All
                      that is necessary for fossilization is quick burial and the right

              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Seeing the problem of
                      gradual evolution with the fossil record, and the obvious abrupt
                      appearances of species, Drs. Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge
                      have formed the theory of punctuated equilibria. Punctuated
                      equilibria, is, by example, a bird giving birth to a mammal, thus
                      leaving no transitional fossils in the geological
                      record.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Many top evolutionists
                      disagree with this position. And punctuated equilibria has its
                      problems, too. For instance, in the above case, of a bird bearing a
                      mammal, another mammal of the same kind of the opposite sex must be
                      born at the same approximate time in the same area in order for the
                      new species to continue. The odds of just one organism appearing
                      this way, let alone two fulfilling the circumstances above, are

              <p><a rel="nofollow" name="10"></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Homology is the
                      similarity of structures between different types of organisms. Some
                      have argued that these similarities are evidence of one common
                      ancestor. However, as Sunderland points out, when the concentration
                      of red blood cells is used, utilizing the ideas of homology, man is
                      more closely related to frogs, fish, and birds than to
                      sheep.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">But now, with the
                      development of molecular biology we are able to make a comparison
                      of the same cells in different species, which adds a whole new
                      dimension to homology. Unfortunately, for the evolutionists,
                      molecular biology does as all other evidences do: presents greater
                      argument against evolution theory.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">In molecular biology,
                      proteins of the same type in different organisms can be tested for
                      difference in amino acid makeup. The figure resulting is converted
                      into a percentage. The lower the percentage, the less difference
                      there is between the proteins. Dr. Michael Denton, in experiments
                      with Cytochrome C, a protein that converts food into energy, and
                      hemoglobin, found the following.</span></p>

                      </pre>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Dr. Denton states,
                      "There is not a trace at a molecular level of the traditional
                      evolutionary series: fish to amphibian to reptile to mammal.
                      Incredibly man is closer to lamprey than are fish." The evidence is
                      clear; evolution is struck another hard blow!</span></p>

              <p><a rel="nofollow" name="11"></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Many of the radiometric
                      dating methods used for determining the age of fossils are quite
                      unreliable. Carbon-14 dating is usually sound within a few hundred
                      years span of time. But there are exceptions to this. For example,
                      a living mollusk was dated using the carbon-14 method. The readings
                      said it had been dead for 3000 years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Lava rocks from a
                      volcano in Hawaii which erupted in 1801 were tested, using the
                      potassium-argon method. The readings showed them to be nearly 3
                      billion years old. Moon rocks were tested by various radiometric
                      methods, yielding dates ranging from 700 million to 28 billion
                      years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Dating methods such as
                      potassium-argon, uranium-lead, and rubidium-strontium, are based on
                      assumptions. These methods are based on chemical change (uranium to
                      lead, etc.) where the parent material (ie., uranium) is converted
                      to the daughter material (ie., lead) at a known rate, called a
                      half-life. These methods cannot be trusted on the basis that too
                      little is known. In order to come up with a correct date, you must
                      know:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">1. how much of the
                      parent material was in it at the start,<br> 2. how much of the daughter material was in it at the start,
                      &amp;<br> 3. if there has been some type of contamination since.<br> In obtaining dates now, scientists assume the answers to or ignore
                      these questions. The fact is that we cannot know how old a specimen
                      is unless we were there when it was formed.</span></p>

              <h4><a rel="nofollow" name="12"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">12. DINOSAURS</span></a></h4>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" name="12"></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Evolutionists insist
                      that dinosaurs died out millions of years before man appeared.
                      However, there are many reasons to disbelieve this. There are the
                      stories of animals much like dinosaurs in the legends of many
                      lands. These creatures were called dragons.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Many times in the
                      recent past, explorers have recorded sightings of flying reptiles
                      much like the pterodactyl. Human footprints were found along with
                      those of a dinosaur in limestone near the Paluxy River in
                      Texas.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Also not to be tossed
                      aside is the possibility of dinosaurs living today. Consider the
                      stories such as the Loch Ness monster (of which many convincing
                      photographs have been taken). Some have claimed to see
                      dinosaur-like creatures in isolated areas of the world.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Recently, a Japanese
                      fishing boat pulled up a carcass of a huge animal that intensely
                      resembled a dinosaur. A group of scientists on an expedition into a
                      jungle looking for dinosaur evidence claims that they witnessed
                      one, but their camera was damaged.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">However, they tape
                      recorded the roar of the beast. This recording was checked. The
                      voice patterns on it did not resemble those of any other roaring.
                      You decide. At any rate, the evidence that man and dinosaur did
                      live together at one time poses another problem for the
                      evolutionists.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">"But if the dinosaurs
                      lived at the same time as man, they would have had to have been on
                      the Ark, and that's impossible!" Is it? The ark was about one and
                      one-half football fields long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet tall. It
                      had a cubic footage of 1,518,750.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">There would have been
                      plenty of room on the Ark for the dinosaurs (especially considering
                      that only a few were of the enormous size of Tyrannosaurus or
                      "Brontosaurus.") Also, the Bible states that Noah was to take two
                      of every kind onto the Ark. Many dinosaurs and reptiles were of the
                      same kind, but much smaller. Dinosaurs pose no problem for creation

                      close to the biblical account.</span></p>

              <p>Actually, I would appreciate it if you stop flaunting here and
                      there that you are a uni student. There is nothing special about
                      being a uni student, since in Singapore, if i throw a stone in the
                      crowd, I can easily hit the head of a university graduate. If you
                      would like it, go and get a PHd or a doctorate before you start
                      flaunting here and there. And if evolution is really right, Why do
                      I also see people who get doctorates, science degrees, going into
                      creationism?</p>
              <p>I don't think people are worried about losing their faith. If
                      they stay in religion, they are constricted by many laws. Anyone
                      would want to break free. So I say evolutionists are the ones who
                      are engaging in massive cover-ups, because if religion is true,
                      they have to follow the restrictions of religion. Evolutionists
                      like this freedom and stay in it forever. You are biased in your
                      claims.</p>

              <p>I did not get this from a forum, but the content of a book.</p>
              <p>First of all, you talk as though religion is against science, and you kept insisting that the bible is false. Have you even read the bible? Then how do you know it's false? And if atheism were to really take over the world, I am sorry but a world war might start once again. And once again, since when were scientists restricted with laws to cross-breed species? I see scientists making pigs that glow in the dark, using human neurons to grow inside a mouse's tummy. Is that very constricting?</p>
              <p>If you can insist that the bible is false even when you didn't read it, why can't I insist that evolution is false just because I didn't study it? Same logic applies, and I am not going to be a biologist in the future, so I can have the knowledge I want, just as you will never be a jew or a christian.</p>

              of tons of dust per year. Realizing this, and knowing that the moon
              also had meteoritic dust piling up for what they thought was
              millions of years, N.A.S.A. scientists were worried that the first
              lunar ship that landed would sink into the many feet of dust which
              should have accumulated.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">However, only about
              one-eight of an inch of dust was found, indicating a young

              contributes nickel to the oceans. Taking the amount of nickel in
              the oceans and the supply from meteoritic dust yields an age figure
              for the earth of just several thousand years, not the millions (or
              billions) expressed by evolutionists. This, and the lack of
              meteoritic dust piles on the earth, lend to the belief in a young
              earth.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The earth's magnetic
              field is decaying rapidly, at a constant (if not decreasing) rate.
              At this rate, 8000 years ago the earth's magnetism would have
              equaled that of a magnetic star, a highly unlikely occurrence.
              Also, if electric currents in the earth's core are responsible for
              the earth's magnetism, the heat generated by these currents 20,000
              years ago would have dissolved the earth.</span></p>

              <p><a rel="nofollow" name="3"></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Charles Darwin stated,
              in his Origin of Species, "The geological record is extremely
              imperfect and this fact will to a large extent explain why we do
              not find intermediate varieties, connecting together all the
              extinct and existing forms of life by the finest graduated steps.
              He who rejects these views on the nature of the geological record,
              will rightly reject my whole theory."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Now, 130 years and
              billions of fossils later, we can rightly reject the view of an
              incomplete fossil record or of one "connecting together all . . .
              forms of life by the finest graduated steps."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Out of the millions of
              fossils in the world, not one transitional form has been found. All
              known species show up abruptly in the fossil record, without
              intermediate forms, thus contributing to the fact of special
              creation. Let's take a look at Archeopteryx, a fossil that some
              evolutionists claim to be transitional between reptile and
              bird.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Archeopteryx is
              discussed in evolutionist Francis Hitching's book, The Neck of the
              Giraffe - Where Darwin Went Wrong. Hitching speaks on six aspects
              of Archeopteryx, following here.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">(The following six
              points are quoted from Luther Sunderland's book, Darwin's Enigma:
              Fossils and Other Problems, pp. 74-75, the facts of which points he
              gathered from Hitching's book.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">1. It had a long bony
              tail, like a reptile's.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">In the embryonic stage,
              some living birds have more tail vertebrae than Archeopteryx. They
              later fuse to become an upstanding bone called the pygostyle. The
              tail bone and feather arrangement on swans are very similar to
              those of Archeopteryx.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">One authority claims
              that there is no basic difference between the ancient and modern
              forms: the difference lies only in the fact that the caudal
              vertebrae are greatly prolonged. But this does not make a
              reptile.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">2. It had claws on its
              feet and on its feathered forelimbs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">However, many living
              birds such as the hoatzin in South America, the touraco in Africa
              and the ostrich also have claws. In 1983, the British Museum of
              Natural History displayed numerous species within nine families of
              birds with claws on the wings.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">3. It had
              teeth.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Modern birds do not
              have teeth but many ancient birds did, particularly those in the
              Mesozoic. There is no suggestion that these birds were
              transitional. The teeth do not show the connection of Archeopteryx
              with any other animal since every subclass of vertebrates has some
              with teeth and some without.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">4. It had a shallow
              breastbone.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Various modern flying
              birds such as the hoatzin have similarly shallow breastbones, and
              this does not disqualify them from being classified as birds. And
              there are, of course, many species of nonflying birds, both living
              and extinct.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Recent examination of
              Archeopteryx's feathers has shown that they are the same as the
              feathers of modern birds that are excellent fliers. Dr. Ostrom says
              that there is no question that they are the same as the feathers of
              modern birds. They are asymmetrical with a center shaft and
              parallel barbs like those of today's flying birds.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">5. Its bones were
              solid, not hollow, like a bird's.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">This idea has been
              refuted because the long bones of Archeopteryx are now known to be
              hollow.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">6. It predates the
              general arrival of birds by millions of years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">This also has been
              refuted by recent paleontological discoveries. In 1977 a geologist
              from Brigham Young University, James A. Jensen, discovered in the
              Dry Mesa quarry of the Morrison formation in western Colorado a
              fossil of an unequivocal bird in Lower Jurassic rock.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">This deposit is dated
              as 60-million years older than the Upper Jurassic rock in which
              Archeopteryx was found. He first found the rear-leg femur and,
              later, the remainder of the skeleton.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">This was reported in
              Science News 24 September 1977. Professor John Ostrom commented,
              "It is obvious we must now look for the ancestors of flying birds
              in a period of time much older than that in which Archeopteryx
              lived."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">And so it goes with the
              fossil that many textbooks set forth as the best example of a
              transitional form. No true intermediate fossils have been
              found.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">In a letter to Luther
              Sunderland, dated April 10, 1979, Dr. Colin Patterson, of the
              British Museum of Natural History, wrote:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">"...I fully agree with
              your comments on the lack of direct illustration of evolutionary
              transitions in my book. If I knew of any, fossil or living, I would
              certainly have included them. You suggest that an artist should be
              used to visualise such transformations, but where would he get the
              information from? I could not, honestly, provide it, and if I were
              to leave it to artistic licence, would that not mislead the
              reader?"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Just think of it! Here
              is a man sitting amidst one of the greatest fossil collections ever
              and he knows of absolutely NO transitional fossils. So convincing I
              believe this quote to be that it will sum up this discussion on
              fossil evidence.</span></p>

              <h4><a rel="nofollow" name="4"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">4. EMBRYONIC
              RECAPITULATION</span></a></h4>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" name="4"></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Darwin said that
              embryological evidence was "second to none in importance." The idea
              of embryonic recapitulation, or the theory that higher life forms
              go through the previous evolutionary chain before birth, was
              popularized by Ernst Haeckel in 1866. It was later found that
              Haeckel forged the diagrams which he used is evidence for the
              theory.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The main arguments for
              embryonic recapitulation are the supposed "gill slits" (left over
              from fish), "yolk sac" (left over from the reptile stage), and
              "tail" (from the monkeys) in the human embryo. The gill slits, so
              called, are never slits, nor do they ever function in respiration.
              They are actually four pairs of pharyngeal pouches: the first pair
              become germ-fighting organs; the second, the two middle ear canals;
              the third and fourth pairs become the important parathyroid and
              thymus glands.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The yolk sac does not
              store food because the mother's body provides this to the embryo.
              In fact, the "yolk sac" is not a yolk sac at all, but its true
              function is to produce the first blood cells.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The "tail" is just the
              tip of the spine extending beyond the muscles of the embryo. The
              end of this will eventually become the coccyx, which is
              instrumental in the ability to stand and sit as humans
              do.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Also arguing against
              recapitulation is the fact that different higher life forms
              experience different stages in different orders, and often contrary
              to the assumed evolutionary order.</span></p>

              <p><a rel="nofollow" name="5"></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The science of
              probability has not been favorable to evolutionary theory, even
              with the theory's loose time restraints. Dr. James Coppedge, of the
              Center for Probability Research in Biology in California, made some
              amazing calculations. Dr. Coppedge</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">"applied all the laws
              of probability studies to the possibility of a single cell coming
              into existence by chance. He considered in the same way a single
              protein molecule, and even a single gene. His discoveries are
              revolutionary. He computed a world in which the entire crust of the
              earth - all the oceans, all the atoms, and the whole crust were
              available. He then had these amino acids bind at a rate one and
              one-half trillion times faster than they do in nature. In computing
              the possibilities, he found that to provide a single protein
              molecule by chance combination would take 10, to the 262nd power,
              years." (That is, the number 1 followed by 262 zeros.) "To get a
              single cell - the single smallest living cell known to mankind -
              which is called the mycroplasm hominis H39, would take 10, to the
              119,841st power, years. That means that if you took thin pieces of
              paper and wrote 1 and then wrote zeros after (it), you would fill
              up the entire known universe with paper before you could ever even
              write that number. That is how many years it would take to make one
              living cell, smaller than any human cell!"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">According to Emile
              Borel, a French scientist and expert in the area of probability, an
              event on the cosmic level with a probability of less than 1 out of
              10, to the 50th power, will not happen. The probability of
              producing one human cell by chance is 10, to the 119,000
              power.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Sir Fred Hoyle, British
              mathematician and astronomer, was quoted in Nature magazine,
              November 12, 1981, as saying "The chance that higher life forms
              might have emerged in this way (evolution) is comparable with the
              chance that a tornado sweeping through a junk-yard might assemble a
              Boeing 747 from the materials therein."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">As one can readily see,
              here is yet one more test that evolution theory has
              flunked.</span></p>

              THERMODYNAMICS</span></a></h4>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" name="6"></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The second law of
              thermodynamics states that although the total amount of energy
              remains constant, the amount of usable energy is constantly
              decreasing. This law can be seen in most everything. Where work is
              done, energy is expelled. That energy can never again be used. As
              usable energy decreases, decay increases. Herein lies the problem
              for evolution. If the natural trend is toward degeneration, then
              evolution is impossible, for it demands the betterment of organisms
              through mutation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Some try to sidestep
              this law by saying that it applies only to closed environments.
              They say the earth is an open environment, collecting energy from
              the sun. However, Dr. Duane Gish has put forth four conditions that
              must be met in order for complexity to be generated in an
              environment.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">1. The system must be
              an open system.<br> 2. An adequate external energy force must be available.<br> 3. The system must possess energy conversion mechanisms.<br> 4. A control mechanism must exist within the system for directing,
              maintaining and replicating these energy conversion
              mechanisms.<br> The second law clearly presents another insurmountable barrier to
              evolutionary idealism.</span></p>

              <h4><a rel="nofollow" name="7"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">7. VESTIGIAL ORGANS</span></a></h4>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" name="7"></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Vestigial organs are
              supposed organs in the body which are useless, left over from
              evolutionary development. The following arguments for vestigial
              organs are based on those taken from the "Bible Science
              Newsletter," August 1989, p. 16.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">1. Just because we
              don't yet know the role of an organ does not mean it is useless and
              left over from previous stages of evolution.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">2. This view is plain
              false. In the 1800's, evolutionists listed 180 vestigial organs in
              the human body. The functions for all have now been found. Some of
              these were the pituitary gland (oversees skeletal growth), the
              thymus (an endocrine gland), the pineal gland (affects the
              development of the sex glands), the tonsils, and appendix (both now
              known to fight disease.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">3. The fact that an
              organ must sometimes be removed does not make it
              vestigial.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">4. The fact that one
              can live without an organ (appendix, tonsils) does not make it
              vestigial. You can survive without an arm or a kidney but these are
              not considered vestigial.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">5. Organs are not
              vestigial based upon your need or use of them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">6. According to
              evolution, if an organ has lost its value, it should, over time,
              vanish completely. There has been enough time to lose these
              "vestigial" organs, but we still have them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">7. If organs do become
              useless, this would back up the second law of thermodynamics and
              the degenerative process, not evolution, which requires adaptation
              of organs for new purposes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">8. Vestigial organs
              prove loss, not evolutionary progression. Evolution theory requires
              new organs forming for useful purposes, not "old ones" dying
              out.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">9. Evolutionists have,
              for the most part, given up the argument over vestigial
              organs.</span></p>

              FORMATION</span></a></h4>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" name="8"></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Evolutionists like to
              tell us that at least thousands of years are needed to form the
              fossils and fuels (such as coal and oil) that we find today.
              However, objects must be buried rapidly in order to fossilize.
              This, bearing also in mind the billions of fossils and fossil fuels
              buried around the world, seems to indicate a worldwide catastrophe.
              None other than, you guessed it, Noah's flood.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Ken Ham, director of
              the Australia-based Creation Science Foundation, presents some
              interesting facts in seminars which he gives. Oil can now be made
              in a few minutes in a laboratory. Black coal can also be formed at
              an astonishing rate. Ham also has in his overlay presentation a
              photograph of a fossilized miner's hat, about fifty years old. All
              that is necessary for fossilization is quick burial and the right
              conditions, not thousands of years.</span></p>

              EQUILIBRIA</span></a></h4>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" name="9"></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Seeing the problem of
              gradual evolution with the fossil record, and the obvious abrupt
              appearances of species, Drs. Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge
              have formed the theory of punctuated equilibria. Punctuated
              equilibria, is, by example, a bird giving birth to a mammal, thus
              leaving no transitional fossils in the geological
              record.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Many top evolutionists
              disagree with this position. And punctuated equilibria has its
              problems, too. For instance, in the above case, of a bird bearing a
              mammal, another mammal of the same kind of the opposite sex must be
              born at the same approximate time in the same area in order for the
              new species to continue. The odds of just one organism appearing
              this way, let alone two fulfilling the circumstances above, are
              astronomical.</span></p>

              BIOLOGY</span></a></h4>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" name="10"></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Homology is the
              similarity of structures between different types of organisms. Some
              have argued that these similarities are evidence of one common
              ancestor. However, as Sunderland points out, when the concentration
              of red blood cells is used, utilizing the ideas of homology, man is
              more closely related to frogs, fish, and birds than to
              sheep.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">But now, with the
              development of molecular biology we are able to make a comparison
              of the same cells in different species, which adds a whole new
              dimension to homology. Unfortunately, for the evolutionists,
              molecular biology does as all other evidences do: presents greater
              argument against evolution theory.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">In molecular biology,
              proteins of the same type in different organisms can be tested for
              difference in amino acid makeup. The figure resulting is converted
              into a percentage. The lower the percentage, the less difference
              there is between the proteins. Dr. Michael Denton, in experiments
              with Cytochrome C, a protein that converts food into energy, and
              hemoglobin, found the following.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Dr. Denton states,
              "There is not a trace at a molecular level of the traditional
              evolutionary series: fish to amphibian to reptile to mammal.
              Incredibly man is closer to lamprey than are fish." The evidence is
              clear; evolution is struck another hard blow!</span></p>

              <p><a rel="nofollow" name="11"></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Many of the radiometric
              dating methods used for determining the age of fossils are quite
              unreliable. Carbon-14 dating is usually sound within a few hundred
              years span of time. But there are exceptions to this. For example,
              a living mollusk was dated using the carbon-14 method. The readings
              said it had been dead for 3000 years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Lava rocks from a
              volcano in Hawaii which erupted in 1801 were tested, using the
              potassium-argon method. The readings showed them to be nearly 3
              billion years old. Moon rocks were tested by various radiometric
              methods, yielding dates ranging from 700 million to 28 billion
              years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Dating methods such as
              potassium-argon, uranium-lead, and rubidium-strontium, are based on
              assumptions. These methods are based on chemical change (uranium to
              lead, etc.) where the parent material (ie., uranium) is converted
              to the daughter material (ie., lead) at a known rate, called a
              half-life. These methods cannot be trusted on the basis that too
              little is known. In order to come up with a correct date, you must
              know:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">1. how much of the
              parent material was in it at the start,<br> 2. how much of the daughter material was in it at the start,
              &amp;<br> 3. if there has been some type of contamination since.<br> In obtaining dates now, scientists assume the answers to or ignore
              these questions. The fact is that we cannot know how old a specimen
              is unless we were there when it was formed.</span></p>

              <p><a rel="nofollow" name="12"></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Evolutionists insist
              that dinosaurs died out millions of years before man appeared.
              However, there are many reasons to disbelieve this. There are the
              stories of animals much like dinosaurs in the legends of many
              lands. These creatures were called dragons.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Many times in the
              recent past, explorers have recorded sightings of flying reptiles
              much like the pterodactyl. Human footprints were found along with
              those of a dinosaur in limestone near the Paluxy River in
              Texas.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Also not to be tossed
              aside is the possibility of dinosaurs living today. Consider the
              stories such as the Loch Ness monster (of which many convincing
              photographs have been taken). Some have claimed to see
              dinosaur-like creatures in isolated areas of the world.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Recently, a Japanese
              fishing boat pulled up a carcass of a huge animal that intensely
              resembled a dinosaur. A group of scientists on an expedition into a
              jungle looking for dinosaur evidence claims that they witnessed
              one, but their camera was damaged.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">However, they tape
              recorded the roar of the beast. This recording was checked. The
              voice patterns on it did not resemble those of any other roaring.
              You decide. At any rate, the evidence that man and dinosaur did
              live together at one time poses another problem for the
              evolutionists.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">"But if the dinosaurs
              lived at the same time as man, they would have had to have been on
              the Ark, and that's impossible!" Is it? The ark was about one and
              one-half football fields long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet tall. It
              had a cubic footage of 1,518,750.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">There would have been
              plenty of room on the Ark for the dinosaurs (especially considering
              that only a few were of the enormous size of Tyrannosaurus or
              "Brontosaurus.") Also, the Bible states that Noah was to take two
              of every kind onto the Ark. Many dinosaurs and reptiles were of the
              same kind, but much smaller. Dinosaurs pose no problem for creation
              science.</span></p>

              close to the biblical account.</span></p>

              <p>Actually, I would appreciate it if you stop flaunting here and
              there that you are a uni student. There is nothing special about
              being a uni student, since in Singapore, if i throw a stone in the
              crowd, I can easily hit the head of a university graduate. If you
              would like it, go and get a PHd or a doctorate before you start
              flaunting here and there. And if evolution is really right, Why do
              I also see people who get doctorates, science degrees, going into
              creationism?</p>
              <p>I don't think people are worried about losing their faith. If
              they stay in religion, they are constricted by many laws. Anyone
              would want to break free. So I say evolutionists are the ones who
              are engaging in massive cover-ups, because if religion is true,
              they have to follow the restrictions of religion. Evolutionists
              like this freedom and stay in it forever. You are biased in your
              claims.</p>

              can be guaranteed that asking an atheist/evolutionist how evolution
              actually works will either produce unprovable theories, assumptions,
              beliefs, or excuses.  This is because </span><span style="color: #191919; font-family: 'HelveticaNeue','Helvetica Neue','Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; opacity: 1;">there is not a scientist on Earth that has been able to prove a single aspect of evolution</span><span style="color: #191919; font-family: 'HelveticaNeue','Helvetica Neue','Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 16px; opacity: 1;">.
               They make fun of Christians by claiming they’d answer science
              questions with “God made it,” but you can make fun of evolutionists
              because their answer to everything is “it adapted it.”  The religion of
              evolution remains in existence only because many people do not want to
              believe in God, and this is the best thing atheists can come up with.</span></div>

              <p>You do know that certain species of plants have been genetically

              As i say, the church is 1 of the biggest obstacle to scientific

              <p>When you enter uni and study biological science, i will provide you an explaination since you have admitted to not having any knowledge of biology so it would be pointless for me to provide you with any explaination in this area.</p>
              <p>Please give egs of your non living matter transforming into living matter.</p>
              <p>For your basic understanding, DNA and proteins are not even related and are completely different biomolecules so they don't directly rely on each other. However, for the body to function, everything has a role to play but it would require alot more scientific explaination to do an indepth discussion on this. Do you even know that all amino acids DO contain Oxygen?</p>
