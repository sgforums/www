              <p>To check whether the bible you read is authentic, use Bible Numerics. The bible has this special mathematical code inside, that once the bible is edited an no loner in order, the numbers will also not in a certain order. Google Ivan pannin, the agnostic who became a christian overnight after realising the numerics.</p>

              <p>yes, the bible did say that all the books should be included. What fatagf is talking about is the nostic bible by Judas. Judas'd scriptures are actually more spiritual. We are yet to totally confirm whether it was the original or taken away by Constantine.</p>
              <p>The Emeperor Constantine may be burning in hell right at this moment. I am so</p>
              <p>Like Picaso's painting, we appreciate the art and the abstract of the painting, not ask which brush did he use to paint what and where. Same goes as the bible. The message is what is important. NOT the writers. They convey the message of the bible, the message of God , morality, how to live our lives accordingly love and so forth.</p>
              <p>So please la.. u guys ... even some of the replies i see from my fellow christians, dun be so fast to react to thier remarks, will only show how limited in knowledge to the intepretations and easily subject to the simplest attacks. I am not here to lecture you, but as an advice. As u can see in the replies, the attacks are very simple to defend actually based on thier logic.</p>

              <p>Gnostic christian, you mean the gospel of Judas? The one who said that Jesus begged to Judas to betray him, so that Jesus can die and escape the from the limits of his physical body to his spiritual realm? That is obviously false. Gnostic beliefs are different, they believe that YAHWEH was given birth to by some Goddess and also a God who is most likely to commit genocide, and also unsympathetic and grumpy.</p>
