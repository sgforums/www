              <p>Please readup on evolution history. Your brains cannot accept
              changes that takes time and you believe things happen immediately.
              Maybe your life is too short to believe that others have lived long
              before you.</p>
              <p>If you believe everything is created, please explain WHY every
              human being is not 100% the same. Why do all humans have a unique
              set of DNA which contains 50% from both parents if they are
              created?</p>
              <p>Evolution talks about passing on of genes, mutation and changes
              with each generation.</p>
              <p>Besides the childish magic that you are trying to say, you still
              cannot answer most of the questions others have answered by
              evolution as well as astronomy thinking that the universe is
              eternal.</p>

              <p>I am quite amazed with Larryteo. You actually believed in God totally and you dun believe a thing in Science at all? Then you shouldnt go to school anymore. Maths, physics and chemistry that you are learning in school now are all a form of Science.</p>
              <p>Since you believe in God totally, I would advise that you dun waste your parents money anymore. Stay at home and learn from God and all his theories, in fact from the person who actually wrote the Bible. (note: no one can prove that God himself actually wrote the Bible)</p>
              <p>In fact till now, what I have read from your replies are all personal attacks, post from some forum and all the replies does not answer the questions posted by dkcx, laurence82 or rooney.</p>

              <p>You just don't learn do u. How many christians out there do u see dare boldly post and argue with all the evolution theory and big bang theory etc that scientist has come out with?</p>
              <p>Most are just quietly believing in their god and live in denial but few dare to challenge science because they have no evidence to proof science wrong. All scientific research and findings have proper and documented evidence yet all the counters that christians etc give saying big bang and evolution theory is false are all simply words they say without any proper scientific backing.</p>
              <p>As we have said before, 2000 yrs is a long time. Anyone can write crap predictions and as long as he never specifys how long it will take to happen, any idiot will believe its true if it just so coincidentally happens 50 yrs after or 500 yrs after or 5000 yrs after. People who cannot accept the truth will just keep emphasising that the predictions were true when almost any statement made will usually come true after a long time has past.</p>
              <p>Anyone can predict S'pore will sink into the ocean 1 day, S'pore will attack M'sia and bring M'sia under S'pore rule etc etc. As long as someone just puts that prediction down, it might happen 10 yrs later, even 10 000 yrs later and people who believe the prediction will argue that people long long ago has been able to see the future and made such an accurate prediction.</p>
              <p>Every tom dick or harry can make such predictions, people who have studied science etc can even make more accurate predictions which seems like it was a prediction but actually its just using science to calculate and predict occurance such as earthquakes, hurricanes, meteor showers etc easily yet you still choose to believe in them.</p>

              <p>I went to look at dkcx's 1st reply in this post and he did not mentioned the word "Bible" in the 3 sentence he wrote. In fact no one replied with the word "Bible in any of their replies until you started it.</p>

              <p>It's not hell yet. People living in cities have a better life, that is not hell. The real hell comes when tsunamis and disasters come every year. Natural disasters are happening more and more frequently, and ever since 1990 there has been one major earthquake every single year. When the antichrist comes those who refuse to worship his image shall be beheaded. Though it sounds old-fashioned, it could be that the antichrist is from some Muslim descent or some other religion which supports beheading of non believers.</p>
