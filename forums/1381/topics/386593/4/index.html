              </p><p>1st Issue) Christianity is afraid of science</p>
              <p>Christians were never scared of science. Religion was neither afraid too. Many early discoveries in our modern world and the basis of our modern world actually rely on the hard work made by priests and monks in the monasteries that sought to better understand our world. The famous example is genetics, where the laws of inheritance were first layed out by Gregor mendel, an austrian monk. These people were the pioneers of our modern science and if they felt that science was going to challenge their religion, why would they contradict their beliefs? </p>
              <p>*they said christians are scared that science will reveal that religion is false</p>
              <p>It was religion that provided imagination to the scientific method we use today. Many aspects of religious texts have encouraged man to know more about our world, how it works and to encourage scientific thought. Without religion we would be living in a backward world today without our modern advances. It has been in recent years that people have denounced religion calling it a practice for the weak but religion has encouraged scientific thought. Major religious texts prove it. </p>

              <p>1st Issue) Christianity is afraid of science</p>
              <p>Christians were never scared of science. Religion was
              neither afraid too. Many early discoveries in our modern world and
              the basis of our modern world actually rely on the hard work made
              by priests and monks in the monasteries that sought to
              better understand our world. The famous example is genetics, where
              the laws of inheritance were first layed out by Gregor mendel, an
              austrian monk. These people were the pioneers of our modern science
              and if they felt that science was going to challenge their
              religion, why would they contradict their beliefs? </p>
              <p>*they said christians are scared that science will reveal that
              religion is false</p>
              <p>It was religion that provided imagination to the scientific
              method we use today. Many aspects of religious texts have
              encouraged man to know more about our world, how it works and to
              encourage scientific thought. Without religion we would
              be living in a backward world today without our modern advances. It
              has been in recent years that people have denounced religion
              calling it a practice for the weak but religion has
              encouraged scientific thought. Major religious texts
              prove it. </p>

              <p>If thats your answer, please do not use your computer as you are using technology. Please pray to god everyday and he might grant you something that is more advance than a computer which is made by science.</p>
              <p>Please explain in detail how did religion lead to scientific advancement and if that is so, they is scientific advancement into space and many fields proving things that goes against what religion believes in.</p>
              <p>Please find SCIENTIFIC proof that religion affects science. As a religion trying to protect itself, it will obviously say that others depend on it but only when others admit/agree that it was due to that could it be valid.</p>

              <p>That doesn't make it true either. You have still yet to explain the different variations of flu virus such as H1N1, H5N1 etc etc. If they didn't evolve, how did these new variations suddenly appear when they were not present earlier?</p>
              <p>Do u go to the supermarket to get everything or would you go to a farm to buy milk, eggs etc, a silkworm farm to get silk etc to make into clothes? You get everything you want these days from supermarkets which have everything and you buy from them because you trust them to give you quality goods.</p>
              <p>Just like why people would trust major publishers and bookstores that sells all kinds of books and not be bias.</p>
