              <p>you mean god created the earthquake in 2010 in Iran? cos you said all things are created from/by him. for what? to punish Irananian people or the country?</p>

              <p>its just like seeing a fortune teller, who told me to avoid driving in December, cos I may encounter a road accident if I drive in December. you mean in other months I am accident free when I drive? so upon hearing this, do I take the words of the fortune teller seriously to avoid driving in December?</p>

              <p>ya thats why it is a revealing religion, but it doesnt provide a solution. whether it turns out to be true or not, nobody can say for sure, unless you send scientists there now and station them there till sept 2010 to study the movement and monitor the quake movements.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but you have to ask, why god need to create earthquakers, tsunamis etc, all these natural disasters in the first place? there will be a lot of replies given to this question?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if you ask science, why does earthquakes happened? they will tell you that earth is a hotspot for plate movements, depending on where these hotspots are located. for instance Indonesia is located where the plate movements are regular.</p>

              <p>Just like 911, people only discovered that the note can be folded in such a way to make it look like it. If there was no 911, even if others know about it, would anyone really care?

              <p>Oh is that so? Then can you explain why every prophecy about Israel from being a nation again to a prosperous land has come true? And can you explain why is that when Jesus said the temple of jerusalem will be destroyed, not one stone left, and 40 years after he resurrected and went up to heaven, the romans really destroyed the temple, with no one stone left, and for your info, the chances of the temple being torn apart are 1/4000.</p>
              <p>there are 2500 prophecies in the bible, and 2000 have been fulfilled. And fulfilling of the bible prophecy obviously means matching the case exactly as described in the bible, so your argument just falls flat on the ground.</p>

              <p>so what if the prophecies is true? how u get the figures that 2000 prophecies are true? what source did you obtained from? pardon me for my cynicism, as I dun trust when people quoted figures and stats to me. you cant trust people words these days. then what happened to the 500 prophecies if 2000 are correct?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so what of everyone is correct, does it help to prevent people from dying, does it help with poverty in some poor countries? as mentioned earlier, if your prophesy can save 200,000 lives lost from the 2004 tsunamis, then its a good prophesy as its purpose saves lives. of the 2000 prophecies, how many of them did save lives and improve the quality of the people? if it did not serve a purpose, then whats the use of it? its just like seeing a fortune teller, he told me to avoid driving in december, but never tell me how to drive without any incident in december. whats the use of telling me that?  if I drive in december, can he accurately tell me the exact date and time where the incident occur so that I can avoid driving that day, save the problem once and for all, isnt it.</p>
