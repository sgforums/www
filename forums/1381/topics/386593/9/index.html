              <p>If i am not wrong, i believe there are species that have
              interbreed and can continue to breed on which results in a sort of
              new species evolving. I don't remember whether science had a hand
              in helping to achieve such reproduction but i do remember reading
              about it before that such are possible which could explain why a
              single family of animals can have so many different sub species as
              over thousands of years, interbreeding has occured and they start
              having enough numbers to form a new species of their own.</p>

              <p>Actually i would like to offer a different theory.</p>
              <p>Caucasians are known to have a higher rate of having skin cancer
              compared to other ethnicity and their skin is a lot dryer.This is
              because they produce less melanin (pigment), which provides
              necessary protection against UV radiation</p>
              <p>It could just be in the early history of Man in the hot and
              exposed plains of Africa and Australia, anyone born with white skin
              are more proned to die earlier and generally have a great
              disadvantage in being able to breed and pass down the
              genes. </p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>I know of the melanin theory as well which is 1 of the reasons they are saying why whites tends to get skin cancer more than the blacks.</p>
              <p>However, i was just pointing out that skin colour was not due directly to the sun since its not exposure to sunlight that causes the skin to turn dark etc. Even whites may have the same amount of exposure yet they still do not change their skin tones to a much darker shade purely due to exposure to sunlight.</p>
              <p>Melanin would be a scientific explaination along the lines of evolution which larry would not believe.</p>

              <p>Correct, there's no real reason for the modern humans to breed with modern chimps and apes.What i am referring to an earlier point of our evolutionary history where the difference may be as slight as a black woman breeding with a chinese man.</p>
              <p>If humans had stayed isolated for another hundred thousand or million years, it may be quite likely that the Inuit people would not be able to produce a viable offspring with say the Australian Aboriginal. </p>
              <p>We are already doing that with gene modified food but the greatest worry has always been what happens when something that is gene modified managed to breed with something in the wild to produce something totally unexpected and grosteque.</p>
              <p>We may be able to obtain the dog's keen sense of smell and hearing but there's no telling whether the offspring would look more like a dog or a human or whether the child could grow insane or feral by the imput of foreign sensory data its brain did not evolved to handle.</p>
              <p>The problem with genetic modifications is that there is a lot of background programs running behind our DNA, we do not know whether by attempting to insert new programs would you corrupt the existing programs or totally compromise the entire system.</p>
              <p>That said however, the current human form is extremely weak and fragile, both mentally, physically and biologically. It's difficult to imagine us being able to progress any furthur with modifying ourselves.</p>

              <p>Now, you did not provide the link to the exact article, the May
                  17 issue of National Geographic has many articles so i'm just going
                  to go out on a limb here and assume that</p>
              <p>http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/05/humans-chimps_2.html</p>
              <p>is the article you're referring to. Please give me the correct
                  link if i'm wrong.</p>
              <p>Dogs are considered to be a different species from wolves but
                  they are still capable of interbreeding and producing fertile
                  hybrids.</p>
              <p>Note that the article also say that it is very likely that the
                  hybrids are also unlikely to reproduce thus it was doubtful that
                  they would have played any long term role in our evolutionary
                  history.</p>
              <p>So it is hardly news that the early divergents from our common
                  ancestors could still breed with each other. The point however, is
                  that humans now are no longer capable of breeding naturally with
                  chimps so it's not wrong for me to say that we are now progressing
                  on a different evolutionary path from chimps.</p>
              <p>I believe this is the point you're trying to drive here?</p>

              <p>Of course humans cannot breed naturally with chimps <strong>now</strong> because chimps descended from chimps and humans descended from humans.</p>
              <p>Your argument is like it could be either this or that  or both. It could have happened or it could not have happened.</p>
              <p>You leave some room here so that  later on when it is suggested that chimps may have descended from humans, you will still be correct.</p>
              <p>You have covered both possibilities. Very safe, very wishy washy.</p>

              <p>''The theory of evolution is certainly an interesting phenomenon.  While
                  it is referred to as a “scientific theory,” it is defended by its
                  believers when questioned like it is sacred; like it is their very
                  lifeblood.  People who believe in this theory defend it as fiercely and
                  even angrily as any other radical religious believer would, as if their
                  very existence depends on it.  But why is this so?  If a scientist or
                  professor questioned or doubted any other scientific theory, their
                  peers would inquire as to why, and a civilized, open minded exchange
                  would ensue in order to educate one another and seek truth of the
                  matter.  This is not so for the theory of evolution.  If a scientist or
                  professor dares to doubt the sacred theory of Darwin (and believe it or
                  not, <a title="http://www.dissentfromdarwin.org/" href="http://www.dissentfromdarwin.org/">some are brave enough to do so</a>),
                  they can be shunned, mocked, ridiculed, or risk losing their respective
                  positions among societal ranks.  What drives this societal mechanism? 
                  Is the theory of really evolution so indisputable that anyone who
                  questions it is deemed unsuitable for a prominent role in society?  Or,
                  does the way these matters are handled simply show that evolution is a
                  belief system, rather than science?''</p>

              <p>There is scientific basis and continued research. You are just too niave and lack the intellectual capabilities to understand all these advanced sciences since you still believe in magic of prince turning into a frog and fish becoming humans.</p>
              <p>We talk about evolution, not magic nor cartoons which its obvious you watch too much of. Please learn what is meant by evolution and what is meant by magic since you seems to lack understanding of their difference.</p>
              <p>Please wakeup, you will never get a magic wand that can summon fairy, angels etc to give u money, food etc to survive. Everything you are using now, doing now, relying on now comes from technology and not your make believe god who has done nothing for you except made you look like a fool in front of us.</p>
              <p>In science, you don't open your mouth and talk crap like you do. Any scientist that wants to deprove anything has to show evidence that it is false. Since so many have found evidence of evolution that few can disprove with proper facts and noone can prove creationism, believing in creationism is like believing magic exist in this world since it can't be proven.</p>

              <p class="Body"> </p>
              <p class="Body">1)    So...
              fish just sprout legs out of convenience, huh?  Sounds like some kind
              of crazy Harry Potter movie.  I wonder how many generations of fish
              flopping up onto land and dying it took before they decided to sprout
              legs and grow lungs.  I bet that if such a transformation did occur,
              the intermediary species would be quite hindered, having half-grown
              legs that impeded its ability to swim while not being able to walk yet.</p>
              <p class="Body"> </p>
              <p class="Body">2)    At
              what point did the fish or lizard (that sprouted legs and grew lungs)
              give birth to a mammal?  I bet that really freaked out the mother when
              she realized there was no way to nurse them.  Of course there's no
              fossil evidence for such an intermediary creature, but imagination can
              be entertaining.</p>

              material rather than believe in science that you are made up of
              carbon, oxygen, hydrogen etc compounds?</p>
              <p>I guess you don't believe in yourself being born from a sperm
              and egg but believe you were implanted into your mother's stomach
              but some god since you believe life is only created by this so
              called god.</p>
              <p>No sex for you in future since you are not allowed to create
              life. Sex is a passing on of genetic information and thus a form of

              <p><span>Questions from those who dare to doubt
              Darwin:</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1)    So... fish just sprout legs
              out of convenience, huh?  Sounds like some kind of crazy Harry
              Potter movie.  I wonder how many generations of fish flopping
              up onto land and dying it took before they decided to sprout legs
              and grow lungs.  I bet that if such a transformation did
              occur, the intermediary species would be quite hindered, having
              half-grown legs that impeded its ability to swim while not
              being able to walk yet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2)    At what point did the fish or
              lizard (that sprouted legs and grew lungs) give birth to a mammal?
               I bet that really freaked out the mother when she realized
              there was no way to nurse them.  Of course there's no fossil
              evidence for such an intermediary creature, but imagination can be
              entertaining.</p>

              <p>Please readup on evolution history. Your brains cannot accept changes that takes time and you believe things happen immediately. Maybe your life is too short to believe that others have lived long before you.</p>
              <p>If you believe everything is created, please explain WHY every human being is not 100% the same. Why do all humans have a unique set of DNA which contains 50% from both parents if they are created?</p>
              <p>Evolution talks about passing on of genes, mutation and changes with each generation.</p>
              <p>Besides the childish magic that you are trying to say, you still cannot answer most of the questions others have answered by evolution as well as astronomy thinking that the universe is eternal.</p>

              <p>Please provide scientific proof of this.</p>
              <p>Psychology explains people who live in denial as someone who are at their end of their stage of life. Perhaps you will soon be leaving this world and going to a make believe heaven since only the sick and dying often live in denial of the truth.</p>
