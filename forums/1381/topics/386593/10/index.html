Sorry but nothing special about being a uni student, I can throw one rock in a shopping mall and can easily hit the head of a uni student. +I know many uni students who are christians too.

              at their end of their stage of life. Perhaps you will soon be

              <p>Psychology really explains the denial of life, people like you. You just want the freedom that there is no God, it is more logical to believe that religious people want to flee from the laws and from the faith rather than believe that they are scared to lose their faith. Evolutionists are the ones who are scared of losing their faith in their nicely put together fairy tale to fool little children.</p>

              You just want the freedom that there is no God, it is more logical

              from the faith rather than believe that they are scared to lose

              <p>Since very early, we have told you to provide scientific proven
              evidence. Websites are never trusted since every forummer here can
              create a website and each saying they are god or some magical
              being. Will you believe in it? Such websites you love to give has
              no proof of anything but just things they say which are as good as
              any word anyone can say.</p>
              <p>If you can't provide any scientific proven basis of anything you
              say, please save yourself some face and runaway rather than
              continue being a laughing stock here as alot of your actions
              contridict your own self and shows your lack of understanding in
              the things you try to prove.</p>

              <p>true, websites can have hidden agenda or rather biased</p>
              <p>but more importantly is to see how its written and explain, whether or not its for or against evolution</p>

              <p>Why can't evolution result in intelligent life-forms? Sorry but
              I will never trust my 5 senses which is not made by some form of
              intelligence. Air head? Wow. You really think you are so smart? As
              I said, go flaunt in front of a creationist who is more highly
              qualified than you.</p>
              <p>Did you talk about PROOF? Sorry, no proof of evolution either.
              They find a fossil and say it is man's ancestor. That's it.
              Evolution is full of assumptions and theories, it is no different
              from your counterpart who believes an intelligent being created
              life on earth.</p>
