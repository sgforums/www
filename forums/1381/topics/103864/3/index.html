"Jesus"<br><br>a testimony from a person who attempted to assassinate annacondia said that he was armed with a rifle from a block away, scoping at the speaker, but everytime he tries to fire at him, the gun jams, but when he fires else where, the gun works fine, and there is always something which blocks his scope. and finally he was pushed "by an unknown force" towards the revival and he manifested and was delieverd. i'm pretty sure he was "under the influence of booze" when he believed and received with his rifle.<br><br>thats the power of the Holy Spirit. they recognise God and they believe. some don't, but they still recognise the power of God which they cannot match.<br></div>
