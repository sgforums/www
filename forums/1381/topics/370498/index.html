              <p>It's simple, keep your money to yourself and save them to bless
              your loved ones.</p>
              <p>BUT DO NOT DENY THE EXISTENCE OF GOD</p>
              <p>Church != GOD</p>
              <p>But if you think Church == GOD, then you're just dumb and
              stupid.</p>
              <p>Church is a place where Christian believers and non-believers
              gathered to worship GOD, so it's just a meeting place and not an
              organisation which many money-profiting followers gathered to form
              in order to mislead and gained a financial leverage over many
              others.</p>
              <p>Obey and Focus on the King of kings (GOD) and NOT on the King of
              Men (Humans in Churches)</p>
