The Church of England's Lambeth Conference, announced that contraception would be allowed in some circumstances.

The Church of England's Lambeth Conference, announced that contraception would be allowed in some circumstances. Soon the Church of England completely caved in, allowing contraception across the board. Since then, all other Protestant denominations have followed suit. Does this make birth control all right? I don't think so.<br><br>Regarding the priesthood, we Catholics make a distinction between the common priesthood and the ministerial priesthood. All Christians make up the common priesthood of believers, and the ordained priests make up the ministerial priesthood.</div></blockquote>but why issit immoral ? married couples may not want to have too many children because they cannot afford to wat.</div>
