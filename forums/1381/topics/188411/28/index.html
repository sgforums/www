Obviously the flaw in his main argument is that his very argument excludes all other kinds of possible arguments except his own as valid, and hence it is no surprise he goes around with his own idea of this and that ignoring the weight of logic. He never regarded it at all.<br><br>If starting logic and ideas are idols, what exacty is the whole system of faith he is trying to see us but starting logic and ideas in his own head? His case self-refutes from the first word but of course he is happily blind to them.<br><br>Of which I am not surprised at all, one can see his point of veiw and our own as well... but he is totally blind to all points of view but his own.<br><br>As I have said, there is no need to answer him at all, for he shall take no answers but that he already started out with.<br><br>What is faith in God? Certainly not the thing we believe in that he believes. And in any case it is irrelevant what he has to say about what I believe is faith in God, because I find it very hard indeed to take advice from somebody starting from a self-contradictary (and he has taken no effort at all to even consider his self-contradiction) position.<br><br>A madman can talk on to argue the case on exactly the same grounds after they have been vapourized by the opponent, this is because reason and logic never mattered to him in the formation of his case, just that there is a motivation to make it come true. This unfortunately, is what I get from CK.<br><br>So as I said brothers, our time with him is done. He could post yet another 50 posts saying the same thing, but it won't make a dent on the case we've built.<br><br>It is done.</div></blockquote>Amen.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So what's new? A refusal to put Faith in God and to put faith in man's logic and arguments? Read the Bible and you can see so many examples. Man has this inate need for idols because they just refuse Faith in God.<br><br>Look at the Isrealis, their Faith was in Moses and the minute Moses went up the mountain to get the ten commandments, they start creating idols for themselves.<br><br>You cannot even have Faith in acts of God, like manna from heaven.<br><br>When Christians ask each other if Da Vinci Code affected their faith I was like? Huh? Was your Faith in God or idols?  Dan Brown managed to expose your idols and you lose Faith? Thank God for Dan Brown. Those who lost their faith because of Dan Brown were having Faith in idols anyway, no big loss.</div>

Not being able to fully understand God does not means we cannot want to know Him. You also cannot fully understand yourself, does that means you don't need to know yourself?<br><br>Faith in God like Abraham, you don't even know and understand what this faith is about, Abrabram believed in God who can fulfills His promises, and this is acredited to him as righteousness (Roman 4), go read about what this faith of Abraham is about then come back.<br><br>oh, Pls read the replies from others first before replying.

He has instead chosen to present the same models and jargons again and again when I think just about everyone in here has knocked the feet from under them. Sitting on a dead horse and shouting 'Hi'o silver' does not get people anywhere, but curiously he persists.<br><br>For as much as it is kind for him to help us quote verses, I think it would do him best to go back and study those verses in their full context. In the meantime I must say that the verse he quotes hardly supports his case at all.<br><br>I am not surprised, often people who try to attack truths do little but end up contradicting themselves. CK attacks the issue of thought in faith, and in the end discredits every single one of his thoughts as well... all the while not even making a dent on the dogma he sought to tear down. I am a little saddened by his reluctance to see the truth, but we must understand that the only thing, and the only real motivation I do see on his part, is hardly a desire to improve people here, but rather to preserve one's ego and go out fighting to the end... even if the end means repeating a certain piece of jargon over and over again and worshiping it as his sole salvation from the abberations of logic.<br><br>Words are idols are scary and heavy words to throw about, but I am rather well assured where my faith lies.
