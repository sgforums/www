To have a relationship with them. They, on their part still need to have Faith in God; just like Abraham.<br><br>Instead of having Faith in God, they ended up following the Ten Commandments plus many more that they added. This is the easy way out. Follow a set of rules and regulations and call that having a relationship with God.<br><br>Can you imagine a marriage where the wife does not know the husband and she follows a set of rules and regulations, supposedly from the husband that she does not know? Everyday she reads about her husband. Everyday she makes sure that she lives her life in a way that her husband would like her to live according to the book. She needs to buy an airline ticket (Faith) to be with her husband. But her faith is in the book about her husband; she bought the airline ticket (faith) to be with the book about her husband but not the ticket to be with her husband.<br><br>She is everyday just reading a book about him and living a life that she thinks he wants her to live, according to the book. Sure, she is his chosen one, but would you call that a relationship?<br><br>Jesus came to remind them that that they need to buy the ticket (Faith) to go to God and not just read the book about God and do what the book says.<br><br>If Christians want to believe that Jesus made them the chosen people (the wife in the example) just like the Jews, then similarly, the Christians must still buy the ticket (Faith) to go to the husband (God.) Instead, just like the Jews, the Christians day and night read about the husband (God) and do what the book says her husband wants her to do.<br><br>If the wife bought the ticket (Faith) to be with her husband, she could then throw away the book. There is no need to read about her husband anymore. There is no need to read from the book what the book says the husband wants her to do. She can throw away the book.<br><br>I cannot answer for you this question: <strong>"Do you have a relationship with God? Did you have the Faith (buy the airline ticket to be with the husband) that brought you to start a relationship with God or are you still reading about God."</strong><br><br>So if you think Jesus died a horrible death so that you can continue to read about God? Think again.<br><br>As for the rest of your post, it is about theology and I am not so interested in that. You can take my version or your own version, it really is of no concern to me. All I am interested to ask you is: <strong>"Do you have a relationship with God such that you can say you need not to read the bible and pray to God anymore because you are talking to God and God is talking to you?"</strong><br><br>What am I talking about?<br><br>Genesis 22:1 <strong>It happened after these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to him, "Abraham!" He said, "Here I am."</strong>You see Abraham talking to God? Not praying, mind you. talking to.<br><br><strong>"It is enough. Now, O Yahweh, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers."  (I King 19:4).</strong> Do you see this person asking God to kill him?<br><br><strong>"What are you doing here, Elijah?"(I King 19:9)</strong> Do you see God talking to this person who wanted to end his own life? If there is anybody who is not worthy for God to talk to, he would be a very good example.<br><br>I am only giving you these examples because you can find the rest yourself. I am here telling you that God is still the same and will talk to you. Stop giving you excuses that the times are different and so on. Stop giving yourself excuses that you and they are different.<br><br>The only difference is that they had Faith in God and you do not. So what is Faith in God?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is a play on words, but it's of no use to anybody. It may very be that I talk to God the way you deem it correct but I consider it praying.<br><br>CK seems to be under this curious idea that reading the bible and praying is anti-faith. And this idea seems to come from the fact that they are detached mediums from having a direction connection with God, which to him is the only possible consideration for justifying true faith. I wonder who sets the terms of this meeting, and who forgets that the human also consists of being part animal as well as spirit.<br><br>And also I think CK is mistaking the means for the end. Indeed if these actions of reading the word and praying are but an end to themself that that would not be faith, but as a means to an end, it's another thing entirely.<br><br>I suspect one reason CK might not be willing to come forward with stating what he truly believes in this issue is that the ability to put his own case into an actual pratice might be very far from what he says it to be.<br><br>It's good and well quoting scripture, but I wonder if CK has actually mustered up the faith and <span style="font-style: italic;">talked</span> to God the way he says it should be. If not it might very well be hot air. I could claim that sleeping, eating and drinking are pagan, faithless and sinful for a person of true faith would be able to rely on God for all these needs instead of doing the physical acts that betray his own faithlessness (saying grace for food? what nonsense, a real person of faith and grace would not even need to eat for he shall be sustained by God alone).<br><br>I may also drag this point on for many pages on a thread and start throwing in monkeys for measure, but of course, I may not actually believe in it all and simply brought it up to confound others for the pleasure of apparently bringing up something indisputable to contradict what everybody knows to be good sense in the pratice in faith.<br><br>Of that I am greatly dubious, unless of course he wishes to correct me.<br><br>It is my opinion that the bible is more then just words and ink, and it is more then just good advice. How it is to people, it seems to me another thing entirely.<br><br>It's odd also, the CK uses religious texts to tell us why we shouldn't listen to religious texts... if that inference was true, then we would have no reason to consider the examples he quoted from the scriputres (of any religion). Which is where he got the entire example of Abraham from in the first place.<br><br>But if we did consider them we would be saying that <span style="font-style: italic;">some</span> of it ought to be listened to to determine the correct way, but then if that part what about the rest?<br><br>Especially the bothersome verses that refer to God being the Word, the Word made flesh, and all those psalms who praised the study of the Word. Somehow we ought to only consider some very specific areas (picked to our own desire) and ignore largely what the rest are saying on how exactly our behaviour towards God should be like.<br><br>In the same like, I can prove to you (from the bible) that God demands us to commit suicide.<br><br>Judas hung himself<br><br>Jesus says that if you love Him, you would follow His commands.<br><br>Jesus says go do it now.<br><br>Not an attack on CK, but just my thoughts on his entire theme and case.

Then sad to say that it would be quite impossible to know God.<br><br>This is however, quite another thing from saying that all believers ought to be <span style="font-style: italic;">poor</span> in logic. Jesus did tell us after all to be as <span style="font-style: italic;">wise</span> as vipers, and saw wisdom as a good thing. The problem comes when logic itself is exalted as the only way that one can ever know Him and takes the place of Him. IN it's proper place, logic is a good thing and in the end all proper thinking shall only lead to Him.<br><br>Paul told us that those who know do not know as they ought to know. It is correct to say that having sheer logic is not enough, knowing how He wants us to use it is equally important. This however means anything that we should be poor in logic, if anything there has been a lot said in the Word asking believers to exercise prudence, knowledge, and wisdom.<br><br><blockquote>There are other things that <strong>you</strong> are rich in that makes it impossible to enter into the Kingdom of God.</blockquote>Isn't it the same for everything taken the the extreme. Nothing should replace Him as the desire of the heart.

I'm amazed anybody bothered to stick with him as long as you did.

It seems to be equal to the trust that a child has in the goodness of his father even though he does not understand everything the father is or what the father may do. It is the trust and confidence in the character, actions and love of the parent in lieu of immediate apparent understanding.<br><br>Now I'm not sure what CK is suggesting, but it seems to me that in his idea of faith in God. This child must not have absolutely no concepts or ideas of his father at all. He must be unquestioningly believing in something even though he is not even sure what that thing is, just that it should be labeled 'GOD'. Any kinds of romantic notions that arise in the mind to help this faith must be slapped down and killed immediately because to have any reason to believe would be anti-faith.<br><br>On that I disagree of course, this is certainly not the faith of the Christian faith. And in any case I do not believe God works that way or demands that of us (thankfully). He may very well choose to do so, but simply because He didn't, it wasn't that way.<br><br>One might as well argue that the world deserve immediate termination the very moment it fell (which would be correct), but the very reason we still persist is because of love and mercy, and against these things there is no law.<br><br>So CK is correct to say that faith comes from God. We cannot muster up the faith to believe in Him or do anything. It seems we can only choose to respond to it or not.<br></div>
