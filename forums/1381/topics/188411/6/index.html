            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, if an idea is a heresy or not is something that is to be tested on the grounds of theology, not mere labels or mudwords to throw around in hope that they stick.<br><br>If C.K. is talking about the elimination of dead ritual and dogma in the conduct of faith then I would agree with him. However if such a statement is made with the assumption that having a direct contact with God would generate a totally new system of work that is better then the older established one is just that, an assumption. If you would want to call this new work a religion or not is really a matter of labels, but I have always supposed that one ought to do religion for God's sake, and not religion for religon's sake, if it has become that way, then it ought to be dismantled.<br><br>But I do not for a moment think that God is too small that He has to work in any one way. Granted many of the so-called revolutions turned out simply to be a restoration of that which had been lost to dead ritual and dogma. Also I note that Jesus didn't come to destroy the law by abolishing it, but rather by completing it with, as Aslan would put it: 'a deeper magic from beyond the beginning of time'.<br><br>So some might want to call the walk of faith a religion, some may want to call it a relationship, what I do know is what it is, and certainly what it is also not.<br></div>

The accounts of Abraham, Suras 19:41-49, 6:74-83 differ quite a bit from Sura 21:51-59. While in Sura 21 Abraham confronts his people strongly, and even destroys the idols, in Sura 19 Abraham shuts up after his father threatens him to stone him for speaking out against the idols. And he seems not only to become silent, but even to leave the area ("turning away from them all"). </a><br><br>some more coming</div>
