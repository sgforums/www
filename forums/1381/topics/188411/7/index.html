Abram's named was later changed by God to "Abraham", meaning "father of many". (Gen. 17:5) Abram's home was a city east of Babylon called, Ur of the Chaldees.

Why drag Hinduism into the picture?</div></blockquote>The reference to Hinduism was to point out that even idols worshippers can and do find God like Abraham.<br><br>After finding God they start to communicate with God like the way Abraham communicates with God. Some Hindus stay where they are; worshipping the idols and observing the rituals and that is all that they do.<br><br>Christians similarly.<br><br>That is why I am of the opinion that the Roman Catholic is more in touch with the truth. They teach Faith in God (which leads to direct communication with God) but in the meantime, for those who continue to seek, they can see the statues of Jesus and Mary and the saints.<br><br>What do believers do when they gather? Rituals. The staues are meaningless, the rituals are meaningless. What is important; the aim; the whole objective is to come into direct communication with God. I said in another post, I saw a RC Priest smoking. Evengelicas will faint if their pastors smoke in church.<br><br>Evengelicals have become a religion. They look at RC and complain about wrong intepretations, wrong behavior, idol worship and propose an alternative.<br><br>Do you see the stupidity of doing that? All it does is detract the believers from Faith and direct communication with God into the right interpretations and the right "Rituals."<br><br>Now we have even evengelicas who tell you the whole point of being a Christian is prosperity. They can even produce Bible verses to "justify" their positions. I will not go into why the do that here and why they are so successful.<br><br>Before you tell me that they have interpreted it "wrongly" I tell you: <strong>Give up your focus on right and wrong intepretations and teach the seekers to find God. Teach them to be Abraham, to be Jesus."</strong><br><br>Unfortunately the seekers will always be taught "the correct interpretations" because the pastors and teachers were appointed not because they were like Abraham and Jesus; people who have met God but because they were good in interpreting the Bible according to whatever sect appointed them.</div>
