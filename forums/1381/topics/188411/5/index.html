I would like to do what the world would consider Atrocities against Humanity. Yes that is what I like, yes, that is what I want?"</div></blockquote>Certainly not... but consider for a moment where their notions of right and wrong came from. Napolean sums it up when he said that we was no ordinary man and that the ordinary laws of right and wrong did not apply to him.<br><br>Rather, that these men do have have any sense of evil at all (the only evil to them is anything opposing them), other that the idea that facts are just facts and people are just material, it is how you view them that matters, and how you can make them to suit your own needs.<br><br>Do they need a conscience? I would suppose so, and yes they strong need one. They seem the same facts and logic as us, but only a conscience might be expected to convince them of the value, or the wrongeness of a certain set of acts. It is worthless to show sheer facts 53 million deaths and killings to Stalin if he thought that it was logical for mankind's future (and his own rememberance).<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Please be a little bit less naive.[/quote]<br><br>Before you delve into personal attacks, consider the following:<br></div><div class="quote_body">[quote]For clear and immediate examples.... open up the newspapers and read about the suicide bombers. </div></blockquote>Hmm... anybody ever read about the stories about the thousands of child laborers who starve, die and remain poor in third world countries every year to feed our capitalist demands for petty material goods?<br><br>How about our greatest medical advances in the petty things of life and our refusal to provide the proper research, care and supplies to the real medical problems that are really affecting the world. What about our opening up of sexual freedoms that had pretty much made the exploitation of youth in such a area acceptable pratice as long as you don't get caught. Who is to be the judge of them?<br><br>If humankind has come up with a better way of running the world on it's own, I have yet to see it. But I shall not delve into one-upmanship, just that I found your statement extremely shallow and naive. To suppose the religion and faith is the root of all human ignorance and evils is yet another naive statement. And I doubt it was made with any 'good' intentions for humanity at all.<br><br>Do open up your eyes a little. Seeing just one kind of evil is quite different from seeing it all.<br><br>Could you please learn a little humility and refrain from making outlandish arguments? Do remember that the things being said here are of value beyond sheer argument, and they deserve a proper amount of respect. You might also learn something.</div>
