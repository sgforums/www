Unfortunately from your answers. coming from my perspective, I can see that you have no understanding of certain issues and the biggest of which is: What is Faith in God<br><br>I am not trying to win a debate with you. Search your own heart. Unfortunately I cannot say, you win and I do not know what I am talking about. Otherwise I will say it to make you happy. As far as I can tell are a sincere and honest person. You seem to me a fervent Christian even, ever willing to please God, ever willing to do God's work.<br><br>Unfortunately people do not come into the Kingdom of God by being sincere, honest, loving God and doing God's work. People come into the Kingdom of God by Faith and Faith in God only.</div></blockquote>Let me add one more to your Faith in God, having faith in God does not means you can enter into the Kingdom of God, you must have <strong>the correct faith in God</strong>. In Roman4 (your favorite, about Abraham's faith), Abraham believed in God, being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised, his faith is credited to him as righteousness.<br><br>Orh, here is mine favorite statement (must have repeated it many times already, its my statement of faith)<br><br>Faith in God is to believe whatever God promises, He can and will deliver. It is to trust God who justifies the wicked, trust enough to understand it is not by our works we received justifications and salvation. It is believing Jesus was delivered over to death and raised to life for our justification. Faith enough to believe that when He love us and promised He will never leave us nor forsake us, He really meant it.<br><br>What about good works? The idea and the motivation of behind doing good work (be it charity, bible study, church going Â…etc) is different from what is normally perceived and need to be put into the correct perspective. We can do good works because of the grace from God through Christ, even the desire and the ability to do good works is from Him. Doing good works is a result and not a means, just as not doing it wonÂ’t change one status before God.<br><br>something to think about<br>Personal thoughts, God did not gave us freedom and ability so we can sin, but we can do good works, God did not gave us knowledge and gifts so we can tear others down, but rather they are given  for us to used to build each other up in Christ.<br><br>By the way every Christian have faith simply because God had said He had given us a measure of faith, for a Christian to call another without faith is almost like calling God a liar (and God is no liar), the only thing is, little faith or great faith.<br><br>peace. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>btw, there is no competition here, so no need to have "winner" kind, no prize anyway.</div>
