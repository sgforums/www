For what end nobody can decern, but I've noticed that everytime we get far enough on a topic (and are at the point of exposing it), a certain person abruptly changes it to a whole new different tangent. I am sure many have noted this curious behaviour many times over.<br><br>In all the great differences of stances and ideas (which go from an almost monotheistic belief in science and sheer rationality to determining value, to making mountains out of vague '666' omens, from arguing for Freud's notion that all morality is naturalistic and irrational, to that we ought to behave in a certain moral fashion anyway (despite it being irrational), to arguing that faith should be the solution to anything, back to yet again another monotheistic belief in science), there is nothing to connect them it seems, except a vague personal notion on the person pushing them that he ought to be 'right', 'brave', 'rational' 'new', 'novel' or have an 'answer' to any possible question, everything except having stopped to consider if it was actually <span style="font-style: italic;">true</span>.<br><br>I don't know who's really into self-deception here, but a person who thinks that Freud can coexist with Abraham in notion could quite possibly be taking his sources from <span style="font-style: italic;">everywhere</span> without checking for consistency.</div>

Therefore based on the criteria you have set, there is NO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR the existence of God. However, scientific evidence is only one form of evidence. Your favourite website, Wikipedia has this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_%28law%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_%28law%29</a> sidebar on the right has types of evidence listed as<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Testimony<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Documentary Evidence<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Physical Evidence<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Digital Evidence<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Exculpatory Evidence<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Scientific Evidence<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Demonstrative Evidence<br><br>Therefore, as you can see, Scientific evidence is only one of the many types of evidence. If your only admissible evidence is scientific, then yes, I cannot prove to you that there is a God. So end of argument.<br><br>But based on the other forms/types of evidence, I do believe that there is a God. So it is my perogative to state to all that, and in accordance to your simple question: Yes I believe in all my heart and all my soul that there is a God. I want to emphasis on the phrase "MY PEROGATIVE". Because it my perogative to look at all evidences. Because it is my perogative to not to only look at ONE aspect of evidences.....<br><br>Just like it is YOUR PEROGATIVE to look at ONLY ONE FORM of evidence and keeps harping and harping about it, like a broken record.<br><br>I study the Bible to<br>Gain knowledge of God,<br>Gain understanding of historical times,<br>Gain insights of future events,<br><br>Gain useful time when I have nothing better to do...<br><br>List is not exhaustive, as it depends from person to person, in case you also have a bone to pick with it.<br><br>I have been called many names before, but none of those matter.... whether I am brave or honest is totally irrelevant to this thread, but in all graciousness, I will take it as a compliment and ignore your normal sarcasm.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span class="small">Forgot one thing - do you believe in love? just wondering..... I can't prove it either, but I keep coming back to the same house each day, interacting to the same people.... and sometimes these people annoyed the hell out of me, but I still come back.... is it love?</span></span></div>
