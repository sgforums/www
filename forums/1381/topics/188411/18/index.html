If you say that love cannot be proven from scientific evidence and is only experiential, then why can't God be experiential.... therefore, firstly, you have no right to question anybody for believing in God and you also have no right to ask for scientific evidence. <strong>THIS POINT CAN OFFICIALLY BE PUT TO REST IMMEDIATELY!</strong><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by casino_king:</div><div class="quote_body">God is only interested in Christians or is God interested in mankind? Based on that statement I have to conclude that you think you have Faith in God but you don't. You probably read a lot and did lots of bible study to try to understand faith. Unless you have Faith in God, you know nothing.</div></blockquote>There is no way you can conclude on what kind of faith I have in God, and whatever you think you have concluded is totally irrelevant to me. And guess what.... wrong again, I do not participate in lots of Bible study. In fact I have not been in a Bible study for years. My faith in God rest on what I have found reading secular materials, cross-referencing with what I know from reading the Bible on my own (which is not Bible study in itself)..... In fact, I absolute dislike the close-mindedness of a BS group.<br><br>.... so you think you know a lot about me.... that's a laugh!</div>
