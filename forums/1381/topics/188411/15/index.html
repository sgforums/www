            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by SingaporeTyrannosaur:<br><strong><br><br>Oddly enough I already answered you a long time ago, please refer to a few posts back.<br><br>But it seems that you are unable to do anything but ask questions, had you chosen to at least taken a little bit of time to answer things might be more productive. But since to jolt your memory and to destroy the myth of your question not being answered, I thus refer you to:<br><br>[b]<span style="font-style: italic;">Arguing down on line, while internally consistent, does not mean your logic would be consistent when finally exposed to all of logicdom.<br><br>You asked a question if we truly believed with everything that there was only one God, then how can there be a right and wrong God?<br><br>Simply put there isn't- there is only one correct notion of God that everybody should (and I believe will) finally believe in the end. The real debate is over which notions of God get as closer to this absolute.<br><br>And in this you seem to have it mixed up somehow that wanting to hold a notion for a particular monotheism destroys theism itself, which is thinly argued out in your arguments on people co-opting ideas and writing books.<br><br>In the end views on a subject are views from a prespective, but certainly it cannot be said that all views are equal, but rather to be judged by the absolute itself. The very fact there is debate is because there is an absolute to be argued over in the first place, and the fight is all about if this or that view is better at grasping this absolute.<br><br>In the end your stance is self-defeating in the end. To accept truth claims as all equally valid would be to dissolve the absolute itself. It is as good as saying nothing by saying alot.<br><br>And another thing I don't quite get why you don't seem to get. Just because I may be of an opposing point of view with another person does not mean that I will have to be totally opposed to them. As far as I am concerned I am only in opposition when the first principle of non-contradiction is concerned. We will oppose when one says that Jesus was just a prophet while we see Him as God. We will oppose when they think that He never died on the cross while we think he did.<br><br>All the same we would agree if we both think that there is only one true God seperate from his creation as opposed to polytheism and pantheism. All the same we would hold the same view if we believed that He created all that we can observed.<br><br>That is not hard to understand at all, what is hard to understand is that while you appeal to the winds of logic at one moment, telling us to watch for contradictions in our own logic, the very next you decry objective logic itself by suggesting that to make an absolute truth claim destroys truth itself.<br><br>I believe wrong does not create or exist to itself, it is simply an lack of right. Right can exist without wrong but wrong cannot without some right to make it the way it is, that part is clear to me. So to answer your question, yes we do believe there is One God, and in no way that belief creates an paradox of 'how-can-there-be-a-right-and-wrong-god'... the paradox as it is, is purely imaginary and can only happen when one decides to abandon first principles (and oddly enough use them to construct some other arguments for the paradox). </span></strong><br><br>To make it simpler for you to understand, I put it to you as this:<br><br>1) That your very question is a logical incongruity when tested against first principles. Unfortunately you cannot deny first principles<br><br>2) It is this incongruity that renders your question largely illogical, but yet I have tackled it in it's logical form. And the conclusion is largely as this: The notion of One God is perfectly logically (as a concept) sound.<br><br>3) Your orginal question is akin to asking: 'If there is only one answer, how can there be a wrong and right answer?' So let me answer you this:<br><br>We can logically believe there is only One God<br><br>-The right God is this One God<br><br>-And the wrong god is not this one God... in fact, it can't be said to be even a God at all. In that sense, no wrong 'Gods' exist but fallacies elevated to the level of them being God, but yet that does not make them God at all.<br><br>Apparently you know the solution to this very question yourself, but it seems you are reluctant to answer anything at all.<br><br>As apologists of old have pointed out, it's a question largely of nonsense and a failure to understand certain first principles. Garbage in, garbage out.<br><br>Let me alert you to another principle, as much as I do not approve of people mocking you, let me put it to you that it is very much deserved should you choose to go on this way. Obviously you have been putting out much nonsense as I can see from the way you are answering less and less and hoping to get by by shooing questions.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Now ask yourself this, what is the point of all this except to tire everybody with wild goose chases and feel better about yourself? Are you sure you are even living up to the standards of intellectual honesty, fair debate and scientific method you so confidenty touted when you first came in?<br><br>From what I have seen, people in here have been very patient and tolorent of your behaviour and sharp (and often unwarranted) attacks. I suspect you know you have been beaten in many areas fair and square, and pushing the issue will not make your case stronger at all. In any case, pushing about mostly-nonsensical questions and notions does neither you or me much good.<br><br>I suggest you leave here for a moment, go do your research, come up with a cohorent worldview, and then bring it back here for debate. Until you can do that, you have no true right to speak here at all except by the grace of others who have so kindly decided to take you like a kind teacher takes in a wayward pupil.</span><br><br>[/b]</blockquote>I know you did but I was more interested in what that guy who made that post was going to say. Well it turns out he was not serious.<br><br>Let's say I am Abraham and have nothing but idols around me. How then do I make that leap and put my faith in GOD? Just because it was never written down does it mean that there were none other than Abraham?<br><br>Are the "false Gods" just notions of God?<br><br>The Hindus put it nicely, they are manifestations of God. So if God is manifested in a tree, they worship that tree as God. That is pantheism, God is everywhere. Where they went arwy is that indeed God is everywhere and you do need need God to be manifested and worship the objects.<br><br>The error as far as I can see is that they do not worship God as GOD. If one worships God as GOD, one cannot be wrong as indeed there is only one God.<br><br>If one puts his faith in GOD, then one cannot be wrong as there is only one GOD. Next we look at the Jews.</div>
