According to Freud, the consequence of not obeying our conscience is "guilt," which can be a factor in the development of neurosis. Click HERE</a></blockquote>Please bear with my long post.<br><br>Interesting you should mention Freud, but I wonder if you have considered the implications of the stance you are taking.<br><br>Firstly Freud often argues from a position that is not unlike the religious point of view, the difference is that he offers a <span style="font-style: italic;">materialist</span> alternative to many of the things that humans might consider to be desires placed in us by something beyond. Let's admit for once that he has built up a very convincing case. But there is a large problem in wanting to adopt this view:<br><br>In Freud's point of view everything we do (including me typing this reply now) is simply a suppressed and edited version of the sex drive (all actions are done for the ultimate sake of sex), indeed as you have quoted Freud arguing that even such things that gives a person a 'moral' compass all simply come from the superego... then indeed morality and guilt are just things that are totally naturalistic and can (and should) be controlled by the application of neurological suggestion and science.<br><br>Freud of course, is arguing from a position that there is no such thing as traditional morality, they are all simply guises of the ego and sex drive. The crux of his argument rests totally on the notion that things we consider above us like conscience and morality have <span style="font-style: italic;">nothing else</span> but natualistic and nonrational origins, and hence we cannot consider them to be rational or worth listening to at all.<br><br>Just as one considers another person's pacifism to be irrational if it is simply based on cowardice, or another person's argument for the value of properity invalid because he is simply loves his riches to an irrational extent. Seemingly rational causes are rejected if they come from irrational causes. Freud attacks traditional morality on these grounds (that they come from irrational causes), with wide success.<br><br>Now the problem is this, if our conscience is really a product of the superego and simply a perverted sex drive kind of thing... why <span style="font-style: italic;">should</span> we listen to it at all? It is not any more rational then my liking for chee chong fun or some other kind of food. If Freud's argument was indeed correct, then the implication is that there was no need to listen to the conscience at all, since it is a naturalistic process, another kind of raw material subject to our desires to change it... rather then us being a slave to it and the guilt it produces.<br><br>Firstly I'm not sure you might be tempted to buy such an implication, because while it may be tempting to think of conscience as naturalistic... yet we insist on not putting naturalistic conclusions to it. If I kill another person's family and my conscience pricks me, I could just dismiss it as some trick of the mind that my parents put in me when I was a child. Indeed in Freud's universe there is no right and wrong, and I'm not sure you would buy it. Being classified as intelligent apes is one thing, but considering ourselves as <span style="font-style: italic;">nothing but </span>intelligent apes is yet another. The distinction is important to make.<br><br>Now it is obvious that we are creatures of flesh and blood, and obviously to work in us such a thing as a conscience has to be applied in the physical mind in some areas or another (some areas of the mind have been mapped to handle our notion of right and wrong), and of course the physical mind has probably to be taught in some ways to exercise this notion as well. But one suspects it might be folly to consider that the sense of conscience is <span style="font-style: italic;">nothing but</span> these activations and movements of atoms in the brain and the nursery. One might as well denounce maths as activations of the brain, or running as no more meaingful then the moving of limbs. Obviously they are not!<br><br>It seems to me that in the activation of conscience we are grasping (or trying to grasp) some higher universal law. And the important thing is that we seem to, and in fact must believe that this higher universal law is <span style="font-style: italic;">absolute</span>, and applies to all beings... and somehow we must listen to it.<br><br>C.S. Lewis noted that a lot of dogs don't understand pointing. They may see the finger pointing but don't get what it is about. They may sniff the finger or lick it. But the dog sees and experience the same facts as we do... in fact the dog's world is often all facts and very little understand of how they work (except in doggy notions). Now his concern was that we were encouraging such a doglike mind in regarding science, having all the facts but never really considering how to put them together, except in a very doglike way. Freud might have sucessfully decoded (though many scientists disagree with him on the idea that ego and sex are responsible for all behaviour) the physcial facts behind the conscience... but he might have very well missed much of what it's about.<br><br>I hope you consider this.<br></div>

One person can feel a moral duty to go to war, another can feel a moral duty to avoid war under any circumstances. Click HERE</a></strong></blockquote>What you note is true, but have you considered why? Won't a moments debate on right and wrong with anybody reveal the answer to this?<br><br>What you have noted seems not to me as the lack of a cohorent conscience in the human psyche, but rather the notion that to a great extent, many if not <span style="font-style: italic;">most</span> people believe that there is a conscience that needs appealing to.<br><br>Firstly it seems to me that conscience is some kind of a need (Freud might term it guilt avoidance but I think it's much more then just that), and you are right to say that it probably has naturalistic and genetic and biological basis in the human mind.<br><br>But obviously what I will disagree is on the notion that conscience is <span style="font-style: italic;">just</span> that, which seems to me a doglike way of looking at things. The finger extends to the dog and it only understands that, but it might miss out the fact that the whole point of the finger extending was to be to point to some object the master wanted it to pick up. I fear yet again it is this mindset we are taking.<br><br>First and foremost, I do not have any problems with the notion that conscience needs naturalistic renforcement, for after all we are also physical animals that need physical means. Even prayer must be done in a state of mind and body and worship involves the physical. This is so obvious it almost needs no statement.<br><br>The renforcement of the conscience through moral codes, taboos and laws set up in cultures is needed if anybody were to become a proper person of morality. But to argue that conscience and morality do not exist because of this is tatamount to arguing that something like eating food is equally vaporous and irrational. Hunger is obviously a biological response, and the ways in which it is met differs based on various cultures and imprinting. Some people like sweet, others salty. From the hamburger to the mee pok.<br><br>But yet again we realize that in the long run, some kinds of eating are not as <span style="font-style: italic;">proper</span> as others. Some people might be by virtue of upbringing come to eat nothing but junk food and others might do otherwise. One only needs to take a step back to realize that eating actually applies to one <span style="font-style: italic;">absolute</span> universal meta-law of hunger for all humans, and that different's individuals senses of eating either come closer, or further to that ultimate standard, and that ultimate standard cannot be defined by humans, but only found through their sense of eating.<br><br>It would be odd if the conscience had no basis in reality beyond simple physical alterations of sheer matter. Because this would mean saying that in effect it is an illusion, and not a sense that allows us to realize the reality of a kind of law not unlike heat and light which our skin and eyes discover. It seems to me that the conscience is yet again a sense of morality, and a morality that humans can only discover and not alter. Yes, morality may be subjective to humans, but this subjectiveness is perceptions of it's absolute nature, and does nothing to say that all points of view are equally valid unless they appeal to the metalaw in some way.</div>

Hmm, I hope you realize what you are saying, which is just another way of saying 'competence of conscience'. A man does not set traps in the cellar if he does not believe that there are any rats in there, but he does if he does believe. That is a competence of exercising basic conscience.<br><br>It is not my belief that logic can be divorced from conscience... in fact looking into all our conscience-promptings one can see a higher logic. In fact it is often conscience that serves as a help against lower-logic functions. For example I may have a logic to preserve my own life from any risk but yet there is another logic (knowing I am a strong swimmer) to save a man from drowning. Now what is the more logical choice?<br><br>It seems that the sense of conscience guides me to choose between my logics, as a kind of buffer against basic logical reasoning by appealing to a higher reasoning that I cannot decern, but yet is entirely logical.<br><br>It would be dangerous to suggest that higher logics are of no consquence to us if we cannot percieve them, which is the same as saying that if we have no inking of the law of gravity at all it is quite alright to jump off a building.<br><br>Unfortunately what sometimes one is suggesting that there should be no decider of our actions beyond what we can observe. Which would be very dangerous. If I view man as just a raw material, and many of my instincts of right and wrong subject to change because they are just instincts... then anything could happen. I could quote a few great examples.<br><br><blockquote>My beef with religion is that it is clinging on to dogma. Worse of all, dogma developed thousand of years ago; <strong>for daily living</strong></blockquote>I am never sure if Christianity was meant to be lived out on dogma... is that an effect of humans or the faith itself? True Christians in a sense I have yet to seen to be the kind that are domgatic about anything, and the truths they cling to are because of personal conviction (like you suggested as a way to live life) instead of 'because the church said so'.<br><br>And unfortunately if one studies paleontology, you will know there is plenty of dogma in science as well. In fact sometimes very few 'scientific' people actually pratice the true scientific method (until some revolution comes about), but does it falsify the whole concept of science?
