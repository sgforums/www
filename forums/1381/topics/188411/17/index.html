Your long post only shows one thing very clearly, you do not have FAITH in GOD, some form of God, yes, that makes you an idol worshipper on par with the seekers in Temples and Churches and Mosques. </blockquote>Whoever said we were judging GOD. What I am telling you is that this is what GOD is <span style="font-style: italic;">telling</span> us about Himself. And how do I know this? Besides apologetical notions and reason there is an element of faith. Nobody slaps ideas of God onto Him for fun, and there's a compelling reason why.<br><br>And as I've said, I do not worship my idea of God, I worship God Himself. The ideas are there simply because as a matter of first principles, one needs to have ideas about something before He can ever start to do anything about it.<br><br>To walk on the floor, I first have to have the notion that the very floor is there in the first place. Maybe there are some people who demand that we should always trust in the FLOOR and not have any ideas or any form of walking on the floor would not be true walking. Which is nonsense.<br><br>What's more amazing, you can't possibly have any point, stance, or case to make if you didn't have any ideas of God at all. What's odd is that as much as you claim that one should not have any ideas of God, you seem to be forming a very large one of Him yourself, and making it into dogma.<br><br><blockquote>THE people who cannot put their Faith in God unless they have a "notion" of God whether that notion is in the form of a statue or in the form of "intellectual " idols.... or to use your own words, "a logical need to know at least something about God, " </blockquote>I have noticed you would like to divorce faith from reason. Unfortunately a slight examination into the matter reveals that they are pretty much intertwined.<br><br>Go read a little on what some person in the bible writes on what faith is. It's quite different from sheer belief, belief is a result of faith, but faith itself is not belief any more then your body exists soley for notion.<br><br><blockquote><br>I let you on a secret. Does not disqualify you as far as God is concern, only that you have missed out on the fullness of FAITH in GOD. So what is FAITH in GOD?</blockquote>Let me let you in on a secret. One cannot say to have any objective fullness when one destroys objectivity itself.<br><br>One might as well say it is equally as wholesome to worship the devil, for he is equally unknown to us as God, why let our ideas of this dabolical foe get in our way?</div>

You can only experience it when you have a relationship with that person.<br><br>God is only interested in Christians or is God interested in mankind? Based on that statement I have to conclude that you think you have Faith in God but you don't. You probably read a lot and did lots of bible study to try to understand faith.
