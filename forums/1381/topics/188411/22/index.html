            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Since you say you are a non  Christian....<br><br>Just to clear up your mind. The Jews believed that the way to know God is only possible if you are a good person. It is by "works;" doing good and following the law.<br><br>Jesus came along and reminded everybody that it is by Faith and Faith alone.<br><br>But the Christian nowadays have gone back to pre Jesus times and insist that the way to know God is by being a good person.<br><br>To be considered a good person, you "believe" Jesus sacrificed himself for you. It is still the "I must be a good person to know God" Jewish beliefs with a twist; nevertheless it is the same "I must be a good person to know God."<br><br>You can see the problem immediately because every Christian continues to sin. There is also the issue of how good is good enough? During Jesus times, it was just like what you see during the Taleban rule in Afganistan. Cannot do this and that and women cannot this and that.<br><br>There is no such thing as I sin and as long as I believe in Jesus, it is OK. Try this, go and kill somebody and then say "I belive in Jesus, I believe in Jesus." You think God will come down from "heaven" and tell the judge; hey he believes in Jesus, let him go?" You will hang for sure if you get caught.<br><br>You will get your just deserts if you sin.<br><br>On the other hand don't imagine for a moment that the way to know God is by getting rid of sin (whether by following the law or believing in Jesus.) It is by Faith in God. Only people who have come to know God by faith will tel you this. In some chuches they go so far as to preach prosperity. It is selling something that people want to hear and so the church is packed. Based on what I know, it is nevertheless an abomination to God. You cannot use God's name in vain even if it is to pack people into churches. You are more blessed even if the church is as poor as a church mouse and nobody comes.<br><br>Ask the Christians here to quote you the words of Jesus explaning all the paragraphs above this one.<br><br>Justification by Faith does not refer to "no punishment for sins."<br><br>According to Jewish beliefs; you cannot come to know God unless you are "justified." You must have the qualifications. It refers to the beliefs that to know God you need to be a good person. To be a good person you must follow the LAW. To be justified, you must fufill the LAW. This is what Jesus ever so politely tried to tell the Jews is in error. They would have none of it. Did you watch Mel Gibson's The Passion of Christ? Well Jesus was willing to die horribly for his stand.<br><br>This is the Gospel of Jesus Christ; that to come to God, to know God, to have a relationship with God; to Enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.... is by Faith in God. Not by being a good person or by fufilling the law (justification by Law) but justification by Faith. Faith in God.<br><br>Jesus died a horrible death to announce His Gospel to the world and His disciples went all the way back to undo His sacrifice and preach their own gospel; you must be a good person before you can know God. Instead of you must have Faith in God before you can enter into God's Kingdom.<br><br>The term "justification ' by faith is for the Jews to understand, not for you. You only need to know that Faith is the key to enter into the kingdom of God.<br><br>So while some Christians get it, that to know God is by Faith and not by the beliefs that you must be a good person either by following the law or believing in Jesus, others think that as long as they are good people (by believing in Jesus' sacrifice) that's it. They then go about doing Christian activities and never enter into the Kingdom of God.<br><br>The Jews during Jesus times knew exactly what Jesus was trying to say and they rejected it. The Christians nowadays are just "blur." They live their lives exactly like you, a non christian, not having a relationship with God. They do a lot of Christian activities, everything except having a relationship with God. most of them as I can see anyway. Not all of them.<br><br>Simply put,<br><br>Sin will bring you your just desserts whether you believe or not; whether you know God (have a relationship with God) or not.<br><br>Faith is what you need, to come to know God and for a relationship with God.<br><br>You will notice that what I have just said does not say anything about God other than you need faith to get to know God. There is only one God. Read my previous few posts. Knowing God is entering into the kingdom of God, here and now and not after you die.<br><br>The focus of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is Faith in God. Not How to become a good person 101 and not How to become prosperous 101. The Christians in Singaporeans resort to these aims because, like Jesus said, Â“It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man (meaning most Singaporeans) to enter the kingdom of GodÂ” (Matthew 19:24. Similar verses are in Mark 10:25 and Luke 18:25).<br><br>Do you want a relationship with God? That is entirely up to you. If you want it, want to "enter into the Kingdon of God," only Faith will get you there. So what remains is:<br><strong>What is Faith in God?</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aye, Eng, don't take his bait lah. It's making the thread boliao. Just because a person is insane (and entertaining) does not mean it is right to monkey around with him. All the same I find it morally wrong to make a fool of a fool for fool's sake.<br><br>Anyway all I feel the need to raise up is that the faith described in Casinoism is quite different from the faith Christians actually believe in. Martin Luther's <span style="font-style: italic;">sola fide</span> is quite different from Casinoism's <span style="font-style: italic;">sola fide</span>. For indeed when Luther uttered it he uttered it for a purpose, while Casinoism's <span style="font-style: italic;">sola fide</span> is just that, without anything to bear upon it. How this form of <span style="font-style: italic;">sola fide</span> for <span style="font-style: italic;">sola fide's</span> sake can ever lead to any form of morality is uncertain.<br><br>Whatever it is, it's certainly not Christian theology by any measure nor as I believe a fair and logical look at the verse he had quoted. Calvinism might be pardoned, for at least there was a logical insistence on it that lurks in the logical mind run wild. Casinoism however, starts straight from the nullity of nonsense and jumps straight into its own infinite circle, demanding that by virtue of roundness this small baseball of self-contained logic be considered the world (which it certainly is not). Any truth it might have dragged along with it simply a matter of accidents and the first principle and all rubbish at one point must come from sense.<br><br>Fustratingly however, due to his insistence of ignoring logic, I see little point in trying to prove this point to him, but rather I shall aspire to prove it to others. It may by very well in his folly he exposes the actual truth for others to see, for of course if he didn't highlight the issue it might have been ignored by others.</div>

Maybe it is only my own perception but I ask a few more difficult questions the people here tend to become confused or unsure.<br><br>Which is alright but then they quickly assume that I am out to attack them. i mean, I expect better right? If I challenge you with difficult questions, then you come back with proper answers and not assume that I am blindly attacking you right?<br><br>You go back and read all my posts, except for those I call people monkeys; where did I blindly tear down people's answers with baseless accusations?<br><br>I do the same to the Buddhists in their forums. I ask them difficult questions. Other than one or 2 individuals who just want to flame me, they tend to take my questions seriously. They do not jump to conclusion that I am blindly attacking them.<br><br><a href="http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=191453&amp;page=2" rel="nofollow">Like here, they seem to be stuck. I assume that they are trying to find the best answer. At least they don't start asking stupid meaningless questions back at me.</a><br><br>I don't assume that my answer is the perfect answer but I am willing to stand by it and please try to tear it apart also.
