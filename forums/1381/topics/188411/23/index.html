            <div class='col-md body'>My comments below in <span style="color: green;">green</span>, pls note that these are my personal comments, you have to decide whether you want to accept them or counter with your own comments, either way, its your choice. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by casino_king:<br>[b]Since you say you are a non  Christian....<br><br>Just to clear up your mind. The Jews believed that the way to know God is by "works;" doing good and following the law.<br><span style="color: green;">Jewish traditions teaches this, Jews are chosen by God to be His people, hence its being a Jew and not by works, but they do believe they have to follows a fixed set of traditions/works to remain blessed</span><br>Jesus came along and reminded everybody that it is by Faith and Faith alone.<br><span style="color: green;">This is not what Jesus comes to do, He comes to fulfills the requirements of the Law, paid the penalty of our sins with His suffering/death, and provide for us the basis to receive salvations from God through grace by faith in Him (Christ).<br>This is not really a good example, but will do till I can think of something better,<br>A loaf of bread, how do you know its ok to eat<br>Believe = ok I believe its ok<br>Faith = Go take a bite<br>basis of this action? perhaps the expiry dates shows its current ...etc<br></span><br>But the Christian nowadays have gone back to pre Jesus times and insist that the way to know God is by being a good person.<br><span style="color: green;">its in the wrong sequence, we want to be a good person because we know God, not the other way round. We are first saved by faith in Christ Jesus, aparts from works, good works is just a "by product" that results after we git saved.</span><br>To be considered a good person, you "believe" Jesus sacrificed himself for you. It is still the "I must be a good person to know God" Jewish beliefs with a twist; nevertheless it is the same "I must be a good person to know God."<br><span style="color: green;">see my comment above</span><br>You can see the problem immediately because every Christian continues to sin. There is also the issue of how good is good enough? During Jesus times, it was just like what you see during the Taleban rule in Afganistan. Cannot do this and that and women cannot this and that.<br><span style="color: green;">yes, we do continue to sin/make mistake, if you mean good enough is regarding good enough to be save? then no, by our own works, we will never be good enough, that's why the basis of our salvation is not our own good works, by perfect work of Christ</span><br>There is no such thing as I sin and as long as I believe in Jesus, it is OK. Try this, go and kill somebody and then say "I belive in Jesus, I believe in Jesus." You think God will come down from "heaven" and tell the judge; hey he believes in Jesus, let him go?" You will hang for sure if you get caught.<br><span style="color: green;">its never ok to sin, your concience will condemn you first. But because our salvation is based on Christ's perfectness, we can repent, receive forgiveness and move on with life.<br>If the physical law is broken? sure, when caught, sure kenna from the judge, but on the other hand, do you think a normal sane person will go around want to kill someone? </span><br>You will get your just deserts if you sin.<br><span style="color: green;">agree, as far as human law is concern</span><br>On the other hand don't imagine for a moment that the way to know God is by getting rid of sin (whether by following the law or believing in Jesus.) It is by Faith in God. Only people who have come to know God by faith will tel you this. In some chuches they go so far as to preach prosperity. It is selling something that people want to hear and so the church is packed. Based on what I know, it is nevertheless an abomination to God. You cannot use God's name in vain even if it is to pack people into churches. You are more blessed even if the church is as poor as a church mouse and nobody comes.<br><span style="color: green;">If we can get rid of our own sin/follow the law, then we don't need Jesus, its precisely we cannot do these, that we need Jesus.<br>ponder this "Seek the giver and the gifts will run after you, seek the gifts and they will run away from you"</span><br>Ask the Christians here to quote you the words of Jesus explaning all the paragraphs above this one.<br><br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>con't from previous post<br><blockquote><br>Justification by Faith does not refer to "no punishment for sins."<br><span style="color: green;">depends on where your faith is, if this is in the finished work of Christ, then there will be no condemnation as far as God is concern.<br>another bad example, have to start thinking of better ones.<br>My daughter make mistake, I will not condemn her, but I may still spank her, because I loved her and wanted her to realise her mistake.<br></span><br>According to Jewish beliefs; you cannot come to know God unless you are "justified." You must have the qualifications. It refers to the beliefs that to know God you need to be a good person. To be a good person you must follow the LAW. To be justified, you must fufill the LAW. This is what Jesus ever so politely tried to tell the Jews is in error. They would have none of it. Did you watch Mel Gibson's The Passion of Christ? Well Jesus was willing to die horribly for his stand.<br><span style="color: green;">Jesus' death is not about making a statement, He do this to in order to redeem us from the penalty of our sins</span><br>This is the Gospel of Jesus Christ; that to come to God, to know God, to have a relationship with God; to Enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.... is by Faith in God. Not by being a good person or by fufilling the law (justification by Law) but justification by Faith. Faith in God.<br>color=green]actually its more like "we receive justification by grace from God through faith in Christ Jesus" [/color]<br>Jesus died a horrible death to announce His Gospel to the world and His disciples went all the way back to undo His sacrifice and preach their own gospel; you must be a good person before you can know God. Instead of you must have Faith in God before you can enter into God's Kingdom.<br><span style="color: green;">this is not the message in the NT, its has always been Justication by grace though faith in Christ Jesus. allow me to say this again, Good works cannot save you, only Faith in Christ can</span><br>The term "justification ' by faith is for the Jews to understand, not for you. You only need to know that Faith is the key to enter into the kingdom of God.<br><span style="color: green;">may not be fully accurate, but this is the best I can think of, If Faith is the key, then Christ is the gate, you need to put your faith in Christ to get to God</span><br>So while some Christians get it, that to know God is by Faith and not by the beliefs that you must be a good person either by following the law or believing in Jesus, others think that as long as they are good people (by believing in Jesus' sacrifice) that's it. They then go about doing Christian activities and never enter into the Kingdom of God.<br><span style="color: green;">need some pondering, Christians are people who by choice had put their faith in Christ, by believing in Jesus' sacrifical death for our sins. on the other hand, merely doing christian activities and going to church does not make one a person.</span><br>The Jews during Jesus times knew exactly what Jesus was trying to say and they rejected it. The Christians nowadays are just "blur." They live their lives exactly like you, a non christian, not having a relationship with God. They do a lot of Christian activities, everything except having a relationship with God. most of them as I can see anyway. Not all of them.<br><br>Simply put,<br><br>Sin will bring you your just desserts whether you believe or not; whether you know God (have a relationship with God) or not.<br><br>Faith is what you need, to come to know God and for a relationship with God.<br><span style="color: green;">which is why we do Bible Study, cause we treasured this relationship with God, Christ, Holy Spirit</span><br>You will notice that what I have just said does not say anything about God other than you need faith to get to know God. There is only one God. Read my previous few posts. Knowing God is entering into the kingdom of God, here and now and not after you die.<br><br>The focus of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is Faith in God. Not How to become a good person 101 and not How to become prosperous 101. The Christians in Singaporeans resort to these aims because, like Jesus said, Â“It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man (meaning most Singaporeans) to enter the kingdom of GodÂ” (Matthew 19:24. Similar verses are in Mark 10:25 and Luke 18:25).<br><br>Do you want a relationship with God? That is entirely up to you. If you want it, want to "enter into the Kingdon of God," only Faith will get you there. So what remains is:<br><strong>What is Faith in God?</strong>[/b]<br><span style="color: green;">only one comment on this question, having faith in God is one thing, knowing the why/what is the basis of this action is also important, else it will be what we would normally refer to as "blind faith"</span></blockquote></div>

Because your way of talking has risen some rather curious questions.<br><br>Anyway I hope you do realize that it is a scientific impossibility to merely analyse what is written on each post without guessing each other motives. Being an observer is quite impossible, for in writing each post your motives will be driving what is being written. So even if you don't speak your motives openly, they tend to come out anyway the moment you write. What is lacking is not a picture of your motives, but the lack of clarification on your side to what that picture may be.<br><br>Clearly we all don't speak from a void, and we don't speak into one too.<br><br>The only difference is that people tend to get curious when you insist on not talking about it, when it seems quite obvious you have an motive to be here.<br><br>Simply put, what I'm saying here is that you'll contribute to a lot of goodwill in here if you simply state where you are coming from. If you are an athiest then state it so openly from the start, if you are a theist, then so be it. I can't see how it won't help debate, for the more information one has the better the debate can be.<br><br>After all the most productive debates all start when both parties start with a clear point of view. It sets up an area of honesty where the cards are laid out on the table. Being evasive is not helping the issue, and instead contributes to the aura of paranoia and misconception.<br><br>And more importantly, if you don't believe in anything at all you won't have any right to debate, for only those who hold the creed and play the game ought to be the ones who fight and speak for it.<br><br>Unless of course, you are trying to avoid a proper open debate, which I am not willing to think so yet. But I don't know what to believe from the amount of monkey posts.<br><br>In the light of this, I would suggest a very simple question.<br><br>Are you athiest, agnostic, or thiestic?<br></div>
