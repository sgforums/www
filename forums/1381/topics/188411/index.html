We cannot be saved by law keeping or good works. When we accept Christ Jesus, we put on His robe of righeousness on us, so that we are completely covered under the blood of Jesus. When God sees us, He sees Jesus' blood which is the new covenant shed for us for the forgiveness of our sins. Thank God.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First, let me stress on this...<br><br>We received the gift salvation from God, by grace, thought the finished work of Christ. Our good works does not and is not able to contribute one single bit to this, neither is our lack of good works able to deduct anything.<br>The only reason we do and is able to do good works is by the grace of God (so no one can boast about this).<br><br>Want to obey the laws or the ten commandments? whenever one want to do this, one must be clear of why and how we should do this.<br><br>The Ten Commandments given to the Jews via Moses by God is Perfect, and it demands perfect and complete obedience, meaning, must follow and obey fully all of them, and not just fully, but must be done in a perfect manner.<br><br>By our own strength, we can never fully and completely follow the law or the Ten commandments, that is why Jesus have to come and fulfill them for us, and through His act of obedience, the full requirement of the Law is fully, completely and perfectly fulfilled.<br><br>Now that we are no longer living under the Law, but under Grace, does this means we can totally disregard the Law and be lawless?<br>Absolutely not, but what does this living under grace means? Simply its means this, we are to always remembering that our righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ and not by our works/obedence.</div>
