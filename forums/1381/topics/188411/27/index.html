            <div class='col-md body'>Can a person without faith ever say much about it?<br><br>It can say much about what it <span style="font-style: italic;">appears</span> to be from the outside, but move on to comment on the inside of it and it all becomes nonsense. He seeks to tell people what faith is without having it himself, demanding a standard which he knows is quite impossible and useless as a whole, the the hybrid concept of man as a reasonable animal of flesh and spirit that has to start from some form of dogma to get about knowing and ever having faith in God.<br><br>But of course my point was that he never made any sense to begin with, and anyway he is simply creating but another dogma to deal with the concept of God. I deem this minimalistic theism, which if you think about it is as good as no theism at all, or even something worse.<br><br>In any case one does not need to take a second to see that even the examples he did draw (oddly enough without authority for he sought to destroy the very authority of the source he drew his example from) actually mean quite another thing from what he said. I do not think that Abraham or Moses for that example, had perfect, or even CKish faith in God (which is actually no faith at all). What they did demostrate was something else entirely, and the fact that they did fall in the faith at times was something CK left out without so much a whisper (should one be surprised for he only accepts whatever supports his theory), lest it breaks his perfect example.<br><br>Their shortcomings however, are perfectly expected within the Christian conception of faith. If there was a true kind of faith, you would expect things to happen this way. What is a wonder, is that anything can happen at all in CK's concept of faith. To think intelligently you first need the brain, as much as not all brains become intelligent in the end. CK is doing aking to focusing so much on the concept and value of intelligence and finding the concept of a brain repulsive to the notion of intelligence because it is so much more basal.<br><br>If I could approach CK with his own logic the way he uses cannon, declares it noncannon, and then declares what he uses cannon again, I could pretty much twist anything he has ever said to support myself. All I need to do is to pratice the very 'rational', 'scientific' and 'faithful' method of selective ommision, pseudo-intellectualism, circular reasoning, being-the-judge-of-the-universe, and monkey games.<br><br>'Faith is not belief!' CK shouts. If that was true he would have been unable to utter a word worth considering.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>In any case if CK has been arguing hard to divorce faith from dogma, then he has failed miserably so far. So far what he has been enforcing is the notion that having faith <span style="font-style: italic;">creates</span> dogma and concepts... which has been perfectly obvious to anybody bothering to live it out.<br><br>Moses, Elijah and Abraham never supposed they were worthy of ever meeting God in anyway, but they believed that a large part of their relationship involved defending, doing, or advancing the causes of many things that CK would quite vocally reject as dogma, concepts and ideas.<br><br>Elijah was an idealist in a time when everybody was going with whatever 'felt' the most agreeable. Moses passed down the law to us (which by CK's argument would be impossible, especially if a God that deamnds his kind of faith would create dogma to prevent that), Abraham had a very specific and dogmatic mission that he blundered trying to fufill in his own 'faithful' way by using a servant to provide a child. All this it seems, has been dismissed by CK, which is not surprising because no possible evidence against his argument can exist.<br><br>Which is really the argument of a madman. If I believed I was the king of england I could construct many self-contained logics to prove my point. Any attempt to demostrate me wrong I could refute because by my logic it would all fall into place as people trying in some conspiracy to deny me my throne. The logic is internally consistent, and virtually impossible to break into. A madman may regard a baseball as the world because of it's roundness (and they both are), but in the end the baseball is not the world.<br><br>It seems to me that CK has absolute faith in one god, and that god is himself. This is why he deems himself a worthy judge of all reality, needing to pay no heed to common sense and honest logic (they're human concepts and dogma anyway) to even getting his proper examples.<br><br>Is is clear to me that he can accept no other answer except that which appeals to his own brand of <span style="font-style: italic;">universal</span> logic, which on not even a second look, hasn't even begin to be accepted by five people of some sense, let alone being universal at all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's your 'scientific' mind mixing you up. The deciet you created.<br><br>I shall now say why:<br><br>You seem to assume that people who have faith in God claim that faith based on the evidence they have for God.<br><br>You might jolly well have forgotten that these evidences they discovered after they approached science following their conversion of faith to God. A person who is already a Christian may become a scientist later and discover signs in physical evidence that echos of what his faith has already told him, in which case there would be no contradiction at all.<br><br>It would be odd however, that one should demand that all reality be against his faith for his faith to be true, that I believe, is an unreasonable demand that God would not bother with.<br><br>In the same like, I would believe in the concept of my friend John with or without science. Using terms of biology and atoms to describe why he should be valid in the scientific argument. Even if that is taken away I might not disbelieve John at all, for it would be the personal experience, the very thing that I believed in John for in the first place that made me believe.<br><br>So you are correct to say that to believe in God <span style="font-style: italic;">because</span> of science is dangerous, because your faith would then be based on the concept of science and not the eternal and infinite entity. It is no surprise many people became apostates because of science because science has been their god all along, so where it goes where they will go.<br><br>It would be in error however to say that, one cannot come to believe in God <span style="font-style: italic;">through</span> science. How the journey is made, if it is made on correct or wrong notions seems to me irrelevant as long as the person finally reaches God. And I believe that person would not be able to call to God unless God had been calling him all along, and working in all kinds of ways to be known. If such a being was omnipotent and omniscient, using our own inperfect science to reach us is hardly illogical, just that it cannot be done by us...<br><br>Which is my contention in the first place. One seems to assume that faith in God is a personal activity of reaching Him, but it seems to me more of a letting ourselves to react in the right way when He reaches us. Your veto is that our faith should be a certain personal conduct that appeals to this God while rejecting as much as possible any notions that could possibly in error, seems to me a purest veto of sorts based on a human understanding of how faith should ever work in human effort.<br><br>I have but a few notions that I do know. That He is Good (or we shall have no hope or motivation of reaching Him) That He is able (so it can be done) That He loves (or He shall not bother with it). In that sense the person with wrong conceptions of God may jolly well be closer and more faithful then the person who soughts to purify his conceptions of faith in God. In a sense it is about the seeker and what God decides to do with him.<br><br>As for starting with beliefs:<br><br>When I think of Singapore I may get a mental image of Kovan MRT station, but of course I know that is not what Singapore is all about. It is the starting to base ones whole notion of Singapore on Kovan MRT that is the danger. The other danger it seems to me, soley yours... and that is to just focus on the word S.I.N.G.A.P.O.R.E. and to believe in it in lieu of any concepts. Both dangers it seems to me, are not faith in God. Kovan MRT is certainly in Singapore and deserves no dropping in concept when it comes to thinking about Singapore. All the same simply focusing on the shady and cloudy concept of Singapore can't go very wrong at first... but it can't go very right either. Eventually anything that can't go very right will go very wrong.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So said one needs beliefs to have faith, that is something I must state.<br><br>True enough having faith in beliefs in that thing might not be the same as having faith in that thing itself. But if that thing and the belief are the one same thing, having faith in the correct belief would be having faith in the thing.<br><br>It seems you have confused the concept of belief as an action, with belief as a noun.<br><br>I may put my faith in a jar also in the belief that it is unbreakable. Now if the jar breaks and I still put my belief in the concept of unbreakability then my faith has been incongruent with the reality of the jar. But if the jar is unbrekable, then the concept of unbreakability is one and the same with the jar, and when I believe in that jar I ought to believe in its unbreakability.<br><br>The unknowing and unassuming pure faith (as you advertise) also smuggles in one assumption: that God is unknowable. And for the unknowing and unassuming faith to hold true that unknowability of God has to stick with Him. In doing that one has already admitted one preconception of God that one is basing one entire faith-posture on. I do not see it unreasonable why other religions may sought to stick other preconcepts, unless of course, they are not justified.<br><br>There are religions that believe that God is fully knowable (deism), their faith posture would be quite different, but not internally invalid. One needs to consider their positions with logic.</div>

To come into the Kingdom of God, what must you do with all these idols?</blockquote>I must dissent, simply because not all preconceptions are idols and not all idols are preconceptions. Preconceptions may very well end up as idols if they are by themselves are allowed to be counted on beyond their lawful status.<br><br>Hence I must disagree to the statement that 'casting down all idols equals casting down all preconceptions'. And it seems that the very statement of 'casting down all preconceptions' have been taken beyond their lawful logical status.<br><br>Granted the Preconception Improper has to be something that has to be cast down, but the Preconception Proper has to be preserved if one has to have any hope of entering into faith in anything at all. Discovering the Preconception Improper/Proper would then be the work that is cut out for us.<br><br>Avoiding the question by stating that all preconceptions should be cast down is more jargon then fact, for it in itself relies on a preconception that preconceptions are bad.<br><br>I do not for a moment think that faith and first principles were ever seperate, to have faith you will have to have a first principle. Without which no case (logical one at least) can be ever built. It may seem valiant to say a lot of things about this most excellent faith, but at the end of the day it seems to slit it's own throat by commiting the very same mortal sin it accuses other systems of idol-faith of doing, and that is to hold some preconception itself of God, and that is a preconception of the nullity of preknowledge.<br><br>It is only possible to hold your creed if you believe in a suspension of logic, in which case I might point out there is no need, nor value in trying to argue your case here as logical arguments applied to refute or support your case are all equally worthless. In a sense all nonsense held has to be taken <span style="font-style: italic;">sola fides</span> but I don't believe <span style="font-style: italic;">Fides Solo</span> is nonsense.<br><br>Now I am less interested in the question if God is knowable by us mortals then if He has decided to make Himself knowable in certain ways. Of this I believe so and hence I would not be surprised that some things would not contradict what He truly is.<br><br>And as a result, my point and case remains the way it is.<br><br>A rejoinder please.<br><br></div>
