It is to trust God who justifies the wicked, trust enough to understand it is not by our works we received justifications and salvation.

Faith enough to believe that when He love us and promised He will never leave us nor forsake us, He really meant it.<br><br>What about good works? The idea and the motivation of behind doing good work (be it charity, bible study, church going Â…etc) is different from what is normally perceived and need to be put into the correct perspective. We can do good works because of the grace from God through Christ, even the desire and the ability to do good works is from Him. Doing good works is a result and not a means, just as not doing it wonÂ’t change one status before God.<br><br>something to think about<br>Personal thoughts, God did not gave us freedom and ability so we can sin, but we can do good works, God did not gave us knowledge and gifts so we can tear others down, but rather they are given  for us to used to build each other up in Christ.<br><br>By the way every Christian have faith simply because God had said He had given us a measure of faith, for a Christian to call another without faith is almost like calling God a liar (and God is no liar), the only thing is, little faith or great faith.<br><br>peace. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>btw, there is no competition here, so no need to have "winner" kind, no prize anyway.[/b]</blockquote>As for this part here: "Faith in God is to believe whatever God promises, He can and will deliver.

If one refuses to play by the laws of logic there can be no help for him.<br><br>After all, he did say that his personal notion of faith gives the authority to all examples from anywhere to be used. This is the same as saying that I can believe in whatever supports my theory, and reject whatever does not for it is my theory that gives the facts their authority. In fact Casino King seeks not to use the facts to support his theory, but rather his theory to create the facts to support his theory. This is obviously an example of circular reasoning to the most tiresome degree.<br><br>Obviously this is also a waste of time.<br><br>Now there is no need to answer his 'question' of what faith in God is, for people here have aready answered him that many times. Just because he refuses to accept the answer does not mean that they are wrong.<br><br>So there, why don't we all just disregard whatever he says, for he says things of no authority accept himself, but of course we are not under his authority.</div>

You start the relationship through Faith, not beliefs.<br><br>2. When the relationship first starts it will blow your mind but after a while (Obedience is a non issue because) you will be like:<br><br>You: "If I do your this will I get all the bessings and riches in the world?"<br>God: "No, do you still want to do it?"<br><br>What do you think your answer will be? Nothing will be able to tear you away from the love of God.<br><br>What am I talking about?<br><br>Genesis 22:1 <strong>It happened after these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to him, "Abraham!" He said, "Here I am."</strong>You see Abraham talking to God? Not praying, mind you. talking to.<br><br><strong>"It is enough. Now, O Yahweh, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers."  (I King 19:4).</strong> Do you see this person asking God to kill him?<br><br><strong>"What are you doing here, Elijah?"(I King 19:9)</strong> Do you see God talking to this person who wanted to end his own life? If there is anybody who is not worthy for God to talk to, he would be a very good example.<br><br>They have a relationship like that with God through Faith. Do you see any continous beliefs in God there or a relationship?<br><br>I am only giving you these examples because you can find the rest yourself. I am here telling you that God is still the same and will have a relationship like with them, with you. Stop giving yourself excuses that the times are different and so on. Stop giving yourself excuses that you and they are different.<br><br>The only difference is that they had Faith in God and you do not. So what is Faith in God?</div>
