            <div class='col-md body'>Do you believe your own logic? I am not sure I believe you could really dare to put it up to your own tests.<br><br>Arguing down on line, while internally consistent, does not mean your logic would be consistent when finally exposed to all of logicdom.<br><br>You asked a question if we truly believed with everything that there was only one God, then how can there be a right and wrong God?<br><br>Simply put there isn't- there is only <span style="font-style: italic;">one</span> correct notion of God that everybody <span style="font-style: italic;">should</span> (and I believe will) finally believe in the end. The real debate is over which notions of God get as closer to this absolute.<br><br>And in this you seem to have it mixed up somehow that wanting to hold a notion for a particular monotheism destroys theism itself, which is thinly argued out in your arguments on people co-opting ideas and writing books.<br><br>In the end views on a subject are views from a prespective, but certainly it cannot be said that all views are equal, but rather to be judged by the absolute itself. The very fact there is debate is because there is an absolute to be argued over in the first place, and the fight is all about if this or that view is better at grasping this absolute.<br><br>In the end your stance is self-defeating in the end. To accept truth claims as all <span style="font-style: italic;">equally</span> valid would be to dissolve the absolute itself. It is as good as saying nothing by saying alot.<br><br>And another thing I don't quite get why you don't seem to get. Just because I may be of an opposing point of view with another person does not mean that I will have to be <span style="font-style: italic;">totally</span> opposed to them. As far as I am concerned I am only in opposition when the <span style="font-style: italic;">first principle</span> of non-contradiction is concerned. We will oppose when one says that Jesus was just a prophet while we see Him as God. We will oppose when they think that He never died on the cross while we think he did.<br><br>All the same we would agree if we both think that there is only one true God seperate from his creation as opposed to polytheism and pantheism. All the same we would hold the same view if we believed that He created all that we can observed.<br><br>That is not hard to understand at all, what is hard to understand is that while you appeal to the winds of logic at one moment, telling us to watch for contradictions in our own logic, the very next you decry objective logic itself by suggesting that to make an absolute truth claim destroys truth itself.<br><br>I believe wrong does not create or exist to itself, it is simply an lack of right. Right can exist without wrong but wrong cannot without some right to make it the way it is, that part is clear to me. So to answer your question, yes we do believe there is One God, and in no way that belief creates an paradox of 'how-can-there-be-a-right-and-wrong-god'... the paradox as it is, is purely imaginary and can only happen when one decides to abandon first principles (and oddly enough use them to construct some other arguments for the paradox).</div>
