However, I find it a bit too extremely conservative so I moved on to the Methodist church where it is pretty much balanced. However, as I grew in the giftings and talents I believe God given and thank God for it, I find the church, as leadership changes, growing more and more unsupportive of what I am doing and want to do. I decided to leave because while I will be most comfortable in the current church with familiar people, I believe I owe it to God to go to a place where I can continue to grow in the giftings I was blessed with.</div>
