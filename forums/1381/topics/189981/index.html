            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>sorry can't reconcile, grace via works??? if via works, I thought that would be reward? grace is undeserved favor, is it not?<br></blockquote>You are right, grace is undeserved.<br><br>However grace inspired faith and works are the response or that manifestation to that intial grace which is given.<br><br><blockquote><br>INDIVIDUAL SALVATION<br><br>It begins with the grace of God which touches a sinner's heart, and calls him to repentance. <strong>This grace cannot be merited; it proceeds solely from the love and mercy of God. </strong>Man may receive or reject this inspiration of God, he may turn to God or remain in sin. Grace does not constrain man's free will.<br><br>Thus assisted the sinner is disposed for salvation from sin; he believes in the revelation and promises of God, he fears God's justice, hopes in his mercy, trusts that God will be merciful to him for Christ's sake, begins to love God as the source of all justice, hates and detests his sins.<br><br>This disposition is followed by justification itself, which consists not in the mere remission of sins, but in the sanctification and renewal of the inner man by the voluntary reception of God's grace and gifts, whence a man becomes just instead of unjust, a friend instead of a foe and so an heir according to hope of eternal life. This change happens either by reason of a perfect act of charity elicited by a well disposed sinner or by virtue of the Sacrament either of Baptism or of Penance according to the condition of the respective subject laden with sin.  By the merit of the Most Holy Passion through the Holy Spirit, the charity of God is shed abroad in the hearts of those who are justified.<br><br><ul>that the initial grace is truly gratuitous and supernatural;<br>that the human will remains free under the influence of this grace;<br>that man really cooperates in his personal salvation from sin;<br>that by justification man is really made just, and not merely declared or reputed so;<br>that justification and sanctification are only two aspects of the same thing, and not ontologically and chronologically distinct realities;<br>that justification excludes all mortal sin from the soul, so that the just man is no way liable to the sentence of death at God's judgment-seat.</ul><br><br>taken from : <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm</a><br></blockquote><blockquote><br>The Bible and Sacred Tradition goes hand in hand, not the Bible alone.<br>what happen if conflicts between tradition and Bible? </blockquote>Well, from the Catholic point of view, so far Sacred Tradition has not contradicted the Bible. However, I'm sure there are some non-Catholic Christians who'll object to that.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>sorry can't reconcile, grace via works??? if via works, I thought that would be reward? grace is undeserved favor, is it not?</blockquote>Let us first define grace. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia: 'Grace (gratia, Charis), in general, is a supernatural gift of God to intellectual creatures (men, angels) for their eternal salvation, whether the latter be furthered and attained through salutary acts or a state of holiness.'<br><br>We can divide grace into 'actual grace' and 'sanctifying grace'. Sanctifying grace is a supernatural quality which the Sacrament of Baptism confers on the human soul. It sanctifies the soul and elevates her beyond her mere natural abilities, thus enabling her to commune with God. This grace is permanent unless forfeited by mortal sin. Sanctifying grace is sometimes called habitual grace, for it is "habitually" (or constantly) present in the soul.<br><br>Actual grace is a aid given by God for us to carry out a specific good work according to the Divine Will.<br><br>Having defined two forms of grace, I have shown that it therefore is not merely divine favour, but a form of power. What good is grace if this power is not utilized? Can we take it for granted?<br><br><blockquote>what happen if conflicts between tradition and Bible?</blockquote>Sacred Tradition is not be thought of as 'traditions of men', because it is the faith which the Apostles have recieved from Jesus orally. The Bible is important, but not everything is written in it.<br><br>When you speak of 'tradition', what do you refer to?<br></div>
