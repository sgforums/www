            <div class='col-md body'>After few rounds of discussion with Brey, I realize his position is getting more and more untenable. The more he reply, the more wrong I feel he is.<br><br>Here is my argument:<br><br>As a Pharisee of Pharisee, the apostle Shaul must have known the Law of Hashem very well. If the Law is always good, why did Shaul say<br><br><blockquote>Romans 7:12 (NIV)<br><br>11For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death. <span style="color: red;">12So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good. 13Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means!</span> But in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.</blockquote>Why is Shaul associating death with the Law?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Notice Shaul is saying the commandment is putting him to death because of sin. Later Shaul will say everybody is a slave to sin. So how leh? According to Shaul, the solution is found in Yeshua.<br><br>To sound more 'academic' .. what triggered the metamorphosis in Shaul? As one who should know the Law very well, why did he need Yeshua? The prophets before Shaul didn't need Yeshua, so why did Shaul need Yeshua? Well, at least the prophets did not KPKB that the Law is putting them to death because of sin.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe I should start a topic in the style of Brey - What did Shaul know that the prophets don't?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
