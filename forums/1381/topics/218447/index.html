            <div class='col-md body'><br>The apostle Paul couldn't heal Timothy's stomach problem (1 Timothy 5:23) nor could he heal Trophimus at Miletus (2 Timothy 4:20) or Epaphroditus (Philippians 2:25-27).<br><br>Paul spoke of "a bodily illness" he had (Galatians 4:13-15). He also suffered a "thorn in the flesh" which God allowed him to retain (2 Corinthians 12:7-9).<br><br>God certainly allowed Job to go through a time of physical suffering.<br><br>In none of these cases is it stated that the sickness was caused by sin or unbelief.<br><br>Nor did Paul or any of the others act as if they thought their healing was guaranteed in the atonement. They accepted their situations and trusted in God's grace for sustenance.<br><br>It is noteworthy that on one occasion Jesus indicated that sickness could be for the glory of God (John 11:4).<br><br>There are numerous verses in Scripture which reveal that our physical bodies are continuously running down and suffering various ailments. Our present bodies are said to be perishable and weak (1 Corinthians 15:42-44). Paul said "our outer man is decaying" (2 Corinthians 4:16). Death and disease will be a part of the human condition until that time when we receive resurrection bodies that are immune to such frailties (1 Corinthians 15:51-55).<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="small"><br>http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/rfsm-healing.html</span></span></div>

What you do with your forum has nothing to do with anyone else. It just goes to show how "capable" you saw yourself but the reality is: you are not able to handle it, which is exactly what everyone's saying all along.<br><br>Please do the right thing and kill your forum. You can do it by deleting all the post. Alternatively, use it for another purpose. Otherwise it will just be a testimony of your failure.</div>
