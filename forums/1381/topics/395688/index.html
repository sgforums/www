                      30 Sep 2006 The Pope played a leading role in systematic cover-up of 
                      child sex abuse by Roman Catholic priests, according to a shocking documentary screened by BBC. In 2001, he 
                      issued a secret Vatican edict to bishops worldwide, 
                      instructing them to put the Church's interests ahead of child safety. He recommended that rather than reporting sexual abuse to the 
                      relevant legal authorities, bishops should threaten the victims and witnesses if they repeat the allegations with excommunication to keep them quiet.</span></p>

              <dl><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The Truth Commission into Genocide in Canada
                  reveals the systematic rape, torture and
                  murder of tens of thousands of Aboriginal children in church-run residential
                  schools. According to its Secretary, Kevin Annett, a former United Church
                  of Canada minister until fired and expelled for exposing these ugly truths:</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"The government and the multinational corporations
                  wanted the Indian land, and so native children from as young as three years
                  old were forcibly taken from their families and sent to residential schools
                  (including Catholic ones), where they underwent 'acculturation' programs.
                  Between 50,000 to 100,000 ended up dead, murdered by the church.''</span></dt><dt><br></dt><dt><br></dt><dt>NOW BACK TO THE POPE..............</dt><dt><br></dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">200 boys at Milwaukee's St. John School for the
                  Deaf reported decades of Father
                  Lawrence C. Murphy's abuse. They told other priests and three archbishops of Milwaukee. They told two police departments
                  and the district attorney. They used sign language, written affidavits
                  and graphic gestures to show what exactly (he) did to them. </span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Then Cardinal Ratzinger got letters about
                  him in 1996 from Milwaukee's Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland, saying the
                  deaf community needed a response from the Church. He
                  did nothing and Father Murphy died in 1998,
                  he died a priest instead of in prison where felons are sent.</span></dt><dt><br></dt><dt><br></dt><dt>MORE COVER-UPS...........</dt><dt><br></dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Ratzinger also introduced a new Exclusive Competence
                  principle, ordering all child abuse allegations handled by Rome. Former
                  Vatican lawyer Father Tom Doyle explained it saying:</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"What you have here is an explicit written policy
                  to cover up cases of child sexual abuse by the clergy and to punish those
                  who would call attention to these crimes by the churchmen. When abusive
                  priests are discovered, the response has been not to investigate and prosecute
                  but to move them from one place to another. So there's total disregard
                  for the victims and for the fact that you are going to have a whole new
                  crop of (them) in the next place. This is happening all over the world."</span></dt><dt><br></dt><dt><br></dt><dt><br></dt><dt><br></dt><dt><br></dt></dl>
