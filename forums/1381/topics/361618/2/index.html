              <p>Catknight....what you talking about? "real spirit to able to move bla bla bla....that is kingdom of heaven"? What do u mean? Do we even know what are the original teachings of Jesus? (btw, im a Muslim and i believe Jesus as a Prophet of God). The Bibles we have now...are they 100% teachings and words of God and Jesus? Does the Bible tells us how to run a country, to treat orphans, treat our wifes, mothers, children?</p>
              <p>What is this kingdom of heaven we talking about? Fantasy world? I am sorry if i offend any of you coz its not my intention. I too dream of a better and peaceful world where there are no poverties, no corruption, people greet anybody they meet etc. But if we dont need talks to change...we need actions.</p>

              <p>Haters...there will always be islam-haters wherever we turn..it's just sad coz most of these haters are just blinded. How can you hate something you do not understand? To listen to one side of the story without finding out the other side is just plain prejudice.</p>
              <p>Anyway, i do not hate them...just pity really coz God create us to be the rulers of the world by giving us brains to think but some just forgot to make use of this gift.</p>

              <p>Some men turn religion into a political weapon. We have 'Muslim' terrorists who led blind followers by the word jihad. We have other extrimists from other religions as well. But Islam is the focus of more attention due to its large population and its fast growing numbers. When we mention Islam, we think of Arabs; barbarians. But when we mention Buddishm etc, we think of holy men. Get what i mean?</p>
              <p>Part of it has to do with biased media reporting and brain-washing since young by the West.</p>

              <p>Everything in this universe is created perfectly with their own specific function and purpose. Does it happen by chance? Evolution? That's is crap theory coz till now sicentists cannot prove it. Things don't happen by chance. There must be a Creator. Think! We are given brains to think...look around you and ponder the things you see, smell, hear, taste.</p>
