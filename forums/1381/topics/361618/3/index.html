              <p><br>Pretty much bullshit.</p>
              <p>I'm not too familar with other religions and cultures. But one important difference between the oldest Chinese religion (Taoism) with the Christian/Islam/Judaism is that there's no representation for the ultimate evil and the ultimate good.</p>
              <p>Both are the same thing in Taoism, symbolized by the Yin and the Yang. Both must co exist in order for the system(Nature, social order) to function properly. Deities and Emperors are only the caretakers for the system, and could not alter or control how the system works.</p>
              <p>Under Taoism, humans are part of the system but under Christianity/Islam/Judaism it is believed God created humans to dominate Nature.</p>
              <p>While Taoism as a religion is waning in influence, Taoism as a personal philosophy is quite dominant in the Chinese culture.</p>

              <p>this is the uniqueness of the bible. there were over 40 authors who wrote the scriptures in the bible. they came from different walks of life. there were prophets, kings to fishermen. and not only that, they also came from different era spanning more 1500 years. yet every book in the bible is consistent. because all scriptures are inspired by God.</p>

              <p>The godly base their confidence

                                        rule of Scripture is that God has deliberately included 
                                        <em>seeming</em> contradictions in His Word to “snare” 
                                        the proud. He has “hidden” things from the 
                                        “wise and prudent” and “revealed them 
                                        to babes” (Luke 10:21), purposely choosing foolish

              <p>The godly base their confidence on two truths: 1) “all Scripture
              is given by inspiration of God” (2 Timothy 3:16); and 2) an
              elementary rule of Scripture is that God has deliberately included
              <em>seeming</em> contradictions in His Word to “snare” the proud.
              He has “hidden” things from the “wise and prudent” and “revealed
              them to babes” (Luke 10:21), purposely choosing foolish things to
              confound the wise (1 Corinthians 1:27).</p>

              <p>Like i said, we are born to think and if i see contradictions between 2 books of similar origin, then it is unreliable. Any sane man will tell u that. You said those who trust God habe no problem harmonizing the whole Bible. I trust God and i analyse my Koran the same way i do with the Bible. And how do you harmonize and make sense when there are contradictions? Just have faith? Then who are we to condemn the newer cults coz they also believe what they preach?</p>
              <p>"All scripture given by inspiration of God" How do you know that God says that and not a man? therefore applying this logic, if i say i have a new scripture, can i also say its inpried by God? God deliberately put in contradictions to snare the proud? Doesnt make sense to me at all. .Purposely contradict yourself to make snare the proud? To snare them into what?</p>

              <p>right. we are ultimately responsible for the choices we make. adam and eve ate from the tree of knowledge of good and evil which God commanded him not to. funny how in the garden of Eden, there is also the tree of life but adam didn't want to eat that.</p>
              <p>same goes to this world. many times people wants to go against God. when we can have the choice to eat from the tree of life, the Living Word, Jesus.</p>
              <p>I tell you the truth, he who believes has everlasting life. I am the bread of life. Your forefathers ate the manna in the desert, yet they died. But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which a man may eat and not die. I
              am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this
              bread, he will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give
              for the life of the world." John 6:47-51</p>
              <p>i boldly quote this passage and trust that people read this not as fools does if you know what i mean.</p>

              <p>You should challenge him. The answer is in the bible. It will reveal who the numbnut is.</p>
              <p>Let's  begin with his question : " Would Jesus inherit David's throne?".</p>
              <p>The answer is yes.</p>
              <p>Let's treat the bible as story books, not books inspired by God.</p>
              <p>Instead of providing the answers which is in the story books, let's make it less easy for him by asking him  questions like:</p>
              <p>How did he conclude that Jesus was a descendent of Jehoiakim?</p>

              <p>Why would i do that? Its such a waste of my time. You asked me
              to write a book but wouldnt believe it to be God's word but many
              have written before and you claim  its God's word? why the
              double standards?</p>
              <p>Since when am i rude? And when did i criticise? I merely asked
              us men to analyse and not do things with blind faith jsut because
              its the norm of people around us.</p>
              <p>I just want to have a discussion based on logic and common

              welcome to discuss with me my religion as much as i wanna discuss
