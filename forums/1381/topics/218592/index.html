            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">4When he heard this, Jesus said, "This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for God's glory so that God's Son may be glorified through it</span></span><br><br><strong>December.</strong> I was in Taiwan when i found that my basketball shoes, which i had worn for 2 months are getting somewhat heavy. Or was it that my legs were getting weak.<br><br><strong>January</strong>. Start of school. Very happy. As i was in a moderate school, i acted like i was a gangster. Followed the crowd like i was blind, spiritually blind.<br><strong>February.</strong> i start to feel more weight on my running shoes(changed to running shoes as they were lighter) By mid February, i started to have falls on my way to school.. I prayed for this condition to disappear. No use.<br><br><strong>March.</strong> Very constant falls in school. It appears that all the muscles on my right leg was getting weaker. Now to demonstrate how scary it is to walk on the roads in fear of falling. Walk in your house right now, then try not to use any strength on your right leg. If it is done properly, you wld find that you r actually tilting towards the left while walking. Limping in other words. Now if the degrees of limp towards the left is too small, then i wld fall. cos the right leg was like useless to me. It can trip me. IF the right leg were to be 100% useless, I have to tilt 90o towards the left which will look rather funny. This condition really bothered me and I prayed everyday on my way to school that I wldnt fall. No use at all still.Ppl looked at me as if im a deformed guy.<br>Late March. As the condition was getting worse, we consultated the doctor and scanned a MRI. There was a cyst on my extradural of the spine, compressing on the nerves causing weakness on my legs. An operation had to be done. We went to Mount Elizabeth, Doctor --- who specialized in neurosurgery. He said that the operation wld take ard 5 hrs and 6 hrs if some nails were to be put on my spine for support after the operation. Well, which simply means 6 hrs lah. That Sunday,a bone doctor for our church had a look at my MRI report knew about the cyst and recommended me to go to Taiwan ------ hospital as they have many cases on this. My father worried that I may not receive immediate medical attention if we are to go to Taiwan. Since the condition is getting more and more worse and the hospital was known for its disproval of surgery(need to queue for operation) That night my mother had a feeling from God that we shld go to Taiwan for treatment. We prayed. That day, we dashed to the hospital after we were out of the airport. The timing by God was so perfect, that the doctor demanded from the hospital for a emergency operation room to be scheduled early next morning., hearing the severity of the condition. The doctorÂ’s diagnosis was also that I donÂ’t need to put on nails after the operation for support as I had the ribs for the job. The operation went successfully. And, heres the important part: the operation was 10hrs!!! By GodÂ’s grace we didnÂ’t go for the SingaporeÂ’s doctor!! Also, to put on nails on my spine wld disrupt my body growth and have negative impacts. Thank God I didnÂ’t need to put on nails(imagine some heavy foreign objects in my body.)<br><br>Now the following days after the surgery were most painful, and it is also the MAIN point of the testimony. I know its long but pls bear with me. The opening on my body wass 15 cm and it really aches. And I mean really, the wound was so painful like a car on your head!! To add on to that, there was loss of neural or spinal liquid if you wld call it. This liquid is from the dural and covers the whole nervous system to the brain and also coats the brain. Now if this liquid were to be loss, due to the opening of the spine, there will not be enuf of those to coat the brain and a VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY big headache wld occur. Which did! I had to endure and endure. Painkillers everyday. Luckily, my parent were beside me to help me pass thru. You shld know when the headache comes(the painkiller had no use) my whole head was literally exploding. I could bang my head against the wall and feel nothing at all as the headache was more painful. I couldnÂ’t sit up too. So it is 24 hrs *7 days 180o on the bed. If I sat up my whole head wld spin and my eyes and neck had no strength to be straight.<br><br><strong>Testimony and personal opinions.:</strong>You may say this is suffering , well yes it is. BUT, thru this things and events, I learnt(ti3 hui4) a lot of things normal ppl wldnt know. I found out how fragile life is. And that suffering actually is existent for the purpose of good. I knew then how much my parents loved me.I found out that there is actually a purpose for all these. God taught me: To treasure life, as it is. To treasure even the ability to walk. To remember GodÂ’s grace. To be serious in religion. Not be act cool.<br>You know that my ward was in the neuron department. Where there are so many children having a worse condition then me. I have learnt also, to zhi1 zu2, be happy with wad I have, since there are other ppl who are living a worser life. My neighbouring ward was a children with heart problem. And another one who is only ard age 5 who has to endure as much pain as I have to.<br>It is also these events that had led me to come to this forum, and now posting this as a testimony to our fellow friends.<br><br><strong>MORE testimonys from myself.</strong><br><br>This school is the biggest turning point of my life. After i go into the school I start to have body problems and face trials from God. Serious trials.<br>You see, i came from Taiwan and was looking for a school. Even queenstown sec also dont wan me to admit me into their school. My mom and i was desperate for a school. We prayed and my mother felt, one morning, after she woke up, that it is God's will for me to go into ACSBR. And strangely enough, the prinicpal admitted me in. Remeber that Queenstown Sec is worse than acsbr.<br><br>Anyway, after i went into the school, i started to have body conditions that made me different from the crowd, my legs started to become very swollen for no reason, which was itself every shameful, having a pair of two big foots walking around in school. I was constantly jeered at. To make matters worse, i had to wear compressive stockings to help the swollen leg. Those STOCKINGS....no joke esp in my kind of school. So yea, you can imagine how my life was at that time. Oh and then my weak leg problem, then following that, because i had to wear braces for my spine after the operation so again, more jeering at.<br><br>These events has led me to be more mature in thinking than other students. I have learnt to become more sensitive to other pepople's feelings in school. I dont know, maybe God is preparing me through somethings??<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ive got more stories about myself. I hope i can be the tool to Glorify God.</span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Testimony From Illvision</strong></span><br><br>i was a christian since 1994. Introduced by friend to his church.First 4 years just play play and not serious. Join their youth adult class and family ministry in 1999. in yr 2000 My own family started having problem with my Dad and Mon breaking up. Many other things happened in my life. Seek for help but no result.<br><br>Ever heard of "it's God's will" answer to every question they cannot explain?<br>Bringing Job as a story that christian suffer in their life is acceptable? Ever heard of you must give up your "Issac" to show your faith? They say you must read the bible, how many chapter a day bla bla bla, do this do that... then God bless you? i tried and i was sick of it. I was troubled.<br><br>I finally given up at 2001. Enjoying a Godless life. Go disco and become drunk and join my army friends to do funny stuff outside.Play lan gaming all night long. Life quite meaningless do it probably as a way to escape going home...Sometime think Is there a God, How come "innocent" people suffer here and there. Why God so cruel...<br><br>I despise my mdn who is a christian and she always host a christian cell gp in the office. i will always make fun of her with the other non-christian friends...behind her back. In 2002 i was cheated 5k by a army mate i trusted...i almost going depression at that time.<br><br>2004, i went back to church, purpose? to chase a girl that i like. she wanted a christian bf. so... .1 sunday, we both miss our morning church so we went into a new church which have later service. This church transformed me immedately? No cos the sermon is something i never heard before. i felt uncomfortable. Becos they say christian life is easy...(  was it ?) i went for more services and became a happier person. thou my problem is still there. i redelicated my life to be come a christian again.<br><br>My pastor's preaching is Jesus centered, encourage us to ask anything from God as it was written in the bible. I tried and soon i break off from my disco habit ( i don't like to go anymore) and lan gaming. i soon found answers to my unanswered bible questions, some thu pastor's preaching some myself... and many thing fall into place? not really, i was slam with a 10k credit card debt and lawers letter is send by hand to my house... Diffcult to pay as my contract ended so have another job with lower income and have to support my mother and my house. i tried to ask my army mate to return me some money but no result ( he's driving a not bad car  ..). so i turned to Jesus..<br><br>2005 i'm down with sickness, and needed operation. i was afraid and ask Jesus to help me...when i went for pre operation check up, i was surprised the doctor said an operation won't be necessary anymore. i was overjoyed and couldn't believe it. He said 3 month of medication will solved the problem. until now i still have 2 month worth of medicine in my drawer.<br><br>Now, as i keep on in my pastor's teaching,i see more light to the bible, it make me just want to read the bible more. I believe my pastor have given me keys to unlock the confusing bible and many contriction seems to make sense.( still reading. just finished psalm.) ( My pastor always quote, faith comes thru hearing and hearing the word of God)<br><br>2006, My parents start to talk again. I'm happy and now i hope to share this joy, out of my overflow, to lift christians up and help people. I redelicated my life when i heard my pastor said, Jesus means saviour and he wants to save you. My 10k debt was paid off supernatually and i don't even know who. I believe God restore me double portion of loosing 5k.<br><br>I heard this elsewhere, if there's no God, when i die, i die, but if there's a God, when i die, i'm in trouble. And now i change, If you(unbeliever) are suffering and tried many method and no other way out , my suggestion to you is, call out Jesus as Lord and He will save you.<br><br>P.s If you want to Know more about Jesus feel free to PM me.<br></div>
