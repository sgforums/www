The word of God is holy and shall not be used in a manner as such.

Do you think I hate you Dave? Haven't you read all the suggestion I made to you on how to improve yourself? Is this the act of someone who hate?<br><br>Let the Bible speak more: Galatians 2:11-21, Paul rebuking Peter for his shortcomings. Read this passage and tell me honestly that Paul had nice things to say about Peter.<br><br>It is so common for a Christian quoting the verses that you put up, dave, under the guise of "love", and if you "love" me, you would not use those words on me. Stop that self-pity dave.<br><br>If you don't know how to quote verses, please stop doing it.

Improve on your writing skills - this has to be a conscious effort on your part. The PREVIEW button helps. Alternatively use an on-line dictionary. I am not even talking about SMS short cuts, I am talking about pure spelling error like: nex (for next), belif (for belief) and many more. It is just too painful to read. Not only that, what you write now is what you write in real life. Use this forum to hone your writing skills (I do that all the time - here, in SGforums, Straits Times forum, Today forum - yes! I post there too, of course using my real name). Writing well is the first step to being credible.<br><br>2. Stick to topics you can handle - Evolution is probably too big for you. The moment YOU start a post, you are expected to carry-on with it. Also, try not to quote for sources you cannot handle - quoting from sources without personal comments is just going to kill your credibility.<br><br>3. Read "7 Habits for Effective Teenagers" by Sean Covey. My sons have either finished it or are reading it. This book will help shape your life in a very practical way. You can buy this book at Kino or borrow it from the National Library.<br><br>4. For the time being - do not depend on any one - you have started this, live with it. Action and consequences are something that is heavily emphasized at my home. Sweep up your own dirt, clean up your own room, pick up your own rubbish.<br><br>5. Get involved in your church ministry - that's an excellent place to pick up biblical truths and concepts. It will strengthen your arguments here in your forum.<br><br>6. Be objective - as much as you dislike some people (me inclusive) you are a host, unless the visitors become genuinely abusive, you will just have to tolerate. Boh pian.... it comes with the turf.<br><br>LIKE IT OR NOT, you own this forum. You have to build it up yourself. Others can help, but don't factor that into your business plan, when it happens, it's a bonus.<br><br>Have I been hard on you? Yes I have. Will I apologise. No! The world is a harsh place, can't take the heat? Get out of the kitchen! I do not believe in criticising without providing practical points - read my points above, chew on them, and see if I am right.</blockquote>Hope you can do the ones which are nessasary for edification <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br></div>
