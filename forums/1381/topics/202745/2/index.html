            <div class='col-md body'>This is quite ironic. I believe the thread starter will probably make a better Christian than a lot of us...if he becomes one, that is. I think he has identified a very real problem with us, but believe me, a lot of us know about it already. The pastors know this, Christians themselves know this. I guess it is up to us if we want to change or not, and for God to change us. Having said that, I still believe this few incidents should not hinder your perception of Christianity. To more objectively view Christianity as it is, why not read the bible and study the words of Jesus, rather than focus too much on the inconsistent living of some Christians to the faith they claim they believe in?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I may so state my own point of view on the serial killer question, I do believe that the problems stem from our own viewing and judgement of the deeds of man, as opposed to viewing them from the way God might see it.<br><br>Of course in no way I am saying God sees our sins in such a way, but I might be tempted to think that as much as we think there is a big difference between a minor sin like telling a small lie and going around killing people, actually no such difference in the eternal sense exists.<br><br>Yes, killing people is a more <span style="font-style: italic;">serious</span> sin because it is indicative of a more fallen and corrupted condition then a person who lies now and then, but the (Christian) concept of salvation from corruption is not interested in the severity of the corruption, but that the corruption in any form is redeemed. The severity of the corruption in a sense, is irrelevant.<br><br>It only seems unfair to us because we fail to see how serious our own minor sin is in the eyes of GodÂ… and ultimately all sin is really against God. In short, all fall equally short of God in the sense that we are always infinitely short of perfection. In that respect you and the serial killer stand on the same ground.<br><br>Sometimes we mistake our feelings for justice, it may feel unfair that the criminal that truly repents on his deathbed be forgiven and not the person who has lived a life of minor sinsÂ… but I suspect that we have a flawed concept of justice. If we really wanted God to practice the justice He without mercy or compassion and by the bookÂ… all of us deserve to die, and die totally.<br><br>So the question remains, what exactly separates the serial killer from us? I don't think there is any reasonable separation in the eyes of God except that we are all sinners and require saving.<br><br>The supposed 'unfairness' is a human conceptÂ… and if we think about itÂ… really unfair to God. He extended a Grace that He could keep by all means and paid for it by such bloody meansÂ… and now we have us sinful humans demanding He dispense this grace in accordance to this sin and that in this way or another? HmmÂ…<br><br>No I don't think the person who accepts God on deathbed lies to himself, and this is not because he has managed to earn any favour but simply because we have a God that is willing to hear even the cries of a person who has no intention but self-preservation to turn to Him. In fact in many cases we realize we don't turn to God with pure or selfless motives at all, but He chooses not to turn us away.<br><br>Really I suspect it's all about what God chooses to do, and very little of what we have to say about it. But I think it's alright to find the concept of salvation and redemption difficult at times, we'd expect to find some difficulty in understanding it if it was of Divine and not human creation and standards.<br></div>

"Every man is responsible for his own actions"<br><br>i believed him and i believed God..<br><br>put it this way..if God could control u and forcefully turn u into an angel..would u still believe that it's a good religion..?i think u would see the Christians nowadays as possessed people..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>and for that serial killer..all sins are sins..u're either on the black side..or the white side..a sin is a sin...u need to repent deeply for every single one of them even if it's juz a minor frown u made to ur parents...to God..it weights juz as much as a serial killer..i think God doesn't decide which level of hell u will go to when He thinks u're not fit for heaven..he will juz send u down..so..it juz DOWN or UP...~  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

I think got points system wan lor. Like if you do some bad things and dunno there's Jesus and god and all, less points will be deducted. But if you know about Jesus and all and you still sin, then more points deducted lor. Something like that lor.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by boredandsleepy:</div><div class="quote_body">Since i was in secondary sch i have always thought that christian, catholics etc... is a very holy religion with good teachings and good followers, but in the recent yrs i've noticed this changed alot.<br><br>take the pastor cheating on church funds for example, detroying the faith and trust of his fellow church mates by using their money for the chruch for himself.<br><br>and then comes the ***Y ******T teeagers being rude in public and misbehaving themselves in public by acting so rowdy. and also spreading rumours that if u wana see chio bus u have to come here. it really defeats the purpose fo attending the church totally.<br><br>well, those above are just on the general where most ppl alrdy knows. For myself, my wife and i have alrdy encountered many incidents that makes me think otherwise of this religion.<br><br>1) My wife's collegue who has never initiated a conversation to tohers before suddenly tries to make friends with my wife, talking nonstop and being very close to her. And also trying to solve most of her work problems for her even though its nt her department. After 1 week, pop comes the main motive. She actually wants my wife to go join her in her church, well i wasnt the kind who says no to sunday morning churches so i told her to go ahead.<br><br>After 2 sessions to her church, my wife finds that she actually don't really belong there cos she feels uneasy in the church. My wife then told her collegue the truth and she stopped going to that church. All of a sudden, her collegue stopped talking to her, and treats her in a hostile manner and even blocked her from the MSN. Bad impression built up here.<br><br>2) when i was in the retail line in a particular VCD shop, on fateful sunday afternoon, there was this grp of ladies around their early 30s came into the shop, while browsing the VCDs they were chatting quite loudly to each other talking about the morning's bible studies thingy. so i could easily tell that they were from the same church. i noticed that they tend to talk so loud that even the tv volume of the shop was quite loud every1 could still hear their voices. Gives me the impression that they are trying to promote their church. whats worse is when i tried to serve them by asking "May i help u" politely, they didn't even bother replying to me. Even if its a no thank you its some form of courtesy rite? But no, they simply continued their conversation loudly within themselves. When they left the shop, all the vcds were messed up, they just take up the vcd, look, not interested, andhow place them making the place look messy and an eyesore.<br><br>3) Neighbour, whole family are duno christians or catholics cant really differentiate. they have a picture of Mary at their front door. Seen them many times while taking lift down stairs. A few incidents when my wife and i were coming back home, we always see him at the lift waiting for the lift too. but that neighbour will always go in the lift and faster press door close making both of us wait for another lift. Well, i can tell u with very sure confirmation he can see us when he's going in the lift. He simply wont wait for us. Even siometimes when going down, he sees us locking our door and about to walk towards the lift, he will not wait too. its not as if waiting a few secs will cause him to lose millions of dollars rite.<br><br>these incidents actually leave me pondering what are the churches in singapore really teaching the believers now. Is it to be more self centered and only their religion is the one and only religion that is real and the rest of the religions are crap? To be arrogant and snobbish to be a christain/catholic?<br>To look down on other ppl just because they dont share ur same believes?<br><br>Its really annoying to know that these ppl are like that. I'm not saying that all church goers are like this. In fact i also know alot of good christains/catholics. But those ppl mentioned above are simply blacksheep. tarnishing the religion instead of bringing it proud.<br><br>and like i said i apologise here if my tread has somehow offended u indirectly, but i'm just stating some of my thouhts.</div></blockquote>Don't you feel you are a overly too sensitive person? Are polite 100% of the time? Sometime you may be too occupied... Are you human... Are Christians human too? Be more understanding... In any religions there are bad people too. Alot of ganster pray for buddha too are they good people? Alot of muslim pray for Allah did they stop bombing the civilians? We are all human who make mistakes. Unless you are telling me the religion actually teaches everyone to kill people then maybe its wrong I think it has nothing to do with the religion. It is your perception. Devoted Christians makes mistake too. If you think Christians are perfect church is perfect. Sorry to broke your dream. It is impossible to happen.<br><br>Furthermore if you are a Christian, isn't church is about you and God? Why so much on the people around?</div>
