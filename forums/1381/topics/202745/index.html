            <div class='col-md body'>Since i was in secondary sch i have always thought that christian, catholics etc... is a very holy religion with good teachings and good followers, but in the recent yrs i've noticed this changed alot.<br><br>take the pastor cheating on church funds for example, detroying the faith and trust of his fellow church mates by using their money for the chruch for himself.<br><br>and then comes the ***Y ******T teeagers being rude in public and misbehaving themselves in public by acting so rowdy. and also spreading rumours that if u wana see chio bus u have to come here. it really defeats the purpose fo attending the church totally.<br><br>well, those above are just on the general where most ppl alrdy knows. For myself, my wife and i have alrdy encountered many incidents that makes me think otherwise of this religion.<br><br>1) My wife's collegue who has never initiated a conversation to tohers before suddenly tries to make friends with my wife, talking nonstop and being very close to her. And also trying to solve most of her work problems for her even though its nt her department. After 1 week, pop comes the main motive. She actually wants my wife to go join her in her church, well i wasnt the kind who says no to sunday morning churches so i told her to go ahead.<br><br>After 2 sessions to her church, my wife finds that she actually don't really belong there cos she feels uneasy in the church. My wife then told her collegue the truth and she stopped going to that church. All of a sudden, her collegue stopped talking to her, and treats her in a hostile manner and even blocked her from the MSN. Bad impression built up here.<br><br>2) when i was in the retail line in a particular VCD shop, on fateful sunday afternoon, there was this grp of ladies around their early 30s came into the shop, while browsing the VCDs they were chatting quite loudly to each other talking about the morning's bible studies thingy. so i could easily tell that they were from the same church. i noticed that they tend to talk so loud that even the tv volume of the shop was quite loud every1 could still hear their voices. Gives me the impression that they are trying to promote their church. whats worse is when i tried to serve them by asking "May i help u" politely, they didn't even bother replying to me. Even if its a no thank you its some form of courtesy rite? But no, they simply continued their conversation loudly within themselves. When they left the shop, all the vcds were messed up, they just take up the vcd, look, not interested, andhow place them making the place look messy and an eyesore.<br><br>3) Neighbour, whole family are duno christians or catholics cant really differentiate. they have a picture of Mary at their front door. Seen them many times while taking lift down stairs. A few incidents when my wife and i were coming back home, we always see him at the lift waiting for the lift too. but that neighbour will always go in the lift and faster press door close making both of us wait for another lift. Well, i can tell u with very sure confirmation he can see us when he's going in the lift. He simply wont wait for us. Even siometimes when going down, he sees us locking our door and about to walk towards the lift, he will not wait too. its not as if waiting a few secs will cause him to lose millions of dollars rite.<br><br>these incidents actually leave me pondering what are the churches in singapore really teaching the believers now. Is it to be more self centered and only their religion is the one and only religion that is real and the rest of the religions are crap? To be arrogant and snobbish to be a christain/catholic?<br>To look down on other ppl just because they dont share ur same believes?<br><br>Its really annoying to know that these ppl are like that. I'm not saying that all church goers are like this. In fact i also know alot of good christains/catholics. But those ppl mentioned above are simply blacksheep. tarnishing the religion instead of bringing it proud.<br><br>and like i said i apologise here if my tread has somehow offended u indirectly, but i'm just stating some of my thouhts.</div>

We are expected to live a life of sanctification and christians should display the fruits of the Spirit as their lives progresses.<br><br>And as much as we thank God for those people who displays a 360 degree change overnight, there are those who don't have that kind of miraculous change.
