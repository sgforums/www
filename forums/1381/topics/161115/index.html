This latitude is what causes so many different flavors of Christianity.  Diversity is a good thing, but disunity is not.  If two churches disagree doctrinally, it is fine that they remain separate.  This separation, though, does not lift the responsibility Christians have to love one another (1John 4:11-12) Â– and ultimately be united as one in Christ (John 17:21-22).</blockquote>See, even a figure of speech is formed when two normally contradictory terms combine.

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The main reason why we have denominations is that Christians are divided on doctrine issues (teaching issues). This have been going on since the New Testament days (Read First Corinthians 9:11-17) and of course, the most famous Martin Luther. Doctrines (teachings) that impact people's lives and the Church. Even though we are divided on doctine issues, we can all agree the true meaning of Jesus Christ. Doctrines are important and Christians might argue for those issues. These would include beliefs about traditions, worship style, communion, predestination, eternal security, original sin, infant baptism and others. Christians chose denominations by following their conscience (Holy Spirit), beliefs and personal worship preferences. There is NO perfect church. No Christians are perfect. There is only one perfect person and that is Jesus Christ.<br><br>There are different preferences of beliefs and different style of worship. Some prefer one worship style while other prefer another worship style. The key is that we must worship God in Spirit with other believers regardless our "personal" opinion or loyalty to our denominations (or non-denomination). God knows every believers' hearts and God will accept any believers who truly believe His Son, who died for our sins. In my opinion, God do not judge us based on what denomination church we go to, but rather God judge us based on how we allow God (Holy Spirit) help us discern truth from false. No matter how great a denomination is, false teachings will always happen and we need to understand that "visible" Church is not perfect but at the same time spiritual church is perfect. We worship in Spirit.<br><br>John 4:23-24 (New International Version) Jesus said:<br>Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth.<br><br></div>

It happens during the apostle times . Take for example this Paul and Barnabas:<br><br>Some time later Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us go back and visit the brothers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord and see how they are doing." Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them, but Paul did not think it wise to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work. They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus, but Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord. He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches. (Acts 15:36-41)  --&gt; (Paul and Barnabas had disagreement and they set apart too BUT they are still spiritually united in Christ. )<br><br>Sometimes, it is divine intervention that occur. I really do not have an exact answer to you because opposing belief have all along been around.<br><br>And also if I'm not wrong catholics also hold opposing beliefs. Some think they should be more liberal, while some think should remain conservative. I'm sure there are more opposing beliefs within catholics.<br><br>I hope I have at least answer some part of your questions. For some honest difficult question, I cannot answer you.</div>

The list below doesn't include more minor causes of "bible-only church" splits, such as style of service, church, government, vestments, attitude to alcohol, pastoring styles, tithing, methods of receiving communion etc.<br><br>Should there be infant or Adult baptism?<br>Does baptism confer Grace or is it just a symbol?<br><br>Is our destiny governed by Calvinist Predestination or Arminian Free Will<br><br>Once Saved Always Saved?<br><br>Is there assurance of Salvation?<br><br>Can one lose Salvation?<br><br>Is Salvation a one-off event or a lifelong journey?<br><br>Does hell exist?<br><br>Can one be saved outside the Christian Church?<br><br>Should images be used in worship?<br><br>Does the Church replace Israel?<br><br>Is Divorce permissible<br><br>Is Abortion murder?<br><br>Is prophecy still given?<br><br>Are there still Miracles?<br><br>Are miracles guaranteed if you have enough faith?<br><br>Will there be a pre-trib Rapture?<br><br>Premillenialism or Postmillenialism?<br><br>Will there even be a millennium?<br><br>Speaking in Tongues - valid or deception?<br><br>Baptism in the Holy Spirit - is it real?<br><br>Are demons real?<br><br>What role do Works have in Salvation?<br><br>What is the Nature and Function of Sacraments?<br><br>Is Jesus physically present in Communion?<br><br>Are the Sacraments necessary to salvation?<br><br>What form of Authority should exist in the Church?<br><br>Does a minister need to be ordained?<br><br>What does ordination confer?<br><br>Is Apostolic Succession necessary?<br><br>Can women be Pastors?<br><br>Can homosexuals be admitted to Church?<br><br>Does God promise Christians material prosperity?<br><br>The list goes on and on........<br><br><strong>And you call it "For most parts, the various denominations do not differ very much" ?</strong><br><br>What HH used to argue about is one of the way the church used to defend themselves of the many denominations.
