I really don't have any good answer for you and while I can continue with questions and prolong another needless debate on religion, I'd rather not.<br>I am glad you wrote and enjoyed reading your notes. It offers a different view of good and evil and while it differs from my view, it is written in a way that does not inflame the readers. It is extremely well written which makes reading easy.<br>I cannot pretend that I am theologically competent to address your questions as it will turn out to something like, if God is omniscience therefore He will know that evil will turn which there means that He should not have created Lucifer and would not have created us. No need to go the chicken and egg way.<br>I guess Eternal Hope exists for the purpose of Christians and anyone who may have an inkling of an interest to Christianity. Others are free to read but if anyone violently object to the existence of Christianity should refrain, out of respect, from commenting. This statement does not at all refer to you. You had asked valid questions, I have answers to some but not others. Instead of starting another pointless debate, I'd like to simply say thanks for your comments.</div>

No... Like communism in it's purest form is probably good. Unfortunately the evil (there's that word again) in the hearts of men will always adulterate it...
