            <div class='col-md body'>U writing poem or something ?<br><br><blockquote>See , God given us a brain to think right/wrong<br><br>The freedom to choose </blockquote>He has given u the power to reason. Why waste it ? Why not use them when selecting your religion ?<br><br><blockquote>God also had a choice you see, to create humans who can only do right..<br>won't do wrong..or humans who can basically do both.. </blockquote>And so ?<br><br><blockquote>So in this world..you are given a chance ,<br>Basically you are also given a choice whether to commit sins or whether to do good deeds </blockquote>R u given a choice to be borned ? No, yet they classified it as a sin. Tat is no a choice.<br><br><blockquote>Naturally , With Freedom to Choose, some people might choose good,<br>some people might choose bad.. </blockquote>God create evil. If he has not created them, people won't choose to do bad deeds because it is no longer an option.<br><br><blockquote>Humans are God's best creation..<br>Also the most sinful one..<br>Also the most destructive one..<br>Also the most disloyal one.. </blockquote>God r human's worst creation.<br>The most cruel one<br>the most disruptive one<br>the most harsh one<br><br><blockquote>The difference between us and animals is that animals don't have the chance to choose whether to love God or not..they automatically is programmed to love God.. </blockquote>And wat hapen to these "faithful" animals ? God say tat they r nothing but meat and we can do all we like with them.<br><br><blockquote>Don't say so fast first,<br>Lucifer was given a chance to choose,<br>Even though he know he will lose in the end,<br>He still is rebellious.. </blockquote>Really ? How do u know ? Maybe Lucifer is "programmed' to oppose God<br><br><blockquote>To those people who said there is No God..<br>They wouldn't have existed in the first place to say that there isn't any God </blockquote>I existed. I say there is not god. I still exist.<br><br><blockquote>Even for the probability of the whole thing getting created by Big Bang is absurdity , Tell me who created the Big Bang? </blockquote>Tell me who create the creator then i will tell u who create the big bang<br><br><blockquote>With regards to dinosaurs,i personally assume it was a testing ground , before He moved on to humans.. </blockquote>testing ground ? U mean they r guinea pigs ? They die and tat is it ? God also kill almost every people during the flood. So these people r guinea pigs ?<br><br><blockquote>With regards to scientists, some of them even say the probability of earth being created with so many humans, and the probability of having a planet, with a sun , and having a ocean , with fresh water, a land with raw materials, a land with oil , a ozone layer..<br><br>The probability of it is almost equal as....a tornado going thru a unassembled 747 jumbo jet..and after the tornado come out..a finished jumbo jet is created.. </blockquote>I have said many times before, there are infinitely possible sites for reaction and given infinite time. It can counter the huge odds tat create life.<br><br><blockquote>That means its theoretically impossible, so there has to be one higher being.. </blockquote>by probabilty, it is possible. In fact, I can put it as highly possible<br><br><blockquote>You declare your not worshipping anything, but everyone does worship something..Money, Ou xiang, condominium, wife, material stuffs.. </blockquote>Your definition of worship is wrong. I like money, condo, ou xiang wife etc, But I do not worship them. Is just liking something become worshipping it ? Then u guys have create the ultimate sins of worshipping other things other than your god.<br><br><blockquote>Lucifer is right within us, in Humans ourselves.. </blockquote>Lucifer is create by god. God create evil tat corrupts lucifer. God is all knowing and know tis will happen yet do nothing about it even though he is omni potent. Lucifer is with us, and tat is planed by god all along.<br><br></div>

Just because u dun experience them..that doesnt mean it doesnt exist. Some of my frens...they had encounter these things before. He was being possessed,...the language he speaks..is then an ancient Jawanese language. biologically speaking...spirits have no brain cells...but how come these "things" retain its memory is still  remain unexplain.<br><br>Have u heard of ghostbuster in the states? they are for real. They use science. Their equipment can detect these "things" by frequency and packets of energy. Physcologist ( some wif phd) also do agree with the existence of them. ..so dun think that u r damn smart...correcting each person sentences as if they are all wrong and u r damn right. If u r so right, today u wont be here. U might be chairing NASA or a damn smart researcher than frequently appear in the TV.<br><br>The point is u r not and u will nvr be with this kind of INCORRIGIBLE attitude.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi SnowFlag<br>To answer your question on Isa 45:7 please refer to the following link<br>http://www.carm.org/diff/Isa_45_7.htm.<br><br>The English Bible is only one of the many languages the Good Book exists in. Due to the differences in meaning and limitation of some languages versus another, one almost need to be careful when dealing with some Biblical verses.<br><br>It had been said that language is alive because new words come and new meanings emerge, one has to go back to the root of historical writing before coming into conclusive decision as to what means what.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lewis asks: "Why, then, did God give them free will?" Why in the world would God give us freedom to choose if He knew people would use that freedom to cause so much frustration in themselves and so much misery in others? "Because free will, though it makes evil possible, is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having." Without free will, we would be robots, and God obviously preferred to relate not to machines, but to human beings. Lewis asserts that "the happiness which God designs for His higher creatures is the happiness of being freely, voluntarily united to Him and to each other in an ecstasy of love and delight compared with which the most rapturous love between a man and a woman on this earth is mere milk and water. And for that they must be free."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh.. in regards of evil.. is sorta noticed this thing somewhere..<br><br><blockquote><br>Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent.<br>Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent.<br>Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil?<br>Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?</blockquote>The question should be, why is God not willing to prevent evil? Because evil is a by product of free will, therefore, free will makes evil possible, but, however, due to desire for people to love Him voluntarily on our own course of action, He chose to allow free will to thrive and evil the chance to prosper within a period of time.<br><br>As much as I agree the importance of free will, I do not agree that God did not create evil; and the question is, is God malevolent and in it such a way, isn't it a type of bending people to His will?[/quote]</div>

However, goodness will last for all eternity because God exists, and God is a good God therefore as long He exists, good exist. If God is an evil God, likewise, evil will be eternal. As far as concerned to human wisdom, this is based on an assumption that God is whole good; therefore good will win.<br><br>Perhaps the people who refuse to follow God's will is because it is too perfect to be true, just as why did the Bible says all things are possible through Him, yet there are sins that are impossible to forgive. This contradiction of the impossibility of possibility brings a deep doubt in most of us; as the idea of the omnipotent yet unable to perfectly bring free-will without the existence of evil.. bringing back to the impossibility of possibilities.</div>

If evil is within us, and we are God's creation, would what exists in us are considered as God's creation? If evil is the outcome of an angel's coruption, than we must ask what corupted that once bright star which shined so bright in all heavens? Is it not the evil of pride and discontempt?
