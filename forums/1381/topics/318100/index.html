              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>Let's avoid discussion on matters that may indirectly create doubts on the non-Christians. E.g. Calvinism &amp; Arminianism, prosperity gospel, faith teachers, etc. </p>
              <p>I think we may not even be  interested find out the answers when we depart from this mortal life but if you are still keen to find out the answer, why not  hear from our LORD Himself rather than discussing such topics in this life where they are so many different opinions.</p>
              <p>The reason I wrote this is because I believe this forum is viewed by non-Christians as well. Are we aware that by discussing topics like questioning the leaders of the Church ( their sermons, their private life, their income &amp; etc),we might indirectly discourage non-christians from  attending Church or finding out more about our Saviour.</p>
              <p>Honestly, what makes we think that the leaders of those mega Church are not appointed by our FATHER that as if our LORD needs us to correct them. Why are we paying attention to these leaders ? Shouldn't we be rejoicing on seeing so many that has turn to our Saviour in these Mega Churches. What would happened to these congregations if our LORD use these leaders to reach out to the lost. I believe many of these congregation are still in their sinful habits, in depression, feeling hopeless, maybe some have already committed sucide, some may have already died of cancer or sickness, etc.</p>
              <p>I came across a website which created by so called christian where it highlighted the erroneous teachings of almost all popular gospel ministers. On another occasion, I also came across another posted video where it shown those who are being healed during Benny Hinn Crusade and it also claim that some Church funds were not being used wisely. I don't understand the purpose of those who created such websites and videos .... How does it benefit in reaching to the lost ?</p>
              <p>I hope we will not further discuss on Church leaders ( whether he or she is from mega or small Church ) in such forums where it is easily accessible by non-christians because I think it is doing more harm than good,</p>
              <p>The LORD bless u all !</p>

              <p>Disagree.</p>
              <p>First, topics like questionable churches and questionable leaders are reasonably well known to the public. If anything, those who rebuke them offer alternatives, like more traditional churches, where non-christians can attend.</p>
              <p>By discussing such topics, we are offering a caveat emptor. Don't join a megachurch, then later kenna conned and then call Christians liars.</p>
              <p>By discussing such topics, we are also telling the non-christians, look not every christian is the hip hop kind and talks about money in church.</p>
              <p>By discussing theological topics like calvinist vs arminianism, we are offering the non christian the whole spectrum of orthodox christian beliefs. Personally I find calvinism offers new perspectives on many issues and better answers to some of the non christian's questions.</p>

              <p>I do not agree with eternity99. The reasons why we should discuss such issues is precisely because there are non-christians in this forum (many are disgusted ones too).</p>
              <p>The dicussion will make light out of dubious teachings such as those by mega churches. Wrong teachings will lead to wrong beliefs and wrong actions which will not do Christianity any good.</p>
              <p>If the teachings are correct and supported by the Bible (without mis-quoting or quoting out of context), then they can always stand up to scrutiny and defended upon.</p>
              <p>Why are people going to meaga churches so afraid that the teachings of their pastors are challenged?</p>
              <p>Example - tithing OR once saved, always saved......are not teachings of Jesus.</p>
              <p>All would be christians should be warned and they should choose which church to go by having some understanding of what Jesus is teaching us about - Christianity is about faith, hope and love - NEVER ABOUT MONEY!</p>
              <p>I have seen in other forum how those mega churches people keep mis-quoting bible verses to support the dubious teachings. When they are debunk completely by correct bible quotation in the correct context, they either disappear or use testimony to support  the dubious teachings which holds no water.</p>
              <p>By the way, do you know the origin of a mega church? If not, you can  <a href="http://www.blogpastor.net/category/church/megachurches/">click here</a> to find out - read and you will also find out that there is no requirement to become a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>pastor in mega churches</strong></span> I.E. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>they do not need formal training (like other pastors or priests)</strong></span> and this explains the dubious teachings. I also have doubts about some of their intentions.</p>
              <p>So, do you know where your pastor get his training from? Are you sure his teachings are sound?</p>
              <p>If one is sick, they seek the qualified doctor to get healed - if one is going to seek salvation, they need to seek the correct churches that teaches correct teachings of Christ and to lead them to eternal life.</p>
              <p>Do you agree?</p>

              <p>the truth are already twisted and spread. the land owner sowed some good wheat seeds in the field but at night,his enemies sowed some weed seeds into the same field.as they both grow. the slaves of the land owner says to the master, " master, master, there are weeds among our wheats,do you want us to take them out now?"</p>
              <p>the master says no because weed and wheat looks very alike when young and by rooting weeds, good and useful wheat gets roots out by mistake too.lets wait for harvest then we can seperate weeds and wheats</p>
              <p>bible teachings are the good wheat..people translations and views,interpretations and lies are the weed.all these will grow together(discussed and exposed,discussed again and exposed again) til armageddon (harvest) then we know the real truth.</p>

              <p>Actually, I'm ok with atheists and non-Christians asking questions here if the intention is truly to understand or to listen to us. And not use every word we say as a chance to attack us.</p>
              <p>I'm also open to them sharing other views if they are not being offensive and negative about it.</p>
              <p>Similarly though, I feel we should treat these particular people with the same senstivity we expect of them.</p>

              <p><br>actually dumb2 is quite right. it is not easy to impose.</p>
              <p>firstly, there is NO moderator.</p>
              <p>secondly, even if there is one, moderators in EH has always been accused of being bias or high handed if they take actions against prepertrators.</p>
              <p>thirdly, individuals choose to respond in anyway they want, and being cordial may be the last thing on one's mind... take you for example, you don't always come across as someone friendly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>.....i am not sure when's the first time you started with EH.... but this forum has a long history of being contentious.... why do you think it is NOT moderated?</p>
