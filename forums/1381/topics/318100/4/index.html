              <p>When did I avoid the sincerity issue? I have already said that whatever apology that was made sounds sincere.Not just that.... in other subsequent posts, dumb2 had cooled down tremendously and attempted to engage you in a friendlier way. However an apology does not amount to agreement on the viewpoints. It was a apology for losing the temper, that's all. What did you expect, dumb2 apologised and then change his mind suddenly to agree with you?</p>

              <p>I see, so you were irritated by dumb2. That's really funny. Bear in mind the context of the apology.... and that is, he was sorry for losing his temper. So, again, in your juvenile mind, what is the reason for the apology - that he should agree with all your views or that he is just sorry for blowing his top?</p>
              <p>You're referring to malcom??? give me a break lah. He was posting his comments, and he has every right to do so. That isn't even taunting me.....</p>
              <p>Whaddaya mean "as soon as your post appear"? I have been posting daily and he only wrote just a while ago. He's probably busy over the past few days or maybe he has nothing else to say on this matter.</p>

              <p>seeking your opinion here... there is absolutely no intention for flaming.</p>
              <p>1. Can we complete detach ourselves from the topic we are discussion - note that the context here is our religious inclination. Note also that our religious inclination is based on our personal understanding of the scriptures.</p>
              <p>2. When such differences in understand of the scriptures erupt, how should it be handled?</p>
              <p>3. When there is a flaring out, one party admitted to being too hot headed and backoff with an apology, can he still continue to debate with a slightly more gentle spirit?</p>

              <p>bleah, i've already apologised, like 5 times already, are we still on the issue whether i am sincere or not? =x</p>
              <p>if he forgiven me, good lor, if he hasn't (and only he would know), then he isn't a very good catholic lor.</p>
              <p>in the end, God knows whether i've been sincere or not, or whether limkopi is actually angry or not. if i'm sincere, i'll benefit from this, and will move from one level of faith to the next. if i'm not, then i'll be learning this lesson another time.</p>
              <p>if limkopi has truly forgiven me, then he would also benefit from it, if he has not, then it'd be interesting to worship God while bearing grudges against me, which totally goes against the teaching of Christ, then he wouldn't be enjoying worshipping God (because i can't see how anyone can really worship God while bearing so much issues.)</p>
              <p>doesn't matter, in the end, we all reap from our own action. if i didn't apologise, i'm going to feel very guilty to worship God in cell group tomorrow. but since i did, i'm reaping peace with myself. so i'm the one who benefits, i wouldn't really be bothered if he thinks i'm sincere or not</p>
              <p>if limkopi still wants to up my lorry, of course i'll feel annoyed, and honestly it isn't easy to keep it in and to turn the other cheek, but everytime i don't blow up, it's a personal victory for me. =)</p>

              <p>bleah, i've already apologised, like 5 times already, are we
              still on the issue whether i am sincere or not? =x</p>
              <p>if he forgiven me, good lor, if he hasn't (and only he would
              know), then he isn't a very good catholic lor.</p>
              <p>in the end, God knows whether i've been sincere or not, or
              whether limkopi is actually angry or not. if i'm sincere, i'll
              benefit from this, and will move from one level of faith to the
              next. if i'm not, then i'll be learning this lesson another
              time.</p>
              <p>if limkopi has truly forgiven me, then he would also benefit
              from it, if he has not, then it'd be interesting to worship God
              while bearing grudges against me, which totally goes against the
              teaching of Christ, then he wouldn't be enjoying worshipping God
              (because i can't see how anyone can really worship God while
              bearing so much issues.)</p>
              <p>doesn't matter, in the end, we all reap from our own action. if
              i didn't apologise, i'm going to feel very guilty to worship God in
              cell group tomorrow. but since i did, i'm reaping peace with
              myself. so i'm the one who benefits, i wouldn't really be bothered
              if he thinks i'm sincere or not</p>
              <p>if limkopi still wants to up my lorry, of course i'll feel
              annoyed, and honestly it isn't easy to keep it in and to turn the
              other cheek, but everytime i don't blow up, it's a personal victory
              for me. =)</p>

              <p>Like you said, you will know if you are sincere or not and others can see too.....and I have said many times not to turn this into our personal feud.</p>
              <p>Grudges? It was you who openly declare you hate Catholic and they will
              go to hell and 90% are ............ Now you said I bear grudges? I don't like or dislike anyone based on their race or religon.</p>

              It was a apology for losing the temper, that's all. What did you

              in mind the context of the apology.... and that is, he was sorry
              for losing his temper. So, again, in your juvenile mind, what is
              the reason for the apology - that he should agree with all your

              <p>Whaddaya mean "as soon as your post appear"? I have been posting
