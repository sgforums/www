              <p>firstly, there is NO moderator.</p>
              <p>secondly, even if there is one, moderators in EH has always been

              <p>thirdly, individuals choose to respond in anyway they want, and
              being cordial may be the last thing on one's mind... take you for
              example, you don't always come across as someone friendly.</p>

              <p>lol, action speaks louder than words, and the actions of the disciples speaks about the theological teachings of the Master, so if i have mistaken alot of stuff, just by observing the disciples.. well... hardly my fault =)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway alot of things non believers say about christians are unfounded too. so solution is to make them eat humble pies eh? =)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and, just a little food for thought. if i've repented and am trying to practice self control on my temper. is what you're doing encouraging me to continue, or stumble my walk?</p>
              <p>if Jesus spoke of forgiveness and to forgive your enemy, why are you so concerned about my sincerity? you should have forgiven me regardless whether i am sincere or not. thus it's your issue.</p>
              <p>and if Jesus also talk about turning the other cheek, why are you trying to up my lorry? =)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if i am now observing the acts of the disciples to see for myself how true is their Master's teaching, what would i have gathered from you now? =)</p>

              <p><br>yes it's common... where an apology is really not an apology.</p>
              <p>but based on the merits of the issue between dumb2 and mrlim, dumb2's apology does not sound like that.</p>
              <p>also, for people involve in mediation, the word "sorry" is a powerful word, so let's not discount it's value.</p>

              <p>lol, yeah, i guess if you gloat while winning, in a way, it's questionable on why you're debating or arguing. is it for God's glory or for your glory when you are debating.</p>
              <p>if the other person is wrong, and he apologises, and you follow up by giving in to him and encouraging him and building him, you're really doing it for God, because you're building someone. but if you're continuing to tear him down, you're not doing it out of love, and you're not upholding Jesus' teachings, then it's pretty clear you're doing it for yourself and for your own glory. that in itself, destroys the basis of your argument.</p>
              <p> something i think i need to keep in mind also.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway bottomline is. it's not a good idea not to discuss sensitive topics. i never once felt that brushing stuff under the carpet is a good idea. never did.</p>

              <p>i apologised because i was wrong in losing my temper. the reasons why i snapped was real to me. the issues were real to me. but i shouldn't have taken them out on you. i was angry at my aunt's friends, and involved you because you both write the same religion on the resume paper.</p>
              <p>and i apologised not because you asked for it, but because i do felt bad after it. in which you said you weren't angry, so there was no need for it. so why are you acting up now? if you're angry, just say you're angry.. nothing wrong with it. pointless in trying to act righteous like you're above being angry over petty issues. if you're angry, and you should be, because i was really horrid, then admit it. i'll apologise again lor.</p>
