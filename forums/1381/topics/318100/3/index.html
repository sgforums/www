              <p>i apologised because i was wrong in losing my temper. the
              reasons why i snapped was real to me. the issues were real to me.
              but i shouldn't have taken them out on you. i was angry at my
              aunt's friends, and involved you because you both write the same
              religion on the resume paper.</p>
              <p>and i apologised not because you asked for it, but because i do
              felt bad after it. in which you said you weren't angry, so there
              was no need for it. so why are you acting up now? if you're angry,
              just say you're angry.. nothing wrong with it. pointless in trying
              to act righteous like you're above being angry over petty issues.
              if you're angry, and you should be, because i was really horrid,
              then admit it. i'll apologise again lor.</p>

              <p>Go back and re-read those posts that I said about baptism at Easter and the condoms and you may see that Catholics do reach out (it's a fact) yet we avoided wrong execution. But if you choose not to see it, then it's your choice to continue to feel that way.</p>
              <p>But you cannot stop me from continuing to dispute with you on this becasue that is unfounded and misleading.......</p>
              <p>In case you have a chance to get a copy of Vanilla (May issue) which I happen to read today at a lounge, there is a article on 110 years old Teresa Hsu (winner of Vanilla Lifetime Achievement Awards). Inspiring story and you may see what I am trying to tell you from there better.</p>

              <p>hmm hmm. may i say smth?</p>
              <p>a gracious person is somebody who gives up his right to be angry
              at the other person, even if he is right. giving in, to avoid an
              argument.</p>
              <p>forgot where i read it b4.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>haha. i don't know if it is a christian thing or a catholic
              thing to always claim that they're above the emotion of anger and
              petty feelings. maybe it's a religious thing. haha..</p>
              <p>like maybe they're taught that if they admit to anger, they're
              spiritually weaker etc, but if they keep up the appearance of not
              being angry, they +1 level</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and it's interesting that he keeps claiming that he isn't angry
              and didn't need an apology (which either means he was never angry
              or felt provoked in the first place, or he did feel angry and
              insulted, but has already forgiven and forgotten), but later on,
              keeps trying to up my lorry and claim that i am not sincere, and in
              a way suggesting that he wants to see some sincerity (by admitting
              that the catholics' teachings are right, perhaps?) so he either has
              an issue with forgiveness, or he's lying about never feeling angry
              in the first place.</p>
              <p>lol, dunno la, only God knows the condition of our hearts,
              right? i've got nothing to prove. can't prove anyway haha.</p>

              <p>yeah, it is fun, actually. =x</p>
              <p>anyway i didn't hurl anymore abuses ah, which was what i'm sorry for. i'm just saying that, if you're angry, then it's ok to say that you're angry. if you're not angry, then why try to up my lorry a few pages ago, after i have apologised? =x</p>
              <p>and i doubt chin eng is angry la. he's too OLD to be angry. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>not happy with you and what you believe in, fine.</p>
              <p>but after an apology is given, still go on and on and on, laced with sarcasm like a broken record.</p>
              <p>....and some more got the cheek to give the "God bless you" at the end of some of the replies....</p>
              <p>.... cannot forgive, cannot let go, cannot love.</p>
