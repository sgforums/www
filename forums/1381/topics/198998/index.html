            <div class='col-md body'><a href="http://www.sabbatarian.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sabbatarian.com</a><br><br>True Sabbatarians are any group of people that honor The Creator's True Seventh Day Sabbath (sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday). See the "International Dateline Dilemma." However, there are many various groups that claim to be Sabbatarian 'Sabbath Keepers.' Regardless of their claims, <span style="color: red;"><strong>The Sabbatarian Network is neither Judaic or Christian nor is it Islamic (Islam has no True Sabbath); but is composed of True Messianic worshippers of The Eternal Creator, according to the example of the sacrificial ministry of 'The True Messiah' (not IHS or Catholic Jesus). We are not a combination of Judaism blended with Christianity, as are the false Messianic, false Nazarene, and 'Jews For Jesus' church groups. The "Sabbatarian Network" is only composed of "True Followers" of Messiah Yahshua of which some are Jewish by birth and some are gentiles by birth. We do not recognize the Catholic (Nicene Creed) man-god savior, Jesus Christ (IHS), as legitimate, because the Roman Catholic Jesus Christ, as presented to the World, never actually existed, as a God, god or a man; while the human Hebrew Messiah (Yahshua) both existed and exists as our Elder Brother, High Priest, Nazarite Priest, Passover Lamb, The First of The First Fruits, and The Creator's Ambassador (Proxy) to mankind. So far, 'The Messiah' is the First and Only human being to be both "Chosen" and "Begotten" by YHVH. The rest of us, who "Follow in the Footsteps of Messiah Yahshua," are "Chosen," but not yet fully "Begotten" (Truly 'Born Again' or 'Resurrected to Immortality'</strong>).</span> There is almost no difference in being "Chosen" and "Fully Begotten," except the passage of time. Time that is required for the "Chosen" to be "Tempered in the Fire," and Time to "Bear Fruit unto Righteousness."<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><a href="http://www.sabbatarian.com/Spotlights/Antichrist.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sabbatarian.com/Spotlights/Antichrist.html</a><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>It also says: </strong></span><br><br><span style="color: red;">So who is the mother of the Anti-Messiah Christopagans?<br><br><strong>The mother church is none other than the Greco-Roman Catholic church, the Protestant churches, the Independent churches, AND anyone or group that follows the pagan traditions established by the catholic church; such as, ChristMass, xmas trees, Easter, Mary worship, baby Jesus worship, Jesus worship, Holy water, the Rosary, Eucharist, Trinity, etc. . As a matter of fact, any tradition that was established by the Roman government's Catholic church and/or followed as a tradition by her daughter Protestant and non-denominational churches should be suspect! This, also, includes the Far Eastern trinitarian religion of Hinduism, and others..</strong></span><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>An argument sounds familiar in EH? </strong></span><br><br><span style="color: green;">However, these false traditions are only the outer appearances of the true Anti-messiah movement.<br><br>The True Anti-messiah belief is the false belief in the Trinity Doctrine of God the Father, God the son, and God the Holy Ghost, but has been modified by some to exclude the Holy Ghost. YHWH is not a Trinity or a Bi-entity; YHVH is One</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>The most funny thing they are using verses from the bible to quote</strong></span><br><br></div>

They changed the Hebrew Messiah's name (Yahshua) to the pagan Greco-Roman name of Jesus, and then abbreviated it as IHS; They called The Messiah "Christ," "Lord," and even G_d; and they called both their Jesus and Our Creator, Lord too (eliminated distinction).</strong><br><br>(2) Then uninspired hellenized (pagan) translators deliberately and ignorantly mistranslated the Holy Scriptures and the Epistles of the Apostles. They confused the distinction between many key terms; such as, between YHVH and Yahshua by calling them both Lord, and G_d. They confused the distinction between the three different heavens and between the three different hells, and the distinction as to what a soul is and is not, they called tribulation or adversity "Evil," they made hades or hell into a place of eternal torment (for purposes of control), they used the confession as a means of political espionage and control, they murdered their opposition, they developed unscriptural church doctrine, and the list goes on and on.<br><br>(3) They incorporated the pagan trinity concept into the Creator. They called YHVH's Righteous Spirit, character or mentality a ghost and made YHVH's Spirit a part of the pagan trinity. 1 John 5 is a deliberate mistranslation.<br><br>(4) They gave a Christopagan appearance and names to pagan gods and goddesses: The Sun gods Apollo or Ra became "YHVH the Father," Horus the sun god became "YHVH the Sun or Son." (Click Vatican Coins to see evidence or go to Photos for more details)<br><br>(5) They elevated the maiden Mary (Miriam) from a human to "Queen of Heaven" and to the mother of God (The original title of the goddess in Jeremiah 7:17-1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, and in doing so, they elevated their Jesus from strictly being in the Flesh to being a deity born of a goddess (Mary, Queen of Heaven) and a non-existent god (Holy Spirit). (see 1 John 4 description of Anti-messiah below).<br><br>(6) Jesus was incorporated into the pagan trinity, and given the same birthday as the pagan god, Mithros, which is December 25th. . Actually, all pagan sun gods have December 25th as their birthday (See Disclaimer).</span></div>
