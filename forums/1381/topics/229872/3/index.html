            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by davidche:<br>The way i see it. The holy communion is used to remember Jesus's death and asking our sins to be forgiven. Some pastors say we can ask for blessing or healing at the same time we pray for forgiving our sins before the communion.<br><br>Ritual? not really, like i said.......................................................(as above lol)..........................................................................................................................<br><br>I would like it if you focus on why we would be judged by God by observing the holy communion...basically whats wrong with it....<br></blockquote>David your pastor has good intentions, it is always good to remember Jesus' death and ask for forgiveness of sins.  But don't you think that it is better to be able to seek forgiveness and ask for blessings/healing all the time instead of just at communion service?  Jesus loves us like a parent and we always can ask him for things anytime.<br><br>One of the reasons why Jesus never asks us to have communion service is that it can cause problems within the church as Paul points out...<br><br><blockquote>1 Corinthians 11:18-19 NIV<br>In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">there are divisions among you</span></strong>, and to some extent I believe it. No doubt there have to be differences among you <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">to show which of you have God's approval.</span></strong></blockquote>Imagine a member skips communion service a couple of times, how to you suppose the others in the same church will treat him?  Now what if the pastor himself skips communion service?<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remember, the communion service does give anybody the right to be holier than anyone else as it is not required by God in the first place.</span></strong><br><br>Thus if the member who skips communion gets told off, or the pastor who absents himself without valid reason gets a warning from his superiors - who is commiting the greater sin here?  Certainly not the 'backsliding' member or the 'errant' pastor.<br><br>Consider the following...<br><br><blockquote>Matthew 18:32-35 NIV<br>"Then the master called the servant in. 'You wicked servant,' he said, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">'I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to. Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?'</span></strong> In anger his master turned him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed.<br><br>"This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart."</blockquote>Thus if the members feel upset that their pastor has absent himself from communion, they are in the wrong.  i.e they perform communion to ask for forgiveness from God but yet do not forgive their brethren pastor.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Compounded to this sin is that when asking for forgiveness during communion they are handling the body and blood of Christ.</span></strong><br><br><blockquote>1 Corinthians 11:27 NIV<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.</strong></span></blockquote>Can you see the kind of problems this creates?</div>

It is but the beginning.  Even now he is our high priest in heaven pleading with his Father to forgive our sins.  Instead of commemorating a person who has died, isn't it better to rejoice with him when he is alive?

To make it simpler for you, do you have any point of references for all those things you had posted.<br>To make even easier, is there a church in the world the subscribe to this trend of thoughts?</span></strong></div>
