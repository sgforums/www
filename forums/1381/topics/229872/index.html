After that he would abstain from such feasting until we are together with him again.<br><br><blockquote>Luke 22:19-23 NIV<br>19And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me</strong></span>."<br><br>20In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you. 21But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table. 22The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed, but woe to that man who betrays him." 23They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this.</blockquote><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note that the above takes appears only in Luke.

In this way, knowing that his happy memories will live on in his disciples hearts he can face the cruxifiction bravely.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>got some sense indeed leh......<br><br><blockquote>Luke 22:14-18 NIV<br>14When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table. 15And he said to them, "<strong>I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. 16For I tell you, I will not eat it again</strong> until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God." </blockquote>Is jesus trying to tell his desiples that this would be the ''last'' supper and that he is going to be killed?? IMO, the bolded highlights the seriousness Jesus wants to put across to his disiples regarding how this supper would be his last meal with them...<br><br>Imagine your friend would be killed after your meal with him. Will you treasue the last moments seriously you have with him, since you know that you would never see him again?  The atmostphere of the meal would be different.<br><br>Thus i feel that what skibi has highlighted is only to say Jesus's emphasis of the seriousness of the meal. this explains, at the same time, why the other disiples did not record those words..<br><br></div>
