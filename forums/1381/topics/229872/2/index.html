The holy communion is used to remember Jesus's death and asking our sins to be forgiven.

Thus he is in a sense fasting.<br><br>This is one of the reasons why I have great respect and love for God as he does not enjoy himself while his followers are suffering.  Rather he shares our pain and suffers together with us.  Only when we are in heaven with him will God break his fast and rejoice together with us in great celebration.</div>
