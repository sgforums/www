            <div class='col-md body'><strong>"So Jesus said to them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day."  John 6:53</strong><br><br><blockquote>When John 6 is prayerfully read, we see how Jesus gradually teaches the faithful about the life-giving bread from heaven that He will give to the world (through the multiplication of the loaves, the reference to the raining manna given to the Israelites, and finally to the bread that Jesus will give which is His flesh). When the Jews question Jesus about how he could possibly give them His flesh to eat, Jesus becomes more literal in His explanation. As we learned in the link on The Eucharist, Jesus says several times that we must eat (in Greek, "phago") His flesh to gain eternal life (which literally means "to chew").<br><br>When the Jews further question the strangeness of His teaching, Jesus uses an even more literal verb (in Greek, "trogo") to describe how we must eat His flesh to have eternal life (which literally means "to gnaw or crunch"). The word Â“trogoÂ” is only used two other times in the New Testament (Matt. 24:38; John 13:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> and it is always used literally (physically eating). Protestants are unable to provide a single example of where "trogo" is ever used in a symbolic sense. To drive His point home, Jesus says that His flesh is real food indeed, and His blood is real drink indeed (Jesus says nothing about the bread being a symbol of His body and blood).<br><br>What is perhaps most compelling about the foregoing passages is what happens at the end of Jesus' discourse. We know that the Jews understood Jesus as speaking literally. This is demonstrated by their question, "How can this man give us His flesh to eat?" They could not conceive of why consuming Jesus' flesh was life-giving and how they could possibly do such a thing. We also know that Jesus responds to their question by being even more literal about eating His flesh and drinking His blood. But we learn at the end of Jesus' discourse that many of His followers, because of the difficulty of His teaching, decided to no longer follow Him - and Jesus let them go. Then He turned to His apostles and asked them, "Will you also go away?" </blockquote><strong>"Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord."<br>1 Corinthians 11:27</strong><br><br>How can u be guilty of PROFANING a symbol???<br><br></div>

These are called the flesh and blood of Christ, because they are purchased by the breaking his body, and the shedding of his blood. Also, because they are meat and drink to our souls. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eating this flesh and drinking this blood mean believing in Christ.</span></strong> We partake of Christ and his benefits by faith. The soul that rightly knows its state and wants, finds whatever can calm the conscience, and promote true holiness, in the redeemer, God manifest in the flesh. Meditating upon the cross of Christ gives life to our repentance, love, and gratitude. We live by him, as our bodies live by our food. We live by him, as the members by the head, the branches by the root: because he lives we shall live also. </strong></div>

After a disputation on the <strong>absolute supremacy of the papacy, purgatory, penance, etc</strong>., lasting twenty-three days (4 JulyÂ–27 July), the arbitrators declined to give a verdict, but the <strong>general impression was that victory rested with Eck. He did succeed in making Luther admit that there was some truth in the Hussite opinions and declare himself against the pope</strong>, but this success only embittered his animosity against his opponents, and from that time his whole efforts were devoted to Luther's overthrow. <strong>Eck was greeted as victor by the theologians of the University of Leipzig</strong>, who overwhelmed him with honors and sent him away with gifts.<br><br>At Baden-in-Aargau from May 21 until June 18, 1526 a public disputation on the <strong>doctrine of transubstantiation </strong>was held, in which <strong>Eck and Thomas Murner were pitted against Johann Oecolampadius</strong>. The affair ended decidedly in favor of Eck, who induced the authorities to enter on a course of active persecution of Zwingli and his followers (Conference of Baden).<br><br>The effect of his victory at Baden was dissipated, however, at the Disputation of Bern (January 152<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, where the <strong>propositions advanced by the Reformers were debated in the absence of Eck, and Bern, Basel, and other places were definitely won for the Reformation</strong>. At the Diet of Augsburg (1530) Eck played the leading part among the Roman Catholic theologians.<br><br>Perhaps they were of equal strength???<br></div>
