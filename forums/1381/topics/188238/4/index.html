            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SingaporeTyrannosaur:</div><div class="quote_body">I am not entirely convinced that all Christians who attack homosexuality do it with an attitude of love. Indeed for many Christians (including me) it involves the hate of what we consider to be the sin, but the whole point of wanting to attack (and in fact even the hate of) the sin has to be out of love for the person who is doing it. If you don't love homosexuals, then you should not be attacking homosexuality at all.</div></blockquote>why do u hate something thats natural???<br><br>im not so sure that u're attacking it because u love the sinner as much as because its something that disturbs your own comfort zone. U have a long way to go towards convincing me that u're really doing it out of their own good because last i looked, it doesn't seem that much different from the Catholic priests of old who accuse people of heresay and make them wear badges of shame or burn them at stake. The 'official' reason being the salvation of the victim's soul. Its rather funny how Xtians would rather lower a person's standard of life on the pretext of saving his soul.<br><br>Besides, last I checked, u're not making sure u're wearing garments of single fibres either, and nobody's attack you for that. I guess it must mean nobody loves u then.<br><br>The problem for many of us who are anti-homophobia is that its a matter of morals for us as well. In this case, the moral being, who are we to decide we have the right to make another human being's life miserable based on our personal beliefs? That doesn't seem moral in ANY way. If thats moral, then the 9/11 attacks are equally moral.</div>

And when i say homosexua christians, i include those who are seemingly 'straight' but are actually repressed homosexuals and this get their motivation for their homophobia from their own repression. In a way, yes its really sad that homosexuals are responsible for the death of other homosexuals, but its often their religion that caused them to reject their own sexuality to begin with, which gives rise to that repression that manifests itself with fierce homophobia.<br><br>Still there are truely straight xtians who r guilty as well, so u can't put all the blame on the repressed homosexual xtians alone.<br><br>3) I already quoted u some of the statistics.<br><br>30% of teen suicides are due to homophobia from religious viewpoints.

            <div class='col-md body'>from www.religioustolerance.org:<br><br>We would point out an analogy in American history. When the U.S. was founded, there was a biblically-based consensus about slavery: that God condoned the institution by issuing parts of the Mosaic law to regulate it. St. Paul had every opportunity to comment on the immorality of slavery, but did not criticize it. It was only when individuals deviated from the Bible's clear statements about slavery that an abolition movement began. To paraphrase Johnston, "<span style="color: red;">It is because we jettisoned as a people that biblical consensus on slavery that we lead to a different position-taking on human bondage based on opinion.</span>" Deviating from the clear mandate of Scriptures, the abolition movement was eventually successfully in freeing the slaves in the U.S. There is a near-consensus that society must jettison much of the Bible's stance on the role of women. There will be a near consensus that the same must happen over homosexuality in the future.</div>

In a way, yes its really sad that homosexuals are responsible for the death of other homosexuals, but its often their religion that caused them to reject their own sexuality to begin with, which gives rise to that repression that manifests itself with fierce homophobia.<br><br>Still there are truely straight xtians who r guilty as well, so u can't put all the blame on the repressed homosexual xtians alone.<br><br>3) I already quoted u some of the statistics.<br><br>30% of teen suicides are due to homophobia from religious viewpoints. U dun consider that a statistic?<br><br>4) Xtian family disagree with the person's lifestyle. They 'disown' him in hope that he will change. Other relatives keep telling him he is sinning badly and that he will burn in hell etc etc. In the end, constant mental abuse from all these people for over 5 years drive the person to suicide.<br></div></blockquote></div>

Because homosexuality is a sin only depending on what your beliefs are. Its not a question of absolute morality. It becomes very tricky to decide who u should help and who u should not. I guess if u're referring to xtian homosexuals who have willingly submitted themselves to the religion, then xtians have every right to enforce the will of yr religion upon them, and make sure they keep in line.<br><br>I will not deny however, that I think its denial of themselves.

Its like chinese people who pretend to be white because they have been told its a sin to be chinese so now they are ex-chinese. This is an anaolgy. I'm not saying there actually are chinese who think its a sin to be chinese so they pretend to be white. However, there is no such thing as ex-homosexual. Its akin to saying someone is ex-chinese. Even Michael Jackson I don't consider him to be ex-black. But he certainly is a good analogy of someone who thinks he is "ex-homosexual" and has "ran away" from sin.<br><br>Just FYI, the age where homosexuality was synonymous with sexual promiscuity is past. As a matter of fact many homosexuals are now seeking to settle down and remain faithful to a single partner. I don't see how that is so sinful. A loving relationship should always be encouraged. In fact I am highly against sexual promiscuity.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is all very simple.<br><br>We as christians, state our point of view. We believe that Homosexuality is a sin, just like any other sin that you and me will commit. i.e. Lying, cursing etc.... Thus, that is the christian point of view. Homosexuality is as common a sin as any other sins in the christian context. So do we hate LIARS? Nay, then we would be hating ourselves. So the christian context is that we hate the sin, love the sinners. Like what Laoda quotes from Philip Yancey, we are all oddballs, we just wanna help each other.<br><br>Then of course, the other camp feels that christians are too insensitive in so called trying to help. And fair enough, there are christians who are too forceful and trying to correct without the love that Jesus Himself would have shown. But of cos, it is entirely the perogative of the person to decide whether or not to heed the advice of the christian. The christian has the right of view just as you have the right to live the lifestyle you want.<br><br>My advice to christians? Say it once, say it twice. If the person does not accept your point of view, fine. Leave it as it is. There is no need to push a point across for the sake of it.<br><br>My advice to non-believers or people who disagrees?

Well then I guess u've not been looking at the world too widely, or choosing only to see whats pleasing to your eyes.<br><br>3) If someone starts another forums for another religion that ACTIVELY attacks and discriminates people for their sexuality(not something that can actually be choosen), then i'll go there and speak up as well. since this forum deals with Xtianity, all context of "religion" we refer to here is xtianity. No doubt some other religions are guilty as well.

U're forgetting there are many instances where the family converts to the Xtian faith later in life. Victim does not have to follow parents in converting to the faith.<br><br>2ndly, even if family is xtian from b4 victim is born, the family need not be "on" xtians. As a result victim need not have had the proper family influence with regards to religion. Afterall, many xtians are from families where majority of the family are of another faith. If this is true, why can't the converse be true also?<br></div>

We believe that Homosexuality is a sin, just like any other sin that you and me will commit. i.e. Lying, cursing etc.... Thus, that is the christian point of view. Homosexuality is as common a sin as any other sins in the christian context. So do we hate LIARS? Nay, then we would be hating ourselves. So the christian context is that we hate the sin, love the sinners. Like what Laoda quotes from Philip Yancey, we are all oddballs, we just wanna help each other.<br><br>Then of course, the other camp feels that christians are too insensitive in so called trying to help. And fair enough, there are christians who are too forceful and trying to correct without the love that Jesus Himself would have shown. But of cos, it is entirely the perogative of the person to decide whether or not to heed the advice of the christian. The christian has the right of view just as you have the right to live the lifestyle you want.<br><br>My advice to christians? Say it once, say it twice. If the person does not accept your point of view, fine. Leave it as it is. There is no need to push a point across for the sake of it.<br><br>My advice to non-believers or people who disagrees? Say it once, say it twice. If the person does not accept your point of view, fine. Leave it as it is.
