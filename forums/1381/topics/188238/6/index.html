Conveniently left out. So you see; whatever the bible is or you claim it to be; it is a bias inaccurate document.</div></blockquote>I'm not to sure what you are trying to drive at by bringing this up. It seems you have not answered any of SGfish's points at all. In fact I did notice you have not answered any of my points at all, what I am getting is a reiteration of your self-evident belief in a certain curious way of considering evidence which I might have pointed up in a lot of cases... isn't that self-evident at all.<br><br>And before we go too far about the Gospel of Judas, I suggest you actually gather the evidence from <span style="font-style: italic;">both</span> sides before you make any claims about the biasessness and inaccuracy of the bible.<br><br>I have actually done my homework... have you?<br><br><blockquote>Roman Catholics as I understand it, have no problems accepting Evolution Theory as proposed by Charles Darwin and refined by others.</blockquote>By my reckoning I don't have much of a beef with it at all. What I can't figure out is this pseudo-scientific religion arising from it that asserts that man is <span style="font-style: italic;">nothing</span> more then an animal with no more rational basis for his being then naturalistic processes. And what is more is that this is a view that is touted as a 'real' belief set on what basis beyond science that now sought to make much judgement on other people's beliefs (they are all just fantasies). There is an incongruence in logic here.<br><br><blockquote>Evolution Theory and creation of the universe in six days cannot co exists unless you say that the creation theory is Christian/Jewish mythology. Parable even. Symbolic... at the level of personal beliefs, it is not a problem... so I say, shamelessly stay in your churches and temples and mosques to encourage each other in your fantasies... but keep out of public forums and schools until you show us the evidence.</blockquote>First and foremost I must state that personal beliefs can never be absolutely kept personal. Or else I might just tell you to stuff your personal beliefs in evidence and carry on my way with absolutely no regard with whatever you are saying.<br><br>Secondly I might point out that any kind of belief when held by a person is personal. Who then is to be judge of that? What if I reject your standard as nonsense? Who is to stop anybody from suggesting that that science is fantasy relentlessly? And how shall you refute him unless there was an absolute system of belief that all have to appeal to?<br><br>I am unconvinced that you have paid any attention or consideration at all to anything that I have been trying to say. What is more it seems that you seem intent on disregarding anything regardless of how reasonable I may try to get it across to you. To date you have yet to answer my questions on the all-emcompassingness of the scientific method, and yet you carry on the very same way.<br><br>Have you bothered to read anything I wrote at all? I can't frankly believe that you have considered them properly for it would at least provoke some useful and progressive discussion from you. It seems that we are just circling around me raising points to every question you put and you raising the same but another religion-is-unverified-and-fantasy song. It is slightly tiresome and dissapointing, especially from somebody who claims to be the bastion of logic versus religious illogic.<br><br>It seems to betray a kind of faith on an equal level of religious fevour on your part... are you here to talk? Or monolouge? You seem to be convincing everybody else of the latter.<br><br>And I have yet to hear your response to my question on the scientific validity of the issue of humanistic freedom, which I suspect might have some far-reaching implications on your very stand. If I am wrong please do refute me, but please, not another shallow religion-is-personal-fantasy reply that is no different in lines from what I have already answered.<br><br>I do not believe in deadlock, and seriously I am starting to doubt your sincerity in here, as much as I have given you the benifit of doubt.</div>

I would like you to present evidence (based on the 'scientific method' mind you) on why do you think evolution is scientific? as far as most people are concerned, evolution is an unproven theory, with many flaws still left unanswered, as only microevolution, which leads to natural selection, is observed (and does not contradict the Bible), whereas macroevolution and any of its characteristics, which is required for stuff like monkeys to turn (or would you say, EVOLVE) into man, has not even been observed before.<br><br>ditto for point number 5. Evolution is a totally unproven theory, hence why should it be taught in public schools anyway?<br><br>furthermore, there are many things that cannot be proven through the scientific method so far. such as the theory of gravitation. Gravity till today, cannot be explained, as quantum gravitation, derived from quantum mechanics, does not agree with the general theory of relativity about gravity. And mind you, these two theories have been observed and in most cases proven correct in most cases through experimentation, and they are far more accurate than any theory of evolution, and they do not contradict the Bible either.<br><br>You mentioning the gospel of Judas, I would like to say that it is a Gnostic text that is not canonical, and was written a long time after the canonical gospels, hence the document is unreliable as a source for the actual historical events in the life of Jesus. Furthermore it wasn't written by any of the apostles or anyone remotely close to them, and this disqualifies it as a reliable source. Furthermore, they do not corroborate with what Jesus said in the four gospels, and hence it was most likely just a Gnostic text written by some random person not closely related to Jesus or the apostles at all.<br><br>ST is right. I have read through the arguments, and you haven't really addressed our points, you're just saying you're right without giving evidence why. This isn't what scientific methodology is is it?</div>

Faith is, to quote "being told from the cradle that it's a virtue to believe in something in spite of lack of evidence". That same faith means people can end up believing and focusing on the wrong things. Within the field of psychology, it is well known that homophobia is often due to insecurity with one's own sexuality, due to repression of one's sexuality. Its not an agenda. It's an end result.<br><br>3) When we say homosexual suicides due to Xtian interference, don't only or primarily refer to suicide cases due to Xtian aid workers trying to help. It primarily involves cases where homosexual victims who have committed suicide have done so with motivating factor for suicide due to depression issues caused by the inacceptance due to a regligious belief(in this case xtian) of the victim by those around them(eg family, relatives, friends, community etc).<br><br>If u don't get a specific number, u dun mind taking a risk that u're going to cause someone's death, as long as that means u can hold fast to your beliefs n impose them on others?<br><br>4) Nope.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SingaporeTyrannosaur:</div><div class="quote_body">If the aim is making somebody miserable for the sake of misery, sadism or ignorance... then it's something that would be morally wrong. But if the whole point of bringing somebody through something really painful is for his ultimate good, then the causation of pain itself cannot be considered to be something that is bad in the larger context.<br><br>Now there is a problem with wanting to keep our personal beliefs to ourselves, and not bother each other with them.<br><br>First and formost it denys any sort of an absolute moral law that everybody is subject to, and that will cause a lot of trouble. Let me demostrate why:<br><br>Firstand formost by highlighting to me the misery that ignorant Xtians inflict on homosexuals you are in fact, highlighting to me the belief that such a thing is wrong and that <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> men should accept it. If this wasn't the case there there would be nothing to argue about... I would quite well simply go 'who cares about your standard? all that matters is what I believe'. But of course we hardly get people who do that, in fact I do see the point you are making.<br><br>Rather they (me) would try to appeal to some common logic that is shared to show why this way of looking at things comes closer to this absolute moral set of laws.<br><br>Now this is important considering personal beliefs. While personal views on absolute moral laws are in no way totally correct (we being fallen humans), they indicate strongly to us that there is a moral absolute out there that all men should listen to. Of course it's then not really a case of if people should keep their own view to themselves, but then a case of how close certain views get to this moral absolute.<br><br>Now this is the kicker: by accepting this principle, we are in fact saying that our personal beliefs <span style="font-style: italic;">should, and must</span> matter to others. This would be impossible to deny. The real debate is not if we should keep to our own views, but rather whose view is closer to this moral absolute. This is the basis of all argument, and the very reason we are even arguing in the first place... that we begin with some common law above all of us and that we all must appeal to that we can disagree on in the first place.<br><br>The problem that arises if we insist that all personal beliefs should be personal we are saying that there is no absolute standard to judge any kind of personal belief. This then would destroy any kind of moral judgement on the 911 hijackers as they simply did what they were convicted to do. As would a murderer who says he has no reason to feel sorry for the killing of women and children as in his own value set, it is the right thing to do... away with all other personal beliefs. In fact such a notion helps, and not destroys homophobia... for homophobia is exactly such a mindset that assumes that one should just do whatever he <span style="font-style: italic;">feels</span> is right about homosexuals without considering any other moral issues. This is of course different from the disagreement that Christians ought to take... I may disagree with what the Soviets in Stalin's regin are doing but that cannot mean that I hate all russians from that time with a passion.<br><br>Now let me say that I agree with you that rabid homophobia is a bad thing, and a stain on the reputation on the Church. For the first thing I doubt Jesus himself was homophobic. But the issue is this: Christians believe that homosexuality in itself is wrong, and that something needs to be done with it just as any other kind of sin needs something to be dealt with. The real issue is not if Christians should do something about it, but if it is in itself an issue that requires the attention of sin-fighting. To stop the mice-catchers one needs to be convinced the things in the cellar are not mice. Of course then much of Christianity considers the act of homosexuality such a 'mouse'.</div></blockquote>Can you quote any eg from the bible abt how did Jesus treat homosexuals in His time on earth? I cannot seem to find any egs.</div>

We are not even within a hundred miles of any kind of theism when we are talking about this. It is your assumption that I am trying to tie in every single argument to God... in fact I have taken great pains not to mention or suggest theism in many of my points, taking an effort to draw examples that are can be directly observed and experimented in real life.

No i dun think u would. Neither do homosexuals. U once again seem to forget they are humans like anyone else, and can feel upset or depressed at the insensitive things others say, REGARDLESS of what religion those "others" belong to. It doesn't mean they're non-Xtian means they dun care about being insulted and being discriminated against. Its got nothing to do with religion. Its got EVERYTHING to do with being HUMAN and behaving in a way HUMANS do when they feel insulted, discriminated against, and hostile against.<br><br>and please. don't come and tell me "if they're not xtian they shouldn't feel insulted..." u say that means u still cannot understand such a simple concept. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>3) Guilty? why would u need to feel im making u feel guilty? Unless of course u full well know inside that u ARE guilty of something.<br><br>I'll also ask u to stop assuming anyone who is against homophobia is gay. It smacks totally of ignorant and prejudiced, bigotted thinking.<br><br>4) I disagree. Religion is a personal choice, and just because u're born into a Xtian family dun mean u're Xtian. That is a rubbish argument really. So now u're discriminating against other religions also la. Child is not taoist/buddhist even if parents is, while child cannot not be Xtian if parents are. Why? because u're xtian huh? So other religions that are not yours do not enjoy the same day to day reality as your religion <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Don't I just love it when people like u start bandying Xtian supremacist attitudes around. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote></div>

Furthermore it wasn't written by any of the apostles or anyone remotely close to them, and this disqualifies it as a reliable source.

We know who the bigots are here ya? Its always so pathetic when people have to recycle words which have been used against them.<br><br>So now im attack Xtianity to feel good, ohhhh so smart. steal what i say again about Xtians attacking homosexuality to make themselves feel good. Sorry leh. Doesn't work. How would i feel good having to get engaged in hot debate with some thick bigotted people all the time? I would much rather be chillin and not caring if the world lives or dies. I do it only because part of me cannot stand it seeing how u people contribute to the misery that this world already has too much of. Crocodile tears, can u spell it kids?</div></blockquote></div>
