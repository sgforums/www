Personal belief is perhaps the <span style="font-style: italic;">most</span> important thing!<br><br>The notion that there ought to be a consensus on a certain truth, and the regardment of that truth as the 'truth' would be total nonsense! While personal beliefs can be made to align to certain ideas of thought, they cannot be taken simply out for consensus' motives. This would then be the bane of any system of though, be it religon and science. Where would relativity be if dear Albert decided it was better to stick with popular notions of gravity? Where would we be if Jesus decided not to reveal anything new cos the old system had been going on for a while and it was best not to disturb it? Disaster I tell you!<br><br>True believers would want to form a personal belief on truth, and hold to that, as opposed to having somebody elses' faith. All belief systems have grown out from personal belief at some point of time, and they are a view on absolute truth. Our main arguments of course, is if this or that certain personal view gets closer to the absolute truth or not. All men interested in debate accept this principle, if not there would be nothing to debate about in the first place should be not believe that there is an absolute.<br><br>I did not for a moment think 'to hell with your standard', but yet of course, I see a common ground by which you, even by your own reasonings, <span style="font-style: italic;">ought</span> to see things in certain ways more congruent with my own.<br><br>So yes, what you personally believe is of paramount importance. If that is not expressed then there would be nothing to talk about at all... what good is reaching any 'agreement' on Religious Faith when the debaters decide their personal ideas on it don't matter in trying to determine it? It's as good as saying nothing, and a rejection of reason in the first place. I am surprised to hear this coming out of you.</div>

Talk is cheap.</div></blockquote>Aye, I did not think I deserve the 'talk is cheap' comment, especially since I decided to answer you with much careful thought and not with statements I did not honestly think I could not back up. Surely it is unjustified to hold such a low opinion of me? As much as we have differences, do differences justify certain malices?<br><br>But since you so ask I shall indulge you.<br><br>I must immediately refer you to the curious notion as to why you think the 'scientific method' is the best. Now lets throw all religious notions of faith and that out of the window for a moment and assume that God does not matter or exist and that Christianity is nonsense and in no competition with science.<br><br>Very well then, lets say you are right and we are in such a universe then... why would you consider the 'scientific method' the best? Do you not regard it as a very curious notion that unless one had grounds in believing in something being the best he has no right in making claims to it as being the best.<br><br>Now before I get started on anything, I would like to wonder indeed why is the 'scientific method' considered the best indeed?</div>

I am a christian and when I say that I mean I believe in Jesus, that He died to save me from my sins and that through Him, I have salvation and eternal life. I also believe in the bible as the true LIVING Word of God and all that it is in it is truth. I try to follow the example that Jesus gave us and I also go back to biblical or hebraic roots which is how the early christians (who were Jews by the way) did things. They would have understood keeping the sabbath, they would have understood celebration of the Lords feasts. Even Paul, was a Jew and he would not have done any different.<br><br>Understand whos children we are becoming and then understand or Father and our GOD.</div>
