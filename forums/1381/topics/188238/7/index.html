            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SingaporeTyrannosaur:</div><div class="quote_body">I apologize for the double post, my computer was having some troubles with sgforums...<br><br>Hmm... you are making a statement on Christian theology from within itself. Would you like to back up that statement? Before we go into detail with that from material I suspect you might nto be familiar with, but yet choose to make big statements on?<br><br>Frankly I think it would be good for the hustling and heckling to stop. I would serious doubt the intellectual intergity of a person whose sole justifiation for being an intellectual comes from how strongly he holds to a certain, curious way of viewing the world.<br><br>I am not sure whose head is in the sand here. Is this truly thinking... or could it be pedantry? Which is intellectual rigour applied to no particular end except perhaps self-importance?</div></blockquote>So I gather from this post you finally understood what I was getting at when I said you were confused in comparing concepts like "freedom" and "entities like God" when discussing "The Scientific Method."<br><br>Similarly you are confused here.. the answer is "No" to your question: could it be pedantry? Which is intellectual rigour applied to no particular end except perhaps self-importance?<br><br>The correct answer is: this is a forum... go and get it clear in your mind what a forum is for.<br><br>As for the statement: Law is a mirror and not a Tool.... let's quote Jesus.<br><br><blockquote>Taken from the bible:<br>"In my Father's house are many homes. If it weren't so, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you." and "Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, except through me."</blockquote> What was Jesus teaching here? A way to heaven? Heaven as in a physical location? Meeting "God" in "Heaven?"<br><br><blockquote>Taken from the bible:"Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.... Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."<br><br>"Nicodemus said to him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?"</blockquote>In my perception or "theory" as one kind soul here puts it, what Jesus says is not to be taken literally. In fact the whole Bible is not to be taken literally.<br><br>The Bible would then sit comfortably with the Scientific Journals.<br><br>As far as I am concerned; "going to heaven" and "born again" are the same thing. When you are born again, you are in "heaven," you are in the "Kingdom of God."<br><br><blockquote>Taken from the bible:" He said, "How will we liken the Kingdom of God? Or with what parable will we illustrate it? It's like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth, yet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow."</blockquote>See? The Kingdom of God is right here on earth. If the Kingdom of God is on earth, then God is on earth and heaven is on earth.<br><br>If you do not agree with what I have just said, then it is pointless to go on... the rest of what I have to say is built on these concepts.</div>

No to begin with I was quite distinct in my own mind of the concepts of 'God' and 'freedom', as quite separate things the moment I made my first argument. It seems to me that the confusion is your own.<br><br>Firstly it seems it is you who are adamant on trying to drag God into the picture of freedom when I have at first already said that we'll have it your way. I have assumed for your sake that all this notions of God is proven nonsense, and hence let's look at freedom instead.<br><br>Do we dare apply the same logic we did to God with freedom? What is the answer we will get? And would we accept such an answer?<br><br>And also I wish that we would refrain from guessing each other's frame of mind, firstly it's actually distracting from the real debate, where it seems that you are more preoccupied with apparent 'confusion', 'fantasies', and the state of the debaters' mind. Secondly it seems to keep us going on for post onto post without ending of 'you're confused-no you really are- no you are the one who is really confused-' without even scraching the topic.<br><br>Which is it you are more interesting in doing?

It's like answering to some complicated mathematical sum 'the answer is a number'. I can't imagine how being in a forum for a moment suspends certain basic laws of intellectual honesty, and basic respect and due consideration for opposing points of view.<br><br>A forum is for speaking a point of view and interacting via views, just as a mouth is for eating. But I suspect the real question is if this speaking or eating is actually appropriate or fruitful in any way.<br><br>I have yet to see any hard justification for eating any amount of any kind of material on the sheer virtue of having a mouth, I doubt a forum is excluded from the same logic.<br><br>Very well that one can state your personal beliefs and points, but do it in a unfruitful, intellectually suspect and pseudoscientific way leaves much to be desired. And is the demand for a higher quality of debate unjustified?<br><br><blockquote>As for the statement: Law is a mirror and not a Tool.... let's quote Jesus.</blockquote>Whatever happened to context? One of the higher scientific virtues?<br><br>Dare we debate the context and merits of the statement as you try to suggest it in? I suspect it might lead to many ontological and metaphysical questions that I have yet to see much display of skill in your particular style and method of reasoning.<br><br>Sigh, I do truly wish that you would choose a style of argument that actually tries to consider the claims of Christianity from within itself, and perhaps think for a moment 'what if it is true?'<br><br>Especially when I have given so much space to your own point, going as far as to think from as atheistic frame of mind.

But yet I find the claim that it should entirely be allegory suspect, but yet again it's a point that is too chim to discuss on a tail end of a post.<br><br>I might suspect there are several scientific principles that one can be tempted to take too literallyÂ… care you think how that might be possible?<br></div>
