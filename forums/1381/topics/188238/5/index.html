Its like chinese people who pretend to be white because they have been told its a sin to be chinese so now they are ex-chinese. This is an anaolgy. I'm not saying there actually are chinese who think its a sin to be chinese so they pretend to be white. However, there is no such thing as ex-homosexual. Its akin to saying someone is ex-chinese. Even Michael Jackson I don't consider him to be ex-black. But he certainly is a good analogy of someone who thinks he is "ex-homosexual" and has "ran away" from sin.<br><br>Just FYI, the age where homosexuality was synonymous with sexual promiscuity is past. As a matter of fact many homosexuals are now seeking to settle down and remain faithful to a single partner. I don't see how that is so sinful. A loving relationship should always be encouraged. In fact I am highly against sexual promiscuity.<br></div></blockquote>So u are saying all the testimonies by homosexuals who are Christians are false?<br><br>Even if homosexuality remain faithful to a single partner, the problems are not going to be solved. As I have said, it is not an exclusive thing for Christians to think of homosexuality as a sin. Some cultures, such as Chinese culture, view it as a taboo too. Whether promiscuity or not, especially in Asian countries/culture, homosexuality is going to remain a taboo for many years to come.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. Well, at least not in Singapore, I dun see Christians running around and hitting homosexuals on the head with the bible =)<br><br>3. U want to make people guilty of what? Hmm...better spend more time spreading word for your cause that homosexuality is normal and should be encouraged.<br><br>4. It is very, very difficult for a child belong to a Christian family not to be Christian, but easier for a child not to be taoist/buddhist even if his family is.<br>IMO, no doubt the parents will be sad, help should be engaged for the child, with the church, with friends. No means should be taken to encourage the homosexual lifestyle.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">1) well welcome to 2006. Have u been looking at the wave of religious(Xtian) fundamentalism sweeping USA lately? No? Well then I guess u've not been looking at the world too widely, or choosing only to see whats pleasing to your eyes.<br><br>3) If someone starts another forums for another religion that ACTIVELY attacks and discriminates people for their sexuality(not something that can actually be choosen), then i'll go there and speak up as well. since this forum deals with Xtianity, all context of "religion" we refer to here is xtianity. No doubt some other religions are guilty as well. But hey if it makes u feel good that Xtianity is EVEN part of it, instead of being solely guilty of it, I'm not too surprised.<br><br>As for this:<br><br>"If the person is non-christian and cannot care less what/how christians are saying abt them, can that person be driven to death by christians? "<br><br>Please lah. u want me to say how many times? Ok thats it, i say u are thick.<br><br>4) How come u keep refusing to accept that someone can be non-xtian when his or her family is xtian? A child doesn't have to follow his parent's faith.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>There is zero logic in this statement:<br><br>"If the family is entirely Christian/Christian background, how can the victim be not a christian?"<br><br>1stly, u're assuming the family is Xtian from before the victim is born. U're forgetting there are many instances where the family converts to the Xtian faith later in life. Victim does not have to follow parents in converting to the faith.<br><br>2ndly, even if family is xtian from b4 victim is born, the family need not be "on" xtians. As a result victim need not have had the proper family influence with regards to religion. Afterall, many xtians are from families where majority of the family are of another faith. If this is true, why can't the converse be true also?<br></div></blockquote></div>

Information derived through human empiricism and rationalism is all based on perception, which we until today, have not really proved that it is entirely accurate.<br><br>Without delving too far into the epistemological realm, what i'm trying to say is that what we as humans perceive and measure not necessarily are true, due to many limitations that we often overlook, hence we cannot scientifically prove whether there is a God or not. My personal take is that if God had made it so easy for us to know all this, faith would not be required at all, and faith is one thing that enables God to do great works through us.<br><br>For a 'scientific method' way of justifying why I believe, I have to state that the main tenets of Christianity rests on the Bible. The Bible is a historically reliable source of information, as every place in there described was confirmed by archaeological finds, and writings of secular historians also corroborate with the Bible on many accounts.<br><br>Having established the Bible as a historically inerrant document, the Bible was written by multiple people over a period of time spanning generations, yet the whole Bible flows as a single piece of literature, and this gives evidence that the people who wrote it were inspired by God. Furthermore, Jesus fulfilled all 48 prophecies of a messiah that were written in the old testament, and the odds of any one man fulfilling all 48 are 1 in 10^157. By the science of probability, this rules out any random person accidentally fulfilling them, as in comparison, the number of electrons in the universe is estimated to be 10^79.<br><br>These are just a few points that i have raised. I shall stop here as I have to study for some upcoming tests soon. </div></blockquote>Remeber the Gospel of Judas? Conveniently left out. So you see; whatever the bible is or you claim it to be; it is a bias inaccurate document.<br><br>Roman Catholics as I understand it, have no problems accepting Evolution Theory as proposed by Charles Darwin and refined by others.<br><br>Evolution Theory and creation of the universe in six days cannot co exists unless you say that the creation theory is Christian/Jewish mythology. Parable even. Symbolic... at the level of personal beliefs, it is not a problem... so I say, shamelessly stay in your churches and temples and mosques to encourage each other in your fantasies... but keep out of public forums and schools until you show us the evidence.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by HENG@:<br>why do u hate something thats natural???<br><br>im not so sure that u're attacking it because u love the sinner as much as because its something that disturbs your own comfort zone. U have a long way to go towards convincing me that u're really doing it out of their own good because last i looked, it doesn't seem that much different from the Catholic priests of old who accuse people of heresay and make them wear badges of shame or burn them at stake. The 'official' reason being the salvation of the victim's soul. Its rather funny how Xtians would rather lower a person's standard of life on the pretext of saving his soul. </blockquote>You raise valid issues.<br><br>First and foremost I will not deny the fact that all too often the concern with somebody's soul has been raised up as a facade for an actual hate attack on that person. This is a fact and attitude I will not try to deny in Christians because it is the very thing that disgusts me itself.<br><br>But the real question is if <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> Christians are like that, or do it with this motive. This would not then be a very fair judgement to make, especially when fairness for Homosexuals is concerned, the proponents of that notion should be fair to their percieved opponents as well. Let's not lump this with all Xtians or else it's not really different from making the homophobe's mistake, which is ignorance and prejudgements.<br><br>And another question is this. If you believe that something is wrong and would ultimately harm that person, and you truly <span style="font-style: italic;">love</span> that person in the end. How then would you want to act? Would it be possible to make every single action congruent with that person's desires?<br><br><blockquote>Besides, last I checked, u're not making sure u're wearing garments of single fibres either, and nobody's attack you for that. I guess it must mean nobody loves u then.</blockquote>I guess somebody might attack me (and rightfully so) if the garments I worn were derived from the bodies of their loved ones. I suspect the real problem is not if such an action is 'natural', but if it is right or wrong. Not unless one wants to take the view that all that comes naturally is correct. That notion I am not convinced of. For instance I can figure out a lot of things that come naturally to us that are not correct, as much as we may like to indulge them.<br><br>The problem with Christianity is that it is something that is quite explicitly anti-natural. It consists of doing a lot of things that would go against our natural instincts and desires. The real question I feel is if such a thing is right. I believe it is, the moment we consider the consquences of many unhindered naturalistic behaviours.<br><br><blockquote>The problem for many of us who are anti-homophobia is that its a matter of morals for us as well. In this case, the moral being, who are we to decide we have the right to make another human being's life miserable based on our personal beliefs? That doesn't seem moral in ANY way. If thats moral, then the 9/11 attacks are equally moral.</blockquote>If the aim is making somebody miserable for the sake of misery, sadism or ignorance... then it's something that would be morally wrong. But if the whole point of bringing somebody through something really painful is for his ultimate good, then the causation of pain itself cannot be considered to be something that is bad in the larger context.<br><br>Now there is a problem with wanting to keep our personal beliefs to ourselves, and not bother each other with them.<br><br>First and formost it denys any sort of an absolute moral law that everybody is subject to, and that will cause a lot of trouble. Let me demostrate why:<br><br>Firstand formost by highlighting to me the misery that ignorant Xtians inflict on homosexuals you are in fact, highlighting to me the belief that such a thing is wrong and that <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> men should accept it. If this wasn't the case there there would be nothing to argue about... I would quite well simply go 'who cares about your standard? all that matters is what I believe'. But of course we hardly get people who do that, in fact I do see the point you are making.<br><br>Rather they (me) would try to appeal to some common logic that is shared to show why this way of looking at things comes closer to this absolute moral set of laws.<br><br>Now this is important considering personal beliefs. While personal views on absolute moral laws are in no way totally correct (we being fallen humans), they indicate strongly to us that there is a moral absolute out there that all men should listen to. Of course it's then not really a case of if people should keep their own view to themselves, but then a case of how close certain views get to this moral absolute.<br><br>Now this is the kicker: by accepting this principle, we are in fact saying that our personal beliefs <span style="font-style: italic;">should, and must</span> matter to others. This would be impossible to deny. The real debate is not if we should keep to our own views, but rather whose view is closer to this moral absolute. This is the basis of all argument, and the very reason we are even arguing in the first place... that we begin with some common law above all of us and that we all must appeal to that we can disagree on in the first place.<br><br>The problem that arises if we insist that all personal beliefs should be personal we are saying that there is no absolute standard to judge any kind of personal belief. This then would destroy any kind of moral judgement on the 911 hijackers as they simply did what they were convicted to do. As would a murderer who says he has no reason to feel sorry for the killing of women and children as in his own value set, it is the right thing to do... away with all other personal beliefs. In fact such a notion helps, and not destroys homophobia... for homophobia is exactly such a mindset that assumes that one should just do whatever he <span style="font-style: italic;">feels</span> is right about homosexuals without considering any other moral issues. This is of course different from the disagreement that Christians ought to take... I may disagree with what the Soviets in Stalin's regin are doing but that cannot mean that I hate all russians from that time with a passion.<br><br>Now let me say that I agree with you that rabid homophobia is a bad thing, and a stain on the reputation on the Church. For the first thing I doubt Jesus himself was homophobic. But the issue is this: Christians believe that homosexuality in itself is wrong, and that something needs to be done with it just as any other kind of sin needs something to be dealt with. The real issue is not if Christians should do something about it, but if it is in itself an issue that requires the attention of sin-fighting. To stop the mice-catchers one needs to be convinced the things in the cellar are not mice. Of course then much of Christianity considers the act of homosexuality such a 'mouse'.</div>

And fundamentalist Xtians dun run around hitting ppl on the head with bibles either. They just simply discriminate as a whole, against some people. and lower their quality of life.<br><br>Let me ask u, would u like to live in a place where everybody refused to talk to u, are unfriendly to you, and treat u like a 3rd class citizen? No i dun think u would. Neither do homosexuals. U once again seem to forget they are humans like anyone else, and can feel upset or depressed at the insensitive things others say, REGARDLESS of what religion those "others" belong to. It doesn't mean they're non-Xtian means they dun care about being insulted and being discriminated against. Its got nothing to do with religion. Its got EVERYTHING to do with being HUMAN and behaving in a way HUMANS do when they feel insulted, discriminated against, and hostile against.<br><br>and please. don't come and tell me "if they're not xtian they shouldn't feel insulted..." u say that means u still cannot understand such a simple concept. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>3) Guilty? why would u need to feel im making u feel guilty?

That is a rubbish argument really. So now u're discriminating against other religions also la. Child is not taoist/buddhist even if parents is, while child cannot not be Xtian if parents are. Why? because u're xtian huh? So other religions that are not yours do not enjoy the same day to day reality as your religion <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Don't I just love it when people like u start bandying Xtian supremacist attitudes around. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
