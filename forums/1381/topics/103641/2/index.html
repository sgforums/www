            <div class='col-md body'>Com'on man... I don't see any reconcilliation between christianity and science. First, almost all the things written there r proven by science to be false. Bible do not believe in evolution, a billion years old galaxy and noah ark to fail to carry all the animals in the world. Not only so, the essense of christianity is against the essence of science. In science, they ask u to reason, to use logics and to prove out and allow other people to verify your theories. For christianty, they force u to stop using your reasoning and logic, they seek blind obedience and ask people to have faith so they do not need to verify anything. The only thing tat why the people in here say tat science is a reconcillation betwen christianity is just because of the following<br><br><blockquote>Science is useful for answering the 'how?' questions, describing how things work. What science can't do is answer the 'why?</blockquote>The answer is, there is no reason to ask why. Science believes tat things come out naturally and not planned. If things come out naturally, then there isn't have a purpose to begin with. If u believe tat everything is here for a purpose, then u already is biased and have a form of religion in place.<br><br><blockquote>science has in fact helped religion exert its influence in the modern day world. take for example, christian networks all over the world. through such programmes, one can become a christian just by calling a hotline. </blockquote>Tis just meant science is used as a tool. Similarly science had also made terrorists or other religions or countries or cults to exert its influence too. Saying tat science has helped religion to exert its influence is the same as saying tat knives help christainity to exert its influence during its crusaders days. U should see tat their enemies is using knives as well.<br><br><blockquote>science and religion should coexist together. they are not mutually exclusive, for the idea of being so mechanized in today's world has created a void in us that science is not only unable to fill, but amplifies. this is when religion comes in, to fill the void inside us -- after all humans have a psychological affinity with religion. </blockquote>Strangely there r many non believer tat do not experience tis void<br><br><blockquote>religion shld serve as a moral guideline for scientists when they carry out their research. having religious consciousess actually helps curb the abuse of science.</blockquote>Moral doesn't have to stemmed from a religion. People r aware of how to live in society and repurcussion from a certain action. We need morals, not religion and morals and religion r mutually exclusive<br><br><blockquote>while science appeals to the head, religion appeals to the heart</blockquote>If it isn't right, why believe in it ? Before u let your heart take control, first establish the facts tat your putting your emotion in is worth it<br><br><blockquote>science will one day prove religions to be false? hmm... think again. in what ways does science prove religion false? </blockquote>Earth revolves around sun, earth is not flat, evolution is true, galaxy not crated in days, galaxy not 10,000 years old, Noah ark is impossible, population couldn't have bcome so diverse after noah and so on and so forth</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with SiS , those people who turn to religion are finding a easy way out of finding out about things . Apparently for them God is the greatest but how can they prove it? It just takes some common sense to find out what to do and not , instead of relying on religion. Is it okay to steal ? Definitely not if your own things were stolen. So on and so forth... To me , Jesus is just a person cashing in to the Jewish fate that he's the messiah. Some chosed to believe , some not .. Now it evolved to a cult , evolution does exists . God evolved from an almightly ruler to someone who gets his son to do the job and finally someone who watchs the world go chaotic. He changed , so did many things in the world. That's evolution too. Music evolves too , are we always listening to classical , never to change but believing that it's the only best? If God created all this , why new forms of things still appear? Is all this out of God's control? He's giving us free will ? Just because some couple eat a fruit , he decide to leave the world alone by condemning them? If I were him , I would reprimand them , make them understand. God don't give warnings , why did he gives reminders then? Reminders just as Jesus , so many prophets ? Okay , their own will .. Only God have the answer to all these , but he's not doing justice to his 'creations' , letting them survive on blind faith alone.</div>

In fact, it should be that religion mellows down and play along the science line.<br><br>Think about it. Many people of all faiths would attribute disaster, miracles and paranormal activities to god and religion, in the past. Heck, hardly any sane people wouldnt be saying such things in modern time. Religion therefore approach a different line to convert people to their side.

Futuyma <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-fact.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-fact.html </a><br><br><strong>A few words need to be said about the "theory of evolution," which most people take to mean the proposition that organisms have evolved from common ancestors. In everyday speech, "theory" often means a hypothesis or even a mere speculation. But in science, "theory" means "a statement of what are held to be the general laws, principles, or causes of something known or observed." as the Oxford English Dictionary defines it. The theory of evolution is a body of interconnected statements about natural selection and the other processes that are thought to cause evolution, just as the atomic theory of chemistry and the Newtonian theory of mechanics are bodies of statements that describe causes of chemical and physical phenomena. In contrast, the statement that organisms have descended with modifications from common ancestors--the historical reality of evolution--is not a theory. It is a fact, as fully as the fact of the earth's revolution about the sun. Like the heliocentric solar system, evolution began as a hypothesis, and achieved "facthood" as the evidence in its favor became so strong that no knowledgeable and unbiased person could deny its reality. No biologist today would think of submitting a paper entitled "New evidence for evolution;" it simply has not been an issue for a century. </strong></div>

The only difference is one is a descriptive explanation while the other can show its behavior mathematically. In short, theories r models tat explain a certain phenomenon in which sometimes laws r derived from it. There r a lot of other science theories as well<br><br><strong>Atomic Theory</strong>: This theory states that the atom is the smallest unit of matter. The atom is composted of the nucleus in the middle of the atom that is composed of neutrons and protons (both of these may break down into smaller particles). The neutrons have no charge. The protons have a positive charge.  Surround the nucleus are electrons that swirl around the nucleus in a large region, rather than orbiting in a fixed pattern (electron cloud). The electrons have a negative charge.  Many modern scientists have contributed to our current view of the atom in which the electrons swirl around the nucleus in a large region (electron cloud), rather than orbiting in a fixed pattern. Plus modern quantum theory shows how atomic particles such as electrons may also be seen as having wavelike properties (see below).<br><br><strong>Gravity Theory</strong>: Gravitation, or gravity, is a force that attracts all objects in the universe. The most familiar of the four fundamental interactions of matter, gravitation has several characteristics that distinguish it from the other interactions. (1). It is universal, (2). it is always attractive, (3). it is a long-range interaction, and (4). it is a long-range attractive force affecting all matter.<br><br><strong>Cell Theory</strong>: The cell theory of life states: (1). All living material is made up of cells; (2). all cells are derived from previously existing cells; most cells arise by cell division, but in sexual organisms they may be formed by the fusion of sperm and egg; (3). a cell is the most elementary unit of life; (4). every cell is bounded by a plasma membrane, an extremely thin skin separating it from the environment and from other cells; (5). all cells have strong biochemical similarities; and (6). most cells are small, about 0.001 cm (0.0004 in) in length; for example, the smallest cells of the microorganism mycoplasma are 0.3 micrometers in size, whereas some giant algae cells may be several centimeters long.<br><br><strong>Quantum Theory</strong>: This theory that says that energy exist in tiny discrete units called quanta. Just as earlier theory showed how light, generally seen as a wave motion, could also in some ways be seen as composed of discrete particles (photons), quantum theory shows how atomic particles such as electrons may also be seen as having wavelike properties. Quantum theory is the basis of particle physics, modern theoretical chemistry, and the solid-state physics that describes the behavior of the silicon chips used in computers. Quantum theory and the theory of relativity together form the theoretical basis of modern physics.  Later work by scientists elaborated the theory into what is called quantum mechanics (or wave mechanics).<br><br><strong>The Germ Theory of Disease</strong>: French bacteriologist Louis Pasteur is considered the founder of microbiology. Pasteur argued that infectious diseases were caused by germs.  The germ theory has affect our views on infectious disease, surgery, hospital management, agriculture, and industry<br><br>DO u believe tat atoms r made from proton, neutrons and electrons ? Do u believe in gravity ? Do u believe tat living things r made up of cells ? Do u believe in photons which is used to explain the discrete level of energy of element ? Do u believe tat germs exists ? Surely these r science knowledge tat even kids knows about</div>
