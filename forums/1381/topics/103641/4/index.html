It deals with both facts (unchangeable) and theories (changeable).</strong><br></blockquote>Science does not deal with facts? Dealing with facts is the very essence of Science. How do you know what is a fact and what is not? Through Science. How can you disprove a scientific theory? Through science. Scientific methods may be flawed but thats only because they fail to address certain assumptions in their reasoning. The basis of Science is logical reasoning. How can logical reasoning be flawed? Unless you believe that human reason will always be flawed. If so, then how do you know that the interpretation of the Bible is not flawed?<br><br>Anyway, Science is agnostic. It neither proves nor disproves the existence of God. And I read somewhere most Scientists believe in God. However, although Science do not contradict the idea of a God, it does contradict the idea of a Christian God e.g evolution and the other stuff mentioned before.<br><br>Its obvious that Christianity has changed over the years. In fact, there are several different branches of Christianity now. People seem to change religion to fit their lifesytles rather than change their lifestyles to fit religion. Then how do you know that this version of Christianity is the right one? What if maybe 2000 years later, people realised that this generation had been misinterpreting the Bible?<br><br>Fire in Hell. Fire being a human concept. Angels with wings. Wings being a human concept.   Apple, snake and tree...all human concepts.<br><br>Christianity is in no way closer to finding the truth than science is.

Thinking too much doesn't make science any lesser than it is now. The Godel's undecidability theorem can also run on religious belief as well. It is not specially on science anyway so tat still make science more reliable than religious.
