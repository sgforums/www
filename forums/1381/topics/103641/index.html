            <div class='col-md body'>Short of saying what science and christianity says, there is definitely room for science and christianity to co-exist.  Science has given us alot. When we are sick, we get medicine. this is just one example of the goodness of science and the importance to us.<br><br>However, we need to be clear about the limitations of science. When we come to the most important questions in life, scientists can only provide very limited answers.<br><br>Science is useful for answering the 'how?' questions, describing how things work. What science can't do is answer the 'why?' questions - it can't explain why things are as they are. Let me give you a few examples that I would credit from some sources which is forgotten by me...(cos i keep them in my computer whenever I find one):<br><br>"Think of Isaac Newton sitting underneath the apple tree. He gets hit on the head by an apple and thinks to himself, "Aha! Gravity!". Now we may be tempted to think that he explained why the apple fell. He didn't. Scientists still can't tell us why the apple fell. Isaac Newton's great achievement was to describe how it fell. What he said was that the same mathematical formula that describes how the apple fell (the inverse square law) also describes the attraction between any lumps of matter. He described how this happens - he didn't explain why.<br><br>Let's take another example. Why are you breathing? A scientist could describe how you are breathing. If he hadn't given the problem much thought he might feel he was answering the why question by saying "Because your muscles are lifting your rib cage, creating a negative pressure in your chest and drawing in air." But why, I would then ask, are the muscles doing this? .... "Because a raised partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood circulating through your brain results in the activation of nerves which stimulate our chest muscles." Well why is that? ... "Because your cells are producing carbon dioxide." But why is that? ... "Because of the action of intracellular enzymes." But why is that?... "Because the enzymes are coded by a DNA template." And why is that? ....why? ...why? .... Do you see that we could keep asking "why?" because what the scientist is actually doing is not explaining why but describing how?"<br><br>But wait, I am not saying that the bible then can tell you why exactly for everything. What I am trying to say is that while science is so important in our lives, it is not everything and cannot prove everything and certainly is not infallible or without error.<br><br>I am not going to go into what the bible says but the bible and science can definitely co-exist to help us not understand the purpose of things around us but also the purpose of us being here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I seek to differ. In fact, religion is doing the same as what science is doing: explaining the how and not why of the world around us.<br><br>Take for example the bible; it tells us how the jewish god created the world and not why; it tells us that the human race decended from 2 persons and not why the jewish god created human.<br><br>Pardon me for sounding blasphemous but the most fundamental question would be: why did god exist?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bear in mind many religions existed for many centuries. Unless they have been fully described as such by reliable third parties, religion has never been reconciling with science in the first place.<br><br>Bear in mind people like Galileo who kept quiet about telling the church who view anything like the fact that the earth revolves the sun as heretic, Took sometime for the Church to recognise that.<br><br>Bear in mind too, early Christians strive to rid of anything unfamiliar to Christianity, such as the Alexanderian science and paganism in and out of the Roman Empire.<br><br>Archimedes was left floating out of sphere till some good souls bring him back. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Lastly, imagine for the last two hundred years, without these advances in technology, will we be still so good as to say religion wanna reconcile with science?<br><br>In fact, i viewed that, because technology has such huge impact on our lives, with the fact many people are becoming secular and do not believe in any religion at all, its fruitless to talk about religion to them. In fact, it should be that religion mellows down and play along the science line.<br><br>Think about it. Many people of all faiths would attribute disaster, miracles and paranormal activities to god and religion, in the past. Heck, hardly any sane people wouldnt be saying such things in modern time. Religion therefore approach a different line to convert people to their side. Only recently do i see religion trying to play along logic and science, rather than faith, Many overly educated people of today would definitely not listen to anything illogical or cannot be proven by science.<br><br>While i do not deny religion may reconcile with science, bear in mind, it is only becoming a recent trend, rather than something that is there all along.<br><br>Similarly, if there is no technology or science on the tip of our tongue today, i think, we will be all condemning science like hell today..<br></div>
