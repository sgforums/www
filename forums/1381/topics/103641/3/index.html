In your previous post u ask why does the term "theory" remain for evolution. I tell u tat being labelled as theory is already very prestigious. The examples like atoms, protons, gravity etc is to show tat the term <strong>THEORIES</strong> ALREADY MEANT TAT IT IS WIDELY ACCEPTED AS A FACT, AND LAWS ARE SOMETIMES DERIVED FROM THESE THEORIES. It is not to show tat they r linked to evolution  or anything, but to show tat evolution too is a theory and it meant it had achieve facthood and is said tat "logical and rational people would accept it as being true". If u think tat protons, electrons etc r true, then u should accept evolution as true since they r graded by almost all the scientists to be at the same level. Tat is they r all theories.<br><br><blockquote>In fact, i think evolution is more of a popular belief.

Evolution is a sceintific theory and by tat term, it meant it is tested, experimented, supported by tons of evidence, can explain a lot of everyday life well and can predict future scientific trends. There r scientist tat says a dust bowl is noah's ark as well, which is proven to be wrong. There r scientist tat say a dinosaur foot prints r human made, and he is also wrong as well. The point is, u don't believe wat <span style="font-style: italic;">anyone</span> says, but should more inclined to believe in wat <span style="font-style: italic;">everyone</span> says. There r always some freak people talking about ridiculous things. U should see through the evidence and see if u agree with the conclusion or not. Evolution is a fundamental theory in biology and medical tat it is as placed to be as important as the theory of atomic structure for electronics/electrical  engineers. Frankly the more people argue tat evolution is wrong because of their religious belief, the more it make them look dumb and stubborn to reject a scientific fact tat is so well proven. It is almost the same in the past when christians used believe the earth is flat. Talk about 2000 years of misguided popular belief...</div>
