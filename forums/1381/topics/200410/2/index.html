            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by vince69:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: green;">Comments:<br>1) The author identified himself as James<br>2) The letter is address to the twelve tribes scattered among nations, so this is most likely refering to the Jews that were exiled from Jerusalem.<br><br></span><br>verse 2-8<br><br>verse 9-11<br><br>verse 12-18<br><br>verse 19-27<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  have fun...</div></blockquote>These are the gems I got so far:<br><br>What should our reaction be in times of trials?<br><strong><br>1) An attitude of Joy </strong><br><br>Â“My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials,Â”  [James 1:2]<br><br>Joy is our attitude to it instead of sulking, grumbling and complaining. We Christians are to live above circumstances not crumble under it.<br><br>We are commanded to <strong>rejoice ALWAYS</strong>: Â“Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will say, rejoice!Â”<br><br>Paul was in prison when he wrote Philippians. He was there unjustly accused, with his arraignment delayed for about two years [justice delayed is justice denied], he was innocent yet he was there incarcerated. Yet inspite of it all, he is still beaming with joy himself that under inspiration he was able to write to those who are in Philippi to REJOICE ALWAYS.<br><br>The words Â“count it all joyÂ” is in the imperative mood just like the words Â“REJOICE ALWAYSÂ” Imperatives are directed to the will. This tells us a lot about true joy.<br><br>1) True joy is a choice.<br>2) True joy is always done in the sphere of the Lord. True joy is always found in Him.<br>3) True joy can be had all of the time, if we choose to rejoice walking in the Spirit.<br><br>There are many reasons for a Christian to rejoice in the midst of trials:<br><br>1)	He has salvation in spite of the trials. Knowledge of that truth is enough to make the heart sing.<br><br>2)	Ac 5:41 So they departed from the presence of the council, <strong>rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His name. </strong><br><br>3)	Ro 8:28 <strong>And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose</strong>. [this verse was written to the Romans under the situational context of suffering]<br><br>4)	there are many other reasons too many to mention but the one given here by James why they should rejoice is this:<br><br>Jas 1:2 My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials,<br><br>3 <strong>knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience.</strong><br><br>Why this is an echo of PaulÂ’s words:<br><br>Ro 5:1  Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,<br><br>2 through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.<br><br>3 And not only that,<strong> but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance;</strong><br><br>God is at work molding and conforming us to the image of Christ. We grow more into His image under sufferings and trials. It takes the dross [unholy things] out from us. GodÂ’s agenda for us is NOT to make us comfortable, but to make us more conformed to His Son, Christ Jesus. God is doing this so that we can have spiritual stamina [patience and perseverance] in the fight of faith. Just like the rigorous training of athletes. The training is arduous and strenuous, it causes discomfort to the athlete but it is needful.<br><br>Somebody said: Â“The stronger the winds, the deeper the roots, the deeper the roots the stronger the tree.Â”<br><br>With that goal in GodÂ’s mind for us, we are indeed to count it all joy to fall into various trials: Trials produce patience or perseverance [spiritual stamina]<br><br><strong>2) We are to be praying for wisdom</strong><br><br>Too many of us do not know how to handle trials and so we need to be in our knees and ask for wisdom about how to handle it and spiritually profit from the trials we face that it may  truly accomplish what it was sent for: to make us complete and lacking nothing in the fight of faith.<br><br>Jas 1:4 But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing.<br><br>[We need endurance, patience and perseverance in the walk towards maturity]<br><br>5 If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.<br><br></div>

Pray with the confidence that God does hear our prayer, and He will most definitely answers our prayer, having the confidence not in ourselves but in His goodness and faithfulness.<br><br>Q: Can we ask just anything we want, since we are to pray/ask with confidence?<br></div>
