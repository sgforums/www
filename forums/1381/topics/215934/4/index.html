As for descendants as many as the stars God could always give him another son.</strong></blockquote>I have shown you verses that totally demolish whatever you said. Unless you can reconcile the verses with what you said .. I feel there is no need for us to continue via a more private channel.<br><br>Put it here.

Do teachers normally give out answer sheets before a test?  Would the result be deemed valid if so?<br><br></div>
