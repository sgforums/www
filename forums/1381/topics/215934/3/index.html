They r left so many questions and doubts yet they r so certain tat it must be right because it must be right. They never really question if the doctrine they r following r right in the first place. For me, I rather believe one less thing than believe in something tat may be wrong because tat can costs me very severe problems in future<br><br><blockquote>Nobody can see the wind, but everyone can see its effects if they look hard enough.

[e] 23 Then Abraham approached him and said: "Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked? 24 What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare [f] the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it? <strong>25 Far be it from you to do such a thingÂ—to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge [g] of all the earth do right?"</strong></blockquote>So Abraham did question. This is very surprising because if you remember, all along this Abraham behaved like a goody goody boy - He said yes when God called him, He said ok when Isaac was going to be sacrificed, total submission, no questions at all.<br><br>And even more surprising .. Abraham challenged God and won!  He bargained until the tolerance becomes 10 righteous people. (we know what happened later, but this doesn't deny the fact that Abraham won the argument)<br><br>So there is actually a biblical precedent of someone challenging God and won. In the Jewish tradition, there is even an account of rabbis openly declare their "insubordination" - God's voice boomed down from heaven and the rabbis replied "so what?"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

It is a covenant remember? God made the promise and how God solve the problem of the sacrifice is God's problem.<br><br>For it is written (Heb 11):<br><br>17 By faith Abraham, when put to the test, offered up Isaac. He who had received the promises was ready to offer up his only son, 18of whom he had been told, Â‘It is through Isaac that descendants shall be named after you.Â’</div>
