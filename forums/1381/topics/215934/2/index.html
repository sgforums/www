Why kill everything with a flood? Why can't God just struck humans with a disease and leave all the animals alive?<br><br>So did he make a mistake? Please don't give me crappy answers like we don't understand his intention cos' that's equivalent to not answering at all.</div></blockquote>I don't think saying that we do not understand is a crappy answer.  From a Christian perspective, it is a perfectly legitimate answer, for it acknowledges the fact that as creatures, we are limited in our understanding of God.  We think that there exists in this life things which have no answers that we are capable of discovering or apprehending.<br><br>So in a sense, you are correct in that such responses do not provide the answer to the question.  But to believers, that's an acceptable position, since it reflects the reality that God is the one who has the right to question, not us (see Job chapters 38 to 42).<br><br>In the philosophical context, you should not stop at those question.  In fact, you should consider further why God bother to create at all, and why he bother to create sentient beings who screwed up his plan big time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>regards,<br>obiterdicta</div>
