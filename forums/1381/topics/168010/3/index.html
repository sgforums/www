That is the problem that I (and perhaps some folks here in EH) am having. We all go around stating that all our beliefs has to be centered on the teachings of the Bible - it was never stated that Jesus spoke in tongues - so we <span style="font-style: italic;">cannot</span> <strong>infer</strong> that he did. To do that is liken to people who claim that Jesus can get angry while we cannot because his is a <span style="font-style: italic;">holy anger </span>(haven't we all heard this one before). Or that in the context of Acts, the purpose of tongues and the conduct of the practitioners are remarkably different from what is seen nowadays.<br><br>I have no problem with Christians who practices tongues, as long as they do not tell me that it is important for Christians to have it, or that it is a requirement for salvation, or no tongue - not spiritual, or can charge mobile phone. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> It is between them and God, I do not judge them, just don't let them judge me.<br><br>I am sure, Brey, that you are one of those rational ones who will NOT insist that everyone of us need to practice this.

Check with your spirit within yourself, if there is peace then it will be of God. Once you have been a Christian for a while you will begin to know how to distinguish this. Pm me if you want to "talk" more about this. God Bless.</div></blockquote>The discussion on spirit is probably a bit sensitive so I will avoid.<br>I also do not deny that tongue speaking is a spiritual gift and Paul was clear that "For if I pray in tongue, my spirit pray but my mind is unfruitful." 1Cor 14:14.  When your spirit prays, it certainly edifes, gives inner peace and whatever other benefits, but only to those who pray and only you know how it benefits you.<br><br>My problem begins when certain believers come to the church and say we should pray in tongue in church, during worship services, for the Bible says "...do not forbid speaking in tongues." 1Cor14:39. I say again, I fully agree that believers should desire to speak in tongues in their quiet times, when they are alone with God. But to speak in public, with no interpretation, it benefits only those who speak, the rest of us cannot join in to say "amen". The purpose of a congregational worship is lost.<br><br>The other problem is when I walk into these kind of worships with non believers. Happened in HK and I invited my associates there to attend a sunday service hereby, in a conference hall, and that happened to be one with a lot of tongue speaking. I had all kinds of questions after that, including the question of possession. It would not be polite for them to give any negative remarks but I never will take any non believer to a church I am not familiar with.<br><br>There is much wisdom in the way Paul concluded in 1Cor.14:40: "But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way."<br><br>Have a good day, God bless.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by breytonhartge:</div><div class="quote_body">Glad you got your gift you asked for, my take is that 5 minutes praying in tongues can accomplish the same as an hour praying in english or chinese or whatever other language we pray in... praying in tongues, our spirit communes directly with God's spirit... fast, effective and simple, sometimes when we just don't know how to pray or whatelse to pray... tongues can help in these situations...<br><br>We will never have enough on our hands to pray for... Jesus never did, He was always praying... for everything. Praying in tongues for the things you do not know about might actually be praying for things that will affect your future now... </div></blockquote>Your "theology" is very dangerous.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the easiest way to answer this subject title is just like what Chin Eng said, trace the roots of "tongues", go back to the Day of Pentecost, ask what was the purpose of the "tongues", how was the "tongues" like, what was it uses in subsequently.<br><br>then it will become very clear that the "tongues" in the time of Acts and Corinthians is NOT like that tongues we see practised in Charismatic churches.</div>
