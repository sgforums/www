            <div class='col-md body'>When it comes to speaking in tongues, it is ultimately upto the particular believer as to whether he or she can accept it or not. There are enought arguments to field both sides.<br><br>Personally, I pray in tongues and believe that there is great benefit to be derived from praying in tongues.<br><br>Lets see what the bible says about this:<br><br>Mark 16:17 NKJV<br><br>17 And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues;<br><br>Acts 10:44-48 NKJV<br><br>44 While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard the word. 45 And those of the circumcision who believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also. 46 For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God.<br>Then Peter answered, 47 Â“Can anyone forbid water, that these should not be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?Â” 48 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to stay a few days.<br><br>Which shows that speaking in tongues was also for the gentiles which is us non-jewish believers.<br><br>1 Corinthians 12: 28-31 NKJV<br><br>28 And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues. 29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles? 30 Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? 31 But earnestly desire the best[d] gifts. And yet I show you a more excellent way.<br><br>It can be seen from this verse that God appointed tongues for the church. Some may argue that this was for the church then and not now, but remember that our God is an unchanging God and is consistent in all He says or does. It also hints at that not all may speak in tongues, but it is a valid gift. Paul here says that to desire the gift. So if you want to speak in tongues you have to desire the gift first. God/The Holy Spirit is a gentleman, you will not speak in tongues unless you genuinely desire to, then go and ask God for this gift.<br><br>1 Corinthians 14: 1- 5 NKJV<br><br>1 Pursue love, and desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy. 2 For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God, for no one understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries. 3 But he who prophesies speaks edification and exhortation and comfort to men. 4 He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church. 5 I wish you all spoke with tongues, but even more that you prophesied; for[a] he who prophesies is greater than he who speaks with tongues, unless indeed he interprets, that the church may receive edification.<br><br>From this verse we see Pual telling us to desire spiritual gifts, and we see that when we speak in tongues, we speak to God and not men, and we speak mysteries.  It is good for personal edification, but when interpreted in a church setting, it is good for all the church as all receive edification.<br><br>1 Corinthians 14: 22 NKJV<br><br>22 Therefore tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to unbelievers;<br><br>1 Corinthians 14: 39 NKJV<br><br>39 Therefore, brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak with tongues.<br><br>Hope that this gives you a biblical perspective on speaking in tongues. It is a gift from God, and we are to desire it, for personal edification and also desire the interpretation of tongues for the edification of the body of Chirst as a whole and even more than that, desire to prophesy which edifies the church!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've seek and been prayed for the gift of tongues almost 15 months back and never ever speak of it until March this year. During the period of a prayer conference, I was staying over at the Chalet with my friends since it's at DTE. The night before the conference, we were praying in the room during the evening and suddenly, I was able to pray in tongues when everyone was praying heavily and could feel the presence in the room. During the whole conference, I could also pray in tongues and during times when I and my friends really have to pray for someone really in need. So I reckon that the gift of tongues isn't something that you'll get when and when you like, but according to God's timing.</div>
