            <div class='col-md body'>Speaking in tongues is clearly a gift from God, we shouldnÂ’t be talking about accepting it or not, but what does God wants us to do with our gift and how does the gift benefit you, church and the ppl around you?<br><br>When the spirit first enabled the disciples to speak in tongues, the God fearing Jews from all over the world were bewildered because these disciples were speaking their native language, proclaiming the wonders of God. (Acts 2:12)<br>But there were some who made fun of them and said, Â“They have had too much wineÂ”, clearly these people did not understand what were said.<br><br>Paul makes it clear that when there is speaking in tongue, there must be interpretation.<br><br>Taking about spiritual gift, Â“Â…to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues.Â” 1 Cor. 12:10.<br><br>Â“Â…do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret?Â” 1 Cor. 12:30<br><br>Â“Â… he who prophesies is greater than he who speaks with tongues, unless indeed he interprets, ...) 1 Cor. 14:5.<br><br>Â“So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and some who do not understand or some unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind?Â” 1 Cor. 14:23<br><br>It is clear that speaking in tongues must be followed with interpretation. I believe speaking in tongues is like speaking many different languages, for the Bible refers to Â“tongue<strong>s </strong>not tongueÂ”, Â“in <strong>other</strong> tongue Act 2:4Â”, and Â“<strong>different kinds </strong>of tongues 1Cor 12:10)Â”. I believe the tongues in themselves are legible languages, it is just that we donÂ’t understand, just like people speaking Cantonese, Hokkien, Hainanese to the Jews. These are the <strong>strange</strong> tongues through which God speaks to the people. (1 Cor. 14: 21).<br><br>Can tongue be a spiritual language, with which the spirit in us speaks to God and only understood by God? May beÂ…. for self edification.<br><br>So how has speaking in tongues benefit us? How often do we hear of speaking in tongues in churches being interpreted? For those who have benefited from speaking in tongues, do they bring love and joy to others? Sad to say, I seldom hear about that, that is why I agree that speaking in tongue is an overrated gift. Sorry, breytonhartge.<br><br>1 Cor 12:31 NKJV, talk about Â“earnestly desire the best giftsÂ”, but what are the best gifts? NIV present the verse as Â“earnestly desire the greater giftsÂ”.<br><br>All gifts are desirable, but the gifts that benefits others and glorify God are the greater ones.<br><br>have a good day.</div>

To one there is given through the Spirit....to another distinguishing between spirits...."<br><br>Sometimes I often wonder who are the ones who distinguish between spirits. Is there a need to distinguish spirits in a church and how?<br><br>whenever I have to spend weekends overseas, I visit churches, or worships services in the name of Jesus Christ (usually in convention halls or hotels) and often come across those lifted by the spirits, their actions can range from speaking intelligible languages, rolling on the floor,  crying aloud.... If I could leave with a peaceful mind, I would recognise the spirit as the spirit of God. If not, I will go straight to find a good restaurant for lunch and never think about what had happened.<br><br>I have not been to CHC, so there is no reference to them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> </div></blockquote>What is distingushing spirits?<br><br>By the way, my friend is from CHC. So, admittedly, he told me some are not really speaking in tongues, just doing what others are doing.</div>

How often do they feel like that? every sunday? Not trying to be funny, but I believe that christians in their own quiet places, they can pray and be lifted by the Spirit, they cried with joy and really came out a different person, but I can't say the same about those appeared to be lifted in public. After the service, they left the worship place and went for lunch like nothing has happened.<br></div>

Being filled by a spirit is similar to being possessed, being filled by THE HOLY SPIRIT is when you are comforted and lifted up by the presence of the Holy Spirit in you and the Holy Spirit is ministering to you...  possession by a spirit only seeks to destroy the person and not edify which is different with the Holy Spirit who is a gentleman and will not force you to do things you don't want to do, tongues can be started and stopped at any time. It is upto the person speaking the tongue.<br><br>My opinion.</div>

Check with your spirit within yourself, if there is peace then it will be of God. Once you have been a Christian for a while you will begin to know how to distinguish this. Pm me if you want to "talk" more about this. God Bless.</div>

We are free to accept or reject the gift. But if it were me, I would want all the gifts of the spirit!</div>
