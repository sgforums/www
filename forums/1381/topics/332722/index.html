              <p>For a Christian, hell is a state where a person is excluded <em>forever</em> from communion with God through his/her own free choice (eg: by sinning gravely against God and not repenting). As the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC 1035) puts it, "The chief punishment of hell is eternal separation from God". Hell might or might not involve fire but regardless, it will be most unpleasant and painful because it is only in God that man can "possess the life and happiness for which he was created and for which he longs." (CCC 1035).</p>
              <p>Your murderer and your japanese general (as with everyone) will have to face God when they die. If they are unrepentent, then they will be eternally separated from God in hell. However, if they have truly repented from their wrong doings, God will welcome them into heaven for there is no sin that is unforgivable. Before entering heaven however, they (and a lot of us as well) are likely to first require 'purification' in a place/condition which the Catholic Church calls 'purgatory' (which comes from a latin word meaning 'cleansing' or 'purifying').</p>

              <p>In repenting (before we leave this world), we need to truly have the desire to turn away from sin and towards God, to detest the wrongs that we have done and sincerely have the desire not to repeat the wrongs committed. Repentence is not just about superficially apologising ("God, I'm sorry for beating so and so" but thinking, "Actually, he had it coming to him ... " !! ) or simply proclaiming that "Jesus is my personal Lord and Saviour ! Alleluia !" without really meaning it or truly having a change of heart. God knows us inside out, we can't deceive him.</p>
              <p>Would hell be empty given God's infinite capacity to forgive ? I wish it was but ... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>

              <p>Hi Bigcable</p>
              <p>I just want to say something that may be a little different from the other people here.</p>
              <p>You don't get to be sent to hell or heaven right away after you died.</p>
              <p>Yes the dead instead will go to the world of the dead or the kingdom of death as Jesus mentioned. The soul of the dead would await final judgement in the kingdom of death.</p>
              <p>The soul or the dead people in the kingdom of death will no longer be conscious of themselves, the dead also can no longer remember God(so only the living, yes you, can praise and worship and pray to God) and the dead cannot in any way be able to register the passage of time which is good news since the final judgment may take awhile.</p>
              <p>If you would like to use logic a bit no matter how ridiculous.</p>
              <p>If Herod had been sent to hell, he would have been tormented for almost about 2000 years than Hitler. That wouldn't be fair isn't it? So if people were sent to hell immediately after death it would be better to live your life in the last days or nearing the last days.</p>
              <p>Anyway I knew the condition of the dead from a [personal] revelation of sort. It changed the way I look my life and everybody's.</p>

              <p>Agreed. Although God will always forgive us our sins when we truly repent (which would enable us to enter into heaven), we would still have to bear the consequences of our sins.</p>
