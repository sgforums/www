If it means that the non-beliveing spouse MUST be converted (akin the Muslim conversion), it does not apply to Protestant.<br><br>Firstly say a guy is a Christian, he should be aware of not having a non Christian girlfriend or spouse.<br><br>Let say under some circumstances, this same man married this non Christian girlfriend, there is no rule in the Bible sayin that she MUST convert. What he can do is to pray to God to soften her heart and that she may be called upon salvation. This again doesn't mean that it opens a flood gate for Christian to marry non-believer. The previous paragraph is still the criteria.<br><br>About going to the same church, the husband and wife must layout their conviction and pray about it. The rule of thumb is that the wife must submit to her husband decision. This means that the husband plays a huge huge huge role and will be answerable to God for whatever decision he makes for him and his wife, and eventually their children.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Icemoon, i agree with you totally on this. It will be so hard for the non-charistmatic spouse.<br><br>The husband and wife must really pray about it. Search the scriptures for the truth.<br></div>

Their membership is getting larger, and there is high chance your christian girlfriend may be from there.<br><br>Ok la, I think fandango will use the 'Christ is the head of church, husband is head of family' argument to 'strongly persuade' his wife in our scenario to switch to his congregation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there is no such thing as Catholic Conversion Rule.... For Catholics, if you want to convert, either for your other half or for yourself, everyone have to go thru the Rights of Christain Initiation for Adults. It's a one year course, free. Available at all churches.<br>However, at the end of it, it's still your free will to choose whether you want to convert or not.<br><br>The only 'Conversion Rule' I know is if there is an emergency(life and death) and the dying wants to be converted, we Catholics have to authority to baptize them.<br><br>And for Catholics, we dun have the problem of whose church you should go to. Singapore is being divided up into Parish areas, each parish area has a church(parish), So you just go to the church in the Parish area where your house is located. Or if you are outside, you can go to the Church most convenient. All Catholic Churches in Singapore have the same readings everyday of the year. Only the Homily is different.</div>
