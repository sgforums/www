Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?" </span><br><br>To be born through your mother's womb is to be born of water.<br><br><span style="color: red;">5 Jesus answered, "Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born of water..." </span><br><br>Those born of water cannot enter into the Kingdom of God for the Kingdom of God is a Spiritual Kingdom. But you must first be alive, be born of water.<br><br><span style="color: red;">5 Jesus answered, "Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born of ... spirit, he can't enter into the Kingdom of God!" </span><br><br>What is it like to be Born of Spirit?<br><br><span style="color: red;">8 The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don't know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit." </span><br><br>The one who asked Jesus believed that by simply following the rules and regulations (the Jewish Law; the secret formula) will enable him to enter the Kingdom of God after his death.<br><br>Jesus told him that to be Born of the Spirit is an earthly event.<br><br>Christians nowadays have come up with a new "formula" that they think will enable them to enter the Kingdom of God after their death.<br><br>They should listen to Jesus and not any wise man on earth:<br><br><span style="color: red;">3 Jesus answered him, "Most certainly, I tell you, unless one is born anew, he can't see the Kingdom of God." </span><br><br>Your mother gave birth to you.
