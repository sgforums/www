            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Everything except the One that really matters</strong><br><br>There are three kinds of persons in hell: a) the immoral person b) the religious person and c) the moral person. Is it really possible for a man to be prayerful, religious, moral, a man imbued with commendable virtues and yet, at the end of it all, his soul is still bound for hell? The answer is a resounding Â“YES!!!!Â” Let me introduce to you a man that fits our description. A man who by any human standards stand head and shoulders above most people in morality.<br><br>Meet Nicodemus:<br><br>Â“There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. This man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, "Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.Â” [John 3:1-2]<br><br>Here in our text we have NicodemusÂ’ religious resume.<br><br>We have his religious affiliation: - He was a Pharisee.<br>His position amongst the Jews: - a ruler of the Jews.<br>His attitude towards the Lord Jesus: - He revered Him. He called Him: Â‘RabbiÂ’<br>-He acknowledged and believed that<br>He [Jesus]came from God.<br><br><strong><br>I. His religious affiliation:</strong> <span style="color: red;">Nicodemus was a Pharisee [verse 1].</span><br><br>That tells us a lot about Nicodemus. The Pharisees were the most strict and the most meticulous of all the sects in Israel during that time. And when I say Â‘strictÂ’ I mean strict to the coreÂ….or should I sayÂ…..bones. Strict to the bones. They were very rigid and very exacting in following the Law of Moses and other traditions of their ancestors. They would fast twice a week, eight times a month and approximately 101 times a year. Everything they possessed they would tithed [they would determine the 10% of it and give it to the temple priests]. Yes, everything even the most seemingly insignificant commodities such as seeds, they would tithed.<br><br>They were men who prayed daily. They were men who memorized their Bibles. Jews have a tradition of wearing phylacteries on their body parts. Phylacteries are those straps they put on their wrists and foreheads containing Bible verses. I told yaÂ….these guys were really religious and moral to the bone.<br><br><strong>II. His position amongst the Jews:</strong> <span style="color: red;">He was a ruler of the Jews [verse 1].</span><br><br>The Jews were under the dominion of the Roman empire. The empire was conceding enough to allow the Jews to run their own affairs according to their laws [which was a good political and military strategy by the way to keep their subject countries tame]. The Jews had their own Supreme Court and Senate [composed of 70 men] called the Sandhedrin. Only men of high moral character were to constitute the Sanhedrin. When our text says that Nicodemus was Â“a ruler of the JewsÂ” [note: it does not say Â“THE ruler of the JewsÂ”Â…..it only says : Â“a ruler of the JewsÂ”] it does not mean that he was the sole leader of the Jews. [Why, of course there were 70 of them]. Nicodemus was a member of the ruling body of the Jews during that time. What does that tell us about our man? It means that this guy was one of the morally elite in Israel during that time. You donÂ’t get a seat in the Sanhedrin if you are not one of the best in Israel morally.<br><br><strong><br><br>PLUSÂ…Â…</strong><br><br>Nicodemus was one of the primary teachers in Israel during that time. He was a Bible teacher.<br><br>Joh 3:10 Jesus answered and said to him, "Are you THE teacher of Israel, and do not know these things?<br><br>The Lord JesusÂ’ use of the definite article suggests that he [Nicodemus] was no ordinary Jew. He was IsraelÂ’s primary Bible teacher. He was not just any teacherÂ….he was THE teacher of Israel.<br><br><strong>III. His attitude towards the Lord Jesus :</strong> <span style="color: red;">He deeply respected the Lord Jesus and acknowledge Him as coming from God[verse 2] </span><br><br>He called the Lord Jesus Â“RabbiÂ”. Jews do not just call any teacher by that designation if they do not have deep respect for that particular person as a teacher of the things of God. Added to that, he acknowledged that the Lord Jesus was one sent by God [verse 2].<br><br><strong><br>LetÂ’s check NicodemusÂ’s religious pulse: </strong><br><br>Prayerful? Check<br><br>religious? Check [fasts 101 times a year. Gives tithes meticulously and faithfully<br><br>Outstanding moral character? Check<br><br>revered the Lord? Check<br><br>Reads the Bible daily? Check<br><br>WAW!!!! WHAT A GUY!!!!<br><br>Question: if Nicodemus were to die that very hourÂ…Â…would he go to heaven? NO!!!!!<br><br><strong>IV. The LordÂ’s assessment of Nicodemus: </strong><span style="color: red;">He must be born again in order to enter the kingdom of heaven.</span><br><br>Joh 3:7 "Do not marvel that I said to you [Nicodemus], 'You must be born again.' "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." [John 3:3].<br><br>And in order to be born again, He must trust in Christ Jesus alone for salvation nothing and no one else:<br><br>Joh 3:16 "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.Â”<br><br>Nicodemus had everything except the One that really matters. How about you dear reader? Have you experienced the new birth? Have you everything except the One that really matters? Have you even matched Nicodemus' morality? You see itÂ’s not what you do, itÂ’s what God has done for you in Calvary that gets you to heaven. That sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ was enough for all time for all sins-past, present and future.<br><br>What you need to do is to put your trust in that sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ alone.<br><br></div>

Everything under Adam's federal headship went with him. This is the 'economy' revelaed in the Bible [read Romans 5:12-21]. This is really a mystery, no one could fully explain it.<br><br>What are the things under Adam's federal headship? Everything you see here in the universe. All this are marred by sin and must be judged [in the case of moral humans] and must be changed [in case of amoral creation].<br><br>This fallen creation is called the 'world' in the Bible.<br><br>God ,on the other hand, has a plan to create a new creation- new earth, new heaven , new universe and new humanity. The federal head of this new creation is Christ, the second Adam.<br><br>All of us born here belong to the first Adam by natural birth. And so we are in danger of the judgment since God will judge everything under the first Adam.<br><br>But God gave us a hope when Christ came [the second Adam, the new federal head of the new creation]. What we must do is cross that gap between the first Adam's headship to the new Adam's headship.<br><br>he  who is born of the flesh [which is under Adam's headship] is flesh. He who is born above or born again is of the Spirit [the agent of the new creation].<br><br>And to be under the new creation which is headed by Christ Himself we must be born into it just like we were born into the first Adam's headship. All the things that you see here on this 'world' headed by the first Adam is passing away [that's why you must not love it].<br><br>How to be born into that new creation glory which will be revealed at the close of time? We must have the Holy Spirit, because it is He who is the agent of the new birth.<br><br>What will the Spirit use in the new birth? it is through the Word [the gospel-the good news of salvation in Christ].<br><br>The Holy Spirit enables our will to trust in Christ and when that is accomplished, He [simultaneous with our trusting] indwells us, giving us a new standing or position in the eyes of God as born again into His new creation. But  not only that He gives us along with it a new condition or state He gives us a new nature.<br><br>when you are now born again [into the new creation of God which is headed by the Lord Jesus Christ which will be reaveled at the close of time], God now sees you as belonging to that new creation. All your connections with that creation that fell with Adam, you are now severed:<br><br>2Co 5:17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.<br><br>This again is proof that salvation cannot be lost. You are now in the New Creation headed by Christ, our federal head who will not fail.<br><br>The subject of God's judgment is the old creation headed by Adam. And Christians are not in it in Gods' eyes.<br><br>What is God doing now? he is plucking out sinners who is still in that old order of things or old creation  or in short the world and bringing it positionally into His new creation throgh the gospel of Christ.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In short, believe in Christ and u are a new creation (born again).<br><br>Right?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ironside:</div><div class="quote_body">Adam was the federal head of all humanity and [in fact all creation] who fell into sin. when Adam sinned we sinned in Adam and all creation went down with him. Everything under Adam's federal headship went with him. This the 'economy' revelaed in the Bible [read Romans 5:12-21]. This is really a mystery, no one could fully explain it.<br><br>What are the things under Adam's federal headship? Everything you see here in the universe. All this are marred by sin and must be judged [in the case of moral humans] and must be changed [in case of amoral creation].<br><br>This fallen creation is called the 'world' in the Bible.<br><br>God ,on the other hand, has a plan to create a new creation- new earth, new heaven , new universe and new humanity. The federal head of this new creation is Christ, the second Adam.<br><br>All of us born here belong to the first Adam by natural birth. And so we are in danger of the judgment since God will judge this everything under the first Adam.<br><br>But God gave us a hope when Christ came [the second Adam, the new federal head of the new creation]. What we must do is cross that gap between the first Adam's headship to the new Adam's headship.<br><br>he is who is born of the flesh [which is under Adam's headship] is flesh. He who is born above or born again is of the Spirit [the agent of the new creation].<br><br>And to be under the new creation which is headed by Christ Himself we must be born into it just like we were born into the first Adam's headship. All the things that you see here on this 'world' headed by the first Adam is passing away [that's why you must not love it].<br><br>How to be born into that new creation glory which will be revealed at the close of time? We must have the Holy Spirit, because it is He who is the agent of the new birth.<br><br>What will the Spirit use in the new birth? it is through the Word [the gospel-the good news of salvation in Christ].<br><br>The Holy Spirit enables our will to trust in Christ and when that is accomplished, He [simultaneous with out trusting] indwells us, giving us a new standing or position in the eyes of God as born again into His new creation. But  not only that He gives us along with it a new condition or state He gives us a new nature.<br><br>when you are now born again [into the new creation of God which is headed by the Lord Jesus Christ which will be reaveled at the close of time], God now sees you as belonging to that new creation. All you connections with that creation that fell with Adam, you are now severed:<br><br>2Co 5:17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
