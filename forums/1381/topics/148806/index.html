            <div class='col-md body'>The similitude of Jesus before Allah is as that of Adam; He created him from dust, then said to him: "Be": and he was."<br>Quran 3:59<br><br>"So she conceived him, and she retired with him to a remote place. And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm-tree: she cried (in her anguish): "Ah! would that I had died before this! would that I had been a thing forgotten and out of sight! But (a voice) cried to her from beneath the (palm-tree) :"Do not grieve! for your Lord has provided a rivulet beneath you; "And shake toward yourself the trunk of the palm-tree: it will let fall fresh ripe dates upon you. "<br>Quran 19:22-5<br><br>"So eat and drink and cool (your) eye. And if you see any man, say, 'I have vowed a fast to (Allah) Most Gracious, and this day I will not enter into any talk with any human being.' At length she brought the (babe) to her people, carrying him (in her arms). They said: "O Mary! truly an amazing thing you have brought! "O sister of Aaron! your father was not a man of evil, nor your<br>mother an unchaste woman!" But she pointed to the babe. They said: "how can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle?" He said: "I am indeed a servant of Allah: He has given me Revelation and made me a prophet; "And He has made me blessed wheresoever I be, and has enjoined on me Prayer and Charity as long as I live; "(He) has made me kind to my mother, and not overbearing or miserable."<br>Quran 19:26-<br><br>Jesus, the son of Mary, said: "O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allah (sent) to you, confirming the Law (which came) before me"...<br>Quran 61:6<br><br>"O People of the Book! commit no excesses in your religion: nor say of Allah anything but the truth. Christ Jesus the son of Mary was (no more than) a Messenger of Allah, and His Word"...<br>Quran 4:171<br><br>"And behold! Allah will say: "O Jesus the son of Mary! Did you say to men, 'worship me and my mother as gods in derogation of Allah'?" He (Jesus) will say: "Glory to You! Never could I say what I had no right (to say). Had I said what is in my heart, though I do not know what is in Yours. For You know in full all that is hidden.<br>"Never said I to them anything except what You commanded me to say, to wit, 'Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord'; And I was a witness over them whilst I dwelt amongst them; when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them, and You are a Witness to all things."<br>Quran 5:116-7<br><br>Source:http://www.angelfire.com/fl/religions/jesus.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, it is interesting to see that even in the quran, Jesus directs the worship and glory to the father, just as He has always done in the bible.<br><br>But God did not need to question Jesus about proper worship... Jesus already knew His place here on earth, He came as our earthly sacrifice... fully man and fully God.</div>

We believe that God simply created Jesus in Mary's womb, and that's it. These two verses pretty much says it all. He was a Messenger of God, and that was it.<br><br>You can also see this in the other verses at the beginning of this thread.... they all explicitly refer to Jesus as 'the son of Mary' and not 'the son of God'.<br><br>Feel free to ask me questions... I can't quite say that I'm the best authority on matters pertaining to Islam, though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by shade343:</div><div class="quote_body">hey hey....dont condemn....</div></blockquote>but what about what chronicles posted? By implication isn't that condemning my faith? To actually post that in EH is like us from EH going to a mosque or a muslim forum and telling the muslims that are there, that they have got it all wrong, get my meaning?<br><br>So other people can tell us what they think is wrong with the Christian faith, but the Christians cannot defend it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, if this thread would continue, it would definetely raged war.<br><br>I need to disagree with some of you, " stating that I belongs to God" is not condemning others. It is the believe of one self.<br><br>If those said that some post are over reacted, wait till u see those regarding the issue regarding hungry ghost festivals. Words like " u christians again " " u stupid chrisitians ppl" .....so, look who's talking now.<br><br>Did we say " u stupid ppl again" no, stating that I belongs to God just reaffirmed the faith. As like " I believe in Buddha, and no one else" is this condeming or ...being harsh.   i believe NOT<br><br>Please maintain peace, by playing your part. The world is dreadful enough. If we, consider the "educated" ppl in Singapore would argue over such issue, how can those who have lower education not become terrorist and defaming thier own religion. So PLEASE!!! slap urself and wake up.</div>
