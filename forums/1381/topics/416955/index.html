              <p>I thought there are many Buddhas and there must be many remains scattered all over the world.</p>
              <p>One Question, what did Buddha eat to grow until so big? Really just vegetables? Don't lie ok?</p>

              <p>So Sun Wukong also existed since Buddha put his 5 fingers mountain on top of it? Wow....your Heaven must be like a pet zoo, got monkey, dog, pig and alot more.....</p>

              <p>You may have heard of Pontius Pilate, the Roman procurator who was in charge of Judea (modern day Palestine if I'm not mistaken) from 26-36 AD.

              <p>Then we're caught in a bind isn't it, since Jesus obviously didn't leave any remains behind when he resurrected.</p>
              <p>So probably one other way to look at this is to infer the existence of Jesus during the recorded reign of Pontius Pilate (not to mention also that many ancient non-Christian writers such as Josephus and Pliny the Younger left evidence of Jesus’ existence).</p>

If the Romans 'created' Christianity, then why bother hiding from them?</p>
              <p>Come to think of it, if Christianity was a 'make-believe' religion as you say, then why were the Romans trying so hard to get rid of Christians? If they were fake, then they were no threat to the Romans right?</p>

              <p>The Mormon movement started in 1830s but that does not stop them from saying god led a tribe of people to Western Hemisphere 600 years before christ. I mean, you are assuming stuff really happens before an event...</p>
