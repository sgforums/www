If a bird flies like an F-16, personally to me, my sight should also be created to match up with that speed to enjoy seeing, the flight of birds. </blockquote>Well, to me the most basic reason why faster birds are better is simply because faster means the birds have an easier time to catch their food or escape their foes. If you believe in creationism, and god create animals for men to appreciate, then why do god create deep sea creatures or tunneling animals when most men can only see them in action from video.<br><br><blockquote>Is there a possibility for God to "create adaptations" ? </blockquote>Persomally, adaptation speaks out more for evolution than for creationism. Creationism do not have to rely on past or other models to come out with different creatures. Strangely all creatures are seen to be adapted from some other species before. If you can come out with a creature that show no signs of adaptation, voila you have proven evolution to be wrong. However that never happened.<br></div>

Glad someone read all the info.<br><br>"Faster" was written in the context that the creator could have done better. It doesn't have to be the best. Have you ever sprained your legs? Ever wondered why we keep spraining our legs or why women always have to endure so much labour pain? It's because we humans were adapted to walk on two legs instead of 4 from our ancestors.<br><br>Our 2 lower limbs are too fragile to support all our weight and they easily give way when stressed. Also, female pelvis will have to be narrowed so that women don't walk like apes <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> and waste precious energy (food was scarce during caveman days). Narrowed pelvis, however, would create problems in childbirth and immature human babies compared to the rest of our close relatives like gorillas and chimpanzees.<br><br>Our legs were just not perfectly designed for walking on 2 feet cos' it was based on adaptation - modification from previous design. Therefore we are imperfect. Going by that logic, if God created us in his image, it would imply he's imperfect. Kinda hard to imagine the creator to be imperfect, don't you agree?<br><br>The only logical conclusion for adaptations to exist, is because of evolution. My analogy of an engineer best describes that. If you're an engineer, why would you design a system that is so faulty? Of course not... unless you're an idiot<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Hope that answers all your questions  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>Can you sum up your ideas?<br><br>So God is perfect and he creates inperfect things<br>walking on two feet causes labour pain is an example of imperfectness.<br>And there are many other examples to support how the world is built inperfect.<br>"An engineer wont build a faulty system unless he is an idiot." i lv this sentance <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Now i shall begin.<br>My main point is that what seems to our human eyes inperfect may NOT be inperfect as you think.<br>My idea cannot be explained, however, it has to be guilded b4 one can understand.<br><br>Is labour pain bad and a sign of inperfectness?<br><br>(this is my question for you now)<br><br></div>
