When told that the Oracle of Delphi had revealed to one of his friends that Socrates was the wisest man in Athens, <strong>he responded not by boasting or celebrating, but by trying to prove the Oracle wrong.</strong><br><br>So Socrates decided he would try and find out if anyone knew what was truly worthwhile in life, because anyone who knew that would surely be wiser than him. He set about questioning everyone he could find, but no one could give him a satisfactory answer. Instead they all pretended to know something they clearly did not.<br><br>Finally he realized the Oracle might be right after all. He was the wisest man in Athens <strong>because he alone was prepared to admit his own ignorance rather than pretend to know something he did not.</strong> </blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>PS: PBS is a good website with tons of educational materials.

            <div class='col-md body'>This is getting off-topic... now back on track...<br><br>I think the reason evolution is so detested by christians because it implies that there God is less than perfect for designing an imperfect system that needs to correct itself over time.<br><br>Take for example, a human female. Like all humans, she's built to walk on her two legs, which means that she has to have a narrow pelvis to walk efficiently with.<br><br>However, that would mean compromising the width of babies she's able to give birth, given her restricted birth canel. That's why human babies are all born "immature" compared to the rest of the animal kingdom.<br><br>If creationism is the truth, why would such an imperfect system that requires compromises be created by a perfect God? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

When told that the Oracle of Delphi had revealed to one of his friends that Socrates was the wisest man in Athens, he responded not by boasting or celebrating, but by trying to prove the Oracle wrong.<br><br>So Socrates decided he would try and find out if anyone knew what was truly worthwhile in life, because anyone who knew that would surely be wiser than him. He set about questioning everyone he could find, but no one could give him a satisfactory answer. Instead they all pretended to know something they clearly did not.<br><br>Finally he realized the Oracle might be right after all. He was the wisest man in Athens because he alone was prepared to admit his own ignorance rather than pretend to know something he did not.
