It's less romantic and has less significance in terms of symbolism.<br><br>Also, to infer that  if she was created with Adam's heart, Eve would think and feel like Adam is pure speculation. It is like trying to twist the symbolism in the favour of explaining why God took the non-functional, less-symbolic, less-poetic rib from Adam in his sleep.<br><br>All that trouble when God could just, in his almighty powers, create Eve from anything he wants.<br><br>In the end, God didn't create Eve out of nothing. Cos' he wanted the symbolism of love and equality of status to be represented by a rib. The discussion would never end cos' it will go round in circles in search of obscure symbolism to make up for any lacking in logic.<br><br>In the end, I can even see the conclusion of it all - we can't judge God cos' he's perfect and omnipotent. It would not bring us any closer from seeing the truth ourselves and only to force us to accept that as a fact.<br><br>Sorry Icemoon, I really can't figure out how different the bible is from your normal weekly horoscope.

This comes from Jewish tradition which did not come together with Scripture.<br><br>If you want to talk about symbolism, I think the ribs is more appropriate than the heart because if you look at gender relationship today:<br><br>1.

Why take a rib when you can create something out of nothing? Genesis never mentioned anything and all are left for interpretations.<br><br>As for your observations, they can all be explained by evolution:<br>1. Women think differently due to different reproductive strategies. As the womb-holder, women are expected to stay at home and look after the kids. They can't go for a more-is-better strategy because they have limited childbearing years. This focusing of resources allows them to have stronger, better raised children to spread their genes futher. They focus on quality, rather than quantity.<br><br>Men, however, can get more of their genes represented in the next generation by sleeping with as many women as they can. Their thinking patterns can be easily explained by how their best reproductive strategy works. Quantity is better than quality. Their work is done when the egg is fertilised.<br><br>Similar patterns can be seen in the animal kingdom. Darwinism explains sexual behaviour shaped by generations of evolution perfectly.<br><br>2. Is it true that humans really need a soul mate? The divorce rate in US is at 46%, an all time high. Women, as I've mentioned earlier, would benefit from keeping their men next to them, so that food and water will not be a problem when she is raising her children. She perhaps need someone, rather than a soulmate to ensure the reproductive success of her offsprings. In time, that need was reinforced by genes and developed into the emotional needs in women we see today.<br><br>Men, however, do not need soulmates. They are perfectly fine with their hunting parties, staring blankly into camp fires. A similar phenomenon can be observed at bars or living room.<br><br>Note, these are generalisations. There are always exceptions.</div>

Whereas if you look at the Jews, Kabbalah never took shape until the middle age but the Jews still include the eosteric philosophy under their umbrella. So the Jews have many ways to understand God, for them it is a never ending process of learning about God and pondering about His Ways.<br><br>The clearest example to illustrate the difference is to look at how the typical Christian understand Judaism today. To the Christian, Judaism is synonymous with the one in the Old Testament - law, law and law.<br><br>Too bad for them, Jewish thinking has evolved and the sages has declared some of the commandments to be void because of changing environment - one notable example being the Temple is no more and some of the commandments cannot be performed without the Temple; it is a sin to perform them now.</div>

The last 'Jewish' book I read recently is about a Jewish rabbi who is trying to understand God using modern scientific metaphors like strings and Calabi-Yau space .. LOL<br><br>To the Christians, the Jews might seem quite liberal in their theology. But to me, underneath this liberty is a sense of unity, an inter-connectiveness that links many branches of human discipline like science and ethics. It is like .. this faith can still be relevant for me as a human living in the 21st century.<br><br>When I read a Jewish interpretation of Scripture, the way the Jewish author encourages thinking, the way he challenges you to think and rethink Scripture, the feeling is .. exhilarating. It is like finding wisdom from an ancient text .. and you wonder why the writings of Christian theologians cannot give you the same feeling.<br><br>I can't be a Jew or else I will say 'we' when referring to Jews.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I am not even circumcised.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yo sorry i've been away.<br><br>In any case, for kaister, a few points to note.<br><br>1 - Jewish scholars regard Genesis as a poem. Thus, the literal meaning of creation should not be taken as a literal form. eg: the garden of eden was not a physical representation of a place, but rather, it was a connotation of an ideal world which god created.<br><br>2 - Incest was a-ok with everyone until Moses (I think? or was it abraham) came along. Well, everyone is really referring to the jews here, since everybody else went to hell, and incest wouldn't have had matter to them.<br><br>thus, it is not really appropriate to say that incest is a disturbing thought. Even with evolution, i'm sure that at some point in time whilst running its course, incest was rampant.<br><br>3 - with regards to soulmates, divorce, adultery etc are all part of "free will". The intent of god was to create them and get them to stay together, and this is still somewhat acceptable if you relate it back to point number 1. It's not unlike eating the forbidden fruit, which again, is a metaphor.<br><br>that being said, I have no idea what the jewish stand on evolution is. I suspect, due to the scholastic nature of their religion they would probably be arguing about it internally themselves.<br><br>anyway, imo, where religious arguments are concerned, it all boils down to the existance of god. since nobody can disprove it, it leaves a huge gaping ravine for arguments where neither side can really win.<br><br>scientists (and i use this term loosely) certainly feel that we are the enlightened ones, having understood what causes certain behaviours by research and evidence.<br><br>Religious arguments are plain and simple; they simply insist that you're wrong ("it dosen't prove anything", as demonstrated by vince69), insist their doctrine is right, and, had you lived in a society where inquisitorial society, accuse you of being an agent of the devil.,<br><br>sigh. oh yes, i was just watching a tv program regarding the debate on stem cell research. perhaps someone ought to start a new thread regarding that.</div>

Whether the world is created by god is unknown, whether men is created by god is unknown, whether adam eat the fruit is unknown, whether eve come from men is unknown, anything about noah is unknown and many issues left unknown if the we simply treat genesis as a peom.

Keep in mind that the bible, for most parts, does not make any literal sense to me.<br><br>The point here rather, is that they do not claim to comprehend the writings thoroughly. Instead, they choose to keep an open mind about how the bible is interpreted. eg: the gift of apple is really eve offering adam sex. Thus, the scholastic nature of their religion. They are always STUDYING the book objectively, and not just accept it simplistically, unlike christianity.<br></div>

That's only 1 point, albeit very major point. another major point is, where does the cloning stop?<br><br>There are other issues such as treating a women's body as a factory for producing eggs, or the health issues, or simply the research method which is viewed as terribly inefficient.<br><br>We could go all day at these, but the general concensus seem to be that the opposing camp are accusing the scientists of peddling false hope as "there isn't enough credible evidence taht stem cells can be used for therepeutic cloning", and the scientists going on and on about, "that's what research is about! that's what we're here for!"<br><br>I personally stand on the side of the scientists, though this is one issue which i feel should be treated with plenty of care, simply because it is so easy to go errant in their quest to be the first.</div>
