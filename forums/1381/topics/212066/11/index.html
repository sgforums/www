They provide so much evidence and facts tat u do not have even a ground or chance not to accept it without showing stupidity on your side.(And if they have no answer to it, they readily admit it.) U do not accept it, u can really keep asking till u do. It is not saying something and u have to accept it without questioning or even convinced. U can be the most agressive critic of science but eventually they have to concede (unless they wanna appear stupid) since science have the evidence tat makes it convincing.<br><br>On the other hand faith teach a different thing. U r taught to accept things. If it doesn't make sense, u r taught not to question further and simply accept them. If someone tell u something, no matter how ridiculous, ex: tat the president of usa is actually an angel, U r taught to accept them and further questioning is not entertained. Tat is why when I ask further questions, I am given a reply to "accept" them and not ask further. Where if there is anyone not satified with the answer I have given, they r welcome to keep replying and replying and I will keep answering and answering till they r satisfied (if I have the time). Furthermore, there r no evidence difference between christainity and other religion. It is really just "believe" without thinking.</div>
