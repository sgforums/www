Why do you say that they are inperfect(in your context) conditions?<br>They are inperfect but when you look at the big picture, i think they are still Good, i dont dare to say perfect cos i dont know it.<br></div></blockquote>First of all, thank you so much for answering.<br><br>There are 2 interpretations to your answers:<br><br>1. God has similar physical traits as us - the useless coccyx, appendix that can get inflammed if you jump around after meals, weak lower limbs prone to getting sprains. There are others but I don't want to go on and on.<br><br>Of course, by your definitions, they are not imperfect.<br><br>2. You don't know what is perfect but you say god is perfect. You said before you can't judge if something is perfect, unless you're perfect - a declaration so flawed on its own that I don't even know where to start.<br><br>------<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by davidche:</div><div class="quote_body">Now heres the thing:<br><br>only a perfect person can judge whether a thing is perfect or not cos he knows better than you or me.<br><br>Do you think a person who cannot even be in the perfect status can judge what is perfect?<br><br>You used Singapore Idol as an example which i think is very good.<br>You find that the judges are experts in music and not just any person.<br>Thats because they know what is good singing and bad singing and they know the <span style="font-style: italic;">difference</span><br>We on the other hand, can give comments and stuffs but we sometimes happen to have the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">wrong judgement</span></span>.<br><br></div></blockquote>Okie, now back to your previous questions when you asked me how I know when is something perfect. The fact is I don't.<br><br>However, I know when something is NOT. Like the example I gave for Singapore Idol - I'm no expert at singing but I can tell a terrible voice from far far away. <span style="color: blue;">I can tell imperfection, I can tell flaws, I can tell if something is wrong. I can tell if something is not perfect.</span><br><br>In fact, we all have the same abilities, if not we won't be criticising people<br><br>Back to the human flaws that arise from our descent from apes. They are imperfections because they are not working as they are supposed to!<br><br>If you get a computer and your keyboard cannot type properly. How do you know if it's imperfect? You compare to others and you realise there are other keyboards working better than this. Similar logic applies.</div>

Glad someone read all the info.<br><br>"Faster" was written in the context that the creator could have done better. It doesn't have to be the best. Have you ever sprained your legs? Ever wondered why we keep spraining our legs or why women always have to endure so much labour pain? It's because we humans were adapted to walk on two legs instead of 4 from our ancestors.<br><br>Our 2 lower limbs are too fragile to support all our weight and they easily give way when stressed. Also, female pelvis will have to be narrowed so that women don't walk like apes <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> and waste precious energy (food was scarce during caveman days). Narrowed pelvis, however, would create problems in childbirth and immature human babies compared to the rest of our close relatives like gorillas and chimpanzees.<br><br>Our legs were just not perfectly designed for walking on 2 feet cos' it was based on adaptation - modification from previous design. Therefore we are imperfect. Going by that logic, if God created us in his image, it would imply he's imperfect. Kinda hard to imagine the creator to be imperfect, don't you agree?<br><br>The only logical conclusion for adaptations to exist, is because of evolution. My analogy of an engineer best describes that. If you're an engineer, why would you design a system that is so faulty? Of course not... unless you're an idiot<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Hope that answers all your questions  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>Thank you for the replies kaister.<br><br>Yes, i have sprained my legs before just like the most of us do. When the pain comes, i did complain. But when my wife took care of me. I felt Love and most of the time, it is myself who who did not take good care of my legs, cannot blame anyone esle.<br><br>Women enduring labour pains. Yes, i am sure a lot of us here do wonder, why - if there is a God, He cannot just enable women to conceive in a painless manner. Myself included. i would want my wife to concieve in a manner that pleases me....no pain, just like magic...tada ! Here, baby klydeer. But then it occurred to me, that if a child is brought into this world as such, we as parents might not be able to appreciate the love and duty of taking good care of the child. Many mothers confided to us, that when they are in labour, they are also getting into a love relationship with their child....and that they are GLAD they went through labour pains - can this phenonmenon be wholly explained by adaptations ?<br><br>Whether or not we are suited to walk this earth on our 2 feet - well, that is i believed, suitably explained in the event that transpired in the garden of Eden. Dont think Adam and Eve has much problems trouncing about in a garden full of flowers, grass, fruits etc etc......but its what happened after the Fall...well that's another story.<br><br>Personally, i believe that when God says He created us in His image - i dont think He is as much referring to the physical nature of man, then the spiritual nature of man.<br><br>When i asked my previous questions, in my mind, i dont think of God as merely an engineer. The engineer in your description above might be capable of working out everything that is "better". But perhaps with a decreasing understanding of the human condition.  At least to me personally, i cringed in a so called perfect world that a few scientist today are trying to construct. I can ask a highly accredited architect to build me a nice house, but i cant ask the same person to build me a nice family in the house.  God can.<br><br>True, things might physically change over time - but i always wonder why the hearts of men doesnt....especially the love for one another. Evolution might be able to explain adaptation, but i dont see it explaining the consistency of the heart of mankind (for good or for evil), which i believe, would be the core of the matter ?<br><br>My apologies if some of your theoratical understandings are misrepresented here for i have really limited knowledge of those. Just wish to say that lived in a bliss where little means much. I lived in a bliss where i am vulnerable to physical pain and being able to feel Love when i mourn for the death of loved ones, or when i dwell in the fellowship of a few good men. This i rather be, than a life which is always in a faster forward mode for alas....i wished that my perspective of life would slow down and just bask in its beauty.<br><br>Maybe....i am just aint "adaptating" to this world.<br><br></div>
