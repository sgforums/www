There were already star systems that were few billion years old then, isn't that contradicting?<br><br>3. Yes, if we take things out of context, all humans are products of incest from the offsprings of adam and eve. Disturbing thought?<br><br>Again, you're trying to argue for creationism using the ONE AND ONLY prove you've got - the bible. Want to convince evolutionists?

In English it is the same word right? But pity, because the reader will miss the subtle difference. If you read the chinese bible, you realize they are translated differently. In Genesis 1, it is qi3 chu1. In John 1, it is tai4 chu1.<br><br>tai4 means very old, like tai4 shang4 lao3 jing1 in Taoism.<br><br>And the Adam part I also understand, thanks to Judaism.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyway, animals were not created from dirt, they could be but it is not specifically mentioned in the bible.<br><br>As to why Eve was not created from dust like Adam, Jewish tradition has this explanation:<br><br>1. Eve was created from his ribs because that is where you find the heart. Eve was created as a companion for Adam and Adam was to love her. It makes sense also to think of the woman as sheltering and providing his emotional needs?<br><br>2. Furthermore, the rib can be considered the middle part of the body, as opposed to the cranium? and the foot. This could be God's way of telling us - there is no discrimination between the male and the female. Adam could not lord over her (if she was created from the foot) and neither was Eve superior to Adam (if she was created from the cranium)<br><br>Hence if you put these two reasons together .. the rib is actually a logical choice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

In English it is the same word right? But pity, because the reader will miss the subtle difference. If you read the chinese bible, you realize they are translated differently. In Genesis 1, it is qi3 chu1. In John 1, it is tai4 chu1.<br><br>tai4 means very old, like tai4 shang4 lao3 jing1 in Taoism.<br><br>And the Adam part I also understand, thanks to Judaism.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyway, animals were not created from dirt, they could be but it is not specifically mentioned in the bible.<br><br>As to why Eve was not created from dust like Adam, Jewish tradition has this explanation:<br><br>1. Eve was created from his ribs because that is where you find the heart. Eve was created as a companion for Adam and Adam was to love her. It makes sense also to think of the woman as sheltering and providing his emotional needs?<br><br>2. Furthermore, the rib can be considered the middle part of the body, as opposed to the cranium? and the foot. This could be God's way of telling us - there is no discrimination between the male and the female. Adam could not lord over her (if she was created from the foot) and neither was Eve superior to Adam (if she was created from the cranium)<br><br>Hence if you put these two reasons together .. the rib is actually a logical choice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>I understand what he said literally but just not the intent behind why it was mentioned in this thread. So inferring from his line of logical thoughts (can be hard), I deducted that he's trying to say that why must evolutionist insist on finding a beginning when all else begins with God?<br><br>So in counter, I offered to say that his arguements are circular, by referring back to his only source of reference - Genesis.<br><br>Ribs serve no function, except as supporting structures for respiratory muscles. It might have some limited function of protecting the heart. In terms of symbolism, it served no more significance than taking a piece of his heart - which is also in the middle of the body.<br><br>Also, if God wanted Adam to love Eve why didn't he take a part of his heart instead? Or even the emotional center of his brain? Both represents how Adam should love Eve just as well. Taking some of his heart also makes the story more poetic.<br><br>So when all inferences of logic fail, we can only deduct that Genesis is not accurate and was based on outdated knowledge of anatomy and science. It also did not explain thoroughly how the sequence of creation is all wrong as mentioned previously in my post.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So I think it is quite senseless to debate whether Eve came from Adam's ribs or his lats. Genesis is telling us - Eve came from Adam, as opposed to being a new creation.<br><br>The Jewish tradition still applies, however, because it is telling us Eve was formed from some anatomy close to Adam's heart and it is not on top or at the bottom of the body.<br><br>I don't think there is anything illogical about this, that Eve came from Adam?</div>

Genesis 4 (NIV):<br><br><blockquote><br>13 Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is more than I can bear. 14 Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."<br><br>15 But the LORD said to him, "Not so [e]; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over."
