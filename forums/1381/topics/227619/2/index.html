They got teach you Luther's Theology of the Cross or not?

I have read the balding scholar's other books, like Early Christianities, Lost Scriptures and a book on the Gospel of Judas. He was one of the authors. Early Christianities is written in a scholarly way, not those books trying to stuff you evidence to make you believe in a certain point of view.<br><br>Well, I guess you can start when I'm done with the book, but I doubt people here will respond .. erm .. eagerly.<br><br>Christian fundamentalists .. hmm .. which kind? YECs? The more traditional Christians?</div>
