To be honest, how many people would actually want to see him as a mod whether Christian or non-Christian forum, afterthe reputation he has gotten from Eternal Hope and Speaker's Corner.

            <div class='col-md body'>EH will continue to be a place for discussing Christian topics in sgForums.  It will be a gathering for Christians so that the Christian views can be heard.  It will be a place for non-believers to ask questions they want an answer to.<br><br>I thank HB for this thread.  In the past, I have approached a few members to take up the moderating role, without success however.  The invitation to them is still open.<br><br>EH will continue to be moderated by born-again Christians only.  And the election of moderators will only be decided by the moderators.  Having said that, the role of a moderator here is minimal.  As SIS have pointed out, our role here is to remove/lock threads/posts that are degrading/offensive.  However, since this is a forum for Christianity-based topics, and judgment-calls to moderate threads need to be made from a Christian point-of-view (mostly), moderators must be Christians only.<br><br>We may try to steer discussions in a general direction.  But I think that can be done by all members or the threadstarter.  We can take up the role of councillor, but I think that can be done by all compassionate Christians.<br><br>Since I cannot be checking this forum consistently, and my co-mod is absent,  I have asked a few people to assist me to watch over the forum.  They will contact me when there is action that needs to be done by me.  I will continue to look our for new moderators.<br><br>I will continue to come in regularly to check for PMs.  Please write to me if there are any concerns.
