It was only when the Catholic inquisitor Johann Eck succeeded in winning him in a debate did his disgust at the POPE showed. But before that i doubt so.<br><br>Wikipedia:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Despite the fact that Eck was thus virtually forced to abandon his position, he succeeded, through his good memory and his dialectic skill, in confusing the heavy-witted Karlstadt and carried off the nominal victory. He was far less successful against Luther, who, as Eck himself confessed, was his superior in memory, acumen, and learning. After a disputation on the absolute supremacy of the papacy, purgatory, penance, etc., lasting twenty-three days (4 JulyÂ–27 July), the arbitrators declined to give a verdict, but the general impression was that victory rested with Eck. <strong>He did succeed in making Luther admit that there was some truth in the Hussite opinions and declare himself against the pope, </strong>but this success only embittered his animosity against his opponents, and from that time his whole efforts were devoted to Luther's overthrow. Eck was greeted as victor by the theologians of the University of Leipzig, who overwhelmed him with honors and sent him away with gifts.</span><br><br>"Accordingly, <strong>we concede to the papacy that they sit in the true Church, possessing the office instituted by Christ and inherited from the apostles</strong>, to teach, baptize, administer the sacrament, absolve, ordain, etc., just as the Jews sat in their synagogues or assemblies and were the regularly established priesthood and authority of the Church. We admit all this and do not attack the office, although they are not willing to admit as much for us; yea, we confess that we have received these things from them, even as Christ by birth descended from the Jews and the apostles obtained the Scriptures from them."<br>Sermon for the Sunday after ChristÂ’s Ascension; John 15:26-16:4 (2nd sermon), page 265, paragraph 28, 1522<br><br>But the quotes i posted seemed to describe the modern day effect of sola scriptura so i was wondering was Luther version of sola scriptura vastly different from today's version??? Surely he will not criticise his own doctrines unless it was a mutated version of his own. Alas this is all speculations...maybe a lutheran can help me.<br><br>I personally feel Sola Scriptura was a formula to reform the Catholic Church. To remove doctrines that are still fallible like the canon and justification. I do not feel it was a means to form a counter-church or denominations. None of the reformers had any intention of forming another church. Which brings me back, <strong>was Luther idea of Sola Scriptura vastly different from modern day version.</strong></div>
