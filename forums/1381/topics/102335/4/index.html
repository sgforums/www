God loves you and you and you and you <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

It was where the zealots (zionist is too mild a word) made their famous last stand against the Romans in 70 AD. (remember what Jesus said about what would happen?) The zealots rather commited suicide than fell into the hands of the invading tropps.

For example, Catholics won't argue to their grave on creationism, don't stress on evangelism like the Protestants (some groups), but Catholics take very strong stand on abortion, cloning, euthanasia etc.<br><br>One thing I learnt is one can learn from the different groups - ethical issues from the Catholics, scriptural study from the baptists and presbyterians, pneumatology from the charismatics etc.<br><br>Just think lor, if you're kind who don't quite emphasize on demon/spirit possession then one day you see someone in that 'state'.

            <div class='col-md body'>In short, catholic history is older than christian, and they held fast to church procedures and rituals. Christian r seperated from them, and they stick with the bible more closely. Tat is why catholic fight on traditional thingy such as abortion, masturbation and pre marital sex while christian fights on things such as speaking in tongues, creationism and tat earth is young<br><br>No matter which side is it, they both held on to the way of the old.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> My advice is to just follow your own moral compass on wat is right or wrong.
