But it's weird coS when we were in Secondary School not long ago, they'd skip recess to 'pray' together. Is that religious or what?

            <div class='col-md body'>Christians,<br>if you have problem with your partner not converting, then in the first place, don't ever date a non Christian.  Don't date the person first, then later try to convert him/her.  You wouldn't wish to quarrel over this kind of issue and end up both of you go on separate ways with him/her resenting your God.<br><br>Non Christians,<br>if you want to date a Christian, then be prepared that you have to face with this issue.  Don't start crying later, when your partner quarrel with you over you not converting.  If you're prepared to convert one day, good for you.  You can now go date the Christian guy or gal that you are attracted to.<br><br>For me, I have no issues.  I love the person for what he is.  If I am with a non Christian, non Catholic, then I have to be patient with his conversion.  I will hope for his conversion and hope to see him convert for the love of God, instead of to be with me.  So I will not give ultimatum like this "Convert, or we break up".  If he converts out of love for me, he will end up loving me, and be a half past six Catholic.  So what's the point?  He will come to church with me, with his mind thinking about something else, other than listening to the sermon.  Am I helping him in anyway by forcing him?  No.  If he can never love God, then I would rather he doesn't force himself into it.<br><br>Don't ever control a person's will.  Even God doesn't do that.
