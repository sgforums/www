            <div class='col-md body'>what the Bible forewarned and if people continue to carry on their own way..is called sin. excuses like 'its my freedom'....'i dun see there's much harm in this' seems reasonable...to me as well. But in the true essence of being a Christian...not a signboard version..is to deny yourself, pick up the cross and follow Christ. If you cannot do that....then my harsh reply to all of you is...dun pretend and deceive yourself......dun call yourself a christian.<br><br>As harsh as it seems...i bear absolute no apology for saying that for that is the expectation and requirement Christ gave to the people during His days when they want to follow Him. The apostles and early disciples did....what makes us feel that we can be some cosy happy go lucky Christian who takes the Bible as a secondary consideration and our self interests as primary?<br><br>I shall not carry on to re-explain why and why not 'unequally yoked' relationships r not allowed and to re-emphasise that Divorcing your non-believer partner is never taught in the Bible. at all.<br><br>What God forewarned and if men continue to walk in that very path He forbid, the rest of the consequences that befall upon u....dun u dare look up to heaven and blame God.<br><br>Rather..look into the mirror.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>If a muslim and a christian marry?

Which side will face a more serious backlash if they convert ?<br><br><blockquote>i mean, it doesn't mean i don't love her or accept her. but if she cannot accept who i am</blockquote>A question, if she is a muslim and cannot go into your church and had to pray 5 times a day, give money to their mosque and fast during certain period of time.She is going to treat her god as a higher priority than u as well. R u going to accept her ? Wat religion r u going to bring up her children as ?</div>
