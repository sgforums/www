OMG !!! i din wanna go, but i HAVE TO, cos the school required all Muslim to go. i was learning how to pray in a short time... i did go for the retreat. must say that all of my Muslim friends n teachers are very nice n so helpful. and i felt so blessed that i did go for that retreat. i finally found what i was searching for for a long time. i finally accept Islam as my religion. not because of my dad told me to. but because i want to and i do believe it. and i am so content now that i am a Muslim. i dun care how people or my mum's family say that Islam is bad or Muslim are poor (yes, my relatives did say that). i know what's good for me n i know that i'm in the right way.<br><br>and oh...after junior high school ended, i studied in a Christian Private School (cos that school was n still is known as a very good school). so i also did learn abt. Christian. but at that moment i'm already a Muslim. n i din hv even a slight thought to convert to any other religion. it's ok to know abt. other religion, n they also teach good things.<br><br>at last...after i finished high school, my mum decided to convert to Islam. not because of my dad told her to. but because she wanted herself.. here we are now..become a Muslim family <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> n i can say that i'm more than just content now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>btw..my post has nothing to do with this thread i think.. i was just telling story abt. myself. and since i was raised in a family where my parents fm different religions, my parents never forbid me to marry non-Muslim. as long as he's a good guy n he's responsible n honest, my parents wouldn't mind  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  and one more thing..he has to believe in God. i dun wanna marry any atheist for sure.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looks like I found the topic for my research presentation.<br><br>But I guess the killer statmentment is always if God is LOVE why would He disapprove of two people who really love each other...<br>Had a hard time explaining to my friend sia...<br><br>Or the statement its not fair to say cannot or disapprove when the two really loves each other...<br><br>Than someone will say than is it fair from someone who is blameless, holy and almight to degrade himself to becoming a sinful mere mortal and die for the whole cmi race? Its not fair.<br><br>Than people will start to argue on that part. Well in the end I guess its going to be very hard to explain in the first place if the other party is never going to accept it.<br><br>I guess its faith or no faith in the end. Without faith all the reasons in the world can be given but to no avail cos acceptance is not there. So I hope that everyone will be abit more open to comments here lah. Try to take it in the poster's view point as well. Like that more info can be shared and we all can learn something.<br><br>My view point to the guy with the problem.

            <div class='col-md body'>You talking rubbish or what? So Fo2 Jiao4 and Dao4 Jiao4 and even Hui2 Jiao2 are all sects or denominations?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Ji1 Du2 stands for Christ .... Ye2 Shu2 Ji1 Du2 is Jesus Christ. So Ji Du Jiao is Christianity lor.<br><br>Chinese is a rich language. If you mean state like Texas or Arizona, it is zhou1, not guo2. In China, there is sheng3 (eg. Guangdong Province). Those familiar with Romance of the Three Kingdoms will remember the liu4 jun4 ba1 shi2 yi1 zhou2 of the State of Wu. English is the hard language here as we can see it is more general in the definition.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Anyway it seems to be a fact Christian and Catholic are well segregated labels when they ask you to fill in your faith.<br><br>And if there is a meeting of religious leaders, you think the Catholic leaders will say "aiya, let the Protestant represent us la, we are all christians anyway ..
