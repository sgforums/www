He is stating his confidence in the Lord God as his refuge and protection, resting his trust in the God's supreme dominion, His watchful care of His people, His hatred to the wicked and judgments on them, and His love for righteousness and the righteous.<br><br>the question then is this, when Christ suffer and died, he did this to reconcile the sinners or the righteous ones to God? surely He paid the penalty for the sinners, simply because the rightous does not need Him to do this for them.<br><br>The phrase "God loves the sinner, but hates the sin" is usually refers to God's love for His creation including the sinners whom Christ had paid their penalty for (may not have received this gift of salvation yet), but God hate the Sin that is preventing the sinner from receiving this gift of salvation through Christ.<br><br>God bless...<br></div>
