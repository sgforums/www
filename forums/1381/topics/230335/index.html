Since we are not experts in, say, theology. Based on your reasoning, this whole forum should be closed down because there is basically no topic where we are experts in. Unless, of course, you have a degree or doctorate in theology or something relatable. Everything that you have said can be applied to almost any topic. So, why aren't you closing the other topics down?<br><br>There is really no one unified scientific community? Did I say that there is one unified scientific community? How about there are many different scientific communities all for the advancement of science throughout the globe?<br><br>I'm sure wikipedia itself is not an authority on anything. Who doesn't know that? How about the references in wikipedia? Didn't I mention that in the earlier thread? Why do you focus only on the wikipedia links? Why not the rest? More than half of the links I posted are not links to wikipedia. Don't be so biased.<br><br>If evolution is accepted by most scientists and most scientific communities and is actually taught in textbooks, then I don't see why some people cannot accept it as a fact.<br><br></div>

If you don't reference from other sources, then how would you know what is real and reliable and what is untrustworthy information? If you have ever written an essay or report at university level, you will know that you will require plenty of independent references to support your points. Why? Because nobody can possibly have all the knowledge in the world and nobody can have done all the research in the world. The worst kind of debate is one where you only give your biased and awful opinions with no backing at all.</div>

Yes, there are lots of links in wiki, unfortunately the realisation is that the links are of course based on the inclination of that particular wiki writer. To be totally objective, you should also posts the links to creationism. Unfortunately, I fear that your goal is just to present the side that you believe in. In order to spare readers the need to search: here is the wiki link to creationism: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creationism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creationism</a> which also contains tons of links to other pro-creationism websites.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by pretzel:</div><div class="quote_body">If evolution is accepted by most scientists and most scientific communities and is actually taught in textbooks, then I don't see why some people cannot accept it as a fact.<br></div></blockquote>Even if something is accepted by most scientists it doesn't mean it is correct, take the former-planet Pluto for example.
