"oorrrhhh! cannot!" and followed by a huge laughing session between two of us.<br><br>Seriously, the school can teach whatever they want. My family philosophy is: the mentoring and educating of the child primarily falls on the shoulder of the parents, so myself? I don't really care if schools teach evolution, or big bang or whatever. At the end of the day, I do not think that either one side is totally right in their interpretation. If I have to make a decision, I'd think the truth is drawn some where in the middle of creationism and evolution. Evolution gives me an insight as to HOW the world can be created.

Questions are one thing, but when you are tending towards provoking and annoying people by the tone and nature of your posts, its a different thing altogether.<br><br>I seriously doubt the "good intentions" of your posts. And I can tell you that this discussion is going to end up nowhere, because ultimately everyone will still continue to believe in what they originally believed in.<br><br>And with people like you posting remarks like that, it's no wonder that eventually such threads become flame baits. Which I think might be your intention all along. But it remains to be seen if your behaviour would improve.<br><br>Post your questions and queries, but leave out the snide remarks and the insults. The people here in general have been very gracious in replying your points despite your annoying and bratty behaviour. As a person being, you should be gracious enough to do the same.<br><br>Unless your intention is to just stir up trouble, then it's a different thing altogether.</div>

Afterall, sillyme has already told him to be nice.<br><br>If even after being told so, and pretzel still choose not to engage discussions politely and nicely, then I think we should just stop entertaining him, since he is not willing to be as gracious to others as how others are to him.<br><br>This isn't about religion or anything. It's more about basic courtest which Pretzel seems to lack.</div>

"oorrrhhh! cannot!" and followed by a huge laughing session between two of us.<br><br>Seriously, the school can teach whatever they want. My family philosophy is: the mentoring and educating of the child primarily falls on the shoulder of the parents, so myself? I don't really care if schools teach evolution, or big bang or whatever. At the end of the day, I do not think that either one side is totally right in their interpretation. If I have to make a decision, I'd think the truth is drawn some where in the middle of creationism and evolution. Evolution gives me an insight as to HOW the world can be created. Creationism (in the Christian POV) tells me the WHY.</div></blockquote>And if they both offer discordant views?</div>
