              <p>maybe some catholics are not well versed with the more traditional teachings of the church.... and in the process changed the traditional teachings to something else...</p>
              <p>however, whether the traditional teachings were changed or not, or whether the individual is aware of them or not.... it remains rather pointless to discuss whether tithing is a correct teaching or not seeing that the money goes to the church. it remains in the church responsibility to see that the money is wisely spent otherwise the leaders of the church is accountable to the unwise expenditure....</p>

              <p>I agree with you but I would not says conviction but faith. Our faith must be aligned with the bible and our Church teaching. As I mentioned to you before in another thread (if I remember correctly) that when you embrace on a faith, you embrace it whole heartedly.</p>
              <p>There are so many versions of Christianity now....all claimed to be the truth. There are some which are pretty attractive and appealing...some not so.</p>
              <p>So go with one that convinces you the most that the teachings and explanation of the bible makes most sense to you.</p>
              <p>I keep encouraging you to search because it will be helpful to you. Finally, you will be either convinced by another faith or become stronger in the one you currently embraced. So no lost to you.</p>
              <p>Abortion is killing another life....and divorce is breaking a vow made in front of God (unless you have a differenr marriage vow).</p>

              <p>St Augustine actually refer to titheing as part of alm giving which include giving to the church and charity works.</p>

This is similarly practiced by a lot of traditional protestant churches where the offering box is place at the back of the hall, and believers will just drop in whatever amount that they deciede to put in.

              <p>Yes, the Catholic Churches do ask for "love offering" which is what you termed as giving. The Church teaches the spirit of giving and not enforced tithing.</p>
              <p>The article you quote is not about teaching of tithing by the Catholic Church.</p>
              <p>I am NEVER against tradtional protestant churches like some assumed and  make wild allegations about. And I am aware that they do not enforce tithing. That is why I told dumbdumb that the sources I have are from protestants.</p>
              <p>Having said that, why are protestant churches not enforcing tithe?</p>
              <p>I am actually against wrong teaching of tithes and enforcing it so that it enriches only some which is why I said in the beinging of the thread:</p>
              <p>"There are recent outcry about mega churches and one of the
                                      issues is about money which of course comes from tithing. However,
                                      is tithing a correct teaching? Can they be enforced on all
                                      Christians?"</p>
              <p>I am never against giving money to the Church....10%, 15% or 200%...</p>

              <p>Yes, the Catholic Churches do ask for "love offering" which is what you termed as giving. The Church teaches the spirit of giving and not enforced tithing.</p>
              <p>The article you quote is not about teaching of tithing by the Catholic Church.</p>
              <p>I am NEVER against tradtional protestant churches like some assumed and  make wild allegations about. And I am aware that they do not enforce tithing. That is why I told dumbdumb that the sources I have are from protestants.</p>
              <p>Having said that, why are protestant churches not enforcing tithe?</p>
              <p>I am actually against wrong teaching of tithes and enforcing it so that it enriches only some which is why I said in the beinging of the thread:</p>
              <p>"There are recent outcry about mega churches and one of the issues is about money which of course comes from tithing. However, is tithing a correct teaching? Can they be enforced on all Christians?"</p>
              <p>I am never against giving money to the Church....10%, 15% or 200%...</p>

              <p>ha ha... i am aware that you do not wish to respond to me directly... no problem...  <em>edit: (i stand corrected... you did respond)</em></p>
              <p>i think if you had phrased the title to this as <strong>Can The Church Enforce Tithing </strong>would have been more appropriate.</p>
              <p>your title is: <strong>is tithing a correct teaching</strong>, and to some the word tithing will mean giving, and that giving is a teaching of Scripture, hence tithing <strong>IS </strong>a correct teaching, but giving, while correct, is also subjected to some conditions, one of which is, be a joyful giver.</p>

              <p><strong>2449 </strong>Beginning with the Old Testament, all kinds of juridical measures (the jubilee year of forgiveness of debts, prohibition of loans at interest and the keeping of collateral, <strong>the obligation to tithe</strong>, the daily payment of the day-laborer, the right to glean vines and fields) answer the exhortation of <em>Deuteronomy</em>: "For the poor will never cease out of the land; therefore I command you, 'You shall open wide your hand to your brother, to the needy and to the poor in the land.'" Jesus makes these words his own: "The poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me." In so doing he does not soften the vehemence of former oracles against "buying the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals . . .," but invites us to recognize his own presence in the poor who are his brethren:</p>

              <p>unless you want me to assume that all those articles are in error and all these catholic writers and brethens are too stupid to understand the word of "tithe".</p>

              <p>"Canon 222 of the Code of Canon Law outlines two financial obligations of the faithful: “to assist with the needs of the church” and “to promote social justice and...assist the poor.” Those Catholic parishes that have adopted tithing often embrace that dual focus, encouraging a gift of 5 percent of gross income to the parish and an additional 5 percent to charitable causes.

              <p>it does seem the issue of NOT-tithing is not as widespread as original thought and that the practices are also not as universal as claimed.</p>

              <p>discussions in catholic websites talks about the history of tithing, the evolving of the giving culture, the rationale over why there was institutionalized tithing and why such practice have changed.... but never was such publication on the issue of whether tithing was a wrong teaching....</p>
              <p>protestant websites? got plenty that says tithing is wrong...</p>

              <p><em><strong>whether tithing is correct or wrong</strong></em>... tithing had a place in history when the priests needed the folks to support them. tithing had a historical precedence in the old testament. whether it had lost it's relevance in the new testament cannot be concluded.</p>
