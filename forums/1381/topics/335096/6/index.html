              <p>Thanks, i think the person is 'breytonhartge'.  He is a messianic believer, they call themselves messianic Judaism.  Their chief 'so call' rabbi is Tim Hegg, a protestant minister, graduated from the Northwest Baptist seminary in 1976 (M.Div) and in 1980 (Th.M).  Tim Hegg also teaches his followers to Brit Milah i.e. cut kkb or kkj. i think maybe breytonhartge cut his kkb or kkj if he is fervent enough.  This group also use Hebrew liturgy &amp; symbols in their worship. They also keep the sabbath. They also teaches their gentiles followers to follow the 613 law of moses.  Rabbinic and bilbical teachings does not require gentile believers to cut kkb or kkj unless he wants to convert, becomes a proselyte, change his name and becomes a Jew. Rabbinic rabbis will discourage gentile who wants to converts, not to convert but to remains as Gentile believers in Hashem.  According to rabbinic teachings the 613 laws of Moses does not apply to gentile believer.  Gentile believers are only obligated  to follow the 7 laws of Noah.  u may wish to refer to your bible  Acts chapter 15 regarding this issue of brit milah for Gentiles.</p>

              <p>The main reason why the Levitical tithes is given to the Levites is for their work at the tents of meeting or at the temple.  These verses can clearly explain the purpose of the tithes.</p>
              <p>"<em>To the sons of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they perform, the service of the tent of meeting.</em>  Numbers 18:21 NASB</p>
              <p><em>'You may eat it anywhere, you and your households, for it is your compensation in return for your service in the tent of meeting</em>. Numbers 18:31 NASB</p>
              <p>In the promised land, 3 times a year, all isrealites must come before the temple or Tabernacle to celebrate the major Feasts of the LORD. They will comsume their tithes before the LORD.</p>
              <p>"<em>You shall surely tithe all the produce from what you sow, which comes out of the field every year. </em></p>
              <p><em> "You shall eat in the presence of the LORD your God, at the place where He chooses to establish His name, the tithe of your grain, your new wine, your oil, and the firstborn of your herd and your flock, so that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always</em>.  Deuteronomy 14:22-23 NASB</p>
              <p>"<em>Three times in a year all your males shall appear before the LORD your God in the place which He chooses, at the Feast of Unleavened Bread and at the Feast of Weeks and at the Feast of Booths, and they shall not appear before the LORD empty-handed</em>.  Deuteronomy 16:16 NASB</p>
              <p>The Levitical tithes cannot be separated from its purpose of temple worship.  The teaching of tithes is not wrong.  It is the wilful mis-interpretation in the teaching of tithes by some churches that profane Hashem good name.</p>

              then the Roman Catholic Church itself must be the biggest of all

              <p>But you know that when one talk about mega-churches, we know roughly who they are talking about.</p>
              <p>It seems like there are many "new" comers striving to be the next mega church and they always says they are non-denominational.....</p>

              <p>Dear bros and sis' in Christ, may I refer you to read up on 1 Corinthians 9:1-14?</p>
              <p>"Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not the result of my work in the Lord? Even though I may not be an apostle to others, surely I am to you! For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.</p>
              <p>This is my defense to those who sit in judgment on me. Don't we have the right to food and drink? Don't we have the right to take a believing wife along with us, as do the other apostles and the Lord's brothers and Cephas? Or is it only I and Barnabas who must work for a living?</p>
              <p>Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its grapes? Who tends a flock and does not drink of the milk? Do I say this merely from a human point of view? Doesn't the Law say the same thing? For it is written in the Law of Moses: "Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain." Is it about oxen that God is concerned? Surely he says this for us, doesn't he? Yes, this was written for us, because when the plowman plows and the thresher threshes, they ought to do so in the hope of sharing in the harvest. <sup id="en-NIV-28536" class="versenum">11</sup>If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you? If others have this right of support from you, shouldn't we have it all the more?</p>
              <p>But we did not use this right. On the contrary, we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ. Don't you know that those who work in the temple get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar? In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel."</p>
              <p>Nowadays, people give money to the church not only to pay the staffs, but also to maintain the church that they are in... Just that there are certain people who used these money for God and turned them to their own without guilt or shame...</p>
              <p>Well? Any opinions?</p>

              <p>if you understand that worldly riches are but temporal, why would this issue even bother you. ;)</p>
              <p>people who truly realise that life is just a passing cloud, or grass which is green today, but dried up tomorrow, won't be bothered by these issues. in fact, they won't even want to waste their energy in critisizing.</p>
              <p>i agree that tithing should be transparent, in the context where, we know what each ministry is spending on, or where the money is being put to use. but if a portion of the tithe is actually the pastor or priest's salary, then i think it's not really our business how he spends his salary.</p>
