              <p>I think we shouldn't think all churches are like these because of the bad experience you encountered.</p>
              <p>If you are really that concerned about how the church spent their money, read their Annual Financial report.  If you don't agree with the spending (eg... they have mishandled the fund), then you can choose to leave the church and keep looking for another one.</p>
              <p>Christians are not perfect so are the Pastors and staffs of the church.  They are human too who are prone to temptations (Greed).</p>
              <p>Why do you allow this experience to stop you from knowing our loving God?</p>

              <p>I think we shouldn't think all churches are like these because
              of the bad experience you encountered.</p>
              <p>If you are really that concerned about how the church spent
              their money, read their Annual Financial report.  If you don't
              agree with the spending (eg... they have mishandled the fund), then
              you can choose to leave the church and keep looking for another
              one.</p>
              <p>Christians are not perfect so are the Pastors and staffs of the
              church.  They are human too who are prone to temptations
              (Greed).</p>
              <p>Why do you allow this experience to stop you from knowing our
              loving God?</p>

              <p>If the church is preaching money, leave at once.....and you see, Joolead is an example of a victim of such preaching....</p>
              <p>Saying tithe is needed so that you can receive blessings are lies and playing on people's greed.....</p>
              <p>It may be good to read the links in the first post and take time to understand why teaching of tithe is wrong and not defensible with the Bible.</p>
              <p>If you agree with them then stop doing the wrong thing (to tithe) and if you are still convinced that god's blessing is for sale, it's your choice.</p>

              <p>This is an EXELLENT question. I can declare right here right now that tithing IS sanctified by God and when you tithe, you will surely reap.</p>
              <p>Lets look at Malachi, the last chapter of the O.T.</p>
              <p>"Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed me.You say,how have we robbed you? In tithes and offerings. You have said: 'it is useless to keep God's ordinance' , yet you say ' how have we robbed you?'"</p>
              <p>God's ordinance here was in reference to the concept of tithes and offerings. Now, why would God say 'you have robbed me" if it was an act out of our "respect" for God?</p>
              <p>In the above chapter still in Malachi, God says :" Bring all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house."</p>
              <p>The keyword here is "Bring". Normally, when someone says "Give me a car", it means that you own the car, and whether you give or not its up to you.  But when he says "Bring me the car", please dont say to another friend afterwards :" I gave him that car".    He'll say : Eh, come here come here... What you mean you gave me that car? You brought back my car!" </p>
              <p>Am i understandable so far?</p>
              <p>"but what good does it do to follow this ordinance?"    God says, "first bring the tithe in, and TEST ME NOW IN THIS! See if I will not throw open the windows of blessing upon you."</p>
              <p>This is the only one time God says "Test me". How many believe this verse?</p>
              <p>"Jesus didnt preach tithing leh? Doesnt that mean its outdated?"</p>
              <p>Wrong. First I must make it clear that only believers can tithe. When Jesus was still alive, He could not ask people to tithte because He had not yet died for their sins. IF they tried to tithe, it would be regarded as a "debt payment" and not a tithe.  But at the cross, AFTER He paid for all our sins, once and for all, we are free to tithe!</p>
              <p>but there were cases of people tithing when He was still on earth. I refer to Zacchaeus, the rich tax collecter whom Jesus cried out to" I must come and eat at your house". Jesus showed him what pure undeserved favor was like and the result of that revelation is that Zacchaeus went out, and returned all that he cheated 4 times the amount, and gave half his possesions to the poor.  Only grace can lead a man to tithe. </p>
              <p>For proof, the previous chapter, there was a rich young ruler. He asked Jesus " Teacher, what must I do to get eternal life? "  He regarded Jesus not as Saviour, but merely as Teacher. So Jesus gave him the "standard" answer. Actually this guy not bad..  of all the commandments, he already keep all, short of 1. Just one leh..  "Give all you have to the poor and follow me."  what happens when Jesus showed him the Law? The poor boy could not even give one coin. But under grace, Zachaeus opened up his coffers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So therefore, tithing and offerings cannot fully function by the law. Where do i get my proof? Lets go all the way back to Genesis. The story now is that there were some kings who were invading the land. The leader of those kings was Kerdorlaomer, King of Elam, which is present day Iran.  This king of Iran conqured their enemies and looted the cities, and guess who was in one of them? Abraham's nephew, Lot! So they carried Lot and all that he had away too.</p>
              <p>When Abraham heard of this, he took up all 318 fighting men in his house and hunted the kings down. Abraham took back Lot and his things, plus the defeated kings and their possession(including women and children) PLUS the invading army's plunder. Wow..  Thats ALOT of gold and silver and slaves...</p>
              <p>Then King of Sodom( an evil king for sure,just look at the name), one of the defeated kings, came to Abraham and said " Keep the gold, just give me the people."  Abraham said, "I will not take anything from you, not even a shoelace, lest you say I made abraham rich. Just give my men their share." </p>
              <p>Then, another King appeared. This was King Melchizedek( his name means King Of Righteousness). In his hand was the Holy Communion elements. Abraham tithed unto Melchizedek. Eh? This was the VERY first direct mention of the tithe. But this happened more than 400 years BEFORE the law. So tithing and the law are two seperate things! </p>
              <p>If you have managed to read until here, good job lol..   </p>
              <p>Ya, I know about tithing now.But I dun want to give to church. Can give to charity direct or not? Scared later the church take my money and buy golden tap or toilet bowl...</p>
              <p>The Lord says: Bring the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house"</p>
              <p>Where is God's house? The church! Is it any church? No, instead it is the one where you get your "spiritual food" from. If your church is not feeding you with the Word, then feel free to find one that does and tithe to it.</p>
              <p>What do i mean by good food?</p>
              <p>1) Does faith come by hearing and hearing the Word that is being preached?</p>
              <p>2) when the pastor preaches, does he use Bible to interpret Bible?</p>
              <p>3) is there life in the church? or is everyone looking like doom and gloom is right upon us?</p>
              <p>4) do you find yourself wanting more and more of the Good News?</p>
              <p>thats food my friends... </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ya ok, but i dun want to give through church can? I want to give direct!</p>
              <p>Ok lor,  you throw up wards...  what ever drops back down goes to the church ok?</p>
              <p>This message is dangerous ... must warn you..  Cos when you believe it and tithe like this, be prepared.  You will be so blessed that your nets will break, your boat will sink, and there might be 12 basketfuls left over if your not too careful...  But if you like having God to personally prsoper you His way, then by all means tithe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope i shared some relvelation on this subject..  </p>

              <p>This is an EXELLENT question. I can declare right here right now
              that tithing IS sanctified by God and when you tithe, you will
              surely reap.</p>
              <p>Lets look at Malachi, the last chapter of the O.T.</p>
              <p>"Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed me.You say,how have we
              robbed you? In tithes and offerings. You have said: 'it is useless
              to keep God's ordinance' , yet you say ' how have we robbed
              you?'"</p>
              <p>God's ordinance here was in reference to the concept of tithes
              and offerings. Now, why would God say 'you have robbed me" if it
              was an act out of our "respect" for God?</p>
              <p>In the above chapter still in Malachi, God says :" Bring all the
              tithes into the storehouse, that there may be food in my
              house."</p>
              <p>The keyword here is "Bring". Normally, when someone says
              "Give me a car", it means that you own the car, and
              whether you give or not its up to you.  But when he says
              "Bring me the car", please dont say to another friend afterwards :"
              I gave him that car".    He'll say : Eh, come here
              come here... What you mean you gave me that car? You brought back
              my car!" </p>
              <p>Am i understandable so far?</p>
              <p>"but what good does it do to follow this
              ordinance?"    God says, "first bring the tithe in,
              and TEST ME NOW IN THIS! See if I will not throw open the windows
              of blessing upon you."</p>
              <p>This is the only one time God says "Test me". How many
              believe this verse?</p>
              <p>"Jesus didnt preach tithing leh? Doesnt that mean its
              outdated?"</p>
              <p>Wrong. First I must make it clear that only believers can tithe.
              When Jesus was still alive, He could not ask people to tithte
              because He had not yet died for their sins. IF they tried to
              tithe, it would be regarded as a "debt payment" and not a
              tithe.  But at the cross, AFTER He paid for all our sins,
              once and for all, we are free to tithe!</p>
              <p>but there were cases of people tithing when He was
              still on earth. I refer to Zacchaeus, the rich tax collecter
              whom Jesus cried out to" I must come and eat at your house". Jesus
              showed him what pure undeserved favor was like and the
              result of that revelation is that Zacchaeus went out,
              and returned all that he cheated 4 times the
              amount, and gave half his possesions to the poor.  Only
              grace can lead a man to tithe. </p>
              <p>For proof, the previous chapter, there was a rich young ruler.
              He asked Jesus " Teacher, what must I do to get eternal life?
              "  He regarded Jesus not as Saviour, but merely as Teacher. So
              Jesus gave him the "standard" answer. Actually this guy not
              bad..  of all the commandments, he already keep all, short of
              1. Just one leh..  "Give all you have to the poor and follow
              me."  what happens when Jesus showed him the Law? The poor boy
              could not even give one coin. But under grace, Zachaeus opened up
              his coffers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So therefore, tithing and offerings cannot fully function by the
              law. Where do i get my proof? Lets go all the way back to Genesis.
              The story now is that there were some kings who were invading the
              land. The leader of those kings was Kerdorlaomer, King of Elam,
              which is present day Iran.  This king of Iran conqured their
              enemies and looted the cities, and guess who was in one of them?
              Abraham's nephew, Lot! So they carried Lot and all that he had away
              too.</p>
              <p>When Abraham heard of this, he took up all 318 fighting men in
              his house and hunted the kings down. Abraham took back Lot and his
              things, plus the defeated kings and their possession(including
              women and children) PLUS the invading army's plunder. Wow.. 
              Thats ALOT of gold and silver and slaves...</p>
              <p>Then King of Sodom( an evil king for sure,just look at the
              name), one of the defeated kings, came to Abraham and said " Keep
              the gold, just give me the people."  Abraham said, "I will not
              take anything from you, not even a shoelace, lest you say I
              made abraham rich. Just give my men their share." </p>
              <p>Then, another King appeared. This was King Melchizedek( his name
              means King Of Righteousness). In his hand was the Holy Communion
              elements. Abraham tithed unto Melchizedek. Eh? This was the VERY
              first direct mention of the tithe. But this happened more than 400
              years BEFORE the law. So tithing and the law are two seperate
              things! </p>
              <p>If you have managed to read until here, good job
              lol..   </p>
              <p>Ya, I know about tithing now.But I dun want to give
              to church. Can give to charity direct or not? Scared later the
              church take my money and buy golden tap or toilet bowl...</p>
              <p>The Lord says: Bring the tithes into the storehouse, that
              there may be food in my house"</p>
              <p>Where is God's house? The church! Is it any church? No, instead
              it is the one where you get your "spiritual food"
              from. If your church is not feeding you with the
              Word, then feel free to find one that does and tithe to it.</p>
              <p>What do i mean by good food?</p>
              <p>1) Does faith come by hearing and hearing the Word that is
              being preached?</p>
              <p>2) when the pastor preaches, does he use Bible to interpret
              Bible?</p>
              <p>3) is there life in the church? or is everyone looking
              like doom and gloom is right upon us?</p>
              <p>4) do you find yourself wanting more and more of the Good
              News?</p>
              <p>thats food my friends... </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ya ok, but i dun want to give through church can? I want to give
              direct!</p>
              <p>Ok lor,  you throw up wards...  what ever drops
              back down goes to the church ok?</p>
              <p>This message is dangerous ... must warn you.. 
              Cos when you believe it and tithe like this, be
              prepared.  You will be so blessed that your nets
              will break, your boat will sink, and there might be 12 basketfuls
              left over if your not too careful...  But if you like having
              God to personally prsoper you His way, then by all means tithe.</p>
