              <p>You can keep quoting Catholic sites that have sermons on tithes (why is that a problem?) but none that enforces tithes like those churches I am talking about. NONE.</p>
              <p>If you wish to argue about right or wrong, go and read those links in the first post and state your stand why you think it is not wrong. Don't stray OT and start blaming others.</p>

              <p>i seriously think that the catholic encyclopedia is a good source. it is relatively unbias and factual.... but this factuality at least with the issue of tithing points irrevocably that this was practice and encouraged.... at least in the past.</p>
              <p>bear in mind again, the thread is about whether "<strong>tithing is a correct teaching</strong>" or not..... had your topic been "<strong>tithing is irrelevant or not</strong>" it will become another issue.</p>
              <p>also your denial of the catholic church not doing it... does not come across as objective when the encyclopedia states that very clearly that tithing was part of the catholic lifestyle.</p>

              <p>Salted fish is unhealty, possibility of heart attack?.  Generally the people that tithe are Owners of fields where certain crops like wheat are planted, also the Owner of flocks of sheeps, goats etc., also the Levites who gave the best 10% of the tithe they received from the Isrealites to the Priests.  The priests don't tithe, but use the tithe for services in the temple.  Poor people who received tithes or charity cannot give tithes unlike some of the present church teachings today.</p>

              <p>It cannot be said that the "church" mentioned in this passage (and all the text the precedes it) refers to any other religious institutions other than the catholic church.</p>
              <p>It does seem to me that according to the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14741b.htm">Catholic encyclopedia</a>, tithes were practiced by the church in history.</p>
              <p>Therefore, can it be concluded that the catholic church was incorrect,</p>
              <p>or perhaps,</p>
              <p>the church was correct, taking into consideration of the social and cultural issue of the era.. but over the years, tithing is now longer relevant?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Obversely the teachings of tithing by the church are not in accordance with the Law of Moses.  I am for the opinion that  the RC Church has repented from this error,  but many protestant churches, especially the independent churches, are still unrepentant.</p>

              <p>Money in the form of shekels, silver &amp; gold were widely used during the time of Abraham.  Abraham bought the piece of land to bury Sarah for 400 shekels of silver.  Jacob sent his sons to Egypt to buy grains with money.  During the time of Moses money is widely used for transactions &amp; trade. e.g if an isrealites wishes to redeem his tithes with money, he must add 20% to its value etc.  Here is a list of valuation laws in the Law of Moses:</p>
              <p><em>Again, the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, </em></p>
              <p><em> "Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When a man makes a difficult vow, he shall be valued according to your valuation of persons belonging to the LORD. </em></p>
              <p><em> 'If your valuation is of the male from twenty years even to sixty years old, then your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. </em></p>
              <p><em> Or if it is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels. </em></p>
              <p><em> 'If it be from five years even to twenty years old then your valuation for the male shall be twenty shekels and for the female ten shekels. </em></p>
              <p><em>'But if they are from a month even up to five years old, then your valuation shall be five shekels of silver for the male, and for the female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver. </em></p>
              <p><em> 'If they are from sixty years old and upward, if it is a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels. </em></p>
              <p><em> 'But if he is poorer than your valuation, then he shall be placed before the priest and the priest shall value him; according to the means of the one who vowed, the priest shall value him. </em></p>
              <p><em> 'Now if it is an animal of the kind which men can present as an offering to the LORD, any such that one gives to the LORD shall be holy. </em></p>
              <p><em> 'He shall not replace it or exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; or if he does exchange animal for animal, then both it and its substitute shall become holy. </em></p>

              <p><em> 'The priest shall value it as either good or bad; as you, the priest, value it, so it shall be. </em></p>
              <p><em> 'But if he should ever wish to redeem it, then he shall add one-fifth of it to your valuation. </em></p>

              <p><em> 'Yet if the one who consecrates it should wish to redeem his house, then he shall add one-fifth of your valuation price to it, so that it may be his. </em></p>
              <p><em> 'Again, if a man consecrates to the LORD part of the fields of his own property, then your valuation shall be proportionate to the seed needed for it: a homer of barley seed at fifty shekels of silver. </em></p>
              <p><em> 'If he consecrates his field as of the year of jubilee, according to your valuation it shall stand. </em></p>
              <p><em> 'If he consecrates his field after the jubilee, however, then the priest shall calculate the price for him proportionate to the years that are left until the year of jubilee; and it shall be deducted from your valuation. </em></p>

              <p><em>and when it reverts in the jubilee, the field shall be holy to the LORD, like a field set apart; it shall be for the priest as his property. </em></p>
              <p><em>'Or if he consecrates to the LORD a field which he has bought, which is not a part of the field of his own property, </em></p>

              <p><em> 'Every valuation of yours, moreover, shall be after the shekel of the sanctuary. The shekel shall be twenty gerahs. </em></p>

              <p>Money in the form of shekels, silver &amp; gold were widely used during the time of Abraham.  Abraham bought the piece of land to bury Sarah for 400 shekels of silver.  Jacob sent his sons to Egypt to buy grains with money.  During the time of Moses money is widely used for transactions &amp; trade. e.g if an isrealites wishes to redeem his tithes with money, he must add 20% to its value etc. </p>

              if the argument is that in the OT times... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the tithe were
              crops... and because it is NOT money, the teaching is wrong</strong></span>... then
              note that in those days, barter trading was the norm... so the
              crops were also a form of currency.</div>
