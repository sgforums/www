              <p>hi guys/gals<br>i used to wonder, wht is the purpose of tithing anyway, giving 10% of our salary or even giving offerings..<br>but as i grew older and c more of the activities going on the church, i realise tht the tithtes and our offering are used to pay for the ultitlity bills of the church, to pay church workers salary (even pastors..), the mission trips expenses (e,g, to china), other ministries such as orphanage ministry etc etc... and also build some extension of the church ( As we harvest more and more soul, we need bigger church)...building dont come cheap nowadays :P</p>
              <p>yeah totally agree.. tht giving tithes u will not get anoything back...but normally u will in a way u dont nkow or expcet..as in scripture..god will trully bless those who follow his words..tht included tithes...</p>
              <p>i have not eaten much salt in life, but thinking tis past few years..i think i m trully blessed, to meet the ppl i meet, to go places i nvr expect to go...</p>
              <p>i m not the right person to say tis, but obey the lord and he will truly bless you..</p>
              <p>p.s. i dont give ttithes because i expect something, but as an obligation :)<br>as some of you would say.. at ur own comfort...</p>

              <p>The point missed here is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>tithing is not enforceable and thus a wrong teaching.</strong></span></p>
              <p>But <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>no tithing does not means no giving.</strong></span>...tithing and giving (out of free will and what one could afford) is not the same.</p>
              <p>The articles quoted (pls do spend some time reading) is just to highlight why teaching of tithing is wrong.</p>
              <p>More importantly, what tithes really are.....</p>
              <p>It is not to show that giving money to church is wrong. But to ask for 10% in the name of God and tithe is wrong (at least for those who agree with the articles).</p>
              <p>God bless us all regardless if we tithe / give or not.</p>

              <p>Just to clarify...Jesus is NOT AGAINST the rich but against GREED.....and the need more more and more....</p>
              <p>And you are right that He <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>never</strong></span> teach or preach about tithing because it is not required by God.</p>
              <p>But again, no tithing does not means no giving but we need to give from our heart and what we are most comfortable to give.</p>
              <p>Not like what is being preached by some self proclaimed pastors that tithing will bring you prosperity, riches, return whatever they call it. Worst that tithing is a command by God and not doing so is "stealing" from God etc....</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>So don't tithe out of GREED or FEAR.</strong></span>....NEVER tithe but do give generously (not to make the pastor rich but to help maintain the church and most important to help the poor and needy) and have peace. Never give cause you want "returns from God.</p>

                      the poor or for maintian the church?some will say look at god

              <p>Then who is the one who take the money not god but man.so can

              <p>First of all, understand the missions of the Church you attend and find out what they do - you can find many charities, home, hospices, hospitals etc that are run by religious organisations.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the Church (at least I know the Catholics Churches do) will tell you that they money collected is for what purposes example : every month, there is a collection by St Vincent de Paul and collections are used to help the poor and needy within the parish regardless of faith.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, you can give directly to any charities or any needy persons you come across. It is not necessary to give only to the Church or through the Church.</p>
              <p>It is the reason why you give that matters.....and not the amount or a must to give only to the Church. Giving is about charity and most important - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LOVE of your neighbour</strong></span>.</p>
              <p>If you belong to a Church, you would want to help chip in by giving money for maintenence right? Just like staying in HDB, you pay town council and in condo, you pay maintenance too.....</p>
              <p>The teaching of tithing is to give 10% to the "church" and if pastors
                      are staying in semi-d and driving conti cars.....I wonder where most of
                      the money goes to.......and worst by saying that God will prosper them when they give money to the "church" which they claimed is to give to God.</p>
              <p>As you rightly questioned:"Then who is the one who take the money not god but man.so can
                                              you be so sure the money is given to god?"</p>
              <p>which is why teaching of tithing is not right.</p>

              <p>Whether to tithe or not to tithe, it's between you and God.  I simply believe that God has blessed us with a job that it's fair enough to give some up for His work.</p>
              <p>It's also a matter of how you believe in the works that your church is doing.  The church can only reach out to the non-believers and to help out the unfortunate with the support of the members including you and me.  Everything involves money nowadays (utilities, salary to the staffs etc) and we just need to be realistic that the only way to keep the church going is from our tithe.</p>

              <p><strong>The point that is missed here is again : <span style="text-decoration: underline;">No tithing does not means no giving.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tithing is a wrong teaching</strong></span> and the biblical facts to support this are in the links provided in the first posts.</p>
              <p>There is no need to tithe and Jesus never tell us to do so. God's blessings are not tied to tithe.</p>
              <p>Catholic Churches never teaches to  tithe and yet they survived for 2000+ years and still thriving.....simply proved that "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the only way to keep the church going is from our
              tithe</span></strong>" is not correct.</p>
              <p>Agreed with you that "give and you will be given" as well as "we should give with a grateful heart instead of obligation".</p>
              <p>To add on, we should give what we are comfortable with and to whom we wishes to help and not tithe to make someone rich.</p>
              <p>"No one has the right to judge you whether you give or not" but certainly NO ONE should teach me to tithe or teach "the benefits of tithing" when it is wrong.</p>

              <p>Yes, I agreed with you that I disagree with such people and that is why I started this thread so that people can see the other side of the teaching of tithes.</p>
              <p>It is sad that some people see pastoring as a way to get rich fast and they really cheapen the word Pastor. Many of these are untrained and self-proclaimed ones....which is why they always need to say "God spoke to me"......some even started their own training school to teach!</p>
              <p>They do a lot of injustice to those Pastors who are trained and who are really out to serving God.</p>
