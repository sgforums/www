              <p>if you understand that worldly riches are but temporal, why would this issue even bother you. ;)</p>
              <p>people who truly realise that life is just a passing cloud, or grass which is green today, but dried up tomorrow, won't be bothered by these issues. in fact, they won't even want to waste their energy in critisizing.</p>
              <p>i agree that tithing should be transparent, in the context where, we know what each ministry is spending on, or where the money is being put to use. but if a portion of the tithe is actually the pastor or priest's salary, then i think it's not really our business how he spends his salary.</p>

              <p><br>Agree totally... We should not really care how a chruch leader spends his money... Afterall these are things that are really personal, I truely believe that the overseers of chruches have the prudence of using their own money and managing their family...</p>

              <p>There is nothing fundamentally wrong with tithing. But yet, certain megachurches like city harvest emphasise on other kinds of donations on top of tithing. There is the building fund where one must make a pledge of a certain amount of money over 6 months ( breaking this pledge, it would be breaking a promise to God as they say ). There is also love offering, mission offering, etc..</p>
              <p>What is astonishing is that they can have offerings for almost everything you can think of. My question is, 10% of its total congregation (assuming at least 15k of them tithes) is already an exhorbitant sum. Is there a need for all the other kinds of offerings?</p>
              <p>Surely millions of dollars taken from tithes alone is enough to cover all costs? Why is there a need for so much money? Didn't Christ say not to hoard up treasures in earth?</p>

              <p>youayou is a christian who needs lots of guidance. Just like all the city harvest kids. The statistics point that almost 60% of city harvest congregation are in their teens.</p>
              <p>Not pointing a finger at anything, but it seems city harvest has a target audience for teenagers. At that age, they are the most easily impressionable and hence easier to convert. Being unchurched, they have no understanding on how a church should be like and are attracted by their friends and the social belonging of cell groups at city harvest.</p>
              <p>Whilst this helps keep the kids away from the streets (which i think is a positive thing), I feel that they function more like a country club for teens rather than a church.</p>
              <p>The God that I love and worship does not need money from me nor does He need an extravagant place of worship. The God that I know is in my heart, Not in a building made of gold and silver.</p>
              <p>Money donated to a church should be just adequate for its pastors/leaders/priests to sustain a decent standard of living and their focus should be on God and not materialistic wants. </p>
