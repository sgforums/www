Any Christian bro/sis care to comment?<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>"GODS love fragrances." That was a common saying among ancient Egyptians. To them, the burning of incense was very much a part of their worship. In the belief that the gods were near, the Egyptians burned incense daily at their temples and household altars and even while engaging in business. Other nations had similar customs.<br><br>What is incense? The term can refer to the smoke or to the substance burned. It is made of aromatic resins and gums, such as frankincense and balsam. These are pounded into a powder and are often mixed with such substances as spices, tree bark, and flowers to create certain fragrances for specific applications.<br><br>Incense was such a desirable and thus valuable commodity in ancient times that its ingredients became important items of trade. Caravans following trade routes carried these from distant lands. You may recall that Jacob's young son Joseph was sold to Ishmaelite traders who were "coming from Gilead, and their camels were carrying labdanum and balsam and resinous bark, on their way to take it down to Egypt." (Genesis 37:25) The demand for incense became so great that the frankincense trade route, no doubt initiated by incense merchants, opened up travel between Asia and Europe.<br><br>Incense is still offered in the ceremonies and rituals of many religions today. Additionally, more and more people choose to burn incense in their homes simply to enjoy its pleasant aroma. How should Christians view incense-burning? Is it acceptable to God in worship? Let us examine what the Bible has to say on the matter.<br></div>

What does buddhist scriptures say with regards to worshipping the dead and ancestor veneration? How do buddhists pay respect/reverence to them?<br><br></div></blockquote>Laoda99,<br><br>Yes, Buddhism does not advocate worshipping of anyone, including Buddha himself. Usually the ones we pay veneration and reverence to are the Buddhas, the Bodhisattvas (saints who are on the path towards Buddhahood, and helping other sentient beings towards their enlightenment), Arhants (saints who attained liberation from sufferings), but we do not worship anyone. We also do not worship gods as they are Worldly beings, not freed from Birth and Death, Samsara (world of sufferings).<br><br>IMHO, it is quite silly to worship the dead. Buddhism believes rebirth, if your dead ancestor is in Heaven, he would be enjoying his life there and wouldnt really come back to bother about earthly matters. If he is in hell or animal realms, there is nothing he can help you. If he is reborned in Human realm, he probably forgotten who are you anyway. If he is a spirit, not only should we not worship them, we should be helping them to get out of that lower realm of sufferings by transference of merits. Worshipping your spirit ancestor is like worshipping a beggar (humans belong to a higher realm, spirits belong to a lower realm).<br><br>The Buddha did however ask people to pay their veneration and reverence to the dead and also as act of remembrance, but has never asked people to worship dead people. It is the folks tradition/ancestral worshippers that advocates this.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U have brought up a very useful topic, Laoda.<br><br>Christians should look at the joss stick holding and kneeling down rituals in a funeral situation in context - juz as we are taught to read the Bible in context.<br><br>There is a line drawn between showing respect for our parents/relatives and act of worship.  In my personal opinion, holding the joss and kneeling is an act of respect for our loved ones - in a funeral situation - and it does in No way compromise my worship and adulation of my God.<br><br>Let me explain - if I was in this scenario - firstly, the Lord knows very well in my heart  that i am NOT worshipping but showing a mark respect for a deceased who has passed away, if the deceased is a member of my family. In no way will the Lord see this act as idol worship.<br><br>Secondly, I will declare openly to my family and relatives that I am a Christian but I love my parent (assuming its his/her funeral) and am showing my respect - which is in line with Biblical teaching to respect and love my parents/family members.<br><br>Thirdly, this will dispel a very erroneous opinion of many a non-Christian, that Christians do not respect their loved ones.<br><br>On the last point, over the years, I have heard enough complaints about Christians who refuse to hold the joss stick or kneel in respect of their loved one in a funeral. Consequently, sad to say, some of them (non-Christians) have become even more resistant to the the Gospel as a result of these unfortunate episodes.<br><br>I believe pastors/church leaders in some churches (many from the traditional churches) should teach their flock to recognise this sensitivity in our cultural context - enough damage has been done.<br><br>Our God is not unreasonable and He knows our very thoughts and hearts. In fact, I dare say, that if our reason for holding the joss sticks/kneeling down in a funeral situation is a testimony of Chrisitianity teaching us to love our parents/elders/families so that they will be more receptive to the Love and Gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>The principle is similar to the eating food offered to idols text in Corinthians - so that our very act do not cause others to stumble. If a weaker brother sees me holding a joss stick for such a purpose, then I will explain my reason(s) and stand.<br><br>Like i said, this is my personal opinion, and I know it may not go down well with some circles....but my reasons are clear.<br><br>BTW, Laoda, if I were u, I'll ignore anything from the "watchtower" thread. They belong to the Jehovah's Witnesses - widely recognised as a cult.<br><br>cheers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SingaporeMacross:</div><div class="quote_body">Excellent points. However, please refer to my post regarding incense.</div></blockquote>Thx for your comment, SingaporeMacross. I agree with you on your references to Revelation 8:3 and Psalms 141:2. These verses refer to the acts of worship where not juz incense but lifting of hands can be used in churches.<br><br>Lets look at John 4:23,24 on what Jesus said:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him. God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.</span><br><br>From here, we can deduce that true worshippers are those who 'worship in spirit and truth". It doesn't matter in what form u may wish to worship the Lord - some prefer it to be sombre and quiet; some in hymns, others praise and worship with choruses, bands, raised hands, lively contemporary music, dancing - I personally believe that as long as Christians know whom they worship and are sincere in praising and expressing their adulation and love for God, then this is where it matters.<br><br>As long as the Lord sees our truthful spirit in worshipping Him - and that can only happen when we have a personal relationship with Him - then He is pleased.<br><br>And lets not stereotype. Christians who worship in the more contemporary form of style and music (including rock and dance) should not be criticised, as much as I would add those who prefer a more quiet and serious form of worship may not necessarily worship "in spirit and in truth" if their hearts and focus are all wrong. Only the Lord sees our hearts and He knows.<br><br>So to relate to my earlier points about holding joss sticks and kneeling at funerals, it boils down to the same principles. I worship God in a manner which I am most comfortable in. If I am holding joss sticks and on my knees in front of the altar of my loved ones in a funeral scenario, and I am doing this as a mark of respect and a testimony to non-Christians, then God knows my heart. In no way should I be condemned coz I reserve my worship to only my God.<br><br>So let not anyone judge me on my physical act in this case, coz by taking this approach, I convey a better testimony to my non-Christian friends and relatives - and they will be more receptive to the Gospel as a result.</div>
