              <p>What about 3rd world countries ? I wonder how come you guys have never questioned the inequality. Few days ago, if I'm not wrong it was on the 2nd page of Straits Times talking about natural disasters and God. The partner of the journalist of that article passed away because of cancer at young age. He asked god why them. He said god was silent, thus he seek answers from the book.</p>
              <p>I find that people will only start to question the inequality when bad things happen to them.</p>

              its not the law of nature.. .its the law we set upon ourselves when adam and eve ate form the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. from then, we were condemned to sin and death, until Jesus Christ came and died on the Cross for us.

                              <p><span style="color: #000066;">QUESTION: But if there are no gods
              how did the universe get here?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #990000;">ANSWER:</span> All religions have
              myths and stories which attempt to answer this question. In ancient
              times, when man simply did not know, such myths were adequate, but
              in the 20th century, in the age of physics, astronomy and geology,
              such myths have been superseded by scientific fact. Science has
              explained the origin of the universe without recourse to the
              god-idea.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000066;">QUESTION: But so many people
              believe in some form of god, it must be true.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #cc0000;">ANSWER:</span> Not so. There was a
              time when everyone believed that the world was flat, but they were
              all wrong. The number of people who believe in an idea is no
              measure of the truth or falsehood of that idea. The only way we can
              tell whether an idea is true or not is by looking at the facts and
              examining the evidence.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000066;">QUESTION: You say there is no
              evidence for the existence of a god. But what about
              miracles?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #990000;">ANSWER:</span> There are many who
              believe that miracles are proof of gods existence. We hear wild
              claims that a healing has taken place but we never get an
              independent testimony from a medical office or a surgeon. We hear
              second-hand reports that someone was miraculously saved from
              disaster but we never get an eye-witness account of what is
              supposed to have happened. We hear rumours that prayer straightened
              a diseased body or strengthened a withered limb, but we never see
              X-rays or get comments from doctors or nurses. Wild claims,
              second-hand reports and rumours are no substitute for solid
              evidence and solid evidence of miracles is very rare. However,
              sometimes unexplained things do happen, unexpected events do occur.
              But our inability to explain such things does not prove the
              existence of gods. It only proves that our knowledge is as yet
              incomplete. Before the development of modern medicine, when people
              didnâ€™t know what caused sickness people believed that god or the
              gods sent diseases as a punishment. Now we know what causes such
              things and when we get sick, we take medicine. In time when our
              knowledge of the world is more complete, we will be able to
              understand what causes unexplained phenomena, just as we can now
              understand what causes disease.</p>

              <div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">      </span></div>
              <div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">    The Lord is always alert to us and ready to give to us. He knows what we need and  what we want - the Lord knows everything about us. But until we ask for what we want and need, the Lord is limited in how much he can do for us. It's as if our unwillingness to ask (or our forgetfulness) actually close us to receiving the specific help we need, the particular desire we cherish.</span></div>
              <div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">     </span><br><span style="font-size: small;">The Scriptures remind us again and again to ask for what we need. Decades after Jesus died, one of his disciples wrote: "We have this confidence in him; that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. And if we know that he hears us in regard to whatever we ask, we know that what we have asked him for is ours" (1 John 5:14-15).</span></div>
              <div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><br><span style="font-size: small;">     Followers of Jesus ask confidently. Whatever a follower needs, whether small and concrete such as a new possession or large and expanding such as a spiritual quality, the follower can ask for it with confidence. This confidence is possible because we know that the Lord will give what is truly good for us and never what is bad for us. We, like children of a wise parent, can express our wishes freely to him, knowing our requests will be sifted so only the best will come to us.</span></div>
              <div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><br><span style="font-size: small;">     Jesus said that we don't need to worry about tomorrow, because if we love him enough to want to be close to him (to live in his kingdom in this life), then all we need to do is "Ask, and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and it will be opened to you." Then Jesus gave further assurances that asking what brings the good gifts. (See Matthew 7:7-11)</span></div>
              <div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><br><span style="font-size: small;">     Why doesn't the Lord just simplify things and always give us exactly what we need and want? It's because our faith-life is about relationship, the relationship between us and the Lord. All relationships require openness. </span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;">Asking the Lord for every need has two results: We grow closer to the Lord, and we depend more on the Lord than on other people or circumstances. </span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;">Asking the Lord for every need has two results: We grow closer to the Lord, and we depend more on the Lord than on other people or circumstances. </span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;">Asking the Lord for every single thing brings us into constant communication with him. The Lord will be delighted. So will we.</span></div>
              <div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><br><span style="font-size: small;">     Let us remember that we can ask for more than concrete gifts. We are also urged to ask for guidance from the Lord. Many times we are quite willing to give our own effort to creating beautiful events or positive qualities in our lives, but we do not know how to do it. Sometimes we are already serving the Lord and others, but we need insight and direction to do it well.</span></div>
              <div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><br><span style="font-size: small;">      The first step in revitalizing our relationship with Jesus is to ask him for it. We tell the Lord that we want a revitalized relationship with him. Then we follow up by asking for everything else we need. Everything.</span></div>

              <div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; color: black;"><br><span style="font-size: small;">I have a son-in-law who is a violent husband. After 9 years of their life I realized what my daughter has been going through. The sacrifices she made for her 4 children without her husband's assistance. He had no permanent job and he used to gamble and drink. When he was drunk, he used to bash his wife, and the kids. My daughter never said any thing, and kept it to herself in order to avoid interference and trouble. She was here in Australia last year, that's when we all knew. After a year she went back home as she was concerned for the children who were left behind. After 2 months, the trouble started again and this time it was even worse. So my daughter and her children ran away and was placed under the care of the police authority. For a month or more her husband never stopped searching for them, finally he found them and asked forgiveness, and to start a new life. He made a promise to God, and asked God to forgive him. With our strong faith in the Lord our prayers were answered and he found a permanent job, and became a devoted member of the couples for Christ as well. I thank and praise the Lord for the things that happened. </span><br><strong><span style="font-size: small;">(Consullo Hardalaza, Farnell St, Chester Hill)</span></strong></div>

After the operation she was brain damage, and was paralyzed. The doctors gave up hope. When Theresa came to the C2TW Charismatic Prayer Meeting, she was crawling, and could not speak. Doctors pronounced their verdict, that this child would never talk or walk. Meeting Bro Terry the leader of the prayer group who told us, that the child will live to walk and talk, if we believed in Jesus. We came to believe in Jesus and trusted Him. The miracle took place. She began to walk and talk normally. Today she is 21 years old, and has graduated at the Tafe and a zealous worker of the Lord.

We believed so much after the first meeting. We went to see the doctor and he stopped all the medications. The Divine Healer took over from then on. Today she attends the C2TW Charismatic Prayer Group, and can recite a decade of the Rosary by herself.

The operation took place at the Sydney Hospital in 1977 and it took almost 8 hours. After the 8 hours of microsurgery I came out completely healed and normal.

We were resigned to God's will. My father refused to believe God and the sacraments of the Church. We called C2TW Charismatic Prayer Group to organize a prayer meeting in our home. He was not able to come to the living room, so we had a speaker connected to his room while the meeting was in progress. Jesus was really alive in our house. Jesus touched my father, and half way through the prayer meeting, he joined in the rosary. He made his confession, received the sacraments and died a very peaceful death the week following. We have a saint in heaven. All praise and thanks to God, who walks with sinful people like us. </span><span style="font-size: small;"><em>(The Pedavoil family, Concord Rd, Concord, NSW)</em></span></div>

I am an asthmatic patient for over 20 years. I came to the C2TW Charismatic Prayer Meeting and asked for many favors and received them all. I never ever prayed for a healing from asthma, but I was healed from that. I believed what Bro Terry said at every prayer meeting. Set your eye on the kingdom of God, and my Father will add to you, all your needs even without you asking Him. I went home and threw all my medications in the garbage bin, and never needed them again. Thank you Lord, and my God.</span><span style="font-size: small;"><em> </em></span><br><strong><span style="font-size: small;"><em>(Alex &amp; Pining Delparado, Chapple Rd, Sth Bankstown, NSW)</em></span></strong></div>

My faith was very weak and my family asked for a C2TW Charismatic Prayer Meeting in my home...I did not like the idea. I was going to be there only as an observer. To prove my point, I had a can of beer in my hand, while the others prayed  for me. When Bro Terry asked the crowd "do you believe that Jesus can heal you Guiseffi, they all replied yes, my eyes filled with tears, I was asked to raise my hand in the name of Jesus and I could not believe, I was able to do it. I was healed by Jesus on that day and I began to believe in Jesus. He loved me even when I refused to believe in Him.</span><span style="font-size: small;"><em> (Guiseffi Natori, Merrylands, Sth NSW)</em></span></div>

My sister in Sri Lanka had been rejected permanent residence, on account of her cancer. The leader of the prayer group rang Sheila in Sri Lanka and asked her to pray in Spirit, at the exact time of the meeting in Sydney. She was asked to make her confession and communion the day before, as a thanksgiving for the healing of cancer. She passed the medical examinations, and was passed by the Australian embassy to migrate to Australia. We praise you the Lord the impossible is possible with you. I keep asking myself why do we come to Jesus, only when every one else fails us. </span><br><strong><span style="font-size: small;"> </span> <span style="font-size: small;"><em>(Therese Batholomeuz, Campbelltown, NSW)</em></span></strong></div>

Due to this one leg, which stopped growing. When we heard about Jesus being alive, and healing like in Galilee, we were there in no time. Doctors had no cure as an operation could worsen the situation. We were distressed and began to hop in Jesus, who said "I will never leave you orphaned". We believed that Savrin would be healed, and today both his legs are the same length, and he is one of the fastest runners in the school. The doctors cannot explain.

The next morning when the nurses came to prepare me for the operation I was walking. Doctors could not believe. Three days later I was discharged. My family and I, became Catholics.

My wife received the Holy Communion that night, and a biopsy was carried out on Friday, with the miraculous results of no cancer.

He was admitted to Liverpool hospital with no improvement, after 2 weeks in a coma. The doctors gave up on him, and pronounced that he had brain damage that cannot be cured. His heart was on a machine and it was to be discontinued. The doctors requested that some one from the Church come, before the machine is turned off. Many came, some from overseas Italy. Bro Terry arrived with the Holy Eucharist, and asked everyone surrounding the bed to believe that Jesus could touch him and heal him. He was touched with the Holy Eucharist and Dominic opened his eyes and began to talk. He came out of the coma and was rehabilitated and later discharged. Just as Jesus promised for those "who believe all things are possible". </span><span style="font-size: small;"><em>(Maris Vitacor, Denham Court, 96183907)</em></span></div>

He reminded me, that everyone Jesus touched in Galilee, was healed, and Jesus was going to touch me right then and now, if I believed I will be healed. He even said before this weekend you would be discharged. My leg was healed and I was discharged that weekend.

Bro Terry gave us an assurance that God died for all mankind including Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims. If we believe there will be a miracle. We left at 8.30 with the assurance that Mohan will be out of his coma when we visit him tonight. Sure enough we visited Mohan and found him sitting on his bed out of his coma.
