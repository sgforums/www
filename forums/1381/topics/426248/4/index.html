              <p><br>hi asro.. you seem to take a delight in BASHING belivers of Christ.. hor!! Yes.. i rather be a fool to believe in the existence of God and Heaven.and of course.. Jesus. . even to the point of YOU calling me "idiot, fool or whatever. Period.</p>
              <p>I know where you come from.. so can't blame you for it.. However, the point is heaven exist even though you cannot or maynot or even not see it.. For us catholics and christians.. heaven is where we destine to  after this eartlhly life.. Life on earth is a "temporary" lodging only.. or as we just a pilgrim on earth..</p>
              <p>FYI.. Christianity (include cathiolicism) is not just a religion.. it is a revelation.. you may say "what revelation.. it's just a man made creation ..as normally you use in your reply. Revelation means in christology .. God reveal Himself thru the person of Jesus Christ to mankind. In layman speak.. there's is a divine presence looking or guiding  after us both here and afterlife. That's Truth..  Religion in lay man speak.. just mere rules and regulations to follow for its disciples.. just that..</p>
              <p>this is just a simple explanation.. if you are in exchange for views on religion, i welcome it but without resorting to name calling.. or vulgarities.. simple polite and respectful views welcome.</p>

              <p>i believe the question is more of why does God if hes so loving, allows so much suffering..</p>
              <p>firstly, we need to see whats the source of all these suffering..death is a kind of suffering..death is the result of sin.sin is therefore now the source of many kinds of suffering.</p>
              <p>illnesses,deformities,handicapps,low iq..etc..all these are because of inherited sin.when our body is no longer at their best optimal performance, we get all sorts of funny things happening to us..it makes us sick, deformed, grow old and die..makes us at most having the intelligence of einstein when we could be so much more.</p>
              <p>current world events are mostly caused by human politics..driven by immorality,violence and occult.</p>
              <p>current physical earth events like earthquakes,tsunami all points to the fulfilment of the signs in revelations and other books that speak about how the end will be like.</p>
              <p>who brought about all these suffering?the first woman had allowed her vanity to let the serpent deceived her..the sepent was used by satan the father of lies.suffering stems from satan and the demons..</p>
              <p>how to not suffer?the bible says it is God that creates us, gave us laws to live by that are wholesome and not a burden to carry out. live by it and we will see the results eventually.</p>
              <p>lets say a person suffers from cancer and needs to go through treatments, even surgery..all these treatments are painful, but are they the true cause of suffering or is it the cancer cells?</p>
              <p>now, if the patient patienly follows thru the whole treatment and is cured..is he still suffering or is he now relived of those suffering??are we gonna endure the treatments??</p>

              <p>does God know satan will revolt when he created him??if yes, then why go thru all the trouble to create the whole saga?</p>

              <p>when God finds that satan and friends and adam and eve had betrayed him..he is hurt and disappointed like how a parent will feel when their children lied to them...</p>

              <p><br>im saying..he chose not to know in advance.</p>
              <p>think about it this way..say, God knows satan,the angels, adam and eve will all sin against him eventually..what was the point in creating them??knowing he will bring so much pain and destruction to billions of innocent people..or, why dont he create them so that they will never be corrupted by pride and vanity?<br><br>or God knows they will revolt..but yet created them then hoping they wont revolt when he knows for sure they will..doesnt that make God silly and stupid??do not forget God have unlimitted wisdom and intelligence..<br><br>God isnt as limitless as what people think..for example.. he limits himself to rules that make up his personality..love, justice , righteousness..he could be like a dictator that creates unfeeling robot..but he didnt..<br><br>he is also limited in that he cannot lie for all these vileness is not found in him..<br>he limited himself because he is love..he limits himself in so many things so people take delight in him when he blesses them..he is a person who takes delight in giving..he gives so much to us..he is a happy God as stated in the bible..if the ultimate ruler in the entire universe gave us such a treatment..what have we as his creatures, given back to him??<br><br>so yes..im saying, becasue of his love to give life,to share the joy of being alive..he chose not to know about the treachery that is gonna happen in advance..</p>

              <p>but the rebirth u talk of..there is a kind of rebirth if u will..its called a resurrection..u know like in dragonball where u wish a person back to life??yeah..thats the destination for most humans...a ressurection on earth..to live in eternity with your loved ones..in perfection..where no one fall sick or die..a paradise..</p>
