              <p>is that your wishful thinking for eternal life in heaven after death?</p>
              <p>another loophole. if there isnt rebirth concept in christianity, there shouldnt be an afterlife after death. so what do you call that? in essence, after you die, that is it, no more, but there you go, an eternal life in heaven........</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000066;">QUESTION: But if there are no gods how did the universe get here?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #990000;">ANSWER:</span> All religions have myths and stories which attempt to answer this question. In ancient times, when man simply did not know, such myths were adequate, but in the 20th century, in the age of physics, astronomy and geology, such myths have been superseded by scientific fact. Science has explained the origin of the universe without recourse to the god-idea.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000066;">QUESTION: But so many people believe in some form of god, it must be true.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #cc0000;">ANSWER:</span> Not so. There was a time when everyone believed that the world was flat, but they were all wrong. The number of people who believe in an idea is no measure of the truth or falsehood of that idea. The only way we can tell whether an idea is true or not is by looking at the facts and examining the evidence.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000066;">QUESTION: You say there is no evidence for the existence of a god. But what about miracles?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #990000;">ANSWER:</span> There are many who believe that miracles are proof of gods existence. We hear wild claims that a healing has taken place but we never get an independent testimony from a medical office or a surgeon. We hear second-hand reports that someone was miraculously saved from disaster but we never get an eye-witness account of what is supposed to have happened. We hear rumours that prayer straightened a diseased body or strengthened a withered limb, but we never see X-rays or get comments from doctors or nurses. Wild claims, second-hand reports and rumours are no substitute for solid evidence and solid evidence of miracles is very rare. However, sometimes unexplained things do happen, unexpected events do occur. But our inability to explain such things does not prove the existence of gods. It only proves that our knowledge is as yet incomplete. Before the development of modern medicine, when people didn’t know what caused sickness people believed that god or the gods sent diseases as a punishment. Now we know what causes such things and when we get sick, we take medicine. In time when our knowledge of the world is more complete, we will be able to understand what causes unexplained phenomena, just as we can now understand what causes disease.</p>

              <p>Primitive man found himself in a dangerous and hostile world, the fear of wild animals, of not being able to find enough food, of injury or disease, and of natural phenomena like thunder, lightning and volcanoes was constantly with him. Finding no security, he created the idea of gods in order to give him comfort in good times, courage in times of danger and consolation when things went wrong. To this day, you will notice that people become more religious at times of crises, you will hear them say that the belief in a god or gods gives them the strength they need to deal with life. You will hear them explain that they believe in a particular god because they prayed in time of need and their prayer was answered.</p>
              <p>There are numerous religions, all claiming that they alone have god’s words preserved in their holy book, that they alone understand god’s nature, that their god exists and that the gods of other religions do not. Some claim that god is masculine, some that she is feminine and others that it is neuter. They are all satisfied that there is ample evidence to prove the existence of their god but they laugh in disbelief at the evidence other religions use to prove the existence of another god. It is not surprising that with so many different religions spending so many centuries trying to prove the existence of their gods that still no real, concrete, substantial or irrefutable evidence has been found.</p>
              <p>Some claim that the belief in a god is necessary in order to explain the origin of the universe. But this is not so. Science has very convincingly explained how the universe came into being without having to introduce the god-idea.</p>

              <p>Hell yeah, including my own faith but not me. But u are definately one of the. Straight enough answer ? I let you do ur usual asssumptions. I dont see where u get that I think Rony Tan and many pastors are tolerant people. Speaking of deluding onself, I think u are in ur own delusion and are stuck in your own paradox. Your paradoxes have all been answered over n over again. Ask something new and more stimulating. I feel stupid by regurgitating to stupid people over n over again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Do you mean normal formed people don't suffer. There are many formed people suffer from all kinds of diseases and on and off will have virus and infection. I don't see a need to create virus and bacterias. The worse thing is all living things will suffer from dying. Have you seen how people suffer before death ? The very old ones can't even eat and need to be fed, very weak can't even walk and talk.</p>
