            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">if u ask me, if the emphasis is sinning, obviously the less u sin, the better a person "contributes". On wat law ? Obviously the gravity of consequences or the amount of damage done to society is an important considerations. Intentions had to be included as well. U can't be blamed for things u cannot control. Generally, the general law made by men is very much a fair gauge. Compared with the christian system, where people r condemn simply because of their belief, and made a sinner because adam (who is not u) ate an apple is absurb Rolling Eyes<br><br></div></blockquote>Ironically, it seems to me that what you just said is actually close to some basic tenets of Christianity.<br><br>1. You spoke about "Less u sin, the better a person contributes" - Well, it is taught in the Bible that even if one is a Christian, he should reckon himself dead to sin and alive in Christ. Practically speaking, contrary to what many dissenters said, the life of a Christian is actually much more on seeking to achieve righteouness through the Grace of Christ, and very much hinged on repentence - turning to the Lord. Christians shall not yield - to darkness and that itself is a "walk" rather than "sleep". (Romans 6)  And u got it ! The less a person sin, the better he or she is able to contribute in Glory for the Lord ! For then, he can be focused on feasting on His Words and their applications !<br><br>2. "Gravity of consquences / damage done to society" - Yes indeed - the sin of one man actually has greater consequences than one would think. For example, Person A rob a elderly woman. This elderly woman then got no money to feed her sick grandchild. The child died.   Â“Then David said to Nathan, Â‘I have sinned against the Lord.Â’ Nathan replied, Â‘The Lord has taken away your sin. You are not going to die. But because by doing this you have made the enemies of the Lord show utter contempt, the son born to you will dieÂ” 2 Samuel 12:13,14.<br><br>But then, does men has the wisdom to know exactly, what are the true consquences ? how far does these consquences stretch ? does one trace or define ? Can one man argue to the other that the such viewing of consqeunces are subjective ?  I would think definitely.<br><br>And do we always want to regret our actions only in the face of consequences ? Or in the Light of Jesus who teaches us what to avoid ?<br><br>3. Intentions - Yes again. For example,<br><br>Acts 8:19-23 (Phi) "Give me [Simon the Sorcerer] this power too, so that if I were to put my hands on anyone he would receive the Holy Spirit." But Peter said to him, "To hell with you and your money! How dare you think you could buy the gift of God for money!.. your heart is not honest before God... repent of this wickedness of yours and pray earnestly to the Lord that if possible the evil intention of your heart will be forgiven. For I can see inside you, and I see a man bitter with jealousy and bound with his own sin!"<br><br>But good intentions alone does not make one right with God for those intentions are perhaps only as good as the man who have them made it to be.<br>Men are created to be Good - in God's image. But it is the choice of men to want to surpass the power and wisdom of God that makes them fall.  We all see this happening in history over and over and over again. And did God warn us about this ? Definitely ! so blame who ?<br><br>________________________________<br><br>Well, the "Christian System" is not just about Adam and the apple.  It is about what you have actually mentioned, and so much more.<br><br>Alas, SIS - you knew much but do not know who is the One who offered you that knowledge. Seek Him. You will find out so much more about yourself.<br><br>Blessings to you.<br><br></div>

A person who had done no wrong should not deserve any punishment such as going to hell. Even though he may not do anything right, he should not be punished.
