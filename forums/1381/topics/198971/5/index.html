At that point when the sinner has touched salvation base [Christ] he is automatically justified and sanctified and glorified positionally. And that's where sanctification [progressive] begins when the sinner touched salvation base through faith.<br><br>2Co 7:10 For godly sorrow produces <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">repentance leading to salvation</span></strong>, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death.<br><br>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Repentance is basically not outward acts and behavior. It is manifested through it. You can do repentant acts but have no attitude of repentance.<br><br>Mt 3:8 Let your change of heart [r<span style="font-style: italic;">epentance</span>] be seen in your works [<span style="font-style: italic;">behavior and acts</span>] {Bible in Basic English}<br>[Note: italics mine]<br><br>When you change your attitude towards sin, you will spontaneously change your behavior to it. When you change your attitude towards God, you will spontaneously change your behavior towards God. When you change your attitude towards self, it will result in not relying in the works of self for salvation. You will accept Christ as Savior.<br><br>Repentance to salvation is not being saved through works for repentance is a change of attitude towards sin, God, self, and Christ. Remember Faith aside from many other things is an attitude of the will towards Christ.<br><br>at the moment of FAITH in CHRIST<br>|<br>|<br>|<br>|<br>|<br>|                                    |<br>*------------------------------ progressive santification---------------&gt;glorification<br>Justified<br>sanctified<br>glorified<br>[positionally]<br><br>After salvation do we still have to repent? Yes, absolutely. So long as we are sinners here we need to repent. Repentance is the product of the new nature we recieved at regeneration. [New nature brings along with it new attitudes]<br><br><strong>2)</strong> 1Co 1:30 But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God--and --<strong>righteousness and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sanctification</span> and redemption</strong><br><br>The words above speak of positional truths. Christ is the Christian's sanctification. At that moment [in the twinkiling of an eye]  when the sinner [through faith] becomes IN CHRIST, he recieves all that Christ has, namely: His rightouesness, His being separate from evil [sanctification] and His glorification-we are inextricably identified with His resurrection which is the basis of the redemption of our bodies.<br><br>Not only His resurrection but His ascention and His sitting in the heavenly places too. we are linked to those truths.<br><br>Positionally we are already raised with Christ [never to die again for the sake of sins because Christ our Head will not suffer anymore for sins]:<br><br>Col 3:1  <strong>If then you were raised with Christ</strong>, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God.<br><br>The word "if" there does not imply uncertainty. It is the "if" of consequence. It means SINCE. "<strong>SINCE THEN [OR THEREFORE] YOU ARE RAISED WITH CHRIST.........</strong>"<br><br>His ascention guaranttees our future Rapture to heaven. Positionally we [Christians] are already in heaven.<br><br>His sitting there in the right hand of the Father guranttees that we [Christians] will be with the Father.<br><br>We are inextricably linked to Christ. We do not need to go to purgatory anymore since Christ our Head's sacrifice was enough.<br><br>He is our Head, we are His body. If you put us [His body]  to purgatory, then you put our Head [who is Christ] there too.<br><br>which is unthinkable.<br><br>peace  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
