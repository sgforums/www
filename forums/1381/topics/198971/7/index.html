If u can find a loophole for tis system u have found a loophole in the world legislative system. In fact some taoist use tis idea as a way to discourage people from committing sins.

Please hightlight to me where on earth do u read the part where I claim there r many loopholes in the human system.<br><br>R there no holes in the system ? tat is the challenge to u.

Repentent or not, u have to face the music. Otherwise everyone could commit every sin in the world and just have to be repentent in the end.

For mitigation a normally good boy can get a lower punishment, however he still did wrong in murdering someone and he still get punished. Tat is fair because tat person had really sin. If u miss the boat by 1 point, u just got burn by 1 second. Is tat so hard to bear ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> According to christainity u got burnt for eternity if u miss something by 1 point.

But it's ok. We will see in due course.

If one day the church say tat u have to gorge out your eyes or kill yourself to go to heaven, u will probably do it. Who r u to argue with "god". Well, good luck to u<br><br><blockquote>Actually I agree with u in the sense that God is sovereign. If God wants u to go paradise, who are u to argue with him?
