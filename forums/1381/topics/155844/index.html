Prior to that, he defended the Catholic Church against the Protestants reformation.  The Church gave him the title "Defendant of Faith".  Much later, he broke away from the church for the reason you mentioned.  He threw away all the Catholic Traditions.  It was his daughter Queen Elizabeth, a Protestant, who brought the traditions back when she decided to merge the two denominations.  This gave us the Anglican Church that we have today.</div>

We see more and more new denominations now, more small independent churches, and there will be more and more in the future.<br><br>Isn't there only one God? one Salvation? are Christians not given only the commandments to love God and to love thy neigbors? din Jesus give only one commission, to preach the gospel? are Christians not supposed to worship God in one and only way, in spirit and in truth? then why so many different denominations??<br><br>Is it good to have so many denomiations, may be yes, for the Gospel is then preached to diff ppl in diff ways in diff places, BUT, if there is a need for all Christians to be united, will this ever happen?? if the anwer is NO, then different denominations is nothing but a division of the body of Christ. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>The answer to the question is clear, many Christians put "ME" first before God. My way of worship is more acceptable to God, my way of running the church will bring in more believers, my method of preaching will convert more unbelievers, my church lift up my spirit everytime I worship, .......<br><br>I agree we should not lose focus, but don't forget the history and the root of the problem. This is for the Christians, espcially those church leaders to ponder on, and this has nothing to do with non believers.</div>

The RC is correct but God will keep revealing new truths in the bible. Anyway, the RC kept the bible from the masses keeping them in the dark abt certain doctrines last time &amp; Luther &amp; so many others b4 him translated the bible to readable langs by the masses. All the various doctrines r in the bible already but it could just be misinterpreted or suppressed or not read at all.<br><br>I also disagree with so many denominations myself &amp; I hurt when i see Christians so divisive among themselves. My stand is also wealth &amp; health is NOT OK when ppl use them to satisfy their covetousness &amp; pleasure. God gave us wealth to help ppl in need. God gave us health so that we can work to support our families &amp; enjoy His fellowship.</div>
