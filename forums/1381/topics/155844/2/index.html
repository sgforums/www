Anglicans was founded because one King decided to have more than 1 wife. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div></blockquote>Not that simple although that is the usual response....it's for more political than religious reasons. Henry VIII did it cos he needed a male heir to ensure stability in his reign. If you have no obvious heir, every nephew and cousin next in line will look for a chance to do you in and take over the throne.<br><br>His first wife, Catherine of Aragon was a Spanish princess who could not give him a son. He sought to annul the marriage (not divorce) on the grounds that his marriage to her was not valid in the first place. You see, Catherine of Aragon was actually married to Henry VIII's brother, Arthur, who was the Prince of Wales. Arthur died and so Catherine married Henry, who became the next king.<br><br>But as you know, taking your brother's wife was prohibited in Leviticus and so a dispensation from the Pope was necessary to marry. Catherine's father, the king of Spain, exerted pressure on the Pope and that dispensation (permission) was given although some might dispute if that could ever be valid.<br><br>After the marriage, however, Catherine could not bear him a son. Henry began to look at the texts of Leviticus which says that if a man takes his brother's wife, they shall be childless. Although they had a daughter, Mary,  that didn't count in Henry's mind. The King began to petition the Pope for an annulment. He apparently thought that the earlier dispensation given was probably not valid, that's the reason why he had no son..<br><br>Catherine objected to an annulment and she had influence in that she was a princess of Spain, a powerful nation loyal to the Pope and her nephew was the Holy Roman Emperor. Whilst the Pope was deciding what to do for the next 6 years, the young Henry VIII made his mistress, Ann Boleyn pregnant. Henry panicked. If Ann gave birth to a son, he had to get that annulment before the baby is out, or the child would be illegitimate.<br><br>Left without much of a choice with the Pope procrastinating and Ann's belly growing, he rejected the power of the Pope in Rome and set up the Anglican Church. The head of the new church, the Archbishop of Canterbury, gave him the annulment.<br><br>Unfortunately for Henry, all that was for nothing. Ann Boleyn's child was a daughter (the future Elizabeth I) and Henry remained very much a Catholic in religious practice until his death.<br><br></div>

We trust Him alone. &amp; bcos we trust Him, we obey what He says to do regarding the sacraments w/c He instituted. The blessed sacrament is Christ Himself, yes, but it takes on spiritual meaning here. How can the broken bread be the actual broken body of Christ on the cross? How can the wine be the actual blood of Jesus that was shed? Unless it's spiritual context. Jesus said in the last supper: Do this in remembrance of Him. We remember Him when we take holy communion.

Just my view.</div></blockquote>"Â‘I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any one eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh.Â’ The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, Â‘How can this man give us his flesh to eat?Â’" (John 6:51Â–52).<br><br>"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him" (John 6:53Â–56).<br><br>Paul wrote to the Corinthians: "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?" (1 Cor. 10:16). So when we receive Communion, we actually participate in the body and blood of Christ, not just eat symbols of them. Paul also said, "Therefore whoever eats the bread and drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will have to answer for the body and blood of the Lord. . . . For any one who eats and drinks without discerning the body, eats and drinks judgment on himself" (1 Cor. 11:27, 29). "To answer for the body and blood" of someone meant to be guilty of a crime as serious as homicide. How could eating mere bread and wine "unworthily" be so serious? PaulÂ’s comment makes sense only if the bread and wine became the real body and blood of Christ.<br><br></div>
