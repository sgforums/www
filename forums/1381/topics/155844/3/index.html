FCBC for example, in spite of having the word Baptist in their name is not Baptist in practice. It is true that it is extremely likely that a new age church is charismatic in nature. I am also not sure if such churches are comfortable in calling themselves as New Age Churches because it conjures up the image of new age philosophies (which has occultic origin).<br><br>It is very likely that mainstream churches are very uncomfortable with the doctrines and theology of the big 3 mega churches. I have heard sermons and read articles with veiled references to the deviant practices of these 3.</div>

Sounds very much like a non-denominational church.<br><br>Most of the larger church groups are either form under an umbrella organisation, eg The Methodist Church of Singapore where there are offices of higher authority. I'd count the Anglicans in this as well. I am not familiar as to how Bible-Presbyterians (BPs), Presbyterians (which is somewhat different from the BPs), Brethen, and Pentacostals are organised, but I do believe that there are higher councils beyond the local pastor.<br><br>Independent (non denominational) churches may be formed because of some pastors (or church leaders) disagreement with their original church or it can be formed  because of some leader's vision (of the supernatural kind).<br><br>The problem with independent churches is that, in a way, most of them boh cheng hu.

"At the Last Supper, on the night when He was betrayed, our Savior instituted the Eucharistic Sacrifice of His Body and Blood. He did this in order to perpetuate the Sacrifice of the Cross throughout the centuries until He should come again, and so to entrust to His beloved Spouse, the Church, a memorial of His Death and Resurrection: a sacrament of love, a sign of unity, a bond of charity, a paschal banquet in which Christ is eaten, the mind is filled with grace, and a pledge of future glory is given to us.''<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Relying on Revelation, Not Reason</span><br><br>16. And so we must approach this mystery in particular with humility and reverence, not relying on human reasoning, which ought to hold its peace, but rather adhering firmly to divine Revelation.<br><br>17. St. John Chrysostom who, as you know, dealt with the Mystery of the Eucharist in such eloquent language and with such insight born of devotion, had these most fitting words to offer on one occasion when he was instructing his faithful about this mystery: "Let us submit to God in all things and not contradict Him, even if what He says seems to contradict our reason and intellect; let His word prevail over our reason and intellect. Let us act in this way with regard to the Eucharistic mysteries, and not limit our attention just to what can be perceived by the senses, but instead hold fast to His words. For His word cannot deceive." (5)<br><br>18. The scholastic Doctors made similar statements on more than one occasion. As St. Thomas says, the fact that the true body and the true blood of Christ are present in this Sacrament "cannot be apprehended by the senses but only by faith, which rests upon divine authority. This is why Cyril comments upon the words, This is my body which is delivered up for you, in Luke 22, 19, in this way: Do not doubt that this is true; instead accept the words of the Savior in faith; for since He is truth, He cannot tell a lie." (6)<br><br>19. Hence the Christian people often follow the lead of St. Thomas and sing the words: "Sight, touch and taste in Thee are each deceived; The ear alone most safely is believed. I believe all the Son of God has spoken; Than truth's own word, there is no truer token."<br><br>20. And St. Bonaventure declares: "There is no difficulty over Christ's being present in the sacrament as in a sign; the great difficulty is in the fact that He is really in the sacrament, as He is in heaven. And so believing this is especially meritorious. " (7)</div>
