But if believing means living by the principles, values and teachings, then you may find it hard to find a compromise between everything you believe in.<br><br>If a godly being is not perfect, then it doesn't make a difference for one to just believe an worship a human or other things that can be worshipped.</div>

Let that sink for a while. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><blockquote>I belive there is a god,each religeon has a god...does it mean i am being unfaithful to god?</blockquote>I really don't think you are unfaithful and is close! You see, the prophets, saints and those regarded as holy form a connection of the divine. And the foundation of religion was brought about by the experience of the divine. Then from there, thoughts, beliefs and religious expressions start to form and develop as the byproducts. But right now, generally all of us are going from the opposite direction. We start to belief without knowing. Feeling without yet perception. And doing rituals which may not function as intended. Probably that is why religions nowadays seems sterile.<br><br>To start off, I suppose everybody has to flick that divine spark within themselves and naturally, one will take towards a certain apprehension. Thats how it commences I guess. How?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> But arrrr... gotta not confuse spirituality with that of feeding on outer manifestations of emotionality.</div>

They work as a team. But to say god is imperfect might be a bit of arrogance on your side. You are not the creator. so who are you to comment on him?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello there!<br><br>I'll try to answer your queries well as i can...<br><br>When God created the world and everything in it, He said that it was good. That means to say that He made the world perfect. However, it was man who tarnished the earth. How did this happen? Well, man is imperfect, and therefore all man (and women, for that matter) have sinned. No one is without sin. So back to my point, Adam and Eve, the first humans on earth, were the ones who sinned first. They ate of the forbidden fruit in which God commanded them not to. And so that was the origin of imperfection on this earth.<br><br>So then, you might be asking yourself, if God is "perfect" and humans are not, why then did He create us? The answer is simple. It is because He loves us.<br><br>The theme of God is all about love, a love so great He laid his life down for us. Which other god has ever done that for us???</div>
