This is your personal opinion and you are entitled to it.<br><br>2. I did not close the other thread because of you.<br><br>3. I closed the other thread because it was going on a well-worn path of arguments and counter arguments which cannot be won by either parties.<br><br>4. I did not want EH to go nuke, like some of the other forums.<br><br>5. My policy is always agree to disagree. Go ahead and discussed anything but if something turns potentially inflammatory, make no mistake: I WILL CLOSE IT DOWN. My topics get closed down in other forums either... I accept that it's the prerogative for mods to do so.<br><br>6. If I am autocratic, I'd close down the Benny Hinn thread because I do not agree to his kind of theology, but it remains open.<br><br>7. I am not here to please you, regardless of whose clone you are. Not happy, get lost.<br><br>8. I am responsible for the peace of this forum. There are many other members here, and none of them had complained about my so-called autocratic style at all. I think my accountability to them is higher than my accountability to a clone.<br><br>9. I did not close do SIS all the time. SIS is famous for his confrontational stand on evolution and science, which he is entitled to. Any contributions that he make will inevitably go only one way, sometimes not necessarily his fault, but because the things he states and the way he says it can infuriate other readers.<br><br>10.
