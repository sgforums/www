It has neutral third-party material like the: </blockquote><blockquote>I can only see that for the whole time, you are the only one taking one-sided info  the anti-Christian info. You condemn and find fault with anything or anybody that is Christian or pro-Christian. This is pretty obvious despite the many times you try to hide your shit by insisting that you're clear-minded, fair and reasonable</blockquote>as said before, it is a christian website and it will only mention the article and portion where it will make them look good. To be convincing, use a third party information. The website where i present my information is wikepedia, a thrid party website tat is not against christianity not catholic. If u really read it then u will realise tat it is likea history book tat just reports the fact. If u want a one sided information, I can show u the one from those who r against catholic below<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If we look at history, the Inquisition began shortly after the Crusades were coming to an end. The Vatican needed to keep its grip on power and decided to carry on Crusade-like activities closer to home.<br><br>It wasnÂ’t until the 1830s that the Spanish Inquisition was officially ended. More than half a millennium was spent by the Roman Catholic Church on torturing and killing those who did not agree, as well as devout followers who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Now, in the 21st century, Vatican officials are downplaying the longest reign of terror in history.<br><br>And, donÂ’t forget about previous Vatican "scholars," the predecessors of those who are denying history today in the recent reports. They were the ones who said the Earth was flat. They were the ones who said the Earth was about 6,000 years old. They were the ones who jailed scientists for having the audacity to state that the Earth was not at the center of the universe. Today, the same denial of reality is implemented by modern Vatican scholars. Nothing has changed.</span><br><br><a href="http://www.atheistcoalition.org/docs/inquisition-not-bad.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.atheistcoalition.org/docs/inquisition-not-bad.html</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In NEWS1675, we revealed that priests threatened their female penitents in the confessional that, unless they would have sex with them, they would turn them into the Inquisition! So effective was this threat that one dying priest revealed in 1710, "by these diabolical persuasions they were at our command, without fear of revealing the secret." [Page 36, "MASTER-KEY TO POPERY", Father Givens]<br><br>Since so few people today have been taught even the rudiments of history, most do not know what the Inquisition was REALLY and TRULY like. Most people today have no idea of the rampant barbarism and torture wreaked upon the unfortunate inhabitants of Europe for 1,200 years! Most people have no idea how the entire population was consumed by fear, for a knock on one's door in the middle of the night meant immediate beginning of a torturous death at the hands of the Inquisitors.<br><br>Accusation equaled Guilty.<br><br>Therefore, if a priest threatened a woman that he would lie about her to the officers of the "Holy" Inquisition, she knew the type of torture and death that awaited her. The priest would probably report the woman to the Inquisitors as a witch. As you shall see in a few moments, the Inquisitors treated alleged witches with special relish, glee, and attention.<br><br>In this treatise, we have attempted to walk a fine line between Christian modesty and a fervent desire that you should know the fullness of truth regarding the Inquisition. Since many of the victims were stripped nude and tortured publicly, or stripped nude and raped privately, we have had to weed out numerous drawings that depicted such nudity; however, we have included a couple of pictures which, even though they depict the nudity of the victim, do so in such a way as to not depict sexual body parts. We hope your sensibilities are not offended. If you think they might be, you may stop reading now.</span><br><br><a href="http://www.cuttingedge.org/news/n1676.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cuttingedge.org/news/n1676.cfm</a><br><br><blockquote>Let me give you an analogy to illustrate: even in a gracious secular society teaches that it is wrong to lie, but people still do it.

If you had phrased it like, "I think history was distorted by the inquisitors and crusaders" you are now removing the emphasis on the "inquisitors and crusaders" and place the emphasis that it is just your opinion. Note that people respond to opinions more easily than a predetermined judgement.<br><br>I am not only trying to ask you to be less confrontational, I am also trying to make EH a better place to come to. There is really no purpose in reading highly charged accusations in a place like Eternal Hope.<br><br>Just to let you know, I enjoy PMs with non-Christians as well as people from other religion and there is NO enemosity between us. Ideas were exchange on the rule that no one is trying to convert each other. We sometimes disagree, but OK fine, I accept that such disagreement is mainly opinion and perception based, we do not usually pursue relentlessly just so that we feel we won an argument. Winning an argument is NOT the objective. It is about the final phrase of "Thank you, so and so, for your opinion. I see your point even though I may not agree with you fully, hope to chat soon"<br><br>Do you have the grace to say that? and don't reply me by saying that others don't do this to you, or others are not nice to you. I am talking about you! Can peace start today from YOU?</div>

Still the issue is with having personal responsibility and control over how you deliver your message. So are you now saying that because others do it, you must do it too? That others misbehave, therefore you must misbehave too. I am sure you are more mature than that, and the reason that others do it too is extremely juvenile and naive for someone with so much knowledge as yourself. </blockquote>Okie, I will try to be more nicer in future.</div>
