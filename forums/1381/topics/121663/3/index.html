            <div class='col-md body'>(Roman Catholic Church)<br><br><strong>Worldwide Distribution</strong><br>The total population of Catholics throughout the world is estimated to be about one billion. They may be found in nearly all countries of the globe, though are more concentrated in the Americas and Europe. They currently make up 63% of the population of North and South America, 40% of Europe and 3% of Asia [12] (http://www.ewtn.com/library/CHISTORY/ANNU2000.HTM). They form a majority in all countries which speak a Latin-based language except Romania. These include nearly all Latin American countries (among them being such heavyweights as Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina); while in Europe, they are France, Italy, Spain, and Portugal. Non-Latin speaking Roman Catholic countries in Europe are Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia; the only one outside of Europe is the Philippines, which was once a Spanish colony. Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, as well as British-ruled Northern Ireland, are about equally divided between Catholics and Protestants.<br><br>The United States of America has a large minority of Catholics; this is a legacy of massive immigration, mainly from countries like Italy, Ireland and Germany. For example, in the United States, the proportion of Catholics grew from virtually nothing in 1790 to about a quarter of the total by 1920. Catholicism in Britain, meanwhile, underwent a revival in the 1800's and early 1900's after three centuries of relentless persecution.<br><br>Catholicism has spread relatively recently to some parts of the world; there are now some 115 million in Africa. Other countries where significant populations have developed are South Korea and East Timor. But, aside from an older presence in Uganda, the Catholicism in those countries tends to be somewhat more eclectic than in more established regions of the world.<br><br>The number of Catholics in the world continues to increase, through population growth in developing countries and, to a lesser extent, spread to new areas. The increase between 1978 and 2000 was 288 million. Protestant evangelicals have succeeded in making inroads into parts of Latin America, but remain a small percentage of the population. In most industrialized countries, church attendance has decreased since the 19th Century, similarly to other faiths.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Eastern Orthodoxy</strong><br><br>Eastern Orthodoxy (also called Greek Orthodoxy and Russian Orthodoxy) is a Christian tradition which represents the majority of Eastern Christianity. During the first millennium of Christendom, differences developed between the Christian East and West. By the 11th century, this had culminated in a Great Schism, separating the Roman Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodoxy.<br><br>Like the Roman Catholics, the Orthodox trace their lineage back to--and claim to be the exclusive continuance of--the original Christian church, referring to themselves as the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.<br><br>Eastern Orthodox Christianity claims an unbroken Apostolic Succession back to the Apostles, with grace transferred through the laying on of hands. Though many nationalities are represented in Orthodoxy, which present a number of slight cultural differences, the jurisdictions of the Orthodox Church are identical in belief, and spiritually one in Christ Jesus.<br><br><strong>Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism</strong><br>The Roman Catholic Church shares many of the same characteristics as the Orthodox Church especially in reference to the early church because of their common origin. For nearly 1000 years, the two churches were united, with the Roman Pope being counted as one of the five major hierarchs, along with the patriarchs of Alexandria, Jerusalem, Antioch, and Constantinople. The division of the Church into separate churches is regarded as having occurred in 1054 in what is known as the Great Schism, though their divergence began as much as two centuries earlier. Both churches claim to be the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, and reject the other's claim to this title. The term "Orthodox" was adopted by the Eastern Church to signify its adherence to, and preservation of, the original apostolic traditions, teachings, and style of worship. Both churches, to signify the universality of the church, retain the term "Catholic". Both churches also continue to claim apostolic succession. The churches differ, however, in their ecclesiology: the Orthodox Church views all bishops as equal, and rejects the idea that one patriarch may have authority over another's jurisdiction. The Patriarch of Constantinople currently enjoys the honorary title of "First Among Equals"; which simply means that in council, he occupies the position of president in what is otherwise a democratic organization. This, in the view of the Orthodox, is the same position held by the Pope before the Great Schism. The Roman Catholic Church, on the other hand, views the Patriarch of Rome as the head of the Church and ascribe to him all-encompassing authority on Christian matters.<br><br>To date, however, there has not been a final statement on behalf of the whole Orthodox Church, with regard to the status of Rome. This is not surprising, since such general, authoritarian statements are simply unheard-of within Eastern Orthodoxy, even upon issues with little to no internal disagreement. Therefore, a lack of a definitive, authoritarian, "Church-wide" statement cannot be taken to mean that the Eastern Orthodox Church necessarily espouses or rejects a specific belief. This sort of centralized communication is neither typical of nor appropriate to Eastern Orthodoxy. Because of its democratic nature, in order to make such a pronouncement, the Orthodox Church would be required to convene another ecumenical council, the last of which was held in 787 AD. There has been talk in recent years of doing exactly that in order to clarify the churches position on certain modern issues though nothing definite has been set.<br></div>

Some are comfortable with certain denominations.  Eg.  I spoke with a German Lutheran before.  She said she could not be a Catholic because she's been cohabitating with her husband before they got married.<br><br>But sometimes, Protestants are stricter than the Catholics, surprisingly.  Many will require their partner to be converted baptised before they get married, while the Catholic these days are more relax in this area.<br><br>As for abortion, generally, all denominations oppose to it, cuz all agree that when a foetus is formed, it has a life.  So abortion = murder.  The only difference is some denominations may be stricter in this area than the others, by placing more emphasis on educating ppl not to do it.<br><br>As for embryonic experiment, I have not come across any church that is agreeable to that.<br><br>I will continue on the role of women later...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

The Crusaders were predominantly knights who had grown up under the feudal system and did not stand to inherit land as they were younger sons. There was a need for them to seek their fortune abroad as their eldest brothers would inherit their fathers' property. One aim the pope had in mind was to rid Europe of barbarism and unrest, but he took the wrong approach. I've seen a video where Urban II was quoted as saying the Crusaders would be guaranteed instant entry to heaven for every infidel {Muslim} killed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, I'm finally back  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> . Lets see now where were we....<br><br><blockquote><br>your site is from a christian source and therefore I believe it is pretty one sided.

I don't remember the documentary from BBC. wat is it about ?<br></blockquote>Though it may be  a christian website(by the way I took that into account). It has neutral third-party material like the:<br><br><blockquote><br><strong>ABSTRACT: The 1994 BBC/A&amp;E production, "The Myth of the Spanish Inquisition"</strong><br></blockquote><blockquote><br>the pope represent catholic and I shown a lot of acts tat were supported by the pope. The monk were the leader for the inquisition and he was found to initiate the may forms of torture. If Catholic countries don't represent catholic, pope don't represent catholic and the monks don't represent catholic, then wat represent catholic ? Anything bad won't represent the catholic ?<br></blockquote>Let me give you an analogy to illustrate: even in a gracious secular society teaches that it is wrong to lie, but people still do it. Now, question is does a liarÂ’s behaviour reflect what the society stands for?<br><br>In a similar way, the Catholics do wrong things. But does that represent what the Church teaches?<br><br>American historian William T. Walsh on Brother Fray Tomas de Torquemada,:<br><br><blockquote><br>For example, Fray Tomas de Torquemada, the Inquisitor General of Spain whose very name is now a symbol of ruthless cruelty, actually checked the excessive zeal of the earlier inquisitors in many ways, including the limiting and mitigating of torture. After the appointment of Fray Tomas de Torquemada as Inquisitor General in 1483 its tribunals were so fair that many preferred to have it hear their cases rather than the regular courts.<br>Walsh thinks that torture under Torquemada was no worse than that used by American police in the 1930s. Also, under Torquemada's entire tenure as Inquisitor General (1483-1498, 100,000 prisoners passed before his various tribunals throughout Spain. Of this number, less than 2% were executed. In Barcelona, from 1488 to 1498, "one prisoner out of 20 was put to death" (23 executions). Torquemada is not the monster of the Black Legend; still, he was responsible for, as an estimation, between 1,000 and 1,500 deaths... those death sentences were not at stake, but always pronounced by the civil court where the heretics were turned... and mostly by burning, the common method for those times.<br>http://ic.net/~erasmus/RAZ442.HTM<br></blockquote><blockquote><br>U mean attacking another country to spread its religion and gained power is not meaningful in the discussion ? Is catholic butchering all the people in a country because it had attacked some country tat has no connection to catholic is ? Aren't u one sided and censor off information ?<br></blockquote>Is that not what the people opposing the crusaders did as well?<br><br><blockquote><br>u mean killing off every living human will not be cruel on some people perception ? WHen the "aggression" forces first occupied a region, they just banish the non-believers. tat is more cruel to catholic than killing them ?<br></blockquote>You have changed the meaning of what I stated. I was referring to the perception that if IÂ’m a Christian of course, IÂ’ll say the other side was crueler. If IÂ’m not a Christian I will say that the Christian were the cruel ones.<br><br>By the way the people opposing the crusaders were not saints either, they didnÂ’t just banish their defeated adversaries. Here are some of their past misdeeds.<br><br><blockquote><br>In 639, Muslim armies invaded Jerusalem, burned churches, destroyed monasteries, profaned crosses, and, in the words of the Patriarch Sophronius of Jerusalem, Â“horribly blasphemed against Christ and the church.Â”  Thousands died as a result of famine and plague consequent to the destruction and pillage.<br><br>In 640, Muslim campaigns in the area around Syria lead to the sacking of monasteries and the execution of monks. Four-thousand peasants in Gaza and Ceasarea were massacred.  The entire population of Elam was put to the sword.<br><br></blockquote><strong>The above historical reference of Islamic mayhem is  taken from Ibn Warraq</strong><br><br>And one from a source I posted earlier:<br><br><blockquote><br>12,000 people were killed, the rest made slaves. The Turks killed every cleric in the city and sawed the archbishop in two.<br></blockquote>Now if we want to compare who was crueler, we could go on  forever. Tell me in war which side is ever fully justified?  But as I said you attributing all the atrocities to the Christians is not fair, did I ever say that the crusaders never committed any atrocities?<br><br>If you want, I can give you examples of Crusader atrocities.<br>So, now how did we distort history?<br><br></div>
