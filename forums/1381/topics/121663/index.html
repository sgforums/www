Methodist comes from Anglican Church.<br>Mormons comes from Presbyterian Church.<br>Jehovah Witness from Individual Bible studies group.<br><br>Martin Luther was working with John Calvin but they couldn't agree on certain issues.  So John Calvin broke away from Luther.  Luther founded Lutheran Church while John Calvin founded the Presbyterian Church.<br><br>King Henry VIII founded the Anglican Church for his own reason.  Methodist Church was founded by John Wesley because he didn't agree with the tradition practised by the Anglicans.<br><br>Seventh-day Adventists church founded came from Baptist.  and Baptist Church came from the Church of English - Anglican.<br><br>The non denominational ones, there are too many of them and nobody knows why they set up new churches anyhow.  Their intention is quite questionable.  There are already so many established churches around.  Why still set up new churches/groups?  To make money or to get some followers??  We certainly dun know whether they will become another cult group.<br><br>The 15th century "Reformation" did a lot of good to the Catholic Church.  It woke up the Catholics to focus on missionary. Since, then the Catholic church sent the priests to Asia to preach the gospel.  Some of them even risked their life to convert the cannibals in the jungle of Southeast Asia.  In fact, many of them died.   That's why today there are so many Catholics in Asia.<br><br>But the "Reformation" gave a <span style="color: red;"><strong>WRONG </strong></span>message to the non Catholic Christians that they can just set up a Christian church whenever and wherever they want, without having to report to any authorities or church HQ.</div>

The Catholic Church doesn't distort history like the way others do.<br><br>The Reformation was a wake up call for the Catholic Pope and Priests.  Otherwise, we won't have St Francis Xavier preaching at Malacca and China, and Catholic Priests converting the native tribes.  If you go visit the East Malaysia and talk to the natives (who are not muslims) you will notice that they are all Catholics.<br><br>If you see any Protestants, that is because the Protestant went there much later to convert the Catholics (like what they are doing in Philippines right now).  Funny right?  The Catholics risked and lost their lives converting the natives.  Many priests were even killed and eaten by the man-eating tribes. And the Protestants just go in and bad mouth the Catholic Church, converting them to their side.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Spanish Inquisition:<br><br>Separate from the Medieval Inquisition was the famed Spanish Inquisition.<br><br>It is the most notorious, for three reasons:<br><br>1- It was more cruel precisely because it was administered by the secular government.<br>2- It was concerned, in large part, with the conversos. These were Jews who had converted either under duress or out of social convenience, and were suspected of secretly practicing the Jewish faith.<br>3- It has been the main target of Protestant and secular opponents of Catholicism who have fabricated Â— through pamphlets, Â“histories,Â” plays, and even paintings Â— cruelties and excesses far beyond what actually occurred.<br><br>Many Protestants use the Inquisition as a handy stick to beat the Catholic Church, but they tend to forget the Protestant Inquisition<br><br></div>
