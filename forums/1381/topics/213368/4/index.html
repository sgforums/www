First, James was the bishop of Jerusalem during the council, and it is common for a bishop to speak in favor of the pope's teaching at a regional or ecumenical council. This is what James does. He agrees with Peter's definitive teaching. Second, James begins speaking, not about the doctrinal issue, but about whether the Gentiles should obey the Noachide laws.

The Greek here (ego krino) means that James was giving a personal opinion about a pastoral issue, and recommends that the Gentiles obey the laws of Noah so as to more easily fraternize with the Jews.<br><br>So we see that Peter is the one who rules definitively on the question of doctrine, and all kept silent.

You should also point out to your friend that Acts 15 disproves the doctrine of sola Scriptura.

            <div class='col-md body'>This is an interesting topic...<br><br>We know from the bible that the apostle Peter could not have founded the church of Rome.  There are many proofs to substantiate this.  I will just name one or two.<br><br><blockquote>Galatians 2:7 NIV<br>On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> just as Peter had been to the Jews.</span></blockquote>Peter was entrusted with preaching to Jews not Gentiles.<br><br><blockquote>2 Timothy 4:16 NIV<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me.

If we believe the Catholics, then Peter has betrayed Paul, for they tell us Peter was  present at Rome during this time.  This is ridiculous as it means that Peter not only betrayed his master Jesus but his fellow disciple Paul as well.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1 Peter 5:13 - Some Protestants argue against the Papacy by trying to prove Peter was never in Rome. First, this argument is irrelevant to whether Jesus instituted the Papacy. Secondly, this verse demonstrates that Peter was in fact in Rome. Peter writes from "Babylon" which was a code name for Rome during these days of persecution. See, for example, Rev. 14:8, 16:19, 17:5, 18:2,10,21, which show that "Babylon" meant Rome. Rome was the "great city" of the New Testament period. Because Rome during this age was considered the center of the world, the Lord wanted His Church to be established in Rome.<br><br>Gal.1:18 - Paul spends fifteen days with Peter privately before beginning his ministry, even after Christ's Revelation to Paul.<br><br>And lastly, Christ told Peter to feed all sheeps not just jews. Thats the power of the papacy.<br><br>I Suppose all my early Catholic brethen in the 1st century were mistaken that Peter was in Rome.<br><br><strong>Church fathers: Peter in Rome</strong><br><br>"Through envy and jealousy, the greatest and most righteous pillars [of the Church] have been persecuted and put to death. Let us set before our eyes the illustrious apostles. Peter, through unrighteous envy, endured not one or two, but numerous labours and when he had at length suffered martyrdom, departed to the place of glory due to him." Clement of Rome, The First Epistle of Clement, 5 (c. A.D. 96).<br><br>"I do not, as Peter and Paul, issue commandments unto you." Ignatius of Antioch, Epistle to the Romans, 4 (c. A.D. 110).<br><br>'You have thus by such an admonition bound together the plantings of Peter and Paul at Rome and Corinth." Dionysius of Corinth, Epistle to Pope Soter, fragment in Eusebius' Church History, II:25 (c. A.D. 17<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br>"Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect, while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome, and laying the foundations of the Church." Irenaeus, Against Heresies, 3:1:1 (c. A.D. 180).<br><br>"As Peter had preached the Word publicly at Rome, and declared the Gospel by the Spirit, many who were present requested that Mark, who had followed him for a long time and remembered his sayings, should write them out." Clement of Alexandria, fragment in Eusebius Church History, VI:14,6 (A.D. 190)<br><br>"It is, therefore, recorded that Paul was beheaded in Rome itself, and that Peter likewise was crucified under Nero. This account of Peter and Paul is substantiated by the fact that their names are preserved in the cemeteries of that place even to the present day. It is confirmed likewise by Caius, a member of the Church, who arose under Zephyrinus, bishop of Rome. He, in a published disputation with Proclus, the leader of the Phrygian heresy, speaks as follows concerning the places where the sacred corpses of the aforesaid apostles are laid: 'But I can show the trophies of the apostles. For if you will go to the Vatican or to the Ostian way, you will find the trophies of those who laid the foundations of this church.'" Gaius, fragment in Eusebius' Church History, 2:25 (A.D. 19<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br><strong>Church Fathers: Primacy of Peter</strong><br><br>"The church of God which sojourns at Rome to the church of God which sojourns at Corinth ... <strong>But if any disobey the words spoken by him through us, let them know that they will involve themselves in transgression and in no small danger."</strong> Clement of Rome, Pope, 1st Epistle to the Corinthians, 1,59:1 (c. A.D. 96).<br><br>"Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the Church which has obtained mercy, through the majesty of the Mast High God the Father, and of Jesus Christ, His only-begotten Son; the Church which is sanctified and enlightened by the will of God, who farmed all things that are according to the faith and love of Jesus Christ, our God and Saviour;<strong> the Church which presides in the place of the region of the Romans, and which is worthy of God, worthy of honour, worthy of the highest happiness</strong>, worthy of praise, worthy of credit, worthy of being deemed holy, and which presides over love..." Ignatius of Antioch, Epistle to the Romans, Prologue (A.D. 110).<br><br>"And he says to him again after the resurrection, 'Feed my sheep.' It is on him that he builds the Church, and to him that he entrusts the sheep to feed. And although he assigns a like power to all the apostles, yet he founded a single Chair, thus establishing by his own authority the source and hallmark of the (Church's) oneness. No doubt the others were all that Peter was, but a <strong>primacy is given to Peter</strong>, and it is (thus) made clear that there is but one flock which is to be fed by all the apostles in common accord. If <strong>a man does not hold fast to this oneness of Peter, does he imagine that he still holds the faith? If he deserts the Chair of Peter upon whom the Church was built, has he still confidence that he is in the Church?</strong> This unity firmly should we hold and maintain, especially we bishops, presiding in the Church, in order that we may approve the episcopate itself to be the one and undivided." Cyprian, The Unity of the Church, 4-5 (A.D. 251-256).<br><br>"After such things as these, moreover, they still dare--a false bishop having been appointed for them by, heretics--to set sail and to <strong>bear letters from schismatic and profane persons to the throne of Peter</strong>, and to the chief church whence priestly unity takes its source; and not to consider that these were the Romans whose faith was praised in the preaching of the apostle, to whom faithlessness could have no access." Cyprian, To Cornelius, Epistle 54/59:14 (A.D. 252).<br><br></div>

The Bible does not have an "inspired table of contents." Instead, this knowledge of the canon of Scripture is a revelation from God that is necessary for our salvation, and yet came to us from outside the Bible . This revelation was given to the Holy Catholic Church, and this historical and theological fact destroys the doctrine of sola Scriptura (interestingly, while Protestants reject the authority of the Catholic Church on most matters, they accept her authority in determining the New Testament canon of Scripture; we pejoratively call such picking and choosing which doctrines to believe and which doctrines to reject "Cafeteria Catholicism<br><br>The Church's compilation of the Bible illuminates the error of sola Scriptura. As alluded to above, Protestants generally believe that God has revealed everything that is necessary for our salvation through the Bible alone. Consequently, they also believe that no knowledge found outside of the Bible regarding the Christian faith is necessary for our salvation. However, the knowledge of which Scriptures belong in the Bible and which Scriptures do not is necessary for our salvation because if we didn't know this we could be led into error. Further, this knowledge could only come from God because human beings cannot necessarily discern divine inspiration.<br><br>Tradition gave rise to Scripture. It was with Tradition we knew which books was inspired and which are not.
