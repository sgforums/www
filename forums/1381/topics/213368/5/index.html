            <div class='col-md body'>Wow. The Protestant feel that what the Apostles did are no longer relevant. I suppose it doesnt matter that no Christian used sola scriptura till 1500s.<br><br>Why dont u reject the other Apostolic teachings then?<br><br>But when, the heretics are Scriptures, as if they were wrong, and unauthoritative, and were variable, and <strong>the truth could not be extracted from them by those who were ignorant of Tradition</strong>...And when we challenge them in turn what that tradition, which is from the Apostles, which is guarded by the succession of elders in the churches, <strong>they oppose themselves to Tradition, saying that they are wiser, not only than those elders, but even than the Apostles.</strong> The Tradition of the Apostles, manifested 'on the contrary' in the whole world, is open in every Church to all who see the truth...And, since it is a long matter in a work like this to enumerate these successions, <strong>we will confute them by pointing to the Tradition of that greatest and most ancient and universally known Church, founded and constituted at Rome </strong>by the two most glorious Apostles, Peter and Paul, a tradition which she has had and a faith which she proclaims to all men from those Apostles.' Irenaeus, Against Heresies 3,1-3 (inter A.D. 180/199).<br><br>St Irenaus describe ur belief well...that u are wiser than the Apostles.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to inject another prespective, many early Christians who rejected The Nicene Creed of the 4th century AD that was imposed by the Pagan Roman Emperor Constantine, had converted to Islam when Islam appeared in the 7th century. This included the majority of Christian Arabs, North Africans and Mediterranean peoples. Spain and Turkey became Islamic countries during Muslim rule from the 8th century AD under the Ummayyad Empire and unlike what is often asserted (without academic qualification) by orientalists and modern christian commentators, Islamic conversion happened slowly over a period of about 200 years and muslims-christians coexisted for over 400 years. In fact, it was by intermarriages between the Arab Umayyad elite and the native Seljuk Turks that the Umayyad empire slowly gave way to the Ottoman empire, showing how open Muslim society was at that time to peoples of other races and cultures.<br><br>Spain is no longer muslim of course due to the genocide perpetrated by the Crusaders when Spain fell in the 15th Century.<br><br>The current trend towards viewing Islam with hostility is due to the nature of the Zionist ideology that has taken over the American establishment (neocon faction) and the subservience of most national press towards American political pressure. The Zionists of course view Islam as an enemy due to the ongoing conflict in Palestine where Islam is seen as an ideological bulwark against the Apartheid policies of the Western backed Zionist state.<br><br>For more info:<br>http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/actionnetwork/A10472988<br>http://wais.stanford.edu/Spain/spain_muslimspain21803.html<br></div>

He even contributed money to the church in Rome ok ..<br><br></div></blockquote>Hiaz....protestnat dont know history ar?<br><br>Wikipedia:<br><br>Irenaeus was the first Christian writer to list all four of the now canonical Gospels as divinely-inspired, <strong>possibly in reaction to Marcion's edited version of the Gospel of Luke</strong>, which he (Marcion) asserted was the one and only true gospel.<br><br>Marcion of Sinope (ca. 110-160), was a major 2nd century Early Christian theologian, founder of what would later be called Marcionism, and one of the first to be strongly denounced by other Christians (who would later be called Catholic as opposed to Marcionite) as heretical. He created a strong ecclesiastical organization, parallel to that of the Church of Rome, with himself as Bishop. <strong>The Catholic Encyclopedia says of the Marcionites "they were perhaps the most dangerous foe Christianity has ever known."</strong><br><br>According to the 1911 EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica article on Marcion: "It was no mere school for the learned, disclosed no mysteries for the privileged, but sought to lay the foundation of the Christian community on the pure gospel, the authentic institutes of Christ. The pure gospel, however, Marcion found to be everywhere more or less corrupted and mutilated in the Christian circles of his time. His undertaking thus resolved itself into a reformation of Christendom. This reformation was to deliver Christendom from false Jewish doctrines by restoring the Pauline conception of the gospel, Â—Paul being, according to Marcion, the only apostle who had rightly understood the new message of salvation as delivered by Christ. In Marcion's own view, therefore, the founding of his churchÂ—to which he was first driven by oppositionÂ—amounts to a reformation of Christendom through a return to the gospel of Christ and to Paul; nothing was to be accepted beyond that. This of itself shows that it is a mistake to reckon Marcion among the Gnostics. A dualist he certainly was, but he was not a Gnostic."<br><br>What made Marcion distinct from the many who sought to recover the authentic Jesus, <strong>was that he believed that while the universe was created by Yahweh, the God behind Jesus and his teachings is not the same as the universal creator. This position has led many in orthodox branches to label his teachings Gnostic, as they make use of the concept of the Demiurge and a Docetic Christ.</strong><br><br>Maybe a saint to ur eyes...but not mine haha</div>

The second is by Mark, who composed it according to the instructions of Peter, who in his Catholic epistle acknowledges him as a son, saying, 'The church that is at Babylon elected together with you, saluteth you, and so doth Marcus, my son.'

Lame .. don't you think so? 4 because of the 4 corners - this is the main reason.
