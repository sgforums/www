            <div class='col-md body'>I was sitting in the canteen a couple of days ago and we started talking about religion. Two particular things really stumped me<br><br>1) My catholic friend said that christians were originally from the catholic church, however they disagreed with some bits of the bible and thus formed the christian church.<br><br>Being a christian my whole life, i was stumped by this.<br><br>2) They also claim that all christians are protestants. And this was even further backed up by a former christian.<br><br>Right at this point, you can imagine i was going like "huh?!?!?!"<br><br>I mean i had always though that protestants were a seperate thing, only in ireland. I mean thinking about it, i think they have a head bishop and all right? Not like our autonomous christian churches in singapore.<br><br>Would anyone care to elaborate on 1 &amp; 2?<br><br>Thanks</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me elaborate.<br><br>In the beginning there was one Church. It was founded by Jesus Christ with St Peter as the first Pope, the Vicar of Christ. The phrase 'Catholic Church' was coined by St Ignatius of Antioch in 107, who wrote: "Where the bishop appears, there let the people be, just as where Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church."<br><br>In 1054 AD, the Great Schism took place. The Church split into half, East and West. The Eastern Church called themselves the Orthodox. There were differences over culture, language and certain doctrines. The Orthodox did not accept the authority of the Pope over all Christians. Despite this, both Catholicism and Orthodoxy recognise the Sacraments, Veneration of the Saints and have much in common. Some Orthodox Churches finally conceded and were reunited with Rome. They are called Eastern Rite Catholics.<br><br>In the 16th Century, the Protestant Reformation took place. The Church was relatively corrupt during that time of history. It first sparked off in Germany by a former Augustinian monk Martin Luther. He tried to reform the Church, but was fed up, and so he left to set up his own church. It soon spread to other parts of Europe, and these Christians were now known as Protestants.<br><br>As time went by, these Protestants disagreed even amongst themselves, and as a result split into hundreds of different churches. Orthodoxy was also subject to many divisions. The Catholic Church remains as Church which has stood the test of time for Jesus Christ promised that the gates of hell would not  prevail against Her.</div>

The Apostle Peter belonged to the Jewish sect but still compromise (read: concede) to the Apostle Paul who wanted to make Christianity 'free for all'.<br><br>Catholics are candid about the Great Schism and the Protestant Reformation, but they are usually silent about the theological wars which took place during the early years of Christianity.

He created a strong ecclesiastical organization, parallel to that of the Church of Rome, with himself as Bishop.
