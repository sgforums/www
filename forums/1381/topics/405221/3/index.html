              <p>Jesus humbled himself to come to this world. He being God temporarily let go of his status as a God when he came down to the earth.</p>

              <p>Hi threadstarter, unless you have very good reasons to be tied down 
              to a specific religion. I recommend you choose to be free. (be a 
              free-thinker but NEVER Atheist).</p>
              <p>I am a free-thinker and I am free to tell people what are my beliefs.</p>
              <p><strong>Ghosts/Spirits/Deities
               exist and are real.</strong> <br> There are countless encounters with them throughout human history. If 
              really want to see them before you die, you may need special training to
               open your "Third eye". But a easier way to communicate/encounter them 
              is through a channeling medium.<br> <br> <strong>Rebirth/Reincarnation is a fact and is real.</strong><br> Two very good examples and I can give you. Both Jesus Christ and 
              Siddhattha Gotama have to go through rebirth to be born as a human being
               in this world. Without them, there will be no Christianity or Buddhism 
              plus some other reilgions.</p>
              <p><strong>Human Origins/Creation/Evolution</strong>?<br> Did God created humans or did humans evolve from single cell organisim 
              to present day form? I am certain humans do not evolve from animals/apes
               as humans are way too advance compared to Earthly animals. As for 
              whether God created humans, it is a very subjective topic because you 
              will need to be clear what you mean by "God", "Create" and "Human". With
               our very limited visibility/understanding, it is much easier to accept 
              that our very original ancestors are actually ethereal beings who 
              immigrated to this planet from other world/s. After millions of years of
               devolution(from perfect to pathetic), we lost our "purity" became 
              short-lived present day human beings like you and me.<br></p>
