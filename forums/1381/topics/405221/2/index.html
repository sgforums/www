              <p><br>Hi, religion is a personal choice. What works for one may not work for the other. I have my own religious beliefs, but it is not my place to expound the 'strengths' and 'weaknesses' of the respective religions based on my own views. Instead, I have the following advice:</p>
              <p>1. Evaluate a religion based on its teachings, not on the behaviour of its adherents</p>
              <p>2. Go by your gut feel and your conscience. If you feel that the inherent teachings of a religion is 'wrong' or does not make sense, then listen to your heart. You may clarify those dounts with other members of that religion, but do not be swayed by the rhetorics, threats etc. At the end of the day, it is more important that you will be at peace for whatever religion you chose for yourself. </p>

              <p>hi imacatt</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i'm a catholic.. catholic believe in heaven, hell and purgatory. What's purgatory? well, its a sort of purification place where yr venial sins (not mortal sins) are being purified while waiting to enter into eternal home with God. Venial sins are small sins eg.. telling small lies,.. some pranks.. etc.. nothing that serious.. however that warrant some time in purgartory being cleansed.</p>
              <p>So all is not lost.. dun worry, God Loves you and me and everyone on this planet earth, not just catholics, christians, including buudhists, hindus, muslims, atheists everyone. I would say majority of us end up in purgatory cos to go heaven we  have to be perfect.</p>
              <p>So in our Catholic tradition.. we often offer prayers for all souls usuallly  1 Our Father, 1 Hail Mary, and 1 Glory Be for all who have left us. We even have a day dedicated to all souls on Nov 2nd of every yr with a mass.  If you have catholic relatives or friends.. you would know they either  go to CCK christian cemetery or catholic churches columbarium on this day to pray for their loved ones.</p>
              <p>If you have every intention to know Christ and His Holy catholic church and its teachings.. dun be discoraged by such scandals such as child molestations. There are black sheep in every religion who gives a bad impression to non believers. Believe that God send His Spirit i.e Holy spirit to enlighten and encourage you. Dun be disheartened. If you are serious, i'll pray for you to make the right decision. Talk to a catholic friend abt yr intentions and ask any questions you need to know abt the Catholic faith or email me if you have any thoughts or questions and step right in if you are almost ready..</p>
              <p>God Bless You!</p>

              <p>for example.. christianity teaches that we all only have 1 life
              and after we die we either go to heaven or hell. Feels this is not
              really reasonable. there r pple borned into good homes and lead
              charmed lives. and there r pple borned into dsyfunctional homes and
              ended up becoming drug addicts or jail birds... </p>
              <p>So i feel that a religion that has the concept of reincarnation
