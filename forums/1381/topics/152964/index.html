            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, jus seeking some advices.<br><br>I was baptised when I was a teenage. At that time, I haven really understood christianity yet and so this mean I haven truely seen God yet though I had tried but due to my stupidity I can't understand the bible.<br><br>Then more recently, when I finally understand what christianity is all about and truely truely know Him, I suddenly have this worry: Do I need to re-baptised since when I was baptised, I have not understood God yet?<br><br>I e-mailed my pastor annoymously regarding this matter, my pastor replied I don't have to be re-baptised. God accepts my baptism.<br><br>I heard that some say it is necessary.<br><br>However, there are verses that said such:<br><br>I[Paul] am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius" (1 Corinthians 1:14)?  "For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel - not with words of human wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power" (1 Corinthians 1:17)?<br><br>I am still a bit lost. Can any mature Christians give some advices? thanks</div>

I was rather ignorant at that time, (though I was all along in Sunday school). I forget how I felt at that time -&gt; whether I have faith in Him or whether I just do it because my mother asked me. But I can say now that I truely have faith in Him and I am confident this will be so for the rest of my life. However, I a bit worry if I did not re-baptise, will I be saved?</div>

It is your dedication of your life to God.<br><br>God's basis of accepting you is not according to your act of '2nd' baptism. But according to His Son who died for you and rose again after 3 days, by accepting Christ. God will accept you in His arms.<br><br>A person who baptise in 1900 didn't understand the meaning and depth of baptism. But he truly loved God. After a few years, he backslided.<br>So on year 1930, as he aged, he felt that he understood baptism even more. So he went for '2nd' baptism and loved God and served God.<br>On 1940, he recieved a revelation about the meaning of baptism, the knowledge was far more than what he knew during his 2nd baptism.<br>He went for 3rd baptism again...<br><br>Morale of the story: It is not wrong to re-baptise, no matter how many times.

            <div class='col-md body'>There are some who said that re-baptism as a recommitment of oneÂ’s devotion to God, greater than the first time. It symbolizes your fidelity to God. They said if you feel led by the Spirit to re-baptise, do it. However, I have been thinking for quite a while and come to a much conclusion that I do not need to re-baptise. I don't feel lead by the Spirit to re-baptise and have already been feeling the Spirit guiding me in life. However, I'm still a bit worry. Just need some assurance from fellow christians. When I was baptised, I was a gong gong, blur and ignorant kid. It has been quite some years, say 4-5 years since I was baptised de.<br><br>Really thanks for all the replies from beloved Christians.<br></div>
