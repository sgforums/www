Machiam any denomination can qualify like that.</div></blockquote>There is a clear definition which all adherents of A.S accept. Most protestant denom reject A.s (like DUH!)<br><br>"And thus preaching through countries and cities, they appointed the first-fruits [of their labours], having first proved them by the Spirit, to be bishops and deacons of those who should afterwards believe. Nor was this any new thing, since indeed many ages before it was written concerning bishops and deacons. For thus saith the Scripture a certain place, 'I will appoint their bishops s in righteousness, and their deacons in faith.'... Our apostles also knew, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and there would be strife on account of the office of the episcopate. For this reason, therefore, inasmuch as they had obtained a perfect fore-knowledge of this, they appointed those [ministers] already mentioned, and afterwards gave instructions, that when these should fall asleep, other <strong>approved men should succeed them in their ministry</strong>...For our sin will not be small, if we eject from the episcopate those who have blamelessly and holily fulfilled its duties." Pope Clement, Epistle to Corinthians, 42, 44 (A.D. 9<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br>"Our Lord, whose precepts and admonitions we ought to observe, describing the honour of a bishop and the order of His Church, speaks in the Gospel, and says to Peter: 'I say unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my Church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.' Thence, through the changes of times and successions, the ordering of bishops and the plan of the Church flow onwards; so that the <strong>Church is founded upon the bishops</strong>, and every act of the Church is controlled by these same rulers." Cyprian, To the Lapsed, 1 (A.D. 250).<br><br><strong>A.s - historic episcopate. One must be able to trace his Bishops directly to the Apostles.</strong><br><br><blockquote>"But if there be any (heresies) which are bold enough to plant themselves in the midst Of the apostolic age, that they may thereby seem to have been handed down by the apostles, because they existed in the time of the apostles, we can say: Let them produce the original records of their churches; let them unfold the roll of their bishops, running down in due succession from the beginning in such a manner that [that first bishop of theirs] <strong>bishop shall be able to show for his ordainer and predecessor some one of the apostles or of apostolic men</strong>,--a man, moreover, who continued steadfast with the apostles. Â…To this test, therefore will they be submitted for proof by those churches, who, although they derive not their founder from apostles or apostolic men (as being of much later date, for they are in fact being founded daily), yet, since they agree in the same faith, they are accounted as not less apostolic because they are akin in doctrineÂ…Then let all the heresies, when challenged to these two tests by our apostolic church, offer their proof of how they deem themselves to be apostolic. But in truth they neither are so, nor are they able to prove themselves to be what they are not. Nor are they admitted to peaceful relations and communion by such churches as are in any way connected with apostles, inasmuch as they are in <strong>no sense themselves apostolic because of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">their diversity </span>as to the mysteries of the faith</strong>." Tertullian, Prescription against the Heretics, 33 (A.D. 200). </blockquote></div>

To Barlow was given the lead, and he, with the others as his assistants, consecrated Parker, 17 December, 1559, in the private chapel at Lambeth, using the Edwardine Ordinal. Three days later Parker, with the aid of Barlow, Scory, and Hodgkins, consecrated four others at Bow Church. From these ancestors the whole Anglican succession is sprung. Was, then, the consecration of Parker a valid act? This is the other ground of dispute round which, as a matter of history, the controversy has gathered. </blockquote>3) They changed thier church constitution by adopting the 39 Articles hence there is a breach in faith so the 'old church' ceased to exist.<br></div>

But rather the fact that they threw away their FORMER doctrines for new ones. The Anglicans reduced 7 sacraments to 2, changed the meaning of the Mass, adopted Luther Sola Fide and Sola Scripture as opposed to Sola Verbum Dei which they held previously. Hence there is a break which means the old Church of England had died in that sense. The Orthodox Church and the Orientals kept the same doctrines (while adding a few more) hence the church at 1500AD is still the same church at 500AD.</div>
