            <div class='col-md body'>Admittedly the trigger for the split was because of Henry wanting a divorce with Catherine.

And their succession also encompass religious and political prowess. With that being said, King Henry VIII while denying Papal authority, did not reject other articles of faith. It was only later that more reformation took place under Elizabeth.</div>
