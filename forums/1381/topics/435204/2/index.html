              <p>what it meant was all those acts and behaviours that doesnt go according to what recommended in the bible . believe me we are all antichrist in someway because in today modern and materialistic world somewhere along the line we know that really dont hold on to ancient bible values as much as those ancient people .</p>

              <p>Newton was not the first of the age of reason, the great rationalist scientist as conventional history likes to protray. He was the "last of the magicians". </p>
              <p>He belonged and was a product of the pre-newtonian age.</p>

              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">For the oligarchy, Newton and Galileo are the only two contenders for the honor of being the most influential thinker of their faction since Aristotle himself.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">The British oligarchy praises Newton as the founder of modern science. But, at the same time, they have been unable to keep secret the fact that <strong>Newton was a raving irrationalist, a cultist kook.</strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><strong>Among the oligarchs, it was the British economist Lord John Maynard Keynes and a fellow Cambridge graduate who began to open the black box of Newton's real character. </strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><strong>Was Newton the first and greatest of the modern scientists, the practitioner of cold and untinctured reason?</strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">No, said Keynes, Newton was not the first of the Age of Reason.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><strong>He was the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians and Sumerians, the last wonderful child to whom the Magi could do sincere and appropriate homage. </strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><strong></strong>Keynes based his view on the contents of a box. What was in the box? The box contained papers which Newton had packed up when he left Cambridge for London in 1696, ending his Cambridge career and beginning his new life in London as member and president of the British Royal Society, director of the mint, resident magus of the new British Empire.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Inside the box were manuscripts and papers totalling some 1.2 million words. After Newton's death, <strong>Bishop Horsley was asked to inspect the box, with a view to publication, but when he saw the contents, he recoiled in horror and slammed the lid. A century passed. Newton's nineteenth-century biographer, Sir David Brewster, looked into the box. He decided to save Newton's reputation by printing a few selections, but he falsified the rest with straight fibbing, as Keynes says. </strong>The box became known as the Portsmouth Papers. A few mathematical papers were given to Cambridge in 1888.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">In 1936, the current owner, Lord Lymington, needed money, so he had the rest auctioned off. Keynes bought as many as he could, but other papers were scattered from Jersualem to America.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">As Keynes points out, Newton was a suspicious, paranoid, unstable personality. In 1692, Newton had a nervous breakdown and never regained his former consistency of mind. Pepys and Locke thought that he had become deranged. Newton emerged from his breakdown slightly ``gaga.'' As Keynes stresses, Newton ``was wholly aloof from women,'' although he had some close young male friends. He once angrily accused John Locke of trying to embroil him with women.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">In the past decades, the lid of the box has been partially and grudgingly opened by the Anglophile scholars who are the keepers of the Newton myth. What can we see inside the box?</p>

              <p>It is with some diffidence that I try to speak to you in his own home of Newton as he was himself. I have long been a student of the records and had the intention to put my impressions into writing to be ready for Christmas Day 1942, the tercentenary of his birth. The war has deprived me both of leisure to treat adequately so great a theme and of opportunity to consult my library and my papers and to verify my impressions. So if the brief study which I shall lay before you today is more perfunctory than it should be, I hope you will excuse me.</p>
              <p>One other preliminary matter. I believe that Newton was different from the conventional picture of him. But I do not believe he was less great. He was less ordinary, more extraordinary, than the nineteenth century cared to make him out. Geniuses are very peculiar. Let no one here suppose that my object today is to lessen, by describing, Cambridge's greatest son. I am trying rather to see him as his own friends and contemporaries saw him. And they without exception regarded him as one of the greatest of men.</p>
              <p>In the eighteenth century and since, Newton came to be thought of as the first and greatest of the modern age of scientists, a rationalist, one who taught us to think on the lines of cold and untinctured reason.</p>
              <p>I do not see him in this light. I do not think that any one who has pored over the contents of that box which he packed up when he finally left Cambridge in 1696 and which, though partly dispersed, have come down to us, can see him like that.</p>
              <p><strong>Newton was not the first of the age of reason. He was the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians and Sumerians, the last great mind which looked out on the visible and intellectual world with the same eyes as those who began to build our intellectual inheritance rather less than 10,000 years ago.</strong></p>
              <p>Isaac Newton, a posthumous child bom with no father on Christmas Day, 1642, was the last wonderchild to whom the Magi could do sincere and appropriate homage...</p>
