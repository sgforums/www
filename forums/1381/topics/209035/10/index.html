Descartes dualism and all that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I remember you mentioned about Catholics and Jews believe about the soul for man and animals and the spirit only for man. Then you mentioned something and SIS started attacking you .. lol<br><br>Actually even if scientists discover that animals can laugh at all, this doesn't contradict the above view. The soul is the life, Genesis used the same word to describe man and animal - nefesh chayah. So we shouldn't be surprised if our thoughts can be reduced to matter and explained scientifically because this is part of "normal creation".<br><br>We have difficulty because the western civilization lends towards the general dualistic view of soul/spirit and matter. So you hear religious arguments like animals have no consciousness, they have no emotions etc. and humans have all of these.<br><br>But a closer look at Scripture - from the Jewish point of view - reveals something different. I shall not go into these now, but meanwhile you should think of this question - why did God attempt to find a helper among the animals for him?<br><br>Wait .. don't dismiss me first .. read the following verses from NIV. Take note of the parts in bold.

He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. 20 So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals.<br><br><strong>But for Adam [f] no suitable helper was found. 21 So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep</strong>; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs [g] and then closed up the place with flesh. 22 Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib [h] he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.</blockquote>SIS is right on one thing though - the spirit has more to do with conscience than consciousness.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

It seems a rather intuitive concept and the only time i came across it was during my undergrad yrs when i was studying cognitive psychology. that's why i'm having problems coming to terms with it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>This is a bit confusing for me. I think you misunderstood what he said. </blockquote>Ok. First, ben state tat from the christian perspective why does men have consciousness is simply because men have a more complete soul than animals. I do not believe in tat notion, but believe instead tat the brain is a "vessel" tat holds all "consciousness" and "intelligence". I support my point by showing tat injury to the brain lead to reduce intelligence and thus consciousness. If soul is the "vessel" tat hold all "consciousness" and "intelligence", then damage to the brain should not reduce men intelligence or consciousness. But it is proven to be true.<br><br>If I am not wrong, consciousness from the dictionary means<br><br>consciousness: the state of being conscious; awareness of one's own existence, sensations, thoughts, surroundings, etc.<br><br>Tat is u r self aware of yourself. U know u exist, u use a name to distinguish yourself, u r able to think for yourself and u r conscious of your actions and where they lead. Is tat correct ?<br><br>In tat case, my personal opinion is still linkng consciousness with intellectual. Higher intellectual lead to better perception of your environment. To me, it is just like having stronger legs will lead to travelling faster and cells degenerate slower will lead to longer longevity. Higher perception and awareness of your environment will lead to awareness of you and your contribution to the environment. It also make u more aware of wat your actions lead to. Tat is why from the examples of nature, higher intellectual is directly link with consciousness. Example, men being more intelligent have complex self awareness. Animals r also aware of themselves and the more intelligent the animal is, the more consciousness they have. People with diesease tat lower their intellectual was found to have reduced "consciousness".<br><br>How does consciousness help in "surviving". Plenty. U know of yourself as an individual, u can start to think for yourself. U can start off with storing food for future use. U can start to protect your clans from intruders and predators, u can start to run away from a losing fight because u r conscious of death after a fatal injury.<br><br>If u say tat I do not have evidence, tat is wrong since intelligence is always tested by the amount of consciousness a being have. How do scientist gauge if dog is smarter than a cat ? They do it by comparing the amount of consciousness they have. Tat is why I can state tat observed from biology, there is no example tat prove my notion to be wrong because the test of intelligent for animals is the test of amount of consciousness. If u wanna ask why does beings develop intelligent, then it is also simple and I have repeated it for a number of times before. Very very very very bluntly, Intelligence leads to better survival of a species isn't it ?<br><br></div>

First, ben state tat from the christian perspective why does men have consciousness is simply because men have a more complete soul than animals. I do not believe in tat notion, but believe instead tat the brain is a "vessel" tat holds all "consciousness" and "intelligence". I support my point by showing tat injury to the brain lead to reduce intelligence and thus consciousness. If soul is the "vessel" tat hold all "consciousness" and "intelligence", then damage to the brain should not reduce men intelligence or consciousness.

Higher intellectual lead to better perception of your environment. To me, it is just like having stronger legs will lead to travelling faster and cells degenerate slower will lead to longer longevity. Higher perception and awareness of your environment will lead to awareness of you and your contribution to the environment. It also make u more aware of wat your actions lead to. Tat is why from the examples of nature, higher intellectual is directly link with consciousness. Example, men being more intelligent have complex self awareness. Animals r also aware of themselves and the more intelligent the animal is, the more consciousness they have. People with diesease tat lower their intellectual was found to have reduced "consciousness". </div></blockquote>I will not fault you on this as the arguements on evolution are not strong for consciousness.

U can start to protect your clans from intruders and predators, u can start to run away from a losing fight because u r conscious of death after a fatal injury.  </div></blockquote>This is in view with my previous question on top. I will play fair and lay all my cards on the table as i rather have a good discussion vis-a-vis a nit pick deabate. Firstly, This is all well if cosciousness is part of intelligence. But if it isn't (which surprisingly i think many scientist agree with me given the amount of research put in to the studying of consciousness), we might have a problem here.

Let's go on to what u typed:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">If u say tat I do not have evidence, tat is wrong since intelligence is always tested by the amount of consciousness a being have. How do scientist gauge if dog is smarter than a cat ? They do it by comparing the amount of consciousness they have. Tat is why I can state tat observed from biology, there is no example tat prove my notion to be wrong because the test of intelligent for animals is the test of amount of consciousness. If u wanna ask why does beings develop intelligent, then it is also simple and I have repeated it for a number of times before. Very very very very bluntly, Intelligence leads to better survival of a species isn't it ?<br><br></div></blockquote>I think u should be astute enough to realise that this is not a discussion about inteligence. I have no issues with the role intelligence has with increasing survival rate. However, interestingly, a short click on wiki <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness</a> and you can gleam that consciousness is more than just intelligence. However, if your definition ties consciousness to intelligence, your reasoning makes sense.</div>
