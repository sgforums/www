Humanism is a component of a variety of more specific philosophical systems, and is also incorporated into some religious schools of thought.<br><br>Humanism entails a commitment to the search for truth and morality through human means in support of human interests. In focusing on the capacity for self-determination, humanism rejects transcendental justifications, such as a dependence on faith, the supernatural, or divinely revealed texts. Humanists endorse universal morality based on the commonality of human nature, suggesting that solutions to our social and cultural problems cannot be parochial.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it's making me laugh when davidche is implying that atheists have no life coz we dun believe in god, thus not living for god or with god. life can be defined differently individually and thus the purpose of life. i dun think i need to go into depth. if u are insistence that living for/with god is the only purpose of life, den good luck for u.</div>
