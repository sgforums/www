If you say animals can laugh and think .. no problem 'cos Scripture never explicitly denies that.<br><br>I think you are just set on demolishing any biblical concept you come across. So when this soul/spirit issue comes up, you just attack it .. without any attempt to understand it.</blockquote>Okay, so lets make your stand clear first<br><br>U believe tat consciousness, human consciousness and animal consciousness is tied to the soul. True or false ?<br><br>If it is false, then I really do not understand why r u even replying to the thread. Take note tat the point of contempt is Soul is not the basis of life. The point of contempt is Soul is the basis of all thinking, intellectual, awareness and consciousness of all living beings. If u do not support the above stand (according to your snake etc argument) then u r clearly confused and come in to state your stand at the wrong place. IT IS NOT ABOUT SOUL BEING ASSOCIATED WITH LIVING, BUT SOUL ASSOCIATED WITH THINKING.<br><br>If u support the souls or spirit to the be basis of all thinking, intellectual, awareness and consciousness of all living being, then clearly u have to answer the point on why does physical alteration to the brain affects consciousness, thinking, awareness etc. In fact u have to debunk the whole studies in neurology etc to prove tat soul is not tied to thinking. Why do people with dementia lose their consciousness over time ? Why do people high on drug lose part of their consciousness ? If u believe soul is the center, or vessel of all thinking, awareness etc, why don't u even give an answer to the above ? Why do u need a brain at all since its primary function is taken over by "soul" ?  I have probably asked these for many times now and I began to doubt your sincerity in tis discussion. U just seems to point the other way then give a personal attack to the person without explicitly give a coherent answer to the questions<br><br><blockquote>If your stand has nothing to do with the bible .. then it raises the question why you opposed ben vehemently. </blockquote>Simply because the stand DO NOT hold water. I think even a kid knows tat thinking etc concerns with the brain and not soul. Tis is not only concern with bible, but with SCIENCE as well since the theory tat brain is the center for all thinking etc is from SCIENCE.<br><br><blockquote>You seem to detach the soul from the life itself. Like the soul is something outside the life. Like you can have life without the soul or something? </blockquote>U r NOT answering the point of content. I am talking about THINKING. I am not talking about LIVING. Why do u keep talking about living etc when the whole point is about thinking ? U don't even DARE touch about thinking throughout the reply and keep harping on living. NOBODY is asking about soul and living ! Have u barge into the wrong discussion when u read wrongly earlier ?<br><br><blockquote>My problem with you is this - you seem to know more than Ben about how the soul actually interacts with the brain, only that your assertion is that it doesn't! </blockquote>Then why all the while NOBODY says brain interact with the soul ? Ben only says consciousness is tied to the soul. HE never mention soul interacting with the BRAIN. U keep mentioning the soul is linked to living. U NEVER mention soul interacting with the brain or even thinking ! WHy don't u prove by quoting the past replies on anyone mentioning a relationship between brain and soul ? About brain interacting with soul, why don't u state your stand clearly on wat do u mean by tat statement ? Why do u get tat idea ? Do the bible even mention about tis relationship (I did a check with the bible and they do not contain even a word "brain" ) ? The idea of the brain alone seems to have answer everythin about thinking awareness etc aptly. Wat is the merit of adding in "soul" to the picture ?<br><br></div>
