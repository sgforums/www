            <div class='col-md body'>If Atheism is to be taken in the broadest sense, which is the lack of belief of a god or deity, I would consider myself to be an atheist. Yet, let it be note that atheism is a very generalised group and not all people within in holds the same set of philosophy. I may not be religious, but that does not mean I avoid religious texts. I read the Bible, Buddhism Sutras, and other religious texts for purpose of knowledge curiousity and to extract whatever philosophical reasonings that make senses to me.<br><br>Davidche posted scientific theories that seeked to explain the world's creation and I believe that he hold skeptical views of these theories. These theories are not without their loopholes and are certainly not proven theories. Yet I see science not as a religion nor a set of belief but an attitude. This attitude can be illustrated by Davidche's previous post on the Steady state theory and the big bang theory. Both theories are rivals and a much larger group subscribe to the former until new evidence was uncovered to provide better backup for the latter, subsequently the same group of supporters for the former chosed to subscribe to the latter instead. The attitude displayed here is that they are willing to change their convictions according to the evidence available. Most religious believers however, are willing to stay with their beliefs even in the absence of evidence. Scientist seek to "know" based on facts, while religious believers seek to "believe" based on faith.<br><br>This is certainly not to say that all religions do not have evidence to provide for their theories. Davidche had mentioned that he had evidence supporting Christianity. I would only have preferred that he listed down the evidence or inform other forumees such as me, of the sources of these evidence. Perhaps we can discuss the authencity and reliability of these sources; maybe on another thread to prevent hijacking the current one.<br><br>On the purpose of life. As an atheist, or rather simply as me, I would rather no have my purpose of life being dictate by another, mortal or not. But I also do not agree with the accusation that Christian's purpose in life had been dictated by their religion. After all, they had simply subscribe to a set of life principles willingly and are normally able to unsubscribe it without much trouble. They are therefore, not being dictated, but simply following a set model. However, when an atheist do not subscribed to any religious pretext, it is not that we do not have any purposes in life. We simply write our own life manual instead of purchasing a ready written one. Personally, my purpose in life adopt a partial utilitarian approach and seek to maximise the happiness of those around me, family, friends, relatives, kinsmen, fellow humen, all other life form, generally in that order. But like all self written manual, it will constantly need refining.<br><br>On a sidetrack issue, I cannot help but observe that a common attitude of emotional arrongance appears to be displayed by a number of the forumees subscribing to this topic. It appears that my fellow forumees enjoyed downplaying each other, if they hold different views, by use of emotionally filled words. Pardon me, but is it not the purpose of a discussion forum to be an exchange of reasons rather than display of emotions and passions? Perhaps we can all work together to make the forum spaces a little more mentally challenging rather than emotionally challenging.</div>
