To my knowledge, nobody is sure why humans have evolved beyond what was needed for survival.<br><br>"sentinality" is really one aspect in which science has problem defining. in the context of evolution however, if we were to take it as anything beyond survival instincts, there are other creatures which may be considered sentinal. eg: elephant herds have been known to divide into societies, and it has also been observed that the matriarch of an elephant herd may pay respects to a deceased matriach of another herd. ie: the creation of a basic feudal society.<br><br>I hope that answers the question. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div></blockquote>yeah. that was why i brought it up. The Lecturer i spoke to mentioned that consciousness is the last black box that science has to face. He thinks wad is needed is greater leaps in our current base of knowledge and to synthesize the different disciplines of maths, physics, biology and psychology before we will be able to even touch the surface consciousness. pretty cool if u ask me</div>

My thinking is tat conscienceness is developed when men learn to live together. Helping another teammate when he is in trouble make the team stronger and help themselves survive better in the long run and thus make them more fitter to survive. Emotions help survival too since "sadness" and "happiness" make them strive to live better. "sadness" may arise from pain so tat u will not do an action tat will hurt your body and "happiness" when u find food so u can survive better. Emotion get richer as beings evolved.<br></div></blockquote>consciousness. It's like knowing that you are being. Example, a computer can do stuff, but do they have individualism? Do they have self-awareness?<br><br>In studies, some scholars try to proof consciousness by theorizing that if an animal can see recognize itself in its reflection, it has consciousness. Seems a bit dodgy if u ask me. As i find the construct to not be a yes/ no thing, but more of different levels of consciousness.<br><br>hmm, i still think i am not explaining it properly.</div>
