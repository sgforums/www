Undeniably it is a christian country due to the very fact that christians comprise the majority and even their dollar bills propagates christian beliefs - Eg "In God we trust". If that does not count as a christian country, I don't know what is a christian country then.<br><br>Furthermore, if we don't take a person's purported belief to guage, what do we use then? Do we judge for that person what religion he/she should belong in? This way of data collection may not be the most effective way as we've seen in cultural catholism but it's still the most reliable way of telling a person's religion. In fact, I think this is the only way to tell a person's religion and belief.<br><br>Have you studied statistics before? If numbers are big enough, even a small proportion can be still quite significant in terms of absolute value. A great proportion of American people still go to churches. Not every Filipino male is a womaniser. That's why we use statistics and numbers to back up our claims. There're always black sheeps in any religion or belief, so be glad that behaviours of some are not representative of the group. But neither can one denies such behaviour and rejects them from their religion just because they're "not behaving like a true christians".<br><br>Edit: replaced even with enough.</div>

For example, Connecticut is still known as the "Constitution State" because its colonial constitution was used as a model for the United States Constitution. Its first words were: "For as much as it has pleased the almighty God by the wise disposition of His Divine ProvidenceÂ…"<br><br>Most of the fifty-five Founding Fathers who worked on the Constitution were members of orthodox Christian churches and many were even evangelical Christians. The first official act in the First Continental Congress was to open in Christian prayer, which ended in these words: "...the merits of Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Savior. Amen".

There are too many concomitent factors invloved and i feel sweeping statements are not needed.</div></blockquote>Hi Ben,<br><br>as you can see, by your arguement, there will NEVER be a christian country. Even if there is one, most christians would deny that country as christian cos' it would be a fundamentalistic approach. Just like how some Muslims do not agree to the way how certain theocractic islamic countries work. At least we've come to agree that no way anyone of us can come up with a definition that everyone agrees<br><br>Furthermore, there's no point in debating if America is christian or not. I've no idea how simple stats came and brought about so much debate. All of you are missing the point I was trying to make. All the stats show is that most Atheists in US don't end up in prison when compared to the general population. Why? It's up to you to interpret.<br><br>I'm not a very intuitive person, but I kinda feel you don't agree to the conclusion I've made but yet you don't dare to voice it out directly. I don't blame you cos' this is a society where we are taught to be politically correct and nice, even when your emotions and heart is running wild with frustrations from the conflicting views presented.<br><br>But hey, that's what forums are for. So don't feel the need to hold back and let us discuss any doubts you have in mind.<br><br></div>

Phillipines also never went into theocracy but it is a catholic country. I can surely say your definition is not the internationally accepted one. I am also for religious right in countries, naturally since I am an atheist. </div></blockquote>Actually, my education under a few very inspiring professors has taught me that only theocracy should ever be considered as a true religious state. But i can see where u're coming from. Actually, not all atheist believe in religious rights. Some of the Aetheist i speak to holds a strong view that religion should be wiped out. As long as u do not subscribe to such a view, i feel alright</div>
