            <div class='col-md body'><br>--Continous creation(steady-state)<br>basically tells us that the galaxies moved farther away from each other, new galaxies were formed in between, out of matter that was continually created. The universe would therfore look more or less the same all the times and its desity would be roughly constant. This projectedmodel suggests matter(in the form of hydrogen) is always being created from nothing, and comes about in order to counteract the delution of material which occurs as the galaxies drift away from each other.<br><br>--A second explaination is called the osicilating model. This says that the universe is like a spring, expanding and contracting, repeating the cycle indefinitely. The basis of this theory is that the universe is closed, that is, no new energy is being put into it. The expansion of matter would reach a certain point and the force of gravity would pull everything together b4 expanding again. However, all evidences refutes this position; the universe is clearly losing density with no sign that the persistant expansion ever has or will reverse, and thus is not closed.<br>Dr.William L.Craig gives his conclusion about these two models with:"Both fail to fit the facts of observational cosmology."<br><br>--At last, the big bang,.....Dr Edwin Hubble plotted the speeds of the galaxies and confirmed that all galxies are moving apart from us and one another.Theres the law: the farther away the galaxy is, the faster it moves.<br>The implication of this is that at one time during 'creation' all matter was packed inside a dense mass of temperature of trillions of degrees. Scientists observed this phnomenon and infered that the universe resembled a white fireball and "BANG"!! Then in 1965 two physicians made a discovery that the earth was bathed in a faint glow of radiation. This exact pattern follows the wave lenth of what is expected in the Big Bang.<br><br>So skyfoo, sometimes Christians may know some atheism too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>or maybe more than you do <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

The basis of this theory is that the universe is closed, that is, no new energy is being put into it. The expansion of matter would reach a certain point and the force of gravity would pull everything together b4 expanding again. However, all evidences refutes this position; the universe is clearly losing density with no sign that the persistant expansion ever has or will reverse, and thus is not closed.<br>Dr.William L.Craig gives his conclusion about these two models with:"Both fail to fit the facts of observational cosmology."<br><br>--At last, the big bang,.....Dr Edwin Hubble plotted the speeds of the galaxies and confirmed that all galxies are moving apart from us and one another.Theres the law: the farther away the galaxy is, the faster it moves.<br>The implication of this is that at one time during 'creation' all matter was packed inside a dense mass of temperature of trillions of degrees. Scientists observed this phnomenon and infered that the universe resembled a white fireball and "BANG"!! Then in 1965 two physicians made a discovery that the earth was bathed in a faint glow of radiation. This exact pattern follows the wave lenth of what is expected in the Big Bang.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So skyfoo, sometimes Christians may know some atheism too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>or maybe more than you do <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </span></span></div></blockquote>u better brush up ur english and knowledge on chrisitianity before u come and talk atheism with me</div>
