Conscience. Ignore my previous blabbering. Sorry for making you read thru all those.<br><br>Evolution DO explain conscience, although it's a very bad explanation.<br><br>Evolution focuses on survival of species, not individuals. That's why individuals in a species can compete but the species advances. It is explained that individuals with conscience helps advancement of the whole species. By having a conscience and being good, the species can hope to reduce conflicts, promoting its survival.<br><br>Take for example altruism. Self-sacrifice. A stranger might sacrifice himself for a boy crossing the road and about to be hit by a car. It's an act of conscience - doing the right thing, however, it would mean the death of him and not getting his genes in the gene pool.<br><br>However, such a behaviour allows the boy to survive, which may prompt similar social behaviours, hereby aiding in the survival of human youths as a whole.<br><br>It's not the best explanation but it's the best evolution got.</div>

That's why individuals in a species can compete but the species advances. It is explained that individuals with conscience helps advancement of the whole species. By having a conscience and being good, the species can hope to reduce conflicts, promoting its survival.<br><br>Take for example altruism. Self-sacrifice. A stranger might sacrifice himself for a boy crossing the road and about to be hit by a car. It's an act of conscience - doing the right thing, however, it would mean the death of him and not getting his genes in the gene pool.<br><br>However, such a behaviour allows the boy to survive, which may prompt similar social behaviours, hereby aiding in the survival of human youths as a whole.<br><br>It's not the best explanation but it's the best evolution got.</div></blockquote>no worries. same thing here on my side .. thankfully, workload is starting to clear up.<br><br>Hmm, interesting. i have always thought of evolution to only explain the physical aspects.

            <div class='col-md body'>Consciousness or conscience ? My thinking is tat conscienceness is developed when men learn to live together. Helping another teammate when he is in trouble make the team stronger and help themselves survive better in the long run and thus make them more fitter to survive. Emotions help survival too since "sadness" and "happiness" make them strive to live better. "sadness" may arise from pain so tat u will not do an action tat will hurt your body and "happiness" when u find food so u can survive better. Emotion get richer as beings evolved.<br></div>
