The pilot knew that a Venezuelan stewardess on board was a devotee of Sai Baba and shouted, "Pray to your guru to save us from disaster!" No sooner had the stewardess shouted for Baba than He appeared in the sky outside the cockpit. Meanwhile the engine began to function. Babas' image remained in the sky outside for about 20 minutes, during which time the stewardess took this photograph of Him.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>"Though seeing, they do not see;<br>though hearing, they do not hear or understand. In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah:<br>" 'You will be ever hearing but never understanding;<br>you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.<br>For this people's heart has become calloused;<br>they hardly hear with their ears,<br>and they have closed their eyes.<br>Otherwise they might see with their eyes,<br>hear with their ears,<br>understand with their hearts<br>and turn, and I would heal them.'But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. For I tell you the truth, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.<br><br>Matthew 13:13-17<br></blockquote>No offense, but could this actually be refering to the "fervent" christians rather, that though seeing they do not see.....etc.<br>I believe what Matthew wished to tell us all, is to see what you should believe what you see, cuz "those" though seeing, do not "See"...like the free-thinkers do, i.e. an open and rational mind.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Thank you all, clap clap ~~~   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

There are always something special with all his pictures taken irregardless of colored lights seemingly emitting from his aura or some unidentified patches of miisty cloudy beings seeemingly resemble angels... Maybe we should adopt a more open-minded perspective towards such issues... Refrain from making such unverifiable comments... we can never know who we are talking about unless we are same as the subject involved or having close encounter &amp; relationship with the subject... Its not for few of us to judge based on unverifiable reports that may be of non-validity... It for the Masses... Anyway that represent my personal view only...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
