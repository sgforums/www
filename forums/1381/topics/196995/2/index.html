            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by asimplelife:</div><div class="quote_body">i am recently exploring more on christianity, after hearing abt some of the concepts from a fren, but am still not sure of some issues. tried to clarify with my fren but he's also not very sure as he is new to christianity, gotta ask his cell gp leader, so thot can get some advice from you all.  If you know, pls reply or pm me ok?<br><br>here goes:<br><br>1. Did God create dinosaurs? Was it mentioned in the bible clearly that he did?<br><br>2. How did all the animals on earth fit into noah's ark? How big was the ark then? Are we all decendents of noah then, since he was the only human to survive?<br><br>3. If God created all the good things in life, such as the sky, sun and so on, why did he also create disasters and diseases, where even christians die from?<br><br>4. Where do animals go to when they die? My fren told me that they have no soul, but I was thinking that if it is so, then why do dogs cry when their owners die? They are too humanlike to be without souls.<br><br>I have a lot of other questions,  but think i'm asking too many already. Did try searching on the net for answers but couldn't get a reasonable answer. Sincerely hope someone can help here. Thanks.</div></blockquote>You have to firstly understand what the Bible is. To understand what the Bible is you need to know what it is not.<br><br>It is not a science text book.<br><br>It is not a book on logic.<br><br>It is not book on philosophy.<br><br>So what is it?<br><br>It is a book on people's encounters with God. People's relationships with God. It is better that you write your own bible; that is, an account of your own relationships with God.<br><br>Answers to your questions by asking you some questions:<br>1. Did God create you or did your parents?<br>2. If you think that not every animal can fit into Noah's ark, then they did not. The Noah's ark story was an account of Noah's encounter with God. You can think of Noah's ark story like it is somebody's story about his encounter with God during the Asian Tsunami. The important point of the story is the account of his encounter with God and not the seismic conditions that led to the Tsunami. He is not a geography professor. So he would write based on his understanding of what he thinks caused it. It is not important because he is not writing an geography text book.<br><br>We cannot assume that Naoh was the only survival. To Noah, it certainly looked that way. We cannot even assume that the whole world was completely inundated; but to Noah, it certainly looked that way.<br><br>3.  We all die sooner or later and if not from this then from something else. God gave man a brain and a choice. Man makes his own choices for better or worse. Even if you become a Christian, you still make your own choices and suffer the consequences.<br><br>If you are carrying out God's will for you in your life, then:<br><br><strong>Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.</strong><br><br>4. Where do animals go? Same as where humans go. To put it in another way, Humans go where the animals go after they die; unless a man is Born of The Spirit. Everybody and animals are born of water; and unless a man is born of water and of the spirit; man and animals, those born of water, go to the same place when they die.</div>
