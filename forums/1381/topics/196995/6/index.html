God is transense time and space and thus there is always some things that you don know or cant be proofed, this unprovablity only prooves MORE that God is the truth. If everything about God and the creation and stuffs can be undersood by us, then God is not God, Wer r only humans, how r we then capable of understanding Gods will? Which is y,...there r mysteries such as dinosaurs' exsitence.....<br><br>The important thing is, i repeat again, believe in God only when u believe, even if u have questions, cos it cant be all proven by evidences and explainations, we only know that God has its will and plan.....</div>

I realise that there is a difference between the way christians and non-christians view things (from a freethinker point of view). Perhaps that is the reason why some dun see eye to eye.<br><br>Maybe let me just share my experience:<br><br>[b]Christians: </strong><br><br>Believe in the presence of God;<br>Believe that the bible is true and that it is the word of God;<br>Believe that the bible is true (cos it is the word of God) then study the bible to comprehend the facts in it.<br><br>(Eg. For me, I've been to NCC. If I were to convert then, I would first be a christian, believe that God exists, and thus that the bible is true as it is the word of God, then study it. That is why I am still a freethinker because I require facts/scientific reasoning before I am convinced, thus my questions here).<br><br><strong>Non-christians (a generalisation here that may be incomplete):</strong><br><br>May believe that there is no god;<br>May believe that there is God but in other religions;<br>May be born to believe in a religion;<br>May be a freethinker;<br>May convert to christianity if they are convinced;<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">May</span> need convincing of facts in the bible and religion first before believing that it is the word of God, as there are also facts in their own beliefs (could be self-beliefs or religious beliefs). This is because Christianity encompasses a lot of bible study and the sermons often use quotes from the bible. If I don't believe in the bible it is difficult to believe in God in the Chistianity context.<br><br>I have received a lot of PMs on attending courses and attending the study groups. However, I have some responding that they are also not quite sure abt the bible itself. I had expected a brief but clear outline abt the answers but I am sorry I remain unconvinced with some of the responses. I often feel that facts of life are made to fit into the bible and explain it than having the bible with clear facts to convince us. This is my personal belief and I understand that christians may have a different view on this.<br>[/b]</blockquote>Hi asimplelife,<br><br>Perhaps the intention of many who responded to you is not so much to "convince" but lovingly, took efforts to tell you what they believe is the Truth and what they think is the better way for you to seek the Truth.<br><br>If you are really seeking, then perhaps a fair action would be to try out the ways recommended by Christians - since they have also experienced the same thing.  i said this, because in the first place, i thought you asked Christians here in this forum because you thought they can help. Well we tried as far as this forum can accomodate. The rest is up to you.<br><br>So are you really seeking ?<br><br>Actually, Christians are not here to "convince" anyone through words. Nor do we convert.  We can be a living testimony of God's Words and Blessings.  We can care for you as if you are their fellow brother and sister - even if we do not know who you are. Some can even die for you.  We can tell you what we know is the Truth not because "someone" say, but because we experienced the Truth.<br><br>Christians do not just "believe" in the Bible - We rely on the Bible as if it is our Life Vessel because the Bible teaches us how to live.<br><br>Only God can accept you into His Kingdom through your willingness to declare that Jesus Christ is your Lord and Saviour.  Only God can do things in your Life you wouldnt even know possible as a pre-believer - and mind you, not everything is going to be "good" as what the world prescribe.<br><br>I always remember what a friend told me when i first accept Christ - "Almost everything you knew is going to be thrown in an opposite direction."  Through these years, i have nothing esle to refute that statement.<br><br>Well, that is so far, what is happening in my walk with God.  Whether or not, you believe or want to seek further, is entirely up to how interested you are.<br><br>Blessings.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>

How did all the animals on earth fit into noah's ark? How big was the ark then? Are we all decendents of noah then, since he was the only human to survive?<br><br>3. If God created all the good things in life, such as the sky, sun and so on, why did he also create disasters and diseases, where even christians die from?<br><br>4. Where do animals go to when they die? My fren told me that they have no soul, but I was thinking that if it is so, then why do dogs cry when their owners die? They are too humanlike to be without souls.<br><br>I have a lot of other questions,  but think i'm asking too many already. Did try searching on the net for answers but couldn't get a reasonable answer. Sincerely hope someone can help here. Thanks.</div></blockquote>1) In the bible, it does mention at one point where it says "...and other beings" which many have come to refer it as Aliens. But in your case, it can be use to explain the creation of Dinos.<br><br>2) Not all the animals. Only pairs of each kind (still, its friggin quite a lot of them). And technically, we including Noah, are all descendants of Adam and Eve. But then again, it is arguable that the Bible is not to be taken literally.<br><br>3) Natural Diasaster may be viewed as a Eco control system. hereby living things get 'refresh' and given a new order. A wake-up call if you like. For mankind, natural disasters are being viewed as destructive, bad etc. But bear in mind that it is not necessary how God views it. For christians, it is only in heaven that we attain eternal life. As much as I hate to die young, I hope this is a good enough answer.<br><br>4) Well, unlike humans, when pets or animals die, they go to a place call the "PET Cemetary" whereby they are brought to life again. If you play PC/PS games, you would understand. It is just like you dying in the game and all you do is hit the 'Reload' key and VOILA... you're back to life again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Alright alright, I am kidding about this one.</div>

If God created all the good things in life, such as the sky, sun and so on, why did he also create disasters and diseases, where even christians die from?</blockquote>Almost no one has answered this. Well, the best answer to theodicy (explaining why evil exists with an all-good god) I've found is this story:<br><br>The Tale of the Twelve Officers<br>http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/mark_vuletic/five.html<br><br>It was, of course, sad to hear that Ms. K had been slowly raped and murdered by a common thug over the course of one hour and fifty-five minutes; but when I found out that the ordeal had taken place in plain sight of twelve fully-armed off-duty police officers, who ignored her terrified cries for help, and instead just watched until the act was carried to its gruesome end, I found myself facing a personal crisis. You see, the officers had all been very close friends of mine, but now I found my trust in them shaken to its core. Fortunately, I was able to talk with them afterwards, and ask them how they could have stood by and done nothing when they could so easily have saved Ms. K.<br><br>"I thought about intervening," said the first officer, "but it occurred to me that it was obviously better for the murderer to be able to exercise his free will than to have it restricted. I deeply regret the choices he made, but that's the price of having a world with free agents. Would you rather everyone in the world were a robot? The attacker's choices certainly weren't in my control, so I can't be held responsible for his actions."<br><br>(Continued at the URL above)</div>
