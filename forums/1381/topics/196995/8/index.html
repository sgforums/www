            <div class='col-md body'>Just a reply for asimplelife, if he ever read tis...<br><br>Frankly from the way u ask the question I can say tat christainity is not suitable for u. If u wanna believe in christainity, u have to abandon science and accept religious scriptures as truth.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Science has itself proven to be very reliable and factual ever since the day u r borned. U r probably borned in the hospital where it is built using structural engineering. They probably use some electrical device such as lights which is science of electricity. They made use of thermodynamic for aircon and the doctor helping u to be borned is medical science. Science has proven itself so reliable tat one don't need to think twice when going to a new building (even though tall things fall) or typing on a computer (though it can explode or shock people).<br><br>On the other hand religious content has rarely proven itself right when it run in contradiction with science so much so tat it is natural to doubt them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> In fact I think the common people can't think of an example where religion is proven to be right whereas matured science is wrong when they contradict each other. Looking on religious content such as falungong and scientology, they claim many ridiculous issues tat is obviously wrong to unbiased people. To think tat religion content is right whereas science is wrong need lots of convincing and evidence but so far, the attempt to do it all really weak<br><br>some examples of ridiculous claims from religious content<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Scientologists believe that you can be harmed by memories of injuries that happened to you during previous lifetimes. They also believe that, if you pay enough money to Scientology and take enough courses of treatment and training, you can become immortal -- a fully-developed being with mind-over-matter powers who is above physical death.<br>Scientologists also believe that you can be bothered by "body thetans" and "clusters", which are the ghosts, or clusters of ghosts, of millions of people from another planet who were murdered here millions of years ago by the evil Galactic Overlord Xenu. Those ghosts are supposedly now clinging to your skin and trying to get into your body and giving you all kinds of pain and troubles. But for only $375,000 or more, Scientology will get rid of those pesky interplanetary cooties for you. </span><br><br>Now looking at christainity, we can again see many issues tat is against science as well. Looking at the young vs old earth arguments, the christain will raise up the same few points<br><br>1) days is not "days" as we know it. (Tis is surprising because the bible itself clearly explicitly mention wat tat a night folow by day is consider a "day". The rest of the bible also use the word "day" as wat a day is about. Otherwise jesus reserrection is not 3 days later but 3 billion years  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> )<br><br>2) they say tat the earth is really a few thousands years. (Tis again is very ridiculous because there r many irrefutable examples to show an old earth.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> An example are logs found in a volcanic region. The rings of the trees with the ones buried inside the lava themselves add up to more than the years consider in the bible)<br><br>They also say tat evolution is wrong, and evolution is really an established theory tat form the core of biology.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> U grab any established biology textbook and they will surely mention evolution in it. They again will come out with some flawed arguments about how evolution is wrong (i do nto want to go through it all again) but I can simply tell u tis point again tat religion content rarely, if never proves matured science theory wrong. Given the many years of developing evolution theorem, it is considered a matured scientific fact.<br><br>And lastly, bible never mention dinosaur and possibly because the writers of the bible do not know there are dinosaurs. Whoever says tat bible mention dinosaur in the bible is nonsense because dinosaurs never lived with men before. They r extinct before men came about. (noah is a man)<br><br>If u wanna believe in christainity, u have to believe all these despite the fact tat it runs in contradiction with science  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> In fact u have to believe more ridiculous facts such as noah ark (it is proven tat the ark can not hold tat much animals. And no eggs can walk up to the ark, and mammals can't lay eggs, and there is not so much water, and the population density and distribution of human from now till noah time is impossible), dead walking the land and no one take notice (when jesus die deads r walking on the streets). And furthermore, u will be told not to read and interprete the bible on your own. U r forced to study wat a group of people had researched and u will be swayed to follow wat they say. They forbid independent thinking. From the viewpoint of cultic identification, tis is because tis way they can still maintain followship even with a faulty scripture.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Guru, his church, and his teachings are always right, and above criticism, and beyond reproach.<br><br>In some cults, the guru is dead, but the principle is the same. I use the word "guru" loosely here; in many cults the charismatic leader has the title of minister, priest, yogi, swami, prophet, or all-knowing wise man. Or even, "Chairman Mao." In any case, the leader is always right.<br><br>Likewise, the teachings of the guru are always right, and when he dies, his writings become holy scriptures, infallible and unquestionable. And the guru's church is always right, and the guru's successors are always right, and everything about the cult is always right. </span><br><br><a href="http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-cult_q0.html#cq_guru_right" rel="nofollow">http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-cult_q0.html#cq_guru_right</a><br><br>Why don't u go to tis website to read a bit before making a decision ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Haven't you ever noticed how God only heals invisible ailments that cannot be verified?</strong><br><br>God never instantly strips 200 pounds of ugly fat right off of an immensely obese bikini-clad woman with a glandular problem, right there on stage in front of the TV evangelist, the TV cameras, and some independent witnesses. God never puts new legs or arms on amputees on Sunday Morning TV shows, or on the Trinity Broadcasting Network.<br><br>Nope, it's always cancer, arthritis, paralysis, gall bladders, blindness, pinched nerves, or other things that the TV camera cannot see; things where independent verification is not possible. And, where verification is possible, like with the Viet Nam Veterans who have been paraplegics since the War, well, God doesn't bother to fix any of them in faith-healing ceremonies. God never fixes their broken spinal cords or replaces their lost legs. God doesn't seem to like the Viet Nam Vets who have authentic medical records. The Lord sure does work in mysterious ways.<br><br>A corollary to all of this irrational nonsense is the implicit assumption that you are not supposed to criticize it. Cults often demand that people stop thinking logically and just "have faith". Cults consider it immoral, or at least a serious spiritual failing, for someone to say that the cherished tenets of the group are illogical and crazy. Cults will even claim that you are harming other cult members by questioning the craziness -- you are keeping them from going to Heaven, or you are weakening their faith, or you are leading them into temptation and to their downfall.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just a reply for asimplelife, if he ever read tis...<br><br>God does not do evidence. God requires man to come by Faith. If God gives you evidence; why would you bother with a God so small?<br><br>The Bible is not a science text Book. All science text books should be thrown away because and should be destroyed because it is not complete. There are too many gaps in scientific knowledge. Scientists themselves understand that science is subject to change.<br><br>Like gravity... Newton came up with a nice model of gravity but when Einstein came along, Newtonian gravity was replaced by Einstein's model. The theory of Gravity is "out there". Meaning nobody knows the truth. All scientific theories are "out there;" subject to change.<br><br>We do not throw away science text books because we understand that man is finite; incomplete; inconsequential; impermanent.<br><br>Instinctively we also know that there is more to human life then this. Man instinctively knows that there is a God and that he can know God.<br><br>Don't let anybody fool you. Don't let anybody discourage you. If God is calling you, then respond. There is only one God. Your relationship is a personal relationship. Nobody has any right to discourage you and tell you otherwise. Just because they have never put their faith in God and does not know God, they have no right to tell you that there is no God.<br><br>You have to be patient. Moses waited for 40 years before God spoke to him. You have to learn to wait on God. It is up to God, you have no choice but to wait and in the meantime learn about God from people who knows God. If what they tell you about God does not make sense then reject it.<br><br>In time of need and trouble and fear, just call out to God. Just say and cry out "God." There is only one God. You cannot go wrong. Do not try to understand God in your head. Whatever people tell you about God understand that it is simply their perception of God and not meant to be a complete assesment and understanding of God.<br><br>If people try to tell you that God's name is this and that, reject it for God is too big to be confined in a name. Reject it as the name of God and as a concept of God but do learn why people call God that name. The name represents somebody's or some people's understanding of God during a certain period of time at certain point in time.<br><br>Ask God for faith to seek Him and you shall find God. When you have found God, knock on the door of the Kingdom of God and it shall be opened to you.<br><br>1. Respond to God's call directly.<br>2. Learn about God from people who have met God but reject what they tell you if it does not make sense to you.<br>3. Be patient and in the meantime keep your faith in God until God gives you a spirit when you are ready.<br>4. This spiritual journey is worth all the wealth in the world.<br><br>Jesus said: What shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses his soul?</div>
