A book listing down some people's experiences of God.<br><br>What you need is your own experience with God. There is only one God. You need not fear; many who called out to God and to whom God responded will tell you that God is not going to harm you when you call out to Him.<br><br>Search your own heart and ask yourself what is preventing you from calling out, asking God to talk to you?</div>

Was it mentioned in the bible clearly that he did?<br></div></blockquote>Yes.<br><br>One of the issues about reading the Bible is to understand the style of writings of the 66 books. Some books are historical in nature, others are more imagery. Some are letters to individuals or groups, while others are narrative stories....<br><br>This is not the first time on whether Genesis was written as a detailed chronological account of creation, or perhaps as a summary of what had taken place over a long period of time.<br><br>I guess those reading Genesis are broken into two camps of old earth and new earth.<br><br>My personal perspective is that the world is very very old (as can be seen from archaelogical discovery), the creation account may have taken millions of years. The fact that in Genesis, the word "DAY" is used does not invalidate the account. The thing to take away from the creation of Genesis is the creation process, where the "days" of creation makes complete sense scientifically.</div>

We are all formed from "nothing." We are all formed from "light." The trees, the dinosaur, the car that you drive, the sun in the sky... you break it down to its most basic, you get "nothing," you get "light," "energy!"<br><br>That is a diversion.<br><br>Like I said. The physical earth was not even formed at that point in time and yet the words used was "one day."

Ultimately, you still need to have your own experiences with God. It will be an experience that will last for eternity if you acknowledge that you are mere man and as a mere man, you have no choice but to depend fully and solely on God.</div>

I am quite sure that the cats and dogs that we know do not exist in those days. Evolution is a "bad" word among churches, and has been debated many times even here in EH, but fact remains that every living thing adapt to their environment. So where species are concern, the animals that we see in the zoo probably do no exists in prehistoric times..... <span class="small">except for maybe the cockroaches and the sharks.</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by asimplelife:</div><div class="quote_body">Please see: How old is the earth according to the Bible?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.users.bigpond.com/rdoolan/earthsage.html</span></div></blockquote>this link is an example of those who subscribe to the "new earth" theory.
