            <div class='col-md body'>Quote<br>2. If you think that not every animal can fit into Noah's ark, then they did not. The Noah's ark story was an account of Noah's encounter with God. You can think of Noah's ark story like it is somebody's story about his encounter with God during the Asian Tsunami. The important point of the story is the account of his encounter with God and not the seismic conditions that led to the Tsunami. He is not a geography professor. So he would write based on his understanding of what he thinks caused it. It is not important because he is not writing an geography text book.<br><br>We cannot assume that Naoh was the only survival. To Noah, it certainly looked that way.

God can give him birth of spirit to the man who comes to Him in Faith. God does not give man birth of spirit on His own accord because that would mean taking away man's will.</div>
