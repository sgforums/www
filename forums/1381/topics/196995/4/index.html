            <div class='col-md body'>Free will is doing and saying what you like; but please remeber that there are consequences. So for you to put words in my mouth have consequences as well. A gentle reminder.<br><br>People who put their faith in the bible are no less idolators then people who put their faith in a statue.<br><br>Man has this overwhelming need for idols. When the bible witness to people, telling them not to put their faith in idols, they straightaway create a new idol called the Bible.<br><br>The Bible has its place. The Bible is a witness like people are witnesses.<br><br>Sure, there are false witnesses and there are real witnesses. Just because the witnesses put their experiences down in writing does not make the witnesses infallable. If the bible is not a "black and white" "witness" of people's experience with God; then it would be God giving man evidence. God give you evidence?<br><br>Please don't think so highly of yourself, to put it mildly, do you think that you are equal to God so that you can demand evidence of God from God?. The original sin was man attempting to be God. "Eat and you shall be like God."<br><br>You need to place your Faith in God. Faith in God are not feelings. You say that because you have never been born again and you have no idea what Faith in God is. Faith in God leads to being Born of the Spirit. People Born of the Spirit have a relationship with God.<br><br>The progenitor of this relationship is Faith in God (Faith in idols will not do.) Once you are born of the spirit as a result of this Faith, the relationship does is not dependent on Faith anymore. You enter into the Kingdom of God.<br><br>Because spirit is eternal, you then continue to have this relationship with God for eternity. Friend, I have been where you are right now. Strip yourself of all idols and put your Faith in God only and ask God to give you Birth of the Spirit. Only God can do that, nothing you can ever do or imagine can do that.<br><br>Remember, idols will not do. Whether the idol is a book or a statue or a concept of God in your head.</div>
