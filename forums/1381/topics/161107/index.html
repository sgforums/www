            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Thanksgiving</strong><br><br>4-year-old boy who was asked to return thanks before Christmas dinner. The family members bowed their heads in expectation. He began his prayer, thanking God for all his friends, naming them one by one. Then he thanked God for Mommy, Daddy, brother, sister, Grandma, Grandpa, and all his aunts and uncles. Then he began to thank God for the food. He gave thanks for the turkey, the dressing, the fruit salad, the cranberry sauce, the pies, the cakes, even the Cool Whip.<br><br>Then he paused, and everyone waited--and waited. After a long silence, the young fellow looked up at his mother and asked, "If I thank God for the broccoli, won't he know that I'm lying?"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Parents aren't alone</strong><br><br>Whenever your kids are out of control, you can take comfort from the thought that even God's omnipotence did not extend to God's kids. After creating heaven and earth, God created Adam and Eve. And the first thing He said to them was: "Don't."<br><br>"Don't what?" Adam asked.<br><br>"Don't eat the Forbidden Fruit." God replied.<br><br>"Forbidden fruit? We got Forbidden Fruit?<br><br>Hey, Eve..we got Forbidden Fruit!"<br><br>"No way!"<br><br>"Where?"<br><br>"Don't eat that fruit!" said God.<br><br>"Why?"<br><br>"Because I am your Creator and I said so!" said God, wondering why he hadn't stopped after making the elephants.<br><br>A few minutes later God saw the kids having an apple break and was angry.<br><br>"Didn't I tell you not to eat that fruit?" the 'First Parent' asked.<br><br>"Uh huh," Adam replied.<br><br>"Then why did you?"<br><br>"I dunno," Eve answered.<br><br>"She started it!" Adam said.<br><br>"Did not!"<br><br>"DID so!"<br><br>"DID NOT!"<br><br>Having had it with the two of them, God's punishment was that Adam and Eve should have children of their own...thus the pattern was set, and it has never changed.</div>

Suddenly, something fell out of the Bible.<br><br>He picked it up and looked at it closely. It was an old leaf from a tree that had been pressed in between the pages.<br><br>Â“Mama, look what I found!Â” the boy called out.<br><br>Â“What do you have, dear?Â” she asked.<br><br>With astonishment in his voice, the young man replied, Â“I think itÂ’s AdamÂ’s suit!Â”</div>
