These marbels bare symbols of the zodiac.<br><br><img src="http://www2.art.utah.edu/cathedral/images/can_cc/can_trin_flr.jpg"><br><br>12- 12 signs of the so called satanic zodiac there.<br>-----------<br><br>Saint Finbar's Catholic Church NEw South Wales.<br><br><a href="http://rds.yahoo.com/S=2766679/K=astrological+symbols+in+English+cathedrals/v=2/SID=w/TID=E195_80/l=WS1/R=5/IPC=us/SHE=0/H=3/SIG=12lh7cf48/EXP=1105003221/*-http://www.acay.com.au/~stfinbar/Symbols%20of%20St%20Finbars.html" rel="nofollow">http://rds.yahoo.com/S=2766679/K=astrological+symbols+in+English+cathedrals/v=2/SID=w/TID=E195_80/l=WS1/R=5/IPC=us/SHE=0/H=3/SIG=12lh7cf48/EXP=1105003221/*-http://www.acay.com.au/~stfinbar/Symbols%20of%20St%20Finbars.html</a><br><br><blockquote>The rose depicted on the organ has five petals which represent the five senses;' taste, sight, hearing, smell, and touch through which the spirit of the human being makes contact with the material world. The rose is sometimes qualified as the "rosa mystica" and the "rosa mundi". The former refers to Christ who by sacrifice attains new life in God. The thorns of the rose and the crown of thorns of the Passion Narrative have a connecting double symbolic meaning. The "rosa mundi", i.e., the rose of the world, refers symbolically to the developing world and the cycle of birth and death that it shows. <strong>There is a connection here with the rose window of the cathedrals which were often divided into twelve segments and take for form of a wheel signifying the "wheel of being" and has links with the astrological types.</strong> It is in this way that the "rosa mundi" came to be connected with the Blessed Virgin Mary. As the sea is the womb of all life on earth, so is the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary the origin of the life of Jesus Christ, who in turn by his sacrificial death paradoxically brought the New Life of God to the world. These ancient symbols are still used by contemporary artist such as Arthur Boyd whose painting "Crucifixion and Rose" links together all the points mentioned above.</blockquote>Ok my question is this. Coz i keep getting told off by christian teachers/friends that i should not dabble or even look at astrology coz it is SATANIC and corrupting my soul or some thing. Yet how come famous bastions of the christian faith have CONSTRUCTED PHYSICAL symbols and associations with this so called SATANIC thing called astrology?!?!? Explain that, and its not just these 2 cathedrals, churches in UK were actually consecrated to different stars.<br><br>But surely the fact that there exists HARD EVIDENCE of association with astrology in churches goes to show that perhaps astrology and christianity were once ONE..<br><br>just pissed off that christian friends keep telling me that iw ill go to hell if i check my horoscope.<br><br></div>
