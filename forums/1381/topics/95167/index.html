I have gone through the article on the first weblink you provided and I don't find any references to the source of the author's finding.<br><br><blockquote>If RC can attract so much controversy, something must be wrong with the "church." </blockquote>Who in first place created so much controversy to make life so challenging for the Catholics?  Who's the one who said that the Catholic church has the names of all Protestants in the world?  Who came out with the idea that the Pope wrote the Koran?<br><br>The second link that you provided, I went through that too.  It was pretty interesting as I am very into archaeologist findings from time to time.  But what doesn't impress me is how the author derive his/her own assumptions in his/her own words.  Things like "Bull fights, Rosaries and Assassinations are from Islam".  Buddhists use rosaries too.  Did they get it from the Moslems as well?  The creditability of the two authors' writings is a big question mark.  Like what you said earlier, I am going to say the same thing to you :<br><blockquote>U have ears, eyes &amp; brain to discern the truth &amp; lies...use it wisely that's all I have to say.</blockquote>When I put two articles together, one said that Catholics wrote the Koran and the second said that the Catholics came from Islam.
