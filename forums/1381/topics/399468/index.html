              <p>Your agenda is clear as daylight. You are trying so hard to destroy the vast majority of Catholic priests, whom you don't understand and who have been so good and inspirational to others, by remotely lumping them in with a number of priests who have let the Church down.</p>
              <p>What makes your posts so pitiful is that you twists facts and news reports (many of which are exaggerated by the way) to suit what you want to say. An example of your 'facts':</p>
              <p>You don't even know that the Catholic Church does <strong>not</strong> collect 10% tithes. You can give as little or as much as you want at each Mass, it's entirely up to you.</p>
              <p>You said in another thread that Mother Teresa, possibly one of the more heroic Catholics in the last few decades, is a fraud. This in spite of the fact that she's been awarded a whole range of humanitarian prizes, including the Nobel Peace Prize (which she refused and asked for the $192,000 to be given back to the poor) for her more than 45 years of helping the poorest of the poor in India. You mean it's so easy to bluff the prize committee?</p>
              <p>You said in another thread that the WW2 holocaust never happened and was a fabrication. Enough said.</p>
              <p>So before you lose any more credibility (I doubt there's any left) with your mindless and immature rantings which frankly no one bothers about, please stop and do some serious reflection ya? If this is what non-Christians do (and I'm thankful that most non-Christians don't sink to this level), then I'm so very glad and thankful to be a Christian, really. Thank you for reaffirming our faith. </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>the sex abuse scandal is now in Nth and Sth Americas, Europe and Australia................and many of them date back decades so there are THOUSANDS of priests involved..................and don't tell me the money paid to so many victims over the years drop from the sky ???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as for Mother Theresa winning Nobel Prize, that prize is no longer that highly regarded anymore............if clowns like Al Gore can win it .....................and Obama won it for Peace while he sent more US troops and drones to Aghanistan and then into Pakistan shows the nobel Prize has lost it's meaning...........</p>
              <p>the poor Indians in Calcutta were the ones that were interviewed by a Western Press journalist and they said Mother Theresa only helped hundreds and not the tens of thousands that she claimed............and they also said she spent the a lot of her time in Hungary.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as for the holocaust, there are tons of evidence and witnesses and many modern experts that clearly point to either the holocaust was a complete myth or the death figures were GROSSLY OVER-REPORTED..............even Jewish rabbis have said the figures were way too high to be possible.</p>
              <p>you wanna read the Red Cross report on their investigation into the so-called death camps ? they were allowed into those camps during WW2 many times throughout the war....................</p>

              <p>I'm curious, do you actually know a Catholic priest? As in <strong>really</strong> know him (not just your usual hearsay)?</p>
              <p>I guess not.</p>
              <p>I've known at least a dozen of them since I was a child and no, I've never been raped, molested, sexually harassed or hit on by any priest. Seems to be the same for every other Catholic I know in Singapore, sorry to disappoint.</p>
              <p>On the contrary, I find them to be decent, humble, gentle, long-winded at times <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> and selfless men who seem to have given up a lot for God, including the possibility of having a wife and a properous career (not with <strong>a few hundred</strong> dollars per month) amongst other things. And what pains me most is to see them suffer these mindless attacks like yours, but what also inspires me is how they shrug them off and continue serving God and His people with quiet strength. </p>
              <p>And about Mother Teresa and the holocaust, it's getting quite embarrassing, really. Perhaps you may want to consider saying your 'facts' to the face of a Jew. Or to someone in Calcutta whose parent was peeled up from the street with festering sores on his back and then washed, fed and clothed by Mother Teresa and her nuns and given a proper place to die with dignity as a human being. Be my guest <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>how could you try to condemn a religion is beyond my understanding but frankly, your actions will be futile. you are just like Pastor Rony Tan, action before facts. when did we ever gave 10% monthly contribution? i definitely give less than 1%... should be 0.8%</p>
              <p>Mother Teresa a fraud? hmm... well, she's dead so you can say all you want... like what they say, the dead cannot defend themselves, cannot refute your claims and definitely cannot argue with you so i will advise, "leave the dead alone."</p>
              <p>for the holocaust, even if millions didn't die, imagine the fear and dread you feel underneath your skin if you are a jew... persecuted by Germans for no apparent reason at all especially if you are a child not older than 18 years old... being dragged away from home and gassed to death in an icy cold room with other children. what did the young children do to deserve this? what did they do to you?</p>
