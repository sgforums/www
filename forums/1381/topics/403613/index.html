              <h2>Jesus could not have died nailed to the cross as there is no evidence that 
                the Romans crucified prisoners 2000 years ago.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The legend of his execution is based on the traditions of the Christian church 
                and artistic illustrations rather than antique texts.</p>
              <p>The ancient Greek, Latin and Hebrew literature from Homer to the first century 
                AD describe an arsenal of suspension punishments but none mention "crosses" 
                or "crucifixion."</p>
              <p>If you are looking for texts that depict the act of 
                nailing persons to a cross you will not find any beside the Gospels.</p>

              <p><br>The topic is,</p>
              <p>Jesus could not have died nailed to the cross as there is no evidence that the Romans crucified prisoners 2000 years ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so, the point to ponder is this;</p>
              <p>Is there any  evidence that the Romans crucified prisoners 2000 years ago (outside Christian sources).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The examples and other sources I cited, shows that there are indeed records outside christian sources that record that the Romans did crucified their prisoners 2000 years ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so this argument (that Romans don't crucified their prisoners)  used to show Jesus could not have died nailed to the cross could not be estiblished.</p>

              <p>Asromanista2001, it seems you are doing it again. It is very ironic how you and a few others keep throwing accusations of people being close-minded, yet you are at least as close minded yourself.</p>
              <p>It is very easy to find other info about cruxification. I suggest you use the same google you used to find such articles to search on that as well.</p>
              <p>If you are truly open-minded, you would be open to the possibility that there are other articles talking about cruxcification that is not bible-related instead of just basing on one article only.</p>
              <p>I think this also highlights that you can't believe everything you read or everything you see on the internet.</p>
              <p>In any case, do you believe in the article for itself? Or is it you have another agenda with putting that article here. Ask yourself this.</p>
