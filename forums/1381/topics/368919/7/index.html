              <p>Ah...novelltie bro...i hav read ur posts &amp; u are 1 of the sensible &amp; knowledgable christians around. As a fellow christian, i feel sad dat christianity is the most hated religion in the world. Actually we r only a simple &amp; peaceful bunch of people but many hav a wrong impression of us just becos of a few bad eggs. which religion doesn't hav bad eggs? but then again, christianity being the most hated religion in the world reflects the true power of our Lord.</p>

              <p>ya... maybe some advice;</p>
              <p>Jesus said, "Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, Give to God
              what belongs to God"</p>
              <p>there is no need to heed all Christians accusations or
              condemnation; If you are brought up a Taoist and you decided to
              live your religion, it's your own free will and i have nothing
              against it. it is God's decision that you should not be born a
              Christian but that does not condemn you to Hell... rather, if you
              live a life full of goodness and charity, you are kind,
              humble, love others and is of good character, i might
              just see you in Heaven for all i know.</p>
              <p>God works in mysterious way and you should have your own free
              will on such decisions. i don't see someone born a Muslim can
              convert to Christianity because it's against the law, does that
              make him condemned to Hell? no... all of us have a plan, arranged
              by God so don't bother too much of what other Christians say...
              live your life freely.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>hmm...correct me if im wrong....you are saying we are somehow destined by God to do this and that..our purpose in life right??so freewill is given to us so as to do what??either follow that destiny or go against it right?now..a freewill to go against destiny will make God look stupid isnt it??and if lives are destined..then the gift of freewill is redundant isnt it??</p>

              <p>errr... in sg no min wage right? say maybe $3 per hour, but you only work say about less than an hour per week... so lets give you one hour a week... so it is $3 x 52 X 2 = $312 SGD...but then, in the last year, you did not come in to work at all and even let everything go... so must claim back for maintenence and repairs... so say we call it even... hehe.</p>

              <p>erm..thats why we live our live imitating Jesus since he was the closest to God..whom God had approved..imperfect humans cannot attain 100% imitation but can only strive their pathetic best..Yodh Hew Wah Hew had his standards spelt out in the bible..kinda like follow and do once you are convinced its the best way to live..</p>
              <p>God is love..that is his foremost quality..without love, he would never wanna waste time creating you and me..he wants to share the joy of living..then he is righteous..and all the other good qualities..but love is still the foremost..</p>

              <p>if that is all that matters then why even believe in the G_d of Avraham, Yitzak and Yakov? Then why does the Brit Chadashah (NT) put emphasis on Yeshua as being the only way to Abba? Even in the Tanakh (OT), the way to salvation is through Hashem.</p>

              <p>Bro honestly, i dun hav an answer u desire for ur 1st question. I may hav my own perception but there will be many to disagree with me. There r too many variations to the original hebrew bible so i believe many are misquoted, again is re-wriiten by humans. i believe in God, not humans. At the end of the day, religion is about faith &amp; how much u believe.</p>
              <p>To answer ur 2nd question, to me...a good person is someone who puts others ahead of himself aka unselfish. But do u agree?</p>
