              <p>we can argue and argue again about your translation and my
              beliefs. you can say our Catholic's teaching are wrong but does
              that does not change my beliefs. as i've said, this will not end;
              which is frankly boring me a little. you have rights to your
              beliefs and i have rights to my beliefs. you can say we are evil
              and cover each others' murder during the middle ages, fine so be
              it. i'm cool about it. if someone here is going to say we Catholics
              are actually a satanic cult for believing in Mother Mary, he's
              obliged to his opinion, which frankly does not affect us at
              all.</p>
              <p>Shawn Wood of Seacost Church says it best;</p>
              <p>"The problem is that we are spending too much time interpreting
              the Bible, and not letting it interpret us. The big problem with
              our understanding of God’s word is not an acedemic issue – it is
              moral."</p>
              <p>you are here debating with me about the wrongs of our religion.
              i have no answers to your accusation because the doctrines are held
              in Italy and again, "the word of God is true"... yes but your
              interpretation may not be the true meaning God has intended for
              us... look, it will never end; your views and our views do not
              meet. you believe whatever what you wish to believe, i have no
              objections because from the beginning of the whole post, i have
              told everyone, "don't be swayed by others' opinions including
              Christians for you are free to have your own religion and
              beliefs."</p>
              <p>i seriously advise you to give Father Simon a call if you wish
              to clarify about the "dead = deep sleep" issue for i'd rather have
              blind faith than question them. it was written in Catholic "law"
              that;</p>
              <p>Hence if anyone, which God forbid, should dare willfully to deny
              or to call into doubt that which We (The Church) have
              defined, let him know that he has fallen away completely from the
              divine and Catholic Faith.</p>
              <p>i rather not challenge for i believe in blind loyalty and
              faith.</p>

              <p>Since there are so many so-called different interpretations of
                  the Bible one complaint often voiced is that everyone has a
                  different interpretation of the Bible. Because many people arrive
                  at varying conclusions when they read the Bible, there is
                  supposedly no way to arrive at a consensus. People point to the
                  variety of denominations as an example that there can be no
                  unanimity among Bible believers.</p>
              <p>This idea neglects to take into account certain facts. The great
                  majority of Bible readers have no problem agreeing on the Bible’s
                  central teachings. Even those who do not believe the Bible to be
                  true have no difficulty whatsoever discerning the main message.</p>
              <p>Within all branches of Christianity, we find the same basic
                  understanding as to what the Bible teaches. They usually accept the
                  same creeds that assert such basic truths as that God made man in
                  His image, with freedom of choice, and that man chose to rebel
                  against God, thus bringing sin into the world. Moreover, God,
                  because of His everlasting love, became a man in the person of
                  Jesus Christ and died a substitutionary death on our behalf, paying
                  the infinite penalty of sin. Men can have their relationship
                  restored with God through placing their faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Bible’s message is clear for
                  those who will read it with an open mind and seek to understand its
                  meaning. The problem comes when people attempt to make the Word fit
                  their preconceived ideas. This is not the fault of the Bible, but
                  of the people who attempt to force the Bible to say whatever they
                  want it to say. Often the disagreement is not so much with the
                  interpretation of the Scriptures, but with the
                  application.</span></p>

              <p>All I am asking you to do is to read the bible in the ORIGINAL context in which it was written, in the original context of who is was written to and in the original context of the setting in which it was talking about.</p>
              <p>How do you put your faith in someone whom you don't even know? You give me all the cliche's but who is Yeshua?</p>
              <p>Yeshua was never roman and never will be, He was a Jew, of the tribe of Yehuda, born and bred in Yisrael, preached in the Synagogue and a rabbi. He did everything as was expected of an Yisraelite. This is the context.</p>
              <p>Have you ever considered that the church which you rely so heavily upon has done exactly just that... attempted to force the bible to say whatever they want it to say? Could there then be a problem with the method of application by the church?</p>
              <p> sorry... but I will leave it here, what you make of it is what you make of it... take care of yourself nove...</p>

              <p>brey, friend... i'm not pushing away the responsibility but
              rather... what i've learnt, i've learnt from Father Simon Pereira.
              he was my Sunday Church teacher and whatever i've said to you comes
              from him. he is my source of knowledge and my mentor.
              i've studied the bible many times and somehow, it coincide
              with my faith and knowledge. yes, there were many questions and
              unclear message the Lord had written in the bible but if i were to
              question every ounce of it, what good will it be?</p>
              <p>you asked me to study and discern the truth... friend, maybe you
              have lot of free time at your disposal but i do not have... and
              again, do i have the resources to seek the "dark secrets"? are you
              willing to sponsor my trip to Israel and Egypt or even Italy? you
              may say i am blinded by facades and lies that does not coincide
              with the Holy Bible, but again are you so sure of it yourself that
              your interpretation of "death = eternal sleep" is 100% accurate and
              true base on the bible.</p>
              <p>i have only one conclusion of why the Catholic Church teaches us
              that when we die, we enter in Heaven or Purgatory to be cleanse...
              cos' they have found out from the bible, they have interprete from
              the bible, based on their deductions and beliefs plus the
              endorsement of the Pope and the Bishops and whatever authority God
              has given them and maybe even hints from Mother Mary when she
              appeared in Fatimah to the 3 children that it is true. you can
              debate this, you can contest this, i'm not saying you aren't liable
              to... you have the very right to do so but you asking me to
              question the teachings of the Catholic Church is akin to in my
              opinion treachery. call it blind faith, call it self-delusional but
              frankly, even if Da Vinci Code is true and Jesus married Mary of
              Magdalene, have a lineage of spawns, i do not care for i have
              experienced the love of God and the Virgin Mother... i have pleaded
              for the protection of St. Michael and it was bestowed to me.</p>
              <p>what more do you wish from me then? when to me, facts do not
              always equal to faith. Science has opened a question for all; why
              wasn't the dinosaurs indicated in the Holy Bible as Adam and Eve
              were the first? there was no collection of wild giant beasts but a
              serpent when dinosaurs came first? when queried, i just shrugged it
              off because there is no way i can out-talk a scientist and we have
              factual proof of dinosaurs fossils. in the end, you are using facts
              on this issue which in my opinion, you are very wise and very
              academic but then; faith is not based on facts and written history
              based on a thousand year old text. faith is believing what is
              unseen and unproven.</p>
              <p>the most debated query of all which is non religious; do ghost
              exist? can science prove it? i have personally encountered spirits
              before. my mother was possessed by a spirit before. my sister could
              see spirits before when she was younger. she told me one lady
              spirit was walking around the house without the lower part of her
              body. but can science prove the existence of the supernatural? how
              many of us wishes to explore and prove the existence in the first
              place; unless you are paid to do so...</p>
              <p>so end of the day, i do understand your stand that the Bible
              indicated "this and that", why do the Church teach otherwise. as
              i've said, they may have interpreted the bible differently from you
              and i chose to believe them. simple as that.</p>
              </div>

              <p>dear nove..while this is pretty much your discussion with brey..may i just add..though its best to study the original scriptures in the original tongue it was written in..its impossible not just tight budget..but even the hebrew used then is different from now..</p>
              <p>the mordern english version is still reliable..you said you had no time..are you the wheat that grows with the weed??there is a time to work in secular..there is a  time for God..which is more important??do you trust God enough to throw your daily anxieties to him??do you not trust that he can make better arrangements for you even if you quit your current job or maybe study less??</p>
              <p>lastly..same bible given to everyone ends with pretty different interpretation..a bible given to someone with no knowledge prior ends with no such thing as trinity doctrine from the church..</p>
              <p>read the bible..compare it with church teachings..see if its consistant not just once or twice..but everytime..does teachings of the church you attend reveals the personality of God the way the bible reveals him..his love, his justice..his love of righteousness...the bible is more accurate than the teachings of men..</p>

              <p>we can argue and argue again about your translation and my
              beliefs. you can say our Catholic's teaching are wrong but does
              that does not change my beliefs. as i've said, this will not end;
              which is frankly boring me a little. you have rights to your
              beliefs and i have rights to my beliefs. you can say we are evil
              and cover each others' murder during the middle ages, fine so be
              it. i'm cool about it. if someone here is going to say we Catholics
              are actually a satanic cult for believing in Mother Mary, he's
              obliged to his opinion, which frankly does not affect us at
              all.</p>
              <p>Shawn Wood of Seacost Church says it best;</p>
              <p>"The problem is that we are spending too much time interpreting
              the Bible, and not letting it interpret us. The big problem with
              our understanding of God’s word is not an acedemic issue – it is
              moral."</p>
              <p>you are here debating with me about the wrongs of our religion.
              i have no answers to your accusation because the doctrines are held
              in Italy and again, "the word of God is true"... yes but your
              interpretation may not be the true meaning God has intended for
              us... look, it will never end; your views and our views do not
              meet. you believe whatever what you wish to believe, i have no
              objections because from the beginning of the whole post, i have
              told everyone, "<span style="color: #ff0000;">don't be swayed by
              others' opinions including Christians for you are free to have your
              own religion and beliefs</span>."</p>
              <p>i seriously advise you to give Father Simon a call if you wish
              to clarify about the "dead = deep sleep" issue for i'd rather have
              blind faith than question them. it was written in Catholic "law"
              that;</p>
              <p>Hence if anyone, which God forbid, should dare willfully to deny
              or to call into doubt that which We (The Church) have
              defined, let him know that he has fallen away completely from the
              divine and Catholic Faith.</p>
              <p>i rather not challenge for i believe in blind loyalty and
              faith.</p>

              <p>who is the pope? the pope is the spiritual leader of the Roman Catholics, the one chosen by God to lead His people; to spread His teaching. so indirectly, God speaks through the pope, to the Church to us.</p>

              <p>for example; so in 1950, when the Pople declared papal infallibility for the Assumption of Mary; we were told that her status of "Mother Mary" is confirmed among the Catholics and we are to venerate her, not worship her as the Mother of God. this is then passed down from the Vatican to the bishops all around the world, to the priests in the different churches locally and to the masss, us.</p>
              <p>now, are you saying God didn't tell the pope to declare papal infallibility for the Assumption of Mary? hey, the bible didn't ask us to venerate Mother Mary but why do we do so? because we have faith that the pope, the successor of St. Peter, the rock and watchman at the Gate of Heaven has received an order by God himself to place status on his mortal mother for she is sinless.</p>

              <p>errr.. the pope is chosen by a group of cardinals who most likely have political agendas... if the pope is supposed to spread the teachings of Yahweh, why then does he teach things which are contrary to the bible? On this point you have never been able to answer...</p>
              <p>ok in 1950 the pope declared the assumption of Mary, don't you think it funny that waaay back when Miriam (Mary) gave birth to Yeshua, if Yahweh wanted to do so, He would have? I mean if you say you read the bible, then you would know that Yahweh made a statement about Yeshua in Mattinyahu 3:17 And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am <strong>well</strong> <strong>pleased</strong>."</p>
              <p>Would not Yaweh have mentioned Miriam to be vernerated then? Would not Yeshua if it was sooooo important mention something about it then as well?</p>

              God that would prevail the test of time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's not worship our religion or theological principles but
              let's worship God alone. For heaven sake we all could be wrong at
              some points and right at another points. No one really knows for
              sure. I've seen good Catholic priests who are full of the holy
              spirit and I've seen the not so good Ctaholic priest which I quite
              don't like. I've seen good Protestants and likewise I've seen the
              bad ones. If you really believe in one true God then we are all
              bothers and sisters of the same God despite our religion and our
              beliefs.</p>
              <p>Could you imagine saved souls arguing one another about whose
              religion is better in heaven?</p>
              <p>You see my point? </p>

              <p>MP, the problem with your statement is if one wants to worship Yahweh, how do we do it, according to what the church teaches us or according to what He wants us to do? Problem is a cp full of holy spirit, is still a cp... if you get my drift... ultimately what one must come to is how Yahweh wants us to worship Him. How He wants us to follow Him, not what the church nor any man says about how we should follow or worship Him.</p>

              <p>Yahweh is found of those who seek Him and there will always be a community of like minded people. So in short yes, He will have to teach me Himself because the church is NOT doing it.</p>
              <p>The whole problem is that the church is NOT teaching what Yahweh wants... they are preaching things that are going against His commandments. There are so many teachings in the church that contradict what the bible says, now then if the bible is the word of Yawheh, who is right? man or G_d? The chruch is telling us how it thinks we should be worshipping our creator, where Yahweh already told us EXACTLY how He wants this to be done, yet is the church listening? Not only does the church not do what Yahweh wants, they create new things and ways of worship and force it upon Yahweh that it is how the church will worship Him, the audacity and the arrogance of it all.</p>

              <p>well, i cant emphasise enough that reading the bible is very important..by that i dont mean attending mass or whatever to listen to what other people tell you what certain bible says...i meant you take out you own bible and time and meditate what you are going to read in there..pray before you read and after...ask that you may understand him...God has lovingly provided what he wanna tell us through the bible...he does also protect us in daily life..he is only now difficult to understand because people has be mystifying him for the past 2000+ years from the creation of the church..and even before that by the jews..</p>
              <p>God sent his only begotten son to clarify matters and witness for him 2000+ years ago..and he knows people through other types of influences will mess things up..but at least his main goal has been achieved..the redemption for humans..</p>
              <p>also,always remember..satan always turn himself into an angel of light in order to mislead..</p>

              <p>who is the pope? the pope is the spiritual leader of the Roman
              Catholics, the one chosen by God to lead His people; to spread His
              teaching. so indirectly, God speaks through the pope, to the Church
              to us.</p>
              <p>you can question the authencity of the authority God gave to the
              Pope, no issues. you can deny his "sacred" duties and message. you
              can say he's hallucinating when he hear God's order... i can't
              challenge you.</p>
              <p>for example; so in 1950, when the Pople declared papal
              infallibility for the Assumption of Mary; we were told that her
              status of "Mother Mary" is confirmed among the Catholics and we are
              to venerate her, not worship her as the Mother of God. this is then
              passed down from the Vatican to the bishops all around the world,
              to the priests in the different churches locally and to the masss,
              us.</p>
              <p>now, are you saying God didn't tell the pope to declare papal
              infallibility for the Assumption of Mary? hey, the bible didn't ask
              us to venerate Mother Mary but why do we do so? because we have
              faith that the pope, the successor of St. Peter, the rock and
              watchman at the Gate of Heaven has received an order by God himself
              to place status on his mortal mother for she is sinless.</p>
              <p>yes as usual, please contest the authencity of Mother Mary,
              contest the legitability of the Pope, contest the manipulation of
              the bible by the Church, contest all you want for it's your own
              free will.</p>
              <p>again, i do read the bible, i do understand the morals behind
              each parable and chapters but my interpretation may not be the same
              as yours. it may mean something else when it means this to me. i
              have no objections if you think otherwise for "yes" and "no" may
              mean different things to us in life.</p>
              <p>like brey, a brother no doubt our differences; i will leave this
              as it is for further contest will breed nothing. Peace be with
              you.</p>

              <p>dear nove..i totally understand your point as i used to think like you too..until i saw it can no longer be that way...pope is elected by people and not God..then people will say bible is written by man not God which is correct technically..</p>
              <p>while the church says to venerate mary and not worship her..think of the title for mary..mother of God..personally, i feel its very insulting...almighty God to be born by a mere mortal sinful human....the God who has no beginnings is now being called a son of woman...a woman who originated God..you get my drift..and yes i am saying God did not say to pope this and that...Jesus himself says to satan..it is to YHWH/JHVH your God that you should render sacred services to..and i dont even wanna say how many things the church is doing against biblical teachings..we read the same bible that was inspired of God..certain consistent truth cannot be missed..</p>
              <p>its because of the love of a brother..thats why i felt compelled to make my points..May YHW/JHVH watch over you and people you care for..</p>

              think it funny that waaay back when Miriam (Mary) gave birth to
              Yeshua, if Yahweh wanted to do so, He would have? I mean if you say
              you read the bible, then you would know that Yahweh made a
              statement about Yeshua in Mattinyahu 3:17 And a voice from heaven
              said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am

              <p>Would not Yaweh have mentioned Miriam to be vernerated then?
