              <p>hmm...correct me if im wrong....you are saying we are somehow destined by God to do this and that..our purpose in life right??so freewill is given to us so as to do what??either follow that destiny or go against it right?now..a freewill to go against destiny will make God look stupid isnt it??and if lives are destined..then the gift of freewill is redundant isnt it??</p>

              <p>life is all about choices... you can choose to walk left or walk right... or simply walk straight or back to where you came from. God simply game your the choice to decide your direction... that is the free will God gave you.</p>
              <p>you saw a wallet on the floor containing money with an NRIC. you know who the owner is and you have the choice to either return him both the money and NRIC, or take the money but return the NRIC or take the money and throw the wallet away. this my friend is free will that God gave you.</p>
              <p>what is destiny? what is your destiny? do you know? were you meant to be a doctor, a lawyer or a priest... you can be an accountant now but your destiny may be a priest, who knows? your destiny does not reveal itself until it's time.</p>

              <p>maybe i am wrong, maybe it's just my perception... maybe i'm just being silly but i remembered i was told that sinful man can still enter the gates of Heaven if he repents at the last minute or second.</p>
              <p>we have this thing call last rites for dying men and women... it is the last chance for them to reconcile with God before they breath their last. it was believed or rather i believed that a man may be sinful and may be notorious during the years of his life but at the end, before the end he confessed to God during the last rites that he was a great sinner and he feels deep remorse for the sins he committed. i also remember if he declare that he believe that God is the Almighty and he pray for salvation earnestly, he will receive grace and he shall be allowed to enter the gates of St. Peter.</p>
              <p>or if Heaven does not allow immediate entry, there is a place call Purgatory where souls are being purified before entering Heaven... so in lame man's term; one can still enter the gates of Heaven if one is truly repenten of his sins...</p>
