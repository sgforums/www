              <p>i'm not asking all of us to live a life of sin before the last moment of repentence. what i'm saying is i believe there is still salvation for men who committed grave sins during their years of living.</p>
              <p>Heaven is where God lives? where he has it prepared for his children to live with him after their lives on earth? Lord Jesus said, "those who believed in me shall have eternal life".</p>
              <p>sins like adultery, falsely accusing a fellow men and murder... these are the major sins but the Lord has one new one before he left us for Heaven, "Love one another as I've love you." Because Lord Jesus loves us so much, He came down to earth to suffer and die to take away the sins of the world, his sacrifice for the love of us is what he desires us Christians to have... to love one another as to sacrifice ourselves in time of need.</p>
              <p>for example; if we saw a child holding a deadly snake, we ought to risk our lives and save the boy from the snake. if we see an old lady having problems with her groceries, we should sacrifice our time to assist her to carry her load or even open the door for her if the opportunity arises. it is all about loving one another as human beings that the Lord wants to instill in all of us. cos' when you love one another, you will not commit sins against them like if you love your mother, will you want to hurt her intentionally like accusing her falsely? will you want to hurt your brother by having adultery with your sister in law?</p>

              <p>Heaven is where Yahweh lives, but is that where belivers will live in the world to come? Maybe try reading the book of Revelations?</p>
              <p>Love one another as I have loved you is not really a new commandment. It espouses the 10 mitzvot given by Yahweh in the Tenakh (OT). To Yeshua's peers, it was automatically known to be taken from there.</p>
              <p>I don't think so. Love is not what Yeshua is teaching. Yeshua is really teaching repentance. Love is but one of the myraid of things that you do after repenting and after loving Him. Otherwise the love would be warped and not in the correct context.</p>

              <p>The problem is that is you are preaching and promising, that Yahweh will be as generous as you say, but how can you guarantee that it will be? Do you want to be responsible for leading someone astray with that teaching? Are you willing to bear that responsibility?</p>

              <p>friend, i have not promised anything. yes, i cannot guarantee anything, that's why if you have read my posts earlier on i'm telling you and the rest of the world, it's okay to have a different opinion and beliefs. i'm not even teaching, i'm just quoting the bible. if you think i'm preaching, it's your opinion and i'm not going to try changing that. </p>
              <p>i'm not going to change your religion for you, i'm telling you and the rest of the world that i'm perfectly fine if you want to be a Taoist, a Buddhist or even a Muslim. i have no distinction because it's your choice and it's your life. i am not even going to shun you if you are a different religion. frankly in my everyday life, i have never used religion as a guide for making friends.</p>
              <p>as i've said, i'm being the most open minded Catholic around here.  </p>

              <p>Just wind back for a minute and think, supposing you were having this conversation with a friend and this certain person heard what you said, would not this person go off with the wrong message in his head? It's too misleading and dangerous to put it across that way.. exactly for that fact that you cannot guarantee that Yahweh will be that generous that you should not speak about this very point.</p>
              <p>Besides, we are not talking about what religion I want to be but the religion that you believe, a religion is only as strong as its followers and if you cannot grasp the basic tenents of your religion, how can you speak about it?</p>

              <p>i must say you are very very wise...</p>
              <p>yes, i sincerely believe that all good men goes to
              heaven irregardless of religion and all sinful men, if
              repented can still enter heaven. i am very convinced that the Lord
              is generous and kind. this is my opinion and you may object but
              again, it's my opinion.</p>
              <p>without His generousity, i would have never met my wife for i
              was a very big sinner then. i committed adultery like no one cared,
              i've committed sins that deserves retribution but the Lord was kind
              enough to allow me to meet my wife who changed my perspectives. He
              gave me opportunities to work and earn enough for a wedding when
              times were bad and my qualifications pretty lame; a diploma in
              info-communications gets you nowhere.</p>
              <p>the Lord was kind and generous in my opinion and though i hate
              to admit it... He watches over me, just like He does to the rest of
              the world.</p>

              <p>Then follow Him and all His ways. Understand who your G_d is and what He requires from you.</p>
              <p>If all good men go to heaven regardless of religion, then we need a definiton of what is good in the sight of Yahweh. If you don't have that definition, then you are just aiming at a moving target and Yahweh is not that wishy washy. He is clear and precise as to what He wants from you and He is the same yesterday, today and forever.</p>
