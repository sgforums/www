              <p>Nowadays got alot of christian parents like to force their kids to go to church when they are still very young.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">because they can't think for themselves and take another transport home, no choice... have to go...</span></p>
              <p>They give alot of self righteous and crap reasons such as the church will teach their children to be good boy/girl lah, it is better for their kids to spend time in church than mix with bad company of friends lah etc etc.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">i think you can teach children to be good and such but if they want to learn bad, what can we do? put it this way; majority of the most notorious crooks are smart kids turn bad... like Madoff. i don't believe his parents taught him bad since young. they gave him good education and he was a good student... his conduct was pretty good but look where he ended up? prison for 150 years...</span></p>
              <p>Think about these poor kids who are so young and innocent and being forced to go to church and get brainwashed into believing christanity.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">at least they have a chance when they grow up... they have to right to choose</span></p>
              <p>When these kids grow up and realise that all these are just bullshit, they decided not to go to church anymore.</p>
              <p> <span style="color: #ff0000;">at least they have a chance when they grow up... they have to right to choose</span></p>
              <p>Than these parents gangup with the church pastors and cell group leaders to try to con their kids to go back to church. These parents come out with alot of lame reasons to try to trick their kids to go back to church like you are backsliding lah, if you don"t go to church GOD will stop blessing you lah etc etc.</p>
              <p> <span style="color: #ff0000;">at least they have a chance when they grow up... they have to right to choose</span></p>
              <p>Haiz. When will these parents grow up? They want to go to church is their own problem lah. Why want to force and brainwash their kids to go to church also?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">this one is understable... they want their kids to follow their footstep...</span></p>

              <p>There are lots of christian teachings that are rubbish.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Such as christians must marry christians. So when a christian can;t find another christian whom he/she love, is he/she suppose to remain single forever?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">up to the Christian lor... if she doesn't want to remain singel, pray harder</span></p>
              <p>Ya and the self righteous christians will continue to live in denial saying craps like the time is not right yet when the time is right you will meet the right girl/guy or it is GOD's will that you should be single and it is for your own good.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">maybe some people are better to remain single; in case they bring harm to others...</span></p>
              <p>Than there is also this self denial crap that you should 10% of your income to GOD and he will multiply it back and give them as blessings to you.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Jesus said, "Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar. Give to God what belongs to God." God never ask for money but more of charity to the poor... if you feed the hungry man that sits outside your house, you are feeding Christ... if you carry a little girl that fell and hurt her knees, you are carrying Christ... if you refuse help to a orphan, you are refusing help to Christ... that my friend; is a bigger sin.</span></p>
              <p>There are still many craps about christanity which I won't even bother to mention about.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If parents just want their kids to learn to be good, I suggest they read books written by Confucius instead of going to church.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Spiderman is pretty good too... Harry Potter is a little too literature but kids who love to read can read them too... lastly, read the bible... got pictorial versions... Hey! wait... there are more; Naruto, Dragon Ball and Bleach. they teach you loyalty, friendship, being good and help the weak!</span></p>
              <p>Nowadays books by Confucius are written in comic style so even children can find it easy to read and understand</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">yeah, bibles too! </span></p>

              <p>but if i'm a father; i will send my kids to Catechism class every sunday until they graduated from "confirmation". if they were to ask me questions about the life of a Christian, i will teach them, "what will Jesus do in your shoes"... i will bring them to mass every week but when they reach 21, i will allow them to make their own choice on religion.</p>
              <p>if they decided to seek another religion, i will wait patiently for them to return to Christianity for i know the Lord will change the hearts of my children eventually. it's all about faith brother.</p>

              <p>my Catechism teacher once told me a story during lesson;</p>
              <p>there were 3 men;</p>
              <p>a farmer, a barber and a rich merchant...</p>
              <p>the farmer is a religious man who gave half of his monthly profits to the poor and the homeless.</p>
              <p>the barber does not believe in God but feed the poor sitting outside his shop and gave free hair cuts to those who could not afford it.</p>
              <p>the rich merchant, a religious man too gave generously to charity.<br><br>one day all 3 died and St. Michael took them back for trial... who ended up in heaven and who did not? those that ended in heaven, who arrived first?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">no one can seriously tell you based on facts and first hand experience that non believers go to hell... and we do not preach that.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">the Lord has a different set of rules for non believers, just like if you are a Police officer and you commit crimes, that is something the judge will not pardon. </span></p>
