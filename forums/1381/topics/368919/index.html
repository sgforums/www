              <p>Nowadays got alot of christian parents like to force their kids to go to church when they are still very young.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They give alot of self righteous and crap reasons such as the church will teach their children to be good boy/girl lah, it is better for their kids to spend time in church than mix with bad company of friends lah etc etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think about these poor kids who are so young and innocent and being forced to go to church and get brainwashed into believing christanity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When these kids grow up and realise that all these are just bullshit, they decided not to go to church anymore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Than these parents gangup with the church pastors and cell group leaders to try to con their kids to go back to church. These parents come out with alot of lame reasons to try to trick their kids to go back to church like you are backsliding lah, if you don"t go to church GOD will stop blessing you lah etc etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
