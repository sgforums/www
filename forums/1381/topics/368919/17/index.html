              <p>Whether i will be forgiven or not is judged by God, not man. And
                  I'm extremely astonished to hear dat u will never believe in Jesus
                  again.</p>
              <p>John 3:16-18?</p>
              <p>God loved the world so much that He gave his only Son, so that
                  everyone who believes in Him may not be lost, but may have eternal
                  life.</p>
              <p>For God sent His Son into the world, not to condemn the world,
                  but so that through Him, the world might be saved.</p>
              <p>No one who believes in Him will be condemn, <strong>but whoever
                  refuses to believe in Him is condemned already, because he has
                  refused to believe in the name of God's only Son.</strong></p>

              <p>just changing names does not change the context in which you understand Yeshua, and it does not change the view which you put across.</p>

              <p>anyway, thanks for supporting my view tat being God's creation dun mean we r His children...i strongly believe tat a r/s is a 2-way thing n a father n child r/s goes more than juz the father loving the son...the son must also accept the father...</p>
              <p>to a child who has ran away from hm, hate his parents n refuse to acknowledge them anymore...can we still consider him having a r/s wif his parents??? his parents may see him as their child but until he achknowledges them, theres no parent-child r/s...he is onli their child in name n theory onli...</p>

              <p>Yes i been a catholic for 30 yrs &amp; i know who my messiah is. I believed in God the Father, the Son &amp; the Holy Spirit. i dun know if u think is this the same as believing in Yahweh, Yeshua &amp; Ruach Hakodesh. Perhaps we went thru different christian teachings since young &amp; therefore u hav had a set of perceptions dat are way different from mine. No one is to say who's right &amp; who's wrong here. I do not know which church u attend in the past but i too believed dat they had taught u a load of crap. But at the end of the day, all mankind are children of Yahweh, our Father in heaven. It's up to the individual to accept this.</p>
              <p>It's certainly nice talking with u &amp; i certainly gain more knowledge with ur sensible arguments rather than wasting my time with some tyrant who only's interested in rolling people over with immature replies.</p>
              <p>Again tks for ur time bro, take care :)</p>

              <p>I will only say this, if you are His child, you will do what He wants you to do, not what the church says He wants you to do. There is a big difference. The churches I have attended in the past are all well known churches, holy spirit, wesley, fcbc, st andrews,  calvary charismatic etc... so if you think they teach crap, how now?</p>
              <p>the point here is not about the church, all I am saying that the church today is not telling the people who have come seeking Yahweh the truth, and instead of leading them to Yahweh, they are leading them away from Him, they teach things against His word, in the wrong context etc... who is this god that the churches teach about??</p>

              <p>exactly, tats my pt...while its also true lah tat humans r diff in tat we r created in His image n tat God breathed life into us, tat still doesnt automatically make all humans his children the moment we r born...</p>
              <p>actually at the beginning, we were suppose to be His children from the day we were born...however, the fall of adam cos humans to be separated from God...from then onwards, anyone who wan to be His child has to acknowledge Him as Father...it is no longer automatic due to the original sin of Adam tat is in us from the day we r born...</p>
