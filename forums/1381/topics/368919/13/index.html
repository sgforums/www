              <p>i gave u a simple answer of my version with regards to
              christianity, nove gave u lengthy answers via quotes from the
              bible. still u are not satisfy. so i presume the problem here
              doesn't lie with our answers. no offence, but u gave me a
              perception dat u are jus stubbornly refusing to accept answers
              dat are spiritually related to God.</p>
              <p>but i do take my hats off u for 1 thing is dat ur arguments are

              <p>my answers may seems "wishy washy" to you and does not have "concrete" strength because i know that we Christians do not have all the answers. i cannot proof whether masturbation is wrong or if life after death = eternal sleep... i can only say in my opinion of 100% conviction (again i stressed, in my opinion) God is generous and merciful. </p>
              <p>if you want answers with proof, i don't think anyone in this age has it. that is also the reason why in my earlier posts, "do not be bothered if Christians condemn anyone, who is a non-believer to hell" don't take it to heart even if they say your religion is satanic because i also cannot say we Christians are 100% right. i believe that God exist, with the angels and saints, with the Virgin Mother because she has answered prayers. (my mother-in law was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. doctor told us 6 months max. we prayed and attended Novena and today she is still alive after 3 years)</p>
              <p>i seriously frankly does not want to know the "dark secrets" the Church has been hiding. what's the point when God has shown His presence to me?</p>
              <p>about what is written in the bible and taught otherwise? yes, i cannot find any text that claim life after death is purgatory or in paradise. you may have found evidence that the bible indicates that after death we are in deep sleep... but how am i to contest this with you when the whole Catholic Church taught that to us? that souls in purgatory requires our help and prayers to purify themselves and enter Heaven? i believe only the priests can answer your questions.</p>

              <p>Nove, don't just keep pushing the responsibility of knowing about your faith to someone else, you have to do the hard yards for yourself, don't rely on what people say is right, for it may not be. The bible encourages us to study and show ourselves approved.</p>
              <p>2Tim2:15</p>
              <p>Be diligent to present yourself <strong>approved</strong> to G_d, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</p>
              <p>Study for yourself so that you can rightly discern the truth. Why find out about dark secrets? So that you can then know the truth and then make an informed decision whether it is right or wrong according to the bible.</p>

              <p>Nowadays got alot of christian parents like to force their kids

              <p>They give alot of self righteous and crap reasons such as the
              church will teach their children to be good boy/girl lah, it is
              better for their kids to spend time in church than mix with bad
              company of friends lah etc etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think about these poor kids who are so young and innocent and
              being forced to go to church and get brainwashed into believing
              christanity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When these kids grow up and realise that all these are just

              <p> </p>
              <p>Than these parents gangup with the church pastors and cell group
              leaders to try to con their kids to go back to church. These
              parents come out with alot of lame reasons to try to trick their
              kids to go back to church like you are backsliding lah, if you

              <p>Haiz. When will these parents grow up? They want to go to church
              is their own problem lah. Why want to force and brainwash their
              kids to go to church also?</p>

              <p>Yup i get it. Though i mentioned religion in general, i have always treat Jesus as my friend/bro/shepherd. I talked to him often in prayer even at work, outside in public. When im angry, sad or happy i will talk to Him &amp; share with Him my feelings &amp; ask Him for guidance. If im lost &amp; helpless, i'll ask Him to let His will be done on me. As sometimes i admit i do not know wat to say to Him at times. This is the relationship u mentioning right? Correct me if im wrong &amp; naive as i believe being humble in life gets me far :)</p>

              <p>Nove, don't just keep pushing the responsibility of knowing about your faith to someone else, you have to do the hard yards for yourself, don't rely on what people say is right, for it may not be. The bible encourages us to study and show ourselves approved.</p>
              <p>2Tim2:15</p>
              <p>Be diligent to present yourself <strong>approved</strong> to G_d, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</p>
              <p>Study for yourself so that you can rightly discern the truth. Why find out about dark secrets? So that you can then know the truth and then make an informed decision whether it is right or wrong according to the bible.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>brey, friend... i'm not pushing away the responsibility but rather... what i've learnt, i've learnt from Father Simon Pereira. he was my Sunday Church teacher and whatever i've said to you comes from him. he is my source of knowledge and my mentor. i've studied the bible many times and somehow, it coincide with my faith and knowledge. yes, there were many questions and unclear message the Lord had written in the bible but if i were to question every ounce of it, what good will it be?</p>
              <p>you asked me to study and discern the truth... friend, maybe you have lot of free time at your disposal but i do not have... and again, do i have the resources to seek the "dark secrets"? are you willing to sponsor my trip to Israel and Egypt or even Italy? you may say i am blinded by facades and lies that does not coincide with the Holy Bible, but again are you so sure of it yourself that your interpretation of "death = eternal sleep" is 100% accurate and true base on the bible.</p>
              <p>i have only one conclusion of why the Catholic Church teaches us that when we die, we enter in Heaven or Purgatory to be cleanse... cos' they have found out from the bible, they have interprete from the bible, based on their deductions and beliefs plus the endorsement of the Pope and the Bishops and whatever authority God has given them and maybe even hints from Mother Mary when she appeared in Fatimah to the 3 children that it is true. you can debate this, you can contest this, i'm not saying you aren't liable to... you have the very right to do so but you asking me to question the teachings of the Catholic Church is akin to in my opinion treachery. call it blind faith, call it self-delusional but frankly, even if Da Vinci Code is true and Jesus married Mary of Magdalene, have a lineage of spawns, i do not care for i have experienced the love of God and the Virgin Mother... i have pleaded for the protection of St. Michael and it was bestowed to me.</p>
              <p>what more do you wish from me then? when to me, facts do not always equal to faith. Science has opened a question for all; why wasn't the dinosaurs indicated in the Holy Bible as Adam and Eve were the first? there was no collection of wild giant beasts but a serpent when dinosaurs came first? when queried, i just shrugged it off because there is no way i can out-talk a scientist and we have factual proof of dinosaurs fossils. in the end, you are using facts on this issue which in my opinion, you are very wise and very academic but then; faith is not based on facts and written history based on a thousand year old text. faith is believing what is unseen and unproven.</p>
              <p>the most debated query of all which is non religious; do ghost exist? can science prove it? i have personally encountered spirits before. my mother was possessed by a spirit before. my sister could see spirits before when she was younger. she told me one lady spirit was walking around the house without the lower part of her body. but can science prove the existence of the supernatural? how many of us wishes to explore and prove the existence in the first place; unless you are paid to do so...</p>
              <p>so end of the day, i do understand your stand that the Bible indicated "this and that", why do the Church teach otherwise. as i've said, they may have interpreted the bible differently from you and i chose to believe them. simple as that.</p>

              <p>brey, friend... i'm not pushing away the responsibility but
              rather... what i've learnt, i've learnt from Father Simon Pereira.
              he was my Sunday Church teacher and whatever i've said to you comes
              from him. he is my source of knowledge and my mentor.
              i've studied the bible many times and somehow, it coincide
              with my faith and knowledge. yes, there were many questions and
              unclear message the Lord had written in the bible but if i were to
              question every ounce of it, what good will it be?</p>
              <p>you asked me to study and discern the truth... friend, maybe you
              have lot of free time at your disposal but i do not have... and
              again, do i have the resources to seek the "dark secrets"? are you
              willing to sponsor my trip to Israel and Egypt or even Italy? you
              may say i am blinded by facades and lies that does not coincide
              with the Holy Bible, but again are you so sure of it yourself that
              your interpretation of "death = eternal sleep" is 100% accurate and
              true base on the bible.</p>
              <p>i have only one conclusion of why the Catholic Church teaches us
              that when we die, we enter in Heaven or Purgatory to be cleanse...
              cos' they have found out from the bible, they have interprete from
              the bible, based on their deductions and beliefs plus the
              endorsement of the Pope and the Bishops and whatever authority God
              has given them and maybe even hints from Mother Mary when she
              appeared in Fatimah to the 3 children that it is true. you can
              debate this, you can contest this, i'm not saying you aren't liable
              to... you have the very right to do so but you asking me to
              question the teachings of the Catholic Church is akin to in my
              opinion treachery. call it blind faith, call it self-delusional but
              frankly, even if Da Vinci Code is true and Jesus married Mary of
              Magdalene, have a lineage of spawns, i do not care for i have
              experienced the love of God and the Virgin Mother... i have pleaded
              for the protection of St. Michael and it was bestowed to me.</p>
              <p>what more do you wish from me then? when to me, facts do not
              always equal to faith. Science has opened a question for all; why
              wasn't the dinosaurs indicated in the Holy Bible as Adam and Eve
              were the first? there was no collection of wild giant beasts but a
              serpent when dinosaurs came first? when queried, i just shrugged it
              off because there is no way i can out-talk a scientist and we have
              factual proof of dinosaurs fossils. in the end, you are using facts
              on this issue which in my opinion, you are very wise and very
              academic but then; faith is not based on facts and written history
              based on a thousand year old text. faith is believing what is
              unseen and unproven.</p>
              <p>the most debated query of all which is non religious; do ghost
              exist? can science prove it? i have personally encountered spirits
              before. my mother was possessed by a spirit before. my sister could
              see spirits before when she was younger. she told me one lady
              spirit was walking around the house without the lower part of her
              body. but can science prove the existence of the supernatural? how
              many of us wishes to explore and prove the existence in the first
              place; unless you are paid to do so...</p>
              <p>so end of the day, i do understand your stand that the Bible
              indicated "this and that", why do the Church teach otherwise. as
              i've said, they may have interpreted the bible differently from you
              and i chose to believe them. simple as that.</p>

              <p>we can argue and argue again about your translation and my beliefs. you can say our Catholic's teaching are wrong but does that does not change my beliefs. as i've said, this will not end; which is frankly boring me a little. you have rights to your beliefs and i have rights to my beliefs. you can say we are evil and cover each others' murder during the middle ages, fine so be it. i'm cool about it. if someone here is going to say we Catholics are actually a satanic cult for believing in Mother Mary, he's obliged to his opinion, which frankly does not affect us at all.</p>
              <p>Shawn Wood of Seacost Church says it best;</p>
              <p>"The problem is that we are spending too much time interpreting the Bible, and not letting it interpret us. The big problem with our understanding of God’s word is not an acedemic issue – it is moral."</p>
              <p>you are here debating with me about the wrongs of our religion. i have no answers to your accusation because the doctrines are held in Italy and again, "the word of God is true"... yes but your interpretation may not be the true meaning God has intended for us... look, it will never end; your views and our views do not meet. you believe whatever what you wish to believe, i have no objections because from the beginning of the whole post, i have told everyone, "<span style="color: #ff0000;">don't be swayed by others' opinions including Christians for you are free to have your own religion and beliefs</span>."</p>
              <p>i seriously advise you to give Father Simon a call if you wish to clarify about the "dead = deep sleep" issue for i'd rather have blind faith than question them. it was written in Catholic "law" that;</p>
              <p>Hence if anyone, which God forbid, should dare willfully to deny or to call into doubt that which We (The Church) have defined, let him know that he has fallen away completely from the divine and Catholic Faith.</p>
              <p>i rather not challenge for i believe in blind loyalty and faith.</p>

              <p>Since there are so many so-called different interpretations of the Bible one complaint often voiced is that everyone has a different interpretation of the Bible. Because many people arrive at varying conclusions when they read the Bible, there is supposedly no way to arrive at a consensus. People point to the variety of denominations as an example that there can be no unanimity among Bible believers.</p>
              <p>This idea neglects to take into account certain facts. The great majority of Bible readers have no problem agreeing on the Bible’s central teachings. Even those who do not believe the Bible to be true have no difficulty whatsoever discerning the main message.</p>
              <p>Within all branches of Christianity, we find the same basic understanding as to what the Bible teaches. They usually accept the same creeds that assert such basic truths as that God made man in His image, with freedom of choice, and that man chose to rebel against God, thus bringing sin into the world. Moreover, God, because of His everlasting love, became a man in the person of Jesus Christ and died a substitutionary death on our behalf, paying the infinite penalty of sin. Men can have their relationship restored with God through placing their faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Bible’s message is clear for those who will read it with an open mind and seek to understand its meaning. The problem comes when people attempt to make the Word fit their preconceived ideas. This is not the fault of the Bible, but of the people who attempt to force the Bible to say whatever they want it to say. Often the disagreement is not so much with the interpretation of the Scriptures, but with the application.</span></p>
