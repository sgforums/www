              <p>Could we dispense with theology differences and just worship God
              and be brothers and sisters to one another?</p>
              <p>In the end we all going to find out the universal truth. None of
              man made theological crap going to matter then anyway. There's only
              God that would prevail the test of time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's not worship our religion or theological principles but
              let's worship God alone. For heaven sake we all could be wrong at
              some points and right at another points. No one really knows for
              sure. I've seen good Catholic priests who are full of the holy
              spirit and I've seen the not so good Ctaholic priest which I quite
              don't like. I've seen good Protestants and likewise I've seen the
              bad ones. If you really believe in one true God then we are all
              bothers and sisters of the same God despite our religion and our
              beliefs.</p>
              <p>Could you imagine saved souls arguing one another about whose
              religion is better in heaven?</p>
              <p>You see my point? </p>

              <p>MP, the problem with your statement is if one wants to worship
              Yahweh, how do we do it, according to what the church teaches us or
              according to what He wants us to do? Problem is a cp full of holy
              spirit, is still a cp... if you get my drift... ultimately what one
              must come to is how Yahweh wants us to worship Him. How He wants us
              to follow Him, not what the church nor any man says about how we
              should follow or worship Him.</p>

              <p>if one is a cp..he cannot be filled with holy spirit...he canonly possess good qualities with God love and therefore spare him from eternal destruction in sheoul...and lovingly correct the cp back into the other fold..</p>
              <p>again you seems to be the only one to understand the point is how humans should worship God according to God's standards and not to some religious leader's standards..</p>

              <p>God sent his only begotten son to clarify matters and witness for him 2000+ years ago..and he knows people through other types of influences will mess things up..but at least his main goal has been achieved..the redemption for humans..</p>

              <p>Bro agreed dat nowadays as christians, we are literally going further away from God in timeline. But i believe as long as we have Him &amp; follow His commandments, He will always remained in our hearts.</p>
              <p>All christians hav obligations to read the bible, but i guess everyone's different so we interprete the bible differently &amp; it can be a dangerous thing if one will to perceive in a wrong manner. So i think this is where bible studies in churches come in handy.</p>

              <p>the bible today is still the same as that which was written in the time of Yeshua, by that I mean the Tenakh is still the same. It is still the same scriptures which are referred to by Yeshua and Shaul etc... so are you really sure you are following the teaching of Yahweh.</p>
              <p>If you not have figured out by now, I have left the church entirely, of every kind and form, I have been through it all and none of the christian churches teach the truth.</p>

              <p>Bro agreed dat nowadays as christians, we are literally going
              further away from God in timeline. But i believe as long as we have
              Him &amp; follow His commandments, He will always remained in our
              hearts.</p>
              <p>All christians hav obligations to read the bible, but i guess
              everyone's different so we interprete the bible differently &amp;
              it can be a dangerous thing if one will to perceive in a wrong
              manner. So i think this is where bible studies in churches come in
              handy.</p>
              <p>But i will always wear holy glasses to see if the 'angel' is a
              fake, &amp; i'll slash him with holy sword to deal higher damage

              <p>Genesis 1:26-27</p>
              <p>God said: Let us make man in our own image, <strong>in the likeness of ourselves</strong>,<strong> </strong>and let them <strong>be masters</strong> of the fish of the sea, the birds of heaven, the cattle, all the wild beasts and all the reptiles that crawl upon the earth.</p>
              <p>"<strong>God created man in the image of Himself</strong>, in the image of God he created him, male and female he created them."</p>
              <p>Read the words in <strong>bold</strong>. Man are of a superior status as to animals &amp; plants because we are created in God's image, so we are God's children &amp; not animals &amp; plants. When u are born, surely u look somewhat like ur parents right? :) so us being God's children are of no redundancy. read the bible first to understand.</p>

              <p>The Catholic Bible retained the books dat were removed a century or two after the Reformation by the Protestants. The books were known as the 'Apocrophya'.
