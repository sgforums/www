              <p>a Buddhist friend once gave me something to ponder...</p>
              <p>how do you know if God was not the creator behind Buddhism?
              how do you know if the reason behind all religions is actually
              a game between God and Satan?</p>
              <p>i have no answer... but when you queried about why God would
              want the priest of another god to enter salvation, this question
              came to my mind.</p>
              <p>i'm not trying to pick a fight or argue back; just something
              that flashed into my mind when i read your post.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Very simple because buddhism is not what is written in the bible. Yahweh is not a G_d of confusion and He is not a G_d of contradiction, for if He did He would not be clear about who He is and what He is about. Something else for you to ponder then.</p>
              <p>The point you make about religions is almost on the mark, but its not a game that Hashem would play, but one hasatan would play with us mortals. G_d does not play games.</p>

              <p>maybe i am wrong, maybe it's just my perception... maybe i'm
              just being silly but i remembered i was told that sinful man can
              still enter the gates of Heaven if he repents at the last minute or
              second.</p>
              <p>we have this thing call last rites for dying men and women... it
              is the last chance for them to reconcile with God before they
              breath their last. it was believed or rather i believed that a man
              may be sinful and may be notorious during the years of his life but
              at the end, before the end he confessed to God during the last
              rites that he was a great sinner and he feels deep remorse for
              the sins he committed. i also remember if he declare
              that he believe that God is the Almighty and he pray
              for salvation earnestly, he will receive grace and he
              shall be allowed to enter the gates of St. Peter.</p>
              <p>or if Heaven does not allow immediate entry, there is a place
              call Purgatory where souls are being purified before entering
              Heaven... so in lame man's term; one can still enter the gates of
              Heaven if one is truly repenten of his sins...</p>

              <p>my reason of choosing Christianity is simple; i was born in a Catholic family and the Lord has shown His presence to me... i mean not literally but by the acts of this world. He has showed me compassion through the works of others and i sincerely believes His existence, again i quote; my opinion.</p>
              <p>my personal opinion of "other gods" defined as idols worshipped by the people of Israel cos' Israel was God's designated land since the times of Abraham and Moses. meaning He was there since Israel was furtile with men or rather, He was the founding God, the first when the people know how to survive. He mentored them and taught them life... so since He was first, how could there be other gods in the Israelis' eyes. the Lord was angry cos' He has shown himself to the people yet they decided to pray to idols later on down the centuries.</p>
              <p>comparing to those born in the Buddhist family. Buddha is their first official god and there shouldn't be any other gods...</p>
              <p>likewise, if i'm the father of my child... i will be pretty angry if my child calls another one father...</p>

              <p>if you read the link; we Roman Catholics believe that Prayer for the dead is one of the greatest acts of charity we can perform. Our prayers help them during their time in Purgatory, so that they can enter more quickly into the fullness of heaven. These prayers are especially suited for offering a novena on behalf of the dead, or for praying during those seasons of the year (November, in the Western Church; Lent, in the Eastern Church) designated by the Church as times of fervent prayer for the faithful departed.</p>

              <p>The bible says that if we seek we will find, so if you are really seeking, then maybe one day you will find, like Shaul (Paul) said be like the bereans who search the scripture to prove that what is being taught is true. So will you search the scriptures to back up what your religion says is true?</p>
