              <p>Yes some translations have been biased and been wrong only because of a lack of understanding of the context and the way of thinking. a greek hellenistic mindset trying to interpret a hebraic mindset would find a lot of conflicting ideas. Just because you were taught in the catholic way does not make it automatically right, I was brought up a taoist, but you would not see me a mile near a taoist temple. That ancient book existied centuries earlier than your catholic church.</p>

              <p>i never said we were 100% right, that's why in my earlier posts i said to all, don't bother too much about what Christians say about other religions or beliefs. live your life freely and to any religion you prefer. the TS was upset that some parents were forcing their child to church... some contested that Christians were too much, the Christians replied condemning all other religion and non believers are condemn to hell.</p>
              <p>i step in and say don't bother too much about what Christians say, they have their beliefs, you have your own... as a fellow Christian, i sometimes feel that we are a little too forceful when trying to convince others which i believe is backlashing the whole Christians' faculty. i suggested they don't take us too seriously when we "condemn" them for it is useless if opinions and beliefs differ.</p>
              <p>why? cos' i know that we do not have all the facts and answers to questions this world pose to us.</p>

              <p>errr. I am one of those singaporeans that have left the country... I really would not know but typically when I graduated, I did a lot of drafting and presentation work for my first boss, did not get to do any design work will about 1.5 years into working? I was only really allowed to do design work after getting registered, this was after 2.5 years. Even then only smaller projects. I currently have my own firm and work for myself. The way the degree course here goes, you will get a masters when you graduate. But seriously, unless you want to become an academic, its really not necessary, I have been working for quite a few years already.</p>

              <p>i gave u a simple answer of my version with regards to christianity, nove gave u lengthy answers via quotes from the bible. still u are not satisfy. so i presume the problem here doesn't lie with our answers. no offence, but u gave me a perception dat u are jus stubbornly refusing to accept answers dat are spiritually related to God.</p>
              <p>but i do take my hats off u for 1 thing is dat ur arguments are so much more sensible &amp; matured.</p>

              <p>so God is behind all religions??so he is know as this and that in this religion while he is known as so and so in that religion so that everyone in different religion starts hating each other and killing each other due to the confusion??God is not a god of confusion..all races of men and women do belong to him whom He bought back with His son's death..</p>
              <p>so after indirectly making an ass out...in your example of a taoist priest,should that guy did good and had certain qualities that moves God then of course he will be given the chance to know God and make a choice to serve his tao or God..</p>
