              <p>Again it depends on which denomination of christianity is the shallow one.</p>
              <p>Sometimes i really wonder if im hard to understand...i meant i chose to remain ignorant on the never ending debates with man but i never said i was remaining ignorant as a disciple of Christ. i keep His commandments &amp; lived the way He wants me to.  - "To love one another as He has loved us" &amp; "to forgive others so in turn we are forgiven." Then at least i hav something to show for on judgement day.</p>
              <p>Bro, my advice from the bottom of my heart - we can lose our beliefs for mankind, but never lose ur faith in God. Hope u find ur faith again someday my bro in Christ :)</p>

              <p>i tink u guys have slightly misunderstood wad i was trying to
              say...when i say tat it makes a r/s wif God redundant, wad
              i meant was if juz being His creation makes us His children,
              then theres no need to acknowledge Him or accept Him into our
              lives. tat would mean tat juz cos God loves us, we automatically
              become His children...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>let me paint a scenario...u love a gal alot n do alot of things
              for her...in ur heart, she is ur beloved...however, she simply
              refuses to acknowledge u as her beloved and detest u for wad u
              do...so is there a r/s btw the 2 of U? since she didnt acknowledge
              u as her bf, is she considered ur gf???</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>lol..ur scenario..strikes so deeply...can feel the hurt...unless the guy also happens to be her dad...</p>
              <p>otherwise..just because he made you doesnt mean you have to acknowledge him..he gave you a choice..gave us all a choice..</p>
              <p>when a person decides to place faith in him and do his will,he is acknowledging God as his God..thus..a solid r/s is formed..he can even be called a fren of God..</p>
              <p>however, when a person forgo this potential end and chose to deny God..God will have to disown him in the end to protect the rest of his children..</p>
              <p>hope u get my drift..</p>

              <p>Again it depends on which denomination of christianity is

              <p>Sometimes i really wonder if im hard to understand...i meant i
                  chose to remain ignorant on the never ending debates with man but i
                  never said i was remaining ignorant as a disciple of Christ. i
                  keep His commandments &amp; lived the way He wants me
                  to.  - "To love one another as He has loved us" &amp; "to
                  forgive others so in turn we are forgiven." Then at least
                  i hav something to show for on judgement day.</p>
              <p>Bro, my advice from the bottom of my heart - we can lose our
                  beliefs for mankind, but never lose ur faith in God. Hope u
                  find ur faith again someday my bro in Christ :)</p>
