              It's the same thing with nurturing patriotism in school to young children. If parents cannot nurture their children on God then the state must not be allowed to nurture patriotism on their children either.

              <p>At the end of the day it's up to the parents to decide what it is to teach their kids... I think it's a joke if the parent is a devout christian, buddhist, muslim, athiest or whatever... and then they make no attempt to influence or even pass on their values and traditions to their kids.</p>
              <p>Ultimately no parent and avoid this duty, like it or not we want our kids to reflect our values and worldviews. The question is of course, if this should be done in a way that restricts their freedom to choose and explore their own questions about life for themselves at the end of the day.</p>
              <p>But no I think it's a big joke if a person is a devout Christian and raises his kid in a totally sterile, Christianity-free environment. The element of choice must be there for the child to eventually make his own choice, but it's another thing to say "hey, I'm a Christian but for the sake of fairness let's raise you the secular humanist way."</p>

              <p>Than these parents gangup with the church pastors and cell group leaders to try to con their kids to go back to church. These parents come out with alot of lame reasons to try to trick their kids to go back to church like you are backsliding lah, if you don"t go to church GOD will stop blessing you lah etc etc.</p>

              <p>hmm..first topic i saw after being away for so long..forcing children to go church..TS sounds so affected by it..when children are young..it is the parents role to try to give them the best..what better choice can there be other than living a godly life??</p>
              <p>however..forcing is wrong..what should be done instead is to educate the kids slowly..so they can make their own decisions..just because they are young dont mean they cant think what is good or bad..its just like baptism at childbirth..did the baby had the right and freewill so treasured by God to choose if s/he wanna go God's way??</p>

              <p>i think all parents would like their children to go through similar life experiences. put it in perspective;</p>
              <p>if i had a good experiece in Singapore's public schools; i would probably not put my child in a international private school even if if i can afford it. i might try to get my child into good reputation top schools like, Raffles, SCGS or St. Joseph, Maris Stella etc</p>
              <p>if i had a good experience when i did my National Service, i will definitely "encourage" my son to be prepared before his enlistment. i would bring him to shops at Changi Village to purchase some stuffs to prepare him for military life and share my secrets of "how to survive N.S"</p>
              <p>if i have a good relationship with God and believes that He watches over me every single day; i will "confirm plus guarantee" bring my child to Church and teach him the essence of the religion. Because i wish my child to bask in God's love and protection; of course i will hope that he follows my religion because of my positive relationship with God and Mother Mary. will i bring my child to Novena? of course, why not?</p>
              <p>we as parents are given the responsibility to "pass down" our knowledge, our beliefs and our experiences to our next generation. but if they wish to choose another path later on, it is our duty to watch over them, not condemn them for they are just like yourself.</p>
              <p>this reminds of my grandfather... before he passed on; "i see my grandfather inside my father and i see myself in my father... what my grandfather knew, he taught my father and my father in turn, taught me whatever he learnt from my grandfather... thus when i become a father, i will teach my son whatever i've learnt from both my grandfather and my father, he will inherit wisdom and experiences from all of us..."   </p>

              <p>At the end of the day it's up to the parents to decide what it
              is to teach their kids... I think it's a joke if the parent is a
              devout christian, buddhist, muslim, athiest or whatever... and then
              they make no attempt to influence or even pass on their values and
              traditions to their kids.</p>
              <p>Ultimately no parent and avoid this duty, like it or not we want
              our kids to reflect our values and worldviews. The question is of
              course, if this should be done in a way that restricts their
              freedom to choose and explore their own questions about life for
              themselves at the end of the day.</p>
              <p>But no I think it's a big joke if a person is a devout Christian
              and raises his kid in a totally
              sterile, Christianity-free environment. The element of
              choice must be there for the child to eventually make his own
              choice, but it's another thing to say "hey, I'm a Christian but for
              the sake of fairness let's raise you the secular humanist way."</p>

              <p>maybe TS just didnt understand that parents usually wants their children to follow what they perceive as good??of course..christianity is always a good target for ridicule thanks to what the church did way back..just like now also always show how the japs invade here and there during WW2..is that not also "attacking" japs..and causing racism against japs?? 1 other reason why christianity is a good target is because they dont send suicide bombers nor do they launch crusades anymore..for now...</p>
              <p>in fact TS thread had made christians felt the agony of general muslims when they were frowned upon becauase of a few jokers..so now christians can understand the feelings of such people..and maybe will not wanna put people of other religions feel bad..is that not the racial/religious harmony crap the government is trying so hard to achieve??</p>

              <p>imagine all these factions as different departments in a company;</p>
              <p>accounts, R&amp;D, sales and marketing and human resource. we are all differently run by the nature of our jobs. sales and marketing have a flexible working hours, they can come in late and leave early to meet clients but accounts have a fixed schedule. R&amp;D may have longer 5 1/2 days work week but they get paid more since they are specialized in their respective fields. you cannot compare the differences between each department (Catholics, Methodist or Jehovah) as the are run different and independently.</p>
              <p>but end of the day, the CEO is God himself... He oversees the company and lead it to greater heights... something like that... there will be managers (priests, pastors) to manage you and me but the BIG decisions is by the Boss himself.</p>
