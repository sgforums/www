              <p>The people who turned against Jesus used to believed in him &amp; listened to his preaches before his sacrifice. But did nothing to stop or rather gang up with the scribes &amp; elders against Him. So are they considered bad christians? or maybe this is jus my perspective, not urs.</p>

              <p>yesh, precisely, the last 12 hours is not the focal point, bad christians are everywhere thats makes it the most hated religion, i mean, bad christians who hates or backstabs jesus....does the rest of the world population even care then? hence your points are all irrelevant...</p>

              <p>Bro honestly, i dun hav an answer u desire for ur 1st
              question. I may hav my own perception but there will be many to
              disagree with me. There r too many variations to the original
              hebrew bible so i believe many are misquoted, again is re-wriiten
              by humans. i believe in God, not humans. At the end of the day,
              religion is about faith &amp; how much u believe.</p>
              <p>To answer ur 2nd question, to me...a good person is someone who
              puts others ahead of himself aka unselfish. But do u agree?</p>

              <p>religion never saved anyone, its not about religion. Yahweh has never been interested in religion. Since there are so many variations, why don't you go back to the original, it has never changed. If I read correctly, you seem to imply that the book that you believe your faith is based on is fallable, then where is the basis of your faith? Who is this G_d that you believe in? So by taking your last line, the reality of G_d is dependent on how much you believe?</p>
              <p>Disagree on the second point as you can still have an unselfish person who is still bad. Too wishy washy.</p>

              <p>yesh, precisely, the last 12 hours is not the focal point, bad christians are everywhere thats makes it the most hated religion, i mean, bad christians who hates or backstabs jesus....does the rest of the world population even care then? hence your points are all irrelevant...</p>
