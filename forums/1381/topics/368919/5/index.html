              <p>catholic are the 1st batch who started the trinity belief...and they call a mortal woman the mom of God..irony they also would say God has no beginning..also, they claim mary is sinless too..another irony is that mary offered a sacrifice for sins after she gave birth to Jesus..hmm...Catholic has endless tales..beautiful,colorful, and dark especially with their rich pagan background..</p>

              <p>Jehovah Witnesses..misunderstood by public..they believe the use of personal name of God is important..would you not wanna know the name of the person you are talking to??they use the name Jehovah because its the most widely accepted english version of the jewish four lettered word of God's name..they do not believe in trinity..do not love war..they published their own bible because they choose to insert the name Jehovah 7000+ times for both old and new testaments instead of using tittles like LORD God which kinda sounded stupid..</p>

              <p>please play with God's name at your own perils...</p>
              <p>like all of us said, the actual pronounciation is lost... only God knows Himself.</p>
              <p>one very good example; Thierry Henry... we pronouce Henry as Henry but the French call is "hawn-ry"</p>
              <p>Jean is either Jean or John...</p>
              <p>even Silvinho is actually Sylvinho based on his own language... so only God knows how to pronounce his own name in his own language. (it is said Heavenly beings speak another kind of language which no mortals can understand)</p>

              <p>please play with God's name at your own perils...</p>
              <p>like all of us said, the actual pronounciation is lost... only
              God knows Himself.</p>
              <p>one very good example; Thierry Henry... we pronouce Henry as
              Henry but the French call is "hawn-ry"</p>
              <p>Jean is either Jean or John...</p>
              <p>even Silvinho is actually Sylvinho based on his own language...
              so only God knows how to pronounce his own name in his own
              language. (it is said Heavenly beings speak another kind of
              language which no mortals can understand)</p>
