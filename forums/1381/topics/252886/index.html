The Sunday-morning faithful Â— a few hundred strong Â— have come to hear the Journey's laid-back pastor, Nelson Searcy, give them the word. The word made film. Searcy, 32, who in jeans and a goatee looks like a way less Mephistophelian Charlie Sheen, is about to deliver the last of the church's eight-part God on Film series. The topic?

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/images2/spiderman3.jpg"><br><br>Best of all, not only does "Spider-Man 3" extol Christian values like sacrifice, forgiveness and love in a setting that resonates with overt Christian metaphors and symbols, it also is a cinematic embodiment of Jesus Christ's statement in John 15:13, "Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends." This is a lesson that both Peter and M.J. learn in "Spider-Man 3." It is also what Jesus does for us on the Cross, so that His death may wash us free of sin and bring us closer to Him and His precious love and joy in the Kingdom of God and Heaven.<br><br><a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=55478" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=55478</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Perspectives: Spider-Man 3 and the dark web of sin</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.onenewsnow.com/2007/05/perspectives_spiderman_3_and_t.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.onenewsnow.com/2007/05/perspectives_spiderman_3_and_t.php</a><br><br>Ripe conditions for sin<br><br>In the initial Spider-Man film, Peter Parker was just trying to make sense of his new abilities while determining what responsibilities went with his "great power." By Spider-Man 2, Parker was struggling with the burden of being a superhero. He was not sure if the benefits outweighed the costs. But as Spider-Man 3 begins, we find Peter at peace. He is beloved in the city, he is getting top grades at school, he has Mary Jane; all is right with the world. In fact, everything's great. Check that -- he's great. It is this shift from healthy introspection to adventures in narcissism that opens Peter up to attack by sin.<br><br>The Apostle James explains the progression of sin. It begins with our own desires, which, if allowed to carry us away, turn into sin, "and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death" (James 1:14-15). Out of nowhere, an asteroid lands near where Peter and MJ are relaxing and fantasizing about their fabulous future. Out of the asteroid, a clearly conscious, black ooze emerges and attaches itself to Peter's scooter -- waiting for an opportune moment to strike. The ooze is a metaphor for the parasitic sin nature -- something foreign in origin that attaches itself to a willing host, conspiring with it to maximize the host's pride and aggression to turn them into arrogance and violence.<br><br>Viewers get a tour through Peter's "pre-ooze" character transformation that turns him into prime target material. He has become a little conceited by his accomplishments, he basks in the city's applause, and he thinks more about himself and ignores Mary Jane -- failing to encourage her when she doubts herself and her abilities. He even cheats on her by giving away their special kiss to a girl he rescued just so he can pump up an already appreciative crowd. And stirring, deep in his heart, are dreams of murderous vengeance against the man who shot and killed his Uncle Ben. When the ooze gets hold of Peter, it doesn't change him -- it merely amplifies the tendencies he has been nurturing on his own.<br><br>Sin is fun<br><br>The ooze looks creepy, at first, but we soon discover its ability to mold itself into very attractive shapes. When it attaches itself to Peter, it mimics his Spider-Man costume, rendering it all in a sophisticated black. Whatever abilities Peter has enjoyed before are enhanced. He becomes more confident, powerful, and dangerous. And it feels good.<br><br>Even after a well-reasoned warning from his Aunt May that his Uncle Ben would not want Peter to go around with vengeance in his heart, Peter loses his struggle against wearing the black suit. Aunt May's prophetic words come true. Vengeance is a poison that can "take us over and turn us into something ugly." But when people are in the grip of the thrill of sin, it is hard to recognize the downside -- often until it is too late.<br><br>In the book of Hebrews we are told that Moses chose a more difficult life rather than giving in to "the passing pleasures of sin" (Hebrews 11:24-26). From this we learn two concepts: first, that Moses was a hero of the faith, and second, that sin is pleasant -- at least, for awhile. After all, if sin wasn't fun, no one would do it. Peter initially revels in his new self, not able to see how others perceive him. He puts on new clothes and a cocky swagger, but people are repulsed. He replaces understanding with aggression, mercy with anger, caring with vindictiveness, and responsibility with lawlessness. Peter thinks he has arrived, that he is finally "cool," but he has been taken over by sin and it is actively seeking his demise. All he once valued has fled. He must seek redemption or be lost forever.<br><br>Sin sticks<br><br>What Peter discovers is that the suit, like sin, is not something that can be easily put on and then taken off at will. Early in the film, Peter is able to shed the black suit -- though it calls to him from the closet. But once he has given in to the power, getting out proves more difficult than fighting any other super-villain. The Apostle Paul explains how our relationship with sin develops. At first we submit ourselves to sin, but that sin then makes us its slaves (Romans 6:12-1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. As long as we are compliant to the wishes of sin, there is little initial discomfort. It is only when we fight to get free and to do right that the true nature of the battle before us becomes clear: sin does not easily give up the struggle for our souls (Romans 7:14-25). Peter knows he has to get free, and has enough insight, at least in a sense, to seek out God.<br><br>Sin can be beaten<br><br>It would be too much to expect for a popular film to show Peter having a blatant conversion experience to free him from the ooze. The location of Peter's deliverance, however, is intriguing. After an encounter with an unscrupulous co-worker who begs Peter for forgiveness for doing wrong, Peter (still in the grip of the ooze) tells him, "You want forgiveness? Get religion." So when Peter finally needs to be freed from the ooze, he knows where to go: to a church. I would almost wish that Aslan would cross over to Columbia Pictures from a Walden Media/Disney set and "un-ooze" Peter the way he "un-dragoned" Eustace Scrubb in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. But the imagery of the church bell and the depiction of Peter's desperate wrestling with the ooze suit certainly avoids the appearance of cheap grace. And once he is free there is a washing which is more ritualistic than hygienic.<br><br>Peter has beaten the ooze suit, but sin is not vanquished; it merely looks for another host. And it finds one even more willing to accept its edicts than was Peter. Eddie's transformation into Venom is one of complete submission. Even when deliverance is offered, Eddie rejects it, saying "I like being bad." So even though victory over sin is possible, the film makes it clear that one has to desire to resist and make the effort.<br><br>Past sin toward forgiveness<br><br>Jesus taught His disciples that sinners need to seek and extend forgiveness. And while Spider-Man 3 spends much of its time exploring the nature and effects of sin, it is sprinkled throughout with calls for forgiveness. Peter needs to learn to ask for and accept forgiveness from Mary Jane. Peter also has to learn to forgive those who have wronged him, and he sees a beautiful example in his Aunt May, who rejects the concept of vengeance -- even against the man who murdered her husband. His efforts are not universally welcomed -- that is to be expected -- but it is important for him to extend forgiveness nonetheless. In a film world filled with vengeance-seeking protagonists who slay their adversaries while popping off with edgy, comedic one-liners, the choice of Spider-Man 3's writers to emphasize instead the difficult virtue of forgiveness is particularly praise-worthy.<br><br>It is not my contention that all of the elements of a salvation message, or even the most important ones, are present in Spider-Man 3. There is no real Christ figure -- just the representation of the Church. There is no talk of substitutionary death, and no resurrection. But what is present in Spider-Man 3 is one of the better examinations of the operative nature of sin. And since recognition of sin, and the terrible price it exacts, is the most fitting place to begin a discussion of the Gospel, Spider-Man 3 is likely to be my pick for the most spiritually thought-provoking (and potentially discussion-starting) film of 2007.<br></div>
