You know where they are since you have already read them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> You don't have to read the whole thing all over again.  Sorry if I didn't make this clear enough.<br><br>And I notice that none of us here is good at explaining the doctrines to you.<br>As you can see, every answer is followed by more questions by you.  This shows how poor we are in presenting what we have learnt.<br><br>May I invite you to attend the RCIA class, just for the Rite of Inquiry till the Rite of Cathecumen stage?  Reading from the Catholic website won't tell you much, as you can see it for yourself already.  Let me know which church is convenient for your location and I will help find out the timings and dates for you.  Don't worry.  Nobody is trying to convert you away from where you belong.  Like what Paul Martin says "The right place to go for information about Catholic belief, in fact the only place to go for complete and authoritative information, is the Catholic Church herself." not Sgforums.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Over here, we can only do so much which is proven to be insufficient to quench your thirst for more information  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>In the meantime, please show us the keypoints of what you have read.
