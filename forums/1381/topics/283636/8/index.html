            <div class='col-md body'>It was a very distressing moment about 2 hours ago. I received an urgent call from my mother to inform me that my father has contracted stomach cancer and is admitted to hospice on his terminal stage. He approached my sister who came back from Australia some time back and informed her he's terminally ill. But with his history, I didn't believe. I will never expect that this time he was telling the truth. After advises from 1 of the 2 persons who converted my belief to Christianity in 2001, I decided to go and see him. The 1st time we're meeting in 4 years.<br><br>He hasn't been a nice guy in his close to 6 decades of life. And a dangerous person to associate with. For he is the sort who will lie his way to take advantage of people. He assaulted my mother many times and lied and feigned pity when the police were finally involved. Then fully knowing I will call the cops again he refrained from hitting her during my presence. But after I moved out, he made his final assault which caused my mother some mildly worrying physical pain. She consulted the doctor and casually revealed she was assaulted but events that followed led her to apply for PPO. When the court order was passed, he applied for divorce. All these happened about a year plus ago. The process took about 1 year. Even in court, he had the audacity to lie repeatedly. When the judge wanted both of them to pen down the 2 children's particulars, highest education, current employment status. Leaving the rest blank, he could only get the 2 names right. And it was mis-spelt.<br><br>When I reached the hospice, the deacon who knew my dad since kids told me to not to say much but let him know I forgave him. Having a stained life under his hegemony, many will assume I still hold against him. But I am too sinful to pick up the 1st stone and throw at another sinner.<br><br>While driving there, I kept praying to God to let me say the right things.<br><br>Before I saw him, I was already mentally prepared about how he will look like. He is only about 60 but looked like he's in his 80s or 90s with balding white hair. An extreme far cry from how he looked like 4 years ago.<br><br>As usual, he tried his signature acts of acting pity on me.<br><br>I was suddenly dumbfounded. But somehow I began to talk and drilled the 4 messages clearly to him.<br><br>I told him 4 things:<br>(1) He has reached 60 years, what has he done with his life &amp; how is he going to account to God since he's only steps away.<br><br>(2) I translated 1 Cor 13:4-7 into mandarin<br><br>(3) Jesus said before those without sin may throw the first stone. And I insisted I will not dare to pick up the stone. Hence indicating I will not determine he's right or wrong. Only God can.<br><br>(4) He shall answer for his own deeds to God. He can do whatever he wishes. But if the one picking him up is the devil, no one will pity him.<br><br>Sorry for ranting here. But it was a really distressing period of my life.<br></div>

Fair? nope.</div></blockquote>Have been thinking about this. I realize sometimes Christians have been clouding the issue by playing around with the words 'just' and 'fair'.<br><br>Two issues here actually. One, whether our life on Earth is fair. Two, whether God will be fair to us during judgement.<br><br>Here is JustDroppingBy's post which shows the two issues clearly:<br><br><blockquote>Christian believe that GOD decides where we are being born right?<br>So if i am an African, which GOD had decided that i am to be born there,<br>BUT unfortunately no one told me about GOD and being poor is all i know.<br>Then one fine day, I died not knowing who GOD is.<br><br>Am i going to hell?<br><br>Unfair?</blockquote>Christians have a misguided understanding of justice. Their justice is defined relative to God. God demands justice because of the sins of Man, hence justice need to be served.<br><br>But unbelievers and critics are asking just the opposite - justice relative to Man. What happens if justice is not served on Earth and the evil person even obtain a ticket to Heaven? The famous Hitler Conversion Scenario.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Edit: The Christian understanding of justice mostly revolve around God. Seldom do we hear justice for Man. Which is why many Christians can never seem to understand or appreciate the 10 Commandments. They think if you break a commandment, you are sinning against God.<br><br>On the other hand, Islam differentiates between the two. Islam has the concept of personal sin and national (or communal .. can't remember) sin. Judaism divides the 10 Commandments into two halves, one half deals with our relationship with God, the other half with mankind.</span><br><br>I read about Judaism and Islam. I think their worldview makes more sense. Here is a summary of what I think about their worldview.<br><br>1. Our life on Earth is never fair. God does not deal the same set of cards to everyone, obviously.<br><br>2. HOWEVER God is fair in His expectation of us.<br><br>3. Justice can never be fully served on Earth. Many of our sins go unnoticed; even the greatest sinners like Hitler never get their just desert.<br><br>4. HOWEVER Judgement Day is when justice get served. Even Catholics believe there is purgatory for their own folks.</div>

If u claim tat fairness is subjective, then righteous is also subjective since righteous does not exist if there is no fairness. I can also give an example tat righteous is subjective too when the christians crusaders claimed they r righteous when they slaughter people from other religion. So fairness and justice does not exist and so god still cannot be fair or just ?<br><br>Furthermore, fairness is giving punishment based on deeds and not on race/religion.
