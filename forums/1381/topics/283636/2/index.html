Usually redemption is summarized as "believe/accept and you will be saved".<br><br>I think this is a wrong perspective to take. Why should salvation be conditional upon your belief? No wonder we have the last minute robber or rapist conversion scenario, also known as the Hitler-conversion scenario!<br><br>Notice when we take the above perspective, the emphasis is never on Jesus dying for your sins. Sure, every Christian says Jesus died for your sins, but I say this is just lip service. The emphasis is on you believing Jesus died for your sins. Notice unbelievers seldom or never ask about the guy called Jesus dying for your sins, instead they are more interested in knowing whether last minute conversions are valid. <strong>Everyone is more interested in discussing the ticket to heaven and why some good people just cannot get the ticket, than the reason why God has to die for you in the first place!</strong><br><br>The Cross is further cheapened when we realize the inescapable conclusion that salvation is conditional upon you accepting the gift, than the act of God dying on the cross.</div>

This argument holds that if Jesus actually did pay for everyone's sins, including unbelief, then no one should go to hell.  The counter argument is that people must believe to be saved.  The answer to this is that even disbelief is a sin that has been paid for; therefore, no one should go to hell.  But, since people do go to hell, it is logical to believe that Jesus only bore the sins of the Christians.  The Reformed theologians would say that <strong>though JesusÂ’ sacrifice was sufficient for all, it was not intended for all.</strong></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[quote]5. Attempted Total Refutations<br><br>There are at least three main ways in which one might attempt to show that the argument from evil does not succeed in establishing that evil is even prima facie evidence against the existence of God, let alone that the existence of God is improbable relative to our total evidence. The first appeals to human epistemological limitations; the second, to the claim that there is no best of all possible worlds; and the third, to the ontological argument.<br>5.1 Human Epistemological Limitations<br><br>The most popular attempt at a total refutation of the argument from evil claims that, because of human cognitive limitations, there is no sound inductive argument that can enable one to move from the premise that there are states of affairs that, taking into account only what we know, it would be morally very wrong for an omnipotent and omniscient person to allow to exist, to the conclusion that there are states of affairs such that it is likely that, all things considered, it would be morally very wrong for an omnipotent and omniscient person to allow those states of affairs to exist.<br><br>The appeal to human cognitive limitations does raise a very important issue, and we have seen that one very natural account of the logical form of the inductive step in the case of a direct inductive argument is not satisfactory. But, as I indicated in section 3.5, there is an account that is satisfactory, one that involves a serious use of inductive logic.<br><br>In addition, the appeal to human cognitive limitations does not show that there is anything wrong either with the reasoning that Draper offers in support of the crucial premise in his indirect inductive version of the argument from evil, or with the inference to the best explanation type of reasoning employed in the updated version of Hume's indirect inductive formulation of the argument from evil.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>5.2 The Â‘No Best of All Possible Worlds' Response<br><br>A second way of attempting to show that the argument from evil does not even get started is by appealing to the proposition that there is no best of all possible worlds. Here the basic idea is that if for every possible world, however good, there is a better one, then the fact that this world could be improved upon does not give one any reason for concluding that, if there is an omnipotent and omniscient being, that being cannot be morally perfect.<br><br>This response to the argument from evil has been around for awhile. In recent years, however, it has been strongly advocated by George Schlesinger (1964, 1977), and, more recently, by Peter Forrest (1981) Â— though Forrest, curiously, describes the defense as one that has been Â“neglectedÂ”, and refers neither to Schlesinger's well-known discussions, nor to the very strong objections that have been directed against this response to the argument from evil.<br><br>The natural response to this attempt to refute the argument from evil was set out very clearly some years ago by Nicholas La Para (1965) and Haig Khatchadourian (1966) among others, and it has been developed in an especially forceful and detailed way in an article by Keith Chrzan (1987). The basic thrust of this response is that the argument from evil, when properly formulated in a deontological fashion, does not turn upon the claim that this world could be improved upon, or upon the claim that it is not the best of all possible worlds: it turns instead upon the claim that there are good reasons for holding that the world contains evils, including instances of suffering, that it would be morally wrong, all things considered, for an omnipotent and omniscient being to allow. As a consequence, the proposition that there might be better and better worlds without limit is simply irrelevant to the argument from evil.<br><br>If one accepts a deontological approach to ethics, this response seems decisive. Many contemporary philosophers, however, are consequentialists, and so one needs to consider how the Â‘no best of all possible worlds' response looks if one adopts a consequentialist approach.<br><br>Initially, it might seem that by combining the Â‘no best of all possible worlds' response with consequentialism, one can construct a successful, total refutation. For assume that the following things are true:<br><br>(1) An action is, by definition, morally right if and only if it is, among the actions that one could have performed, an action that produces at least as much value as every alternative action;<br><br>(2) An action is morally wrong if and only if it is not morally right;<br><br>(3) If one is an omnipotent and omniscient being, then for any action whatever, there is always some other action that produces greater value.<br><br>Then it surely follows that it is impossible for an omnipotent and omniscient being to perform a morally wrong action, and therefore that the failure of such a being to prevent various evils in this world cannot be morally wrong.<br><br>Consider an omnipotent and omniscient being that creates a world with zillions of innocent persons, all of whom endure extraordinarily intense suffering for ever. If (1), (2), and (3) are right, then such a being does not do anything morally wrong. But this conclusion, surely, is unacceptable, and so if a given version of consequentialism entails this conclusion, then that form of consequentialism must be rejected.<br><br>Can consequentialism avoid this conclusion? Can it be formulated in such a way that it captures the view that allowing very great, undeserved suffering is morally very different, and much more serious, than merely refraining from creating as many happy individuals as possible, or merely refraining from creating individuals who are not as ecstatically happy as they might be. If it cannot, then it would seem that the correct conclusion is that consequentialism is unsound. On the other hand, if consequentialism can be so formulated that this distinction is captured, then an appeal to consequentialism, thus formulated, will not enable one to avoid the crucial objection to the Â‘no best of all possible worldsÂ’ response to the argument from evil.<br>5.3 The Appeal to the Ontological Argument<br><br>A final way in which one could attempt to show that facts about evil cannot constitute even prima facie evidence against the existence of God is by appealing to the ontological argument. Relatively few philosophers have held, of course, that the ontological argument is sound. But there have certainly been notable exceptions Â— such as Anselm and Descartes, and, in the last century, Charles Hartshorne (1962), Norman Malcolm (1960), and Alvin Plantinga (1974a, 1974b)<br><br>If the ontological argument were sound, it would provide a rather decisive refutation of the argument from evil. For in showing not merely that there is an omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect being, but that it is necessary that such a being exists, it would entail that the proposition that God does not exist must have probability zero on any body of evidence whatever.<br><br>The only question, accordingly, is whether the ontological argument is sound. The vast majority of present-day philosophers believe that it is not, and one way of arguing for that view is by appealing to strengthened Gaunilo-type objections Â— where the idea behind a strengthened Gaunilo-type objection is that, rather than paralleling the ontological argument, as Gaunilo did in responding to Anselm, in order to show that there is an overpopulation problem for reality in the form of perfect islands, perfect unicorns, and so on, one can instead construct versions that lead to mutually incompatible conclusions, such as the conclusion that there is a perfect solvent, together with the conclusion that there is a perfectly insoluble substance (Tooley, 1981). But if the logical form of the ontological argument is such that arguments of precisely the same form generate contradictions, then the ontological argument must be unsound.<br><br>A more satisfying response to the ontological argument would, of course, show not merely that the ontological argument is unsound, but precisely why it is unsound. Such a response, however, requires a satisfactory account of the truth conditions of modal statements Â— something that lies outside the scope of this article<br>6. Attempted Defenses<br><br>In this section, we shall consider three attempts to show that it is reasonable to believe that every evil is such that an omnipotent and omniscient person would have a morally sufficient reason for not preventing its existence, even if one is not able to say, in every case, what that morally sufficient reason might be.[/quote]<br><br><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil/" rel="nofollow">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil/</a></div>
