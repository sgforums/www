A forum is not really a class per se. I am not here to compare whether I have a better understanding of the Bible to, say sillyme, or vince, or ben. Neither do I have the need to fight with you whether you or I are smarter. I can offer my opinions to those willing to listen. But from where you are coming from, anything that is written will end up being another fault finding session by you. I do not challenge your belief or your right to believe. It's your own life. </blockquote>If u r a science teacher, i expect u to have a good foundation of science or a maths teacher to have a good foundation in maths. Nobody is asking whether r u the best of the best, but r u knowledgable enough.<br><br><blockquote>Whether I am qualified enough or not really isn't the issue. This is NOT counselling class. This is a Christian-themed forum, again I say, I (or anyone else) can offer their opinion, but if by offering any opinion, it turns into a flaming session, then there is really no point at all to continue further. No one will change anything other than raising one's blood pressure</blockquote>Since tis is a christian themes forum, u should expect non believers to be in. Other christian forum also face tis issue. Furthermore the mood is amicable. I don't see flaming<br><br><blockquote>Do you, SIS, feel that your questions are answers, or that there is anyone out here capable (or qualified) of answering your questions? Obviously no. So that being the case, why not you consult a priest, or pastor, or father of any church of your choosing? </blockquote>My questions r genuine questions. I expect people who think a lot into the religion to have come out with the answers for the questions. Why not consult it here ?<br><br><blockquote>Because by continuing here, you are either: implying that the Christians here are able to satisfy your need, or by continuing here, it will satisfying your goal to paint Christians into a corner</blockquote>In fact, I expect the christians to come out with reasonble answers so I felt there is a reason why they believe in it. If they have a reasonable answer to it, they will not be pushed into a corner.<br><br><blockquote>So let me ask this question: for folks like yourself, why do you see the need to continue to question Christian doctrine? Sure, your answer will be that you don't see logic in such doctrine.... but shouldn't that be, you also won't see logic in buddhism or islam as well? You almost never enter these forums to pose your questions. Don't you admit that you still do have deep hatred towards Christians? If not, why bother?</blockquote>To be truthful, I find lesser flaws with buddhism because they have a golden clause saying "if u think it is wrong, don't believe in it". I can find out 100 problems with their beliefs and they can just throw them out of the window with no problem at all. I do talk about muslim belief as well. The questions I ask in here can be applied to muslim as well be cause they r similar in many ways.</div>

It's understandable that it would be difficult to try and talk people out of believing in what they believe Trust me, I've tried it. My Christian friends and I have had role-play conversations about what one would do and say to destroy our faith. It never works.<br><br>It's not that Christians don't question. In fact, I think those who are not in for the "Shortcut to salvation" and "Accept God and He'll let you meet hot girls" parts think a lot more. I won't say I think a lot more than the unkers here, but I do my best. "Why does this happen?", "Has God created the Laws of Nature as a means of governing all things in this Universe?", "Why has God given us free choice [read: NOT free will] even if it means it may cut down on His omnipotence?" are questions I tend to ponder daily. Rest assured, I haven't lose faith with the only temporary answers (somewhat like in Science) I have derived from then.</div>

There are many good non believers, Ah Lau, Herzog and Ice are among those. Of course there is the occasional challenge and banter, but none of the name calling associated with, perhaps yourself (in the past) and some of those I rather not care to name.

But looking beyond christianity, you will see that people will still have things to argue about. You can take all the existing arguments in these world and throw them out and soon the people will still find something else to argue about. My fren once said that, if you put a man in a room with a mirror for too long, he will start arguing with himself. Thats a bit exaggerating but i guess the common denominator in all arguments are clear, the ego of humans. I shall not go on liao, or else i would be 'arguing' with you liao hahahaha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

But after some studying, I realize Christianity pales in comparison with Judaism and Islam.<br><br>For example, Christianity preaches that everyone, by default, is hopeless unless he/she has Christ's saving grace. It doesn't matter what you do, or whether you believe in a God or not. The only way is through Jesus.<br><br>On the other hand, Judaism and Islam teach that while everyone is fallen one way or another, none of us is hopeless. Everyone has the potential to fulfill the will of God .. it is whether you want to do it or not.</div>
