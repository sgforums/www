I will probably not say that the concept of salvation as taught by Christianity is absurd but it does not let me make an informed decision by just asking me to believe when good or bad things happen to me.<br><br>Good, will say it's God's work. Bad, will say God's testing me, training or toughening me up. It's like anything goes.<br><br>Then like that how to differentiate between a good or a bad teaching?<br><br>For example, in some scriptures, God kills a lot of ppl but it is explained that it is for the benefit of all. But in human history, how often have we heard military dictators use that logic to wage war against a particular country, a particular race?<br><br>That's why global terrorism is so much feared by governments around the world.<br></div>
