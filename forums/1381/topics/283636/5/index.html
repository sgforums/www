Aren't our objectiveness usually influenced by some form of subjective opinion based on what we experienced?<br><br>Reality is, I think most Christians here have no issue about people not believing in God. Believe (or not believe) whatever you want. No one can prove beyond the shadow of doubt one way or another. So we've always propose to agree to disagree.....<br><br>Nonetheless, we'd have folks like TheGoodEarth coming in calling everybody names and continue to repeat like a broken record over what he believe....<br><br>We believe in the Bible, Muslims in the Koran, and perhaps many atheists believe in Carl Sagan....

I can go onto my deathbed knowing that there is a probabilty of having other intelligent lifeforms, namely aliens, in this universe, even though there may be no evidence uncovered thus far. I don't have a need to make a conclusion if none can be made<br><br>Having an open mind and making decisions are two completely different issues. In order to have an open mind, you need to discern what is real and what is not. It is not being able to come to premature conclusions. Of course you can make a decision regarding whether to believe or to be a christian, but it doesn't mean that you cannot continue questioning its validity.<br><br>Your analogy of a person going up the mountain looking for elephants sounds as if you know everything and that they are the truth, which is typical of christians. Some people are saddled with questions that are left unanswered? So, I guess christians already have all the answers. Or is it that they think they have all the answers? Beliefs are just beliefs, by the way<br><br>If there are many claims to the existence of a monster in Loch Ness, but there being few evidence, do you need to come to a conclusion? If you do, is it necessarily that the Loch Ness monster exists? If you don't, then what kind of logic are you using and why is it different from your application to religion?<br><br>It's true, science and logic are inconclusive on how the universe began. But it doesn't mean that it will forever be unsolved. In the future, there may be advances or new discoveries in science that may bring a conclusion. I guess because science cannot give you a quick solution to the question, you'd rather believe blindly in a dubious solution just to give yourself a peace of mind?<br><br>I am strictly giving my opinion here, but I think many christians take up the religion just to relief themselves of the fear of the unknown and to bring some closure to various issues that they cannot comprehend.<br><br></div>
