The term also refers to the status or condition of those persons who are treated as the property of another person or household. This is referred to as "chattel slavery".<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave</a><br><br>Servant<br>A domestic worker, domestic, or servant is one who works, and often also lives, within the employer's household. Servants are distinguishable from serfs or slaves in that they are compensated, that is, they must receive payment (and, following labour reforms in the 20th Century, benefits) for their work. They are also free to leave their employment at any time, although socio-economic conditions and laws relating to working in a foreign country may make that difficult.<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant</a><br><br>....but i am sure you are more than capable of doing your own research. therefore i believe all you want to for me to write something and you will jump into any loopholes, as per your normal style. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> So households in Singapore employ Filipino maids..... or slaves......???

A forum is not really a class per se. I am not here to compare whether I have a better understanding of the Bible to, say sillyme, or vince, or ben. Neither do I have the need to fight with you whether you or I are smarter. I can offer my opinions to those willing to listen.

This is a Christian-themed forum, again I say, I (or anyone else) can offer their opinion, but if by offering any opinion, it turns into a flaming session, then there is really no point at all to continue further. No one will change anything other than raising one's blood pressure.<br><br>In the first place, I don't usually have QUESTIONS to ask, so I don't need to consult any priest, pastors or fathers.

Obviously no.

Go see a a pastor.... No one individual here can give you the answer that you want.</span><br><br><strong>So let me ask this question</strong>: for folks like yourself, why do you see the need to continue to question Christian doctrine? Sure, your answer will be that you don't see logic in such doctrine.... but shouldn't that be, you also won't see logic in buddhism or islam as well? You almost never enter these forums to pose your questions. Don't you admit that you still do have deep hatred towards Christians? If not, why bother?</div>
