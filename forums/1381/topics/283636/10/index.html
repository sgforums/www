The pharaoh even repented but he made a u-turn eventually. Actually, I read that the author could only explain the pharoah's refusal to submit in spite of the plagues was that God hardened his heart.

Jesus did not die but went straight to Paradise. Allah promised that Jesus will be back with us. Back when?
