              One thing is not to store any porn material in your computer. That's what I've done. That helps quite a bit.

              <p>The requirement is only to stop watching porn, not for carrying on living.</p>

              <p>No. it is not normal for guys to watch porn. the way porn works is to get you addicted. Remember, whatever things we do and are going to do, all things starts from the mind and heart. So it is important to guard your thought life.</p>

              <p>As some advised, remove the sources of temptation.</p>
              <p>Additionally, a change of perspective is required.  The problem is that the materials cause us to view women as sexual objects.  They also emphasise on physical beauty and instant gratification.  This should not be the case.</p>
              <p>Sometimes porn prevents you to have a healthy relationship a the person of the opposite sex.</p>
              <p>Stop viewing women as objects of sexual desire, but be reminded that they are persons that are to be appreciated more than at the physical level.</p>
