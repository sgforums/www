            <div class='col-md body'>If we were to think that way, then we'd probably have to stop watching movies and TV programmes <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>But seriously, I do not see a problem with it.  I like listening to music and listen to all sorts, except grunge, rap and heavy metal.  However, in certain genres of music, sex and violence are often linked to it. Most love songs sings about failed love.  Sometimes we get influenced, emotionally or mentally, by these songs.<br><br>The point is, there are many external influences around us and running away from them is not the solution.  What is important is to have an anchor in God, to be sure and steadfast <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nah... I think that this view is one of those that makes Christianity look like a holier-than-thou religion.<br><br>We live in the world and there is no way we can keep ourselves away from such stuffs. I typically do not have the habit of buy Christian music. My personal view here is (please don't anybody flame me) is that Christian music is solely for worship. I don't understand the need for Christian karaoke. So to me, the context of Christian music to be played is only when one is worshipping God, hence there is a "sacred" connotation to it.<br><br>Pop music? It's like everything that exist out there. I buy CDs, DVDs, clothes, I have hobbies, eat at Thai restaurants with the four-faced buddhas, enjoy my prata at the stores with the crescent and the star. No problemo.....<br><br>I would NOT go chase down a star at HMV, get hysteria at a concert, or follow some pastor's wife turned pop star's every move.<br><br>So... go ahead and listen. Me? I like Sally Yeh, Black Eye Peas, Blue, Eagles and ah-beng sounding Mandarin songs from the 70s.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hummmmm.................<br><br>my personal experience:<br><br>i started limited the amount of secular music i listen to when i was 11. stopped listening to secular music from 14 to 19. i even went as far as to dedicate my guitar playing to only christian music. during this time (and up til today,) i get a headache whenever i listen to certain secluar music. right now i listen to both secular and christain music. Admittedly i do not listen to secular music that is blatantly against God and His ways. I guess the important thing is your walk with God. if something (in this case, music) affects your walk with God and u feel God's prompting to stop, then do so.<br><br>hope my nonsensical blabbering helped :mgreen:</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For every christian song I listen to, I listen to 10 secular songs.  In fact, I listen to stuff like Megadeth, Black Sabbath, Slipknot, Nirvana and many others which people denounced as hopeless people, angry people, violent people and dangerous people.<br><br>I started seriously listening to music at the age of 8 or 9 when I bought my first cassette compilation including some Michael Jackson songs. My first idols were AIR SUPPLY haha.  I went on to some cheesy chinese pop songs like Sky Wu etc. At 13, I was introduced to Nirvana and fell in love with them till today. I went on to Guns and Roses and getting not enough of them, I went on to Megadeth, AC/DC, Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden and such.  I was crazy over these bands who wore PVC pants that are so tight that will make u screech because it seems that they are so stylo on stage and girls seem to love them (if u read those stories of groupies offering themselves hehe).<br><br>It went on till I am 17 when I was first introduced to Christ. I accepted Jesus into my life a few mths later in Poly.  That was when I started learning the guitar and singing.  As a christian, I heard many conflicting views about secular music alone, not even talking about heavy metal  or what.  Most say that it is better to stay clear of them. Some say it is ok.  I began to question God about such things, whether as christians, do we have to go to such extremes? Is God such a God?<br><br>At this point of time, I also got into the band thing with several christians who are into such rock stuff and this went on for many years. Over the years, I get questioned in church, by friends and family even, that should christians be playing and listening to rock or secular music? Having said that, I am not saying that all my songs are with profanities lah, in fact none of them have lah hehehe.<br><br>To me as a musician, i insist on listening to all sorts of music to improve myself.  Listening to various music improves my imagination in music creation.  I told myself, Hey GOd gave me a gift, I need to work on it.  So i continued to listen to all sorts of music, secular, christian.<br><br>Granted, it is not wrong to say that some music does really glorify suicide, violence, negativity.  But I always challenge people who makes a sweeping statement that "then it is up to us to make a diffference."  The crux is not the music, but the message. If we listen to such music with negative messages and we dun like it, then lets come up with such music with a positive message!  When people listent to Nirvana and Kurt Cobain they say "oh how sad, another pathetic person. Just dun understand what he thinking." When I listen to Nirvana and Kurt Cobain nowadays, I still think and reflect "What a difference it could have been if someone shared about the acceptance and love of God to Kurt."  Where people shunned, I see opportunity.<br><br>Maybe it is because I felt that God called me to such a ministry where I want to use music that is not widely accepted or what we call the sub culture to reach out to youths. Rock music, secular music, i never advocate it is good but i wun say it is bad either. Many things in this world is how you use it, just like the internet.<br><br>For dumbdumb, do not be discouraged if christians seem to tell you that secular music is bad.  Ask yourself, what do you think God is telling you? And also be honest with yourself, when you listen to secular music, do you have an urge to make a difference or do you find urself very influenced by them (e.g. you find glory in violence? or some cheesy love songs make u only think of having a girlfriend all the time? you know what i mean right?) If you are very influenced by them and you realised it, it maybe better to stop.

            <div class='col-md body'>Christian music has evolved due to the hype machine of drawing impressionable young audience. i've heard Chrsitian songs that sounds like trance and some even have the attributes of heavy bass rhytmn used extensively in techno. seriously speaking, i think Australian hillsongs can even be used to compete in Australian Idol. there are even heavy metal christian bands displaying melodic speed metal in their "holy" compositions. imho, the boundaries of "christian music" has been stretch to the extent that it actually sounds secular anyway, so the question should be phrased like "should christians stop listening to music?"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
