              </p><p class="MsoNormal">My Prayers Were Answered</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">After reading around 20 threads, I thought I would start one
              and I hope it would be interesting.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I’m born catholic and am as skeptical about religion as some
              of you are. As humans, we only believe what we see or experience. All we seek
              for is evidence and this evidence does not come to us easily so we choose not
              to believe.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Here’s something I would like to share. I’ve been force to
              pray when I was young. My mom would scold me if I did not pray. Despite being
              forced, I often pray sincerely when I’m doing so and not knowing what to pray
              for, I prayed for height and the prettiest girl in class to love me.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In sec1 I’ve an average class height and there were like 10
              people taller than me in class. Miraculously, my height shot up to 188cm when I
              was in sec 4. Even though I’m not the tallest person in the world, I’m sure
              that prayer was answered. Oh… and the girl that I had a crush on didn’t really
              love me, even if she did I would never know as I didn’t confess to her. But one rare
              incident did happened then involved us. Being a short and unsociable guy in my
              early years, I would be bullied occasionally, thank god there were nerds that
              took the rap most of the time. There was once this bully tried to do something
              and the girl actually stood up for me and shouted at the bully.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">“STOP BULLYING *MY NAME*....(i forgot what she said after that)” she said.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The bully replied “WHY? U LIKE *MY NAME* AR?” the bully
              rebutted.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The girl ignored and went back doing her thing.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">That was the first time the girl actually stood up for
              someone being bullied and I was really touched. Good or bad, I was never
              bullied again and when my height shot up I was the one bullying others -.-</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">This thread is created for those people who pray to share their
              answered prayers. </p>

              <p>sometimes i don't understand why people pray for minor things. minor things have to be handled by yourself. god has better things to do like helping the sick and the poor or preventing the natural disasters from happening and so forth.</p>
              <p>i have friends who pray for good tuition teachers or minor things. sometimes i wonder if god is really that free to look into minor issues like this.</p>
              <p>anyway i always believe god will only help those who help himself.</p>

              <p>Believe it or not, no matter. But I'll share nevertheless:</p>
              <p>Creator/Source/God and Ascended Masters do not respond to prayers that are of selfish or harmful intentions. They are able to 'read' anyone's (regardless of your faith/religion/belief) thoughts, minds and hearts. So even if your spoken words in your prayer sound good in nature, but you actually have ulterior motives behind your prayer or wishes, they know. In fact, they might even lecture you if you're able to communicate with them about such wishes.</p>
              <p>If you pray, for selfish or harmful things, to the deceased or some other beings, from other dimensions, other than Creator/Source/God or Ascended Masters, they might help you within their limited power, but be prepared to pay a price sometime in future, as there's no free lunch for such beings. Sometimes, the price that needs to be paid is much heavier (and even more painful) than what you prayed for, so I personally would not recommend anyone to do it.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, even for prayers of truly good intentions, such as helping a very sick person recover, Creator/Source/God and Ascended Masters may not respond directly if it's required as part of the person's lifeplan and life lessons. However, they may respond indirectly by influencing the people around them to show more care and concern.</p>
              <p>Truth of Life is not as simple, straightforward, logical or scientific as what most people think. :)</p>
