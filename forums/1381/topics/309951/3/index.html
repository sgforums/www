              <p>How is this an answer at all? Let alone a short answer? So WHY did G-D issue this commandment about incest? Gene pool? He felt like it?</p>
              <p> With Cain, GOD had warned him about his anger and premediated murder (upcoming), but he ignored. Clear enuf, that's sin.</p>
              <p>With Lot's daughters, no such warning. The only sin i can attribute to them is that they failed to trust GOD enuf. They didnt trust GOD that He would continue their family line so they took things into their own hand. Technically, they did not sin.</p>
              <p>Grant it to you, if they did sin, Origen says, "<span style="font-size: x-small;">"Where, in all this transaction, can the crime of lust or of incest be proved? How can this be proved to be a <em>vice</em> when the <em>fact</em> was <em>never</em> <em>repeated</em>? I am afraid to speak my whole mind on the subject, lest the incest of <em>these</em> should appear more laudable than the chastity of multitudes." <strong>There is
                  a distinction made here by Origen which is worthy of notice; a single <em>bad act</em>, though a <em>sin</em>, does not necessarily argue a <em>vicious</em> heart, as in order to be <em>vicious</em> a man must be <em>habituated</em> to sinful acts.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Hope this reasoning's not too preposterous for you, you asked a question. I'm just questioning your question.</p>

              <p>The topic is about incest. I'd say that incest was allowed to happen
              until the time of Moses, for a very specific purpose that GOD allowed
              to carry on their family line. This act was only allowed at the early
              stages of history. Until Moses, i'd say that effects of sin have caused
              the gene pool to break down and bring about mutations, such that GOD
              puts a stop to it. </p>
              <p>Is it morally wrong during the time of Lot?
              From our perspective, yes because we live in the time after GOD says no
              more. From the perspective of Lot's daughters then, it's not morally
              wrong if it's to carry on the family line since maybe they thought
              nobody else was around for them to reproduce with and because of the
              effects of having recently come from Zoar.</p>
              <p>But neither is it
              totally right, because there was enough knowledge about good and evil
              then (effects of the fruit that Adam ate?) for them to guess that this
              was morally unacceptable. Is it a common thing? I don't know. Probably
              because other sources outside of bible would talk about Nimrod and his
              mother. Does some sort of law exist back then? Certainly! As Joseph
              declared to Potiphar in Genesis, it is a sin for him to sleep with her.</p>
              <p>Technically, was it a sin for Lot's daughters? No, because
              they thought what they were doing was to repopulate the earth and not
              for the pleasure, and as Origen said, it was a one off incident and not
              meant to repeat again such that it becomes a consistent vice. Is it a
              sin now? Definitely! Because GOD has specifically disallowed it in
              Leviticus.</p>

              <p>Technically, was it a sin for Lot's daughters? No, because they thought what they were doing was to repopulate the earth and not for the pleasure, and as Origen said, it was a one off incident and not meant to repeat again such that it becomes a consistent vice. Is it a sin now? Definitely! Because GOD has specifically disallowed it in Leviticus.</p>

              <p>My friend, 24/7, think harder. =)</p>
              <p>I pose the following questions to you:</p>
              <p>1. Imagine you are the daughter. You think only three of you left in the world .. or is it? If truly you have such virtuous motives [to repopulate the world], why don't you *openly* ask for Lot's cooperation?</p>
              <p>2. The fact you have to take Lot by surprise means you already know Lot is reluctant to cooperate with you. And why should he, if it is a noble task after all? Does it mean Lot is committed to some kind of incest commandment, issued long before Moses?  *hint hint*</p>
              <p>3. On the other hand, what makes you think you are the only three left in the world? If you know the righteousness of your relative Abraham, is it not possible God could have saved him and Sarah as well?</p>
              <p>Of course lah, Lot ä¹Ÿä¸�æ˜¯ä»€ä¹ˆå¥½ä¸œè¥¿. He started to turn bad after parting from the righteous Abraham and moved to Sodom. Kaoz, of all places, he chose Sodom. Granted, he is still good or else the angels won't save him. However Lot is not that holy after all and as the Jewish commentator Rashi pointed out, "Lot knew what had happened the first night with his first daughter and did nothing to avoid the situation with the second daughter."</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Honestly, I'm not sure whether God practised double standards regarding incest. We are like operating on two levels here, commandments and sins. Like you said, no such commandment before Moses. But no commandment doesn't mean no sin because sin means missing the target/expectation of the person. Sin doesn't mean doing something evil, as commonly [mis]understood.</p>
              <p>Incest falls under the general category of sexual immorality. So you'd have sins like adultery and homosexuality inside also.</p>
              <p>The Judaistic perspective is six commandments were given to Adam, one more to Noah, and the seven "social" commandments form the bedrock of civilization. Creation1656 talked about this in this thread.</p>
              <p>So sexual immorality happens to be one of the seven. Granted, the Oral Tradition did not specifically point out incest, but it is included by at least Rambam.</p>
              <p>In my view, the beauty of Judaistic perspective is that sin and mitzvah are separated by a thin line. Nothing is intrinsically evil; even Satan is not considered evil like how he is seen in Christian circles.</p>
              <p>For the case of Lot, while God did not specifically say the act was a sin, the result pretty well says it all. It is like the saying a bad tree cannot produce good fruit. Like the offspring of Esau, Amalek.</p>
