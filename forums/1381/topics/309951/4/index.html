              <p>The Oral Tradition is not silent about whether the prohibition against sexual immorality was given before Moses.</p>

              <p>The problem is how they reconcile the act with the commandment against sexual immorality, given since Adam. If you are Christian, you have no such problem 'cos the prohibition was only given at Sinai.

              <p>I found a creative way around the problem. Looking at the prohibitions for incest, it is possible to avoid committing the "sin" by marrying your cousins. Or, for the case of Cain, marry somebody who is not a descendant of Adam.</p>
              <p>After some poking around, I found out some of the more creative explanation given by Tradition. For instance, somebody said that Cain and Abel each has a twin sister, meant for the other brother, to minimize the effect of incest.</p>
              <p>As with many things found in Tradition, read it with a pinch of salt, for not everything found inside is authoritative, i.e. aggadah.</p>

              <p>This interface is kooky, sometimes it works, some times it doesnt</p>
              <p>Understand
              cousins are left out of the equation, but with A&amp;E, one of their
              children have to marry each other to produce cousins for Cain to marry
              in the first place. Even if Cain and Abel had twins, they still remain
              siblings. Some sources believe that A&amp;E werent the only people
              around. But my POV, is that they were.</p>
              <p>When GOD created
              A&amp;E, he called it 'very good'. Sin entered the picture and the
              effects of His curse were soon felt. Generations of genetic degradation
              meant that by the time Sinai came about, people could no longer have
              close marriages. Also there were more than enough people to around
              anyway. Commandments were given to distinguish Israel from the pagan
              nations around and to put a complete stop.</p>
              <p>There was some law
              going around before Sinai, probably laid down by GOD thru the  Jewish
              Tradition or some other way, such that people could still marry within
              the family out of desperate circumstances.</p>
              <p>To the atheist, yes, GOD allowed incest but for the
              abovementioned reasons. Does GOD practise double standards? Nope, not
              if you understand that this was in His plans. Will it happen again such
              that there won't be anybody around for one to multiply with and he has
              to engage in incest? For everybody's sake, when that time comes, that
              shouldnt be the foremost question on his mind, but why is he left
              behind?</p>

              <p>ok, i'm thinking in a simpler term. we usually tell kids, not to play with power outlets, and we set it as a rule, telling them "it's wrong to play with power outlets"</p>
              <p>the reason is, we know it isn't safe, if not handled properly. there could be accidents and death. but it's pointless telling them how electricity works and how they will die from it. they don't even know the concept of death.</p>
              <p>but as they grow older, they know how to protect themselves, and are now allowed to plug in power etc.</p>
              <p>so is playing with power outlet "wrong" as in simple black or white terms? sometimes we cannot see things that way, there's a reason why at that time, incest was allowed, and then later on, it isn't.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it's not so much "wrong" wrong, but actually it's just bad for us in the long run.</p>

              <p>in the beginning, God created Adam and Eve and told them to re produce,enjoy live and fill the earth with humans. NOTE that God created Adam and eve only..not adam and steve nor was there any john and mary,peter and jane...whatsoever.</p>
              <p>the whole idea was through incest. in Noah's time, again incest was the only way to go.in fact there was at least one more a/c of incest in the bible about 2 dauhters and the father in a cave or something.</p>
              <p>but why incest is punishable by death in the mosiac law? go back to adam n eve time and we noticed they are no longer perfect.every person is born sinful.the same reason why some babies are born with aids. and with this effect, the degradation worsen. God knew that will adversely affect human kind and thus the law for no incest and death to incest lovers.</p>
              <p>hope this answer your qn.</p>
