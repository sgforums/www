            <div class='col-md body'>Overview to Pentecost<br>by Todd Elder<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>In the Scriptures, there is little that compares with the the day known as Pentecost (Shavu'ot). In it we can historically see the One Most High acting in two different ways to make a group of people His own.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>This festival goes by many names and each one shows a different aspect of it. It can be called the Feast of Weeks which represents the 50 day count (7 weeks plus a day) from the wave sheaf offering that helps one arrive at this day on the calendar. It is also known as a Feast of Harvest because it represents the beginning of the wheat harvest for Israel. It is also known in Jewish tradition as the Festival of the Giving of the Torah because on this day the 10 commandments were spoken on Mt. Sinai.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>In the Old Testament Scriptures we read of the Israelites who were recently taken from Egypt and whom have been led to Mt. Sinai. In the scriptural celebration of the day there are not many things to be done. It is considered to be a day of rest when no work should be done. This is also a pilgrimage festival where the men are to go to Jerusalem and offer a freewill offering. A special event of the day is the two loaves of wheat bread that are to be waved before the altar. Many possible explanations exist for what these loaves represent (Jew and gentile, the two witnesses, sinners with leaven in their lives, etc). It is interesting to note that these two loaves were huge. I do not know the exact shape, but they were approximately 12 x 21 x 3 inches in size. In Jewish tradition, it is customary to eat a dairy meal on this day as a reminder of their journey to a land flowing with milk and honey.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Perhaps the most important event of this day was the first time it was observed there at Mt. Sinai. It was at this time that YHVH came to the people of Israel (in the smoke on the mountain) and made a covenant with the Nation of Israel thereby making them His people. The importance of this covenant is witnessed throughout the Scriptures as the history of the Nation of Israel unfolds even into our very age. On a side note, about 3000 people died at Mt. Sinai due to disobedience ... YHVH is a jealous Mighty One and does not take His covenant lightly.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Yet this day has another great significance. About 1500 years later, the Spirit was sent down and a new age began. It is important to realize that it was Messiah Yahshua Himself who sent the Spirit as our Guide and Comforter. What a job the Spirit has done. We are helped continually by the Spirit in our prayeers and in our works and in our lives. The greatest work of all is summarized in the little statement that those who have the Spirit within them are Sons of Elohim. If you don't mind a suggestion, take some time to pray and reflect on that. Going back to the side note from above, is it any coincidence that on the day of Pentecost about 3,000 people were saved?<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>This day has had great meaning in our lives. On it we first received the covenant which makes us a people that belong to YHVH. Later, on this same day, we received His Spirit which makes us Sons of YHVH. We should be thanking Him for all He has done for us, not just on this day but throughout the year. But as this particular day approaches, it would be good for each of us to ask what we are willing to do or give back in return. It is time for a freewill offering, what shall we give?<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>www . thesilvertrumpets . info<br></div>
