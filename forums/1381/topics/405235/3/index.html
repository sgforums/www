              <p><br>Christianality is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not easy</span></strong> too. U see wad happened to Job in the bible? What happened to Job might happen to us. We have to hold on to our faith until we die cannot give up halfway. Christian life is not easy life too.</p>
              <p>But buddhism is very tough in its practises.</p>

              <p>Meditation,chanting buddha name, recitation of sutra are tough too.</p>
              <p>The buddhism 5 precepts are tough too.</p>
              <p>I have tried meditating in dharma centre really very tough. Single minded pointed chanting of buddha name is difficult too. Sutra recitation is tough too. Precepts are difficult too.</p>

              <p>to me, reincarnation is even tougher. if reincarnated in somalia, in africa, life will be tougher than reciting buddha's name and meditation. i strongly believe in reincarnation. a monk told me by reciting buddha's name is enough to get out of the cycle of reincarnation (salvation by works and grace) </p>

              <p>Honestly, I think the bible is not meant for reading from cover to cover. As christians, we know that the bible is written by God and everything. It's like an instruction manual to us. It comes to 'life' when we receive messages from God saying about this particular phrase in the bible and cross reference to our lives. </p>
              <p>I used to learn that when we read the bible we should ask ourselves 3questions; what, why, how.</p>

              <p>to me, reincarnation is even tougher. if reincarnated in somalia, in africa, life will be tougher than reciting buddha's name and meditation. i strongly believe in reincarnation. a monk told me by reciting buddha's name is enough to get out of the cycle of reincarnation (salvation by works and grace) </p>
              <p>see the video clip below which proves reincarnation is real (at least to me) :</p>

              <p>A creationist religion is compatible with a Atheistic religions? Of course not.</p>
              <p>Christianality have God buddhism no God.</p>

              <p>there are more differences than that, stardust...but theres no need to list them all down here...u mean Hasene is female? i didnt noe that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in fact, fairyfairy is already not 100% buddhist cos she believes in good works leading one to heaven and bad works leading one to hell...hwoever, the emphasis of buddhism is not abt heaven and hell...its nirvana...absolute good karma dun get u to heaven, it brings u nirvana...before reincarnation, we dun even go heaven, we go hell to pay for our sins...</p>
