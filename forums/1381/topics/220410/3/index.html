            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Dave, can i give you the standard dispensational principle when studying or reading the Bible?<br><br>This is really an elementary principle to others [especially thoroughgoing dispensational students of the Bible] but here it is anyway:<br><br>While all the Bible was written FOR you, it was not all written TO you, nor was it all written ABOUT you.<br><br>1) It was all written for you. From the Bible we glean principles, instuctions, correction, training for righteousness and etc.<br><br>From the OT we can glean principles and examples of others. We can learn from their mistakes, their exemplary life and etc. Certainly the command to build an ark was not given to you. it was for Noah. But can we glean principles from it? Certainly.<br><br>For example: The position of the majority is not always right. Noah heeded God's voice than heeding the voice of the unbelieving world. May we follow Noah's example. No, not the building of the ark [LOL]......i mean the principle.<br><br>In the NT we can glean direct commands for a Christian.<br><br>pray always. stand fast in the faith. Grow in the grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ and etc.<br><br>2) It was not all written to you. Scripture divides the world into three major peoples [though there maybe other divisions but these are the major distinct divisions that leap out of the pages of the Bible]<br><br>a)Gentiles b) Israel and c) the Church of God.<br><br>You can see that in Romans. First he addresses the case of the Gentiles mostly chapter one starting from verse 18. Then he addresses the Jews or Israelites from chapter 2:17. Then the book as a whole was intended for the Church of God in Rome and to all the churches throughout all the Churh Age till the Lord Raptures His Church.<br><br>These three sets of people God has a special plan. There were directives given to Israel like there were directives given to the Church. Some directives of Israel were given to the Church as well. But this doesn't mean that the Church is Isreal.<br><br>3)It was not all written about you. This is self explanatory. There are things there written about you as a sinner, about you as a redeemed sinner [if you have trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ alone for salvation], about you as a member of the Church of God and etc. But there are also things written there not about you.<br><br>P.s. do not confuse Israel with the Church or mix the two. you will be hopelessly confused. Skeptics who often find "contradictions" in the Bible often fail to distinguish the two. </blockquote>If we use 2 Corinthians 6:14, the verse is written for me? if thats so then why the wrong application?</div>

If u pull in doctrine wise, then it seems tat god is controlling everything in your life, even who u can love. And it is not fair to to say the love between husband and wife is lesser than god because in many instances a husband can sacrifice everything he have, including his life, to help his wife and god wouldn't even lift a finger or a fraction of his omnipotency to help her.</div>

Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Be not yoked.</span> As if regaining his authority, he now reproves them more freely, because they associated with unbelievers, as partakers with them in outward idolatry. For he has exhorted them to show themselves docile to him as to a father: he now, in accordance with the rights that belong to him, reproves the fault into which they had fallen. Now we mentioned in the former epistle what this fault was; for, as they imagined that there was nothing that was unlawful for them in outward things, they defiled themselves with wicked superstitions without any reserve.<br>For in frequenting the banquets of unbelievers, they participated along with them in profane and impure rites, and while they sinned grievously, they nevertheless thought themselves innocent.<br>On this account Paul inveighs here against outward idolatry, and exhorts Christians to stand aloof from it, and have no connection with it. He begins, however, with a general statement, with the view of coming down from that to a particular instance, for to be yoked with unbelievers means nothing less than to<br><br><span style="color: blue;">have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,<br>(Ephesians 5:11,)<br></span><br>and to hold out the hand to them in token of agreement.<br><br>Many are of opinion that he speaks of marriage, but the context clearly shows that they are mistaken.<br>The word that Paul makes use of means -- to be connected together in drawing the same yoke. It is a metaphor taken from oxen or horses, which require to walk at the same pace, and to act together in the same work, when fastened under one yoke.<br>When, therefore, he prohibits us from having partnership with unbelievers in drawing the same yoke, he means simply this, that we should have no fellowship with them in their pollutions. For one sun shines upon us, we eat of the same bread, we breathe the same air, and we cannot altogether refrain from intercourse with them; but Paul speaks of the yoke of impiety, that is, of participation in works, in which Christians cannot lawfully have fellowship. On this principle marriage will also be prohibited, inasmuch as it is a snare, by which both men and women are entangled into an agreement with impiety; but what I mean is simply this, that Paul's doctrine is of too general a nature to be restricted to marriage exclusively, for he is discoursing here as to the shunning of idolatry, on which account, also, we are prohibited from contracting marriages with the wicked.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">For what fellowship.</span> He confirms his exhortation on the ground of its being an absurd, and, as it were, monstrous connecting together of things in themselves much at variance; for these things can no more coalesce than fire and water.<br>In short it comes to this, that unless they would have everything thrown into confusion, they must refrain from the pollutions of the wicked. Hence, too, we infer, that even those that do not in their hearts approve of superstitions are, nevertheless, polluted by dissimulation if they do not openly and ingenuously stand aloof from them.<br><br>gam pei</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MÂ©+square:</div><div class="quote_body">What is the differences in view/vision between believers and non believers?<br>Since not all non believers adopts the same religious values.<br><br>You need to find out the meaning of 'yoke' because 'Yoke' is a weighty term.<br>When you say it does have some connection with marriages, you're not wrong. It depends on the way you interprete contextual wise. Which is why, it is important to clarify your stand before saying a yes or a no to quoting 2 Cor 6:14<br><br>To me, 2 Cor 6:14 is not a anchor verse for this topic(marriage), let alone a sermon topic.<br>But, if a preacher can expound soundly on this verse. Maybe i might listen for awhile.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>_________________________________<br><br>I'll share some insights from John Calvin about 2 Cor 6:14<br><br>14. Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Be not yoked.</span> As if regaining his authority, he now reproves them more freely, because they associated with unbelievers, as partakers with them in outward idolatry. For he has exhorted them to show themselves docile to him as to a father: he now, in accordance with the rights that belong to him, reproves the fault into which they had fallen. Now we mentioned in the former epistle what this fault was; for, as they imagined that there was nothing that was unlawful for them in outward things, they defiled themselves with wicked superstitions without any reserve.<br>For in frequenting the banquets of unbelievers, they participated along with them in profane and impure rites, and while they sinned grievously, they nevertheless thought themselves innocent.<br>On this account Paul inveighs here against outward idolatry, and exhorts Christians to stand aloof from it, and have no connection with it. He begins, however, with a general statement, with the view of coming down from that to a particular instance, for to be yoked with unbelievers means nothing less than to<br><br><span style="color: blue;">have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,<br>(Ephesians 5:11,)<br></span><br>and to hold out the hand to them in token of agreement.<br><br>Many are of opinion that he speaks of marriage, but the context clearly shows that they are mistaken.<br>The word that Paul makes use of means -- to be connected together in drawing the same yoke. It is a metaphor taken from oxen or horses, which require to walk at the same pace, and to act together in the same work, when fastened under one yoke.<br>When, therefore, he prohibits us from having partnership with unbelievers in drawing the same yoke, he means simply this, that we should have no fellowship with them in their pollutions. For one sun shines upon us, we eat of the same bread, we breathe the same air, and we cannot altogether refrain from intercourse with them; but Paul speaks of the yoke of impiety, that is, of participation in works, in which Christians cannot lawfully have fellowship. On this principle marriage will also be prohibited, inasmuch as it is a snare, by which both men and women are entangled into an agreement with impiety; but what I mean is simply this, that Paul's doctrine is of too general a nature to be restricted to marriage exclusively, for he is discoursing here as to the shunning of idolatry, on which account, also, we are prohibited from contracting marriages with the wicked.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">For what fellowship.</span> He confirms his exhortation on the ground of its being an absurd, and, as it were, monstrous connecting together of things in themselves much at variance; for these things can no more coalesce than fire and water.<br>In short it comes to this, that unless they would have everything thrown into confusion, they must refrain from the pollutions of the wicked. Hence, too, we infer, that even those that do not in their hearts approve of superstitions are, nevertheless, polluted by dissimulation if they do not openly and ingenuously stand aloof from them.<br><br>gam pei</div></blockquote>my stand:<br>A wife has to have the same vision/view as the husband for them to get married. Therefore, when the verse says we christians have different view as non christians, i take it to mean that they cannot get married.<br><br>A husband and wife, both christians would hold the same christian value unlike a believer and non-believer together. To yoke would mean going together on the same path or road in life, for that to happen, like i said, there has to be a unified view/vision. The way to achieve that will be to marry a christian rather than with a non-christian.<br><br>I dont quite get the meaning of fellowship, as used in your explaination.<br>the others i roughly agree since i have to admit my english is not good enough for you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As for why i didnt reply your post earlier on,  i didnt have the time to start a passage.
