Does Christianity makes you Legalistic or Compassionate?</div></blockquote>Thank you sir.<br><br>Its hard for me to choose between both. Even as a Christian myself, I am bound by temptations and sinful nature a man would have. I would not escape from any of these clutches even though I have accepted HIM.<br><br>Its through the course of time and through plenty of trials and obstacles that HE gives which will change a person's qualities. As tough as these qualities would be, HE would provide a way out, but that particular assurance never all the time seem clear and most would often fail before they see that way out. But HE is gracious and gives a lot of opportunities for you to get up again from your fall and to cling on to HIM so that you will begin to learn that despite how hard a trial may be or seem to accept for humans, HE is in control. Nevertheless, this statement would always raise a lot of queries and evidence of what the world has been going through that may seem that God is letting it happen without having mercy. That is not within my understanding of explaining further as it takes faith to believe such trials, and since faith is questionable amongst everyone, I shan't detail further.<br><br>Anyway back to your question of whether am I legalistic or compassionate, I would want any Christians want, to be more and more like HIM as on how the four gospels have described of him in the New Testament; compassionate and loving. For HE knows that we are bound to sin and its impossible to cling on to every rule and Word of God, but as HE is gracious, HE is ever willing for you to confess your mistake or sin before HIM through prayer and ask for HIS forgiveness. HE has paid the terrible price of sin by coming to earth to die on the cross for us; the gift of eternal life is free for all to those who chooses to accept HIM. But I urge you that if you do really want to know more about Christianity and have deeper questions about it, that you can refer it to a pastor or a deacon of your nearby church.</div>
