            <div class='col-md body'>How come ah, in nearly over two pages of replies we haven't even really started on the true topic at hand and are instead, making many words about concepts we were already clear to begin with such as befriending?<br><br>Anyway I will try not to add it, but to give my take on the issue... it all boils down to ideas and convictions. Of course the question of if Christian can marry a non-Christian is dependent on several variables. It seems to me then, at the end of the day is how you prioritize your beliefs in your belief system.<br><br>Lets start with the assumption that it is an accepted part of Christian orthodoxy that marrying outside the faith is frowned upon. Let's just start with this and not worry yet about inter-denominational marriages and stuff. Of course if we reject this assumption on grounds that Christian theology has no stand on/allows extra-faith marriages then there is never a question to begin with. But for the sake of an argument, let's assume it says that such marriages are prohibited.<br><br>Going by this assumption, it would mean that a Christian marrying a non-Christian would be going against his beliefs. Usually the justification/argument raised for this is that True Love can overcome all barriers, even that of faithÂ… hence even God's (in the eyes of the Christian) instructions are subject to it.<br><br>However it seems to me that this argument often rests solely on the idea that True Love is a concept that is separate and distinct from the Truth as Christianity sees itÂ… but unfortunately this is not the Christian view on what True Love is. True Love and Christianity are rather inseparable concepts, and usually a flaw of logic is at work when one claims that the other must triumph over the next.<br><br>Of course I stated that not to sound pompous, but however to point out that in the world view of the Christian, True Love only makes sense, and has any real meaning to the Christian when it is viewed and understood in the way through the Christian world view. This is hardly to say that people of different beliefs do not understand True Love, but the idea is that it would be extremely imprecise for a Christian to even think that this thing called "True Love" ought to triumph his faith, for it cannotÂ… it is his faith.<br><br>Of course somebody might point out that if the Christian Faith is True Love, why then this restriction? I might have also to point that this is an incomplete viewÂ… it seems to be the crux of Christian Love is indeed to overcome many kinds of barriers in faith and understanding. Christians are supposed to exceedingly love people of different faiths, walks of live and convictions just like the way Jesus did. However our idea of love has often been restricted to that of the notion of "romance", which is hardly even what True Love is about most of the time.<br><br>The restriction on not marrying non-Christians I believe, comes not from a separatist intention (though it can often be hijacked to be that way), but rather as a guideline to protect both Christians and non-Christians from the dangers of <span style="font-style: italic;">defective</span> love, rather then the excess of it.<br><br>It may be a buzzkill for some people, but it seems to me that sometimes a Christian girl (I use "girl" here because it is guys who frequently make this compliant) might love a non-Christian guy <span style="font-style: italic;">more</span> by being his friend then actually being his girlfriend. And it is because she loves him so that she resolutely refuses to get into a relationship with him, for that would destroy her justification of her love as one that comes from a heart never able to love until the creator showed her how to one that which is more ambiguous and based on shifty logic on how "true" love can overcome allÂ… but that isn't the real True Love.<br><br>Personally it seems to me that if a girl makes Christianity a big part of who she is, as the justification of her being and identity, wanting her to trump or bend who she truly is simply to be with me deducts from who she really is. It may be that many of the attractive things I see in her were born of her faith, and to ask her to suppress her faith to join me would be putting cutting a rose from the stem or taking the pot indoors where there is no sunlight. It looks nice for a while, but it will wilt in the end.<br><br>It seems to me thatÂ… if she's really such a great personÂ… I wonder what makes her so greatÂ… and why so that might be more useful to find out. I don't think we can "get" ladies as if they were prosperities we might find a way into if we knew the right thing to say and the right thing to do. Granted, courtship involves a large part of doing extraordinary thingsÂ… but it must be true to who she isÂ… especially if she treats Christianity as more then just a mere legality or paperwork with rules to find loopholes in.<br></div>

BUT, it is also not right to literally present to another person of passages which you're unclear about.<br>There are certain passages need to be studied carefully before concluding.<br><br>You may wish to re-read what Ironside what typed for you regarding about the bible.<br>I notice your memory always fail you.<br>Let me help, for the last few times.<br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=218342&amp;page=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=218342&amp;page=2</a><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ironside:</div><div class="quote_body">Dave, can i give you the standard dispensational principle when studying or reading the Bible?<br><br>This is really an elementary principle to others [especially thoroughgoing dispensational students of the Bible] but here it is anyway:<br><br>While all the Bible was written FOR you, it was not all written TO you, nor was it all written ABOUT you.<br><br>1) It was all written for you. From the Bible we glean principles, instuctions, correction, training for righteousness and etc.<br><br>From the OT we can glean principles and examples of others. We can learn from their mistakes, their exemplary life and etc. Certainly the command to build an ark was not given to you. it was for Noah. But can we glean principles from it? Certainly.<br><br>For example: The position of the majority is not always right. Noah heeded God's voice than heeding the voice of the unbelieving world. May we follow Noah's example. No, not the building of the ark [LOL]......i mean the principle.<br><br>In the NT we can glean direct commands for a Christian.<br><br>pray always. stand fast in the faith. Grow in the grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ and etc.<br><br>2) It was not all written to you. Scripture divides the world into three major peoples [though there maybe other divisions but these are the major distinct divisions that leap out of the pages of the Bible]<br><br>a)Gentiles b) Israel and c) the Church of God.<br><br>You can see that in Romans. First he addresses the case of the Gentiles mostly chapter one starting from verse 18. Then he addresses the Jews or Israelites from chapter 2:17. Then the book as a whole was intended for the Church of God in Rome and to all the churches  throughout all the Churh Age till the Lord Raptures His Church.<br><br>These three sets of people God has a special plan. There were directives given to Israel like there were directives given to the Church. Some directives of Israel were given to the Church as well. But this doesn't mean that the Church is Isreal.<br><br>It was not all written about you. This is self explanatory. There are things there written about you as a sinner, about you as a redeemed sinner [if you have trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ alone for salvation], about you as a member of the Church of God and etc. But there are also things written there not about you.<br><br>P.s. do not confuse Israel with the Church or mix the two. you will be hopelessly confused. Skeptics who often find "contradictions" in the Bible often fail to distinguish the two.<br></div></blockquote></div>

The married couple/business partner need to share the same basic values and views to make the marriage/business work.<br><br>For example you are running a business with another business partner.  You believe in ethics and integrity but your business partner believes the opposite but just making profit.  Because of the different values, there will be many conflicts between you and your business partner and as a result the whole business will probably fall apart.<br><br>So this is the way I interpret the verse....  it's not talking about the superiority of oneself but it's about sharing the same values in a partnership to minimise conflict.  Please note I mentioned partnership (in marriage) here as it is not the same as friends you're generally hang around.<br><br>Hope that clarifies my view on this.<br></div>
