              <p>Your question is akin to - What is the difference between an Apple and a Fruit. One is the subset of the other.</p>
              <p>Catholicism is a subset of Christianity.</p>
              <p>Christianity can be divided into 2 folds - East and West.</p>
              <p>Western Christianity consist of the Catholic Church, the form of the latin-rite Church, founded in the first century, the Anglican Church who claims to be the CC (branch theory) and the Protestant sects who claims to be the successor of the corrupted CC. The Protestant Sect are made of thousands of denominations consisting of namely the Methodist, Lutherans, Charismatic, Baptist, Pentecostal, Calvinist, Adventist etc. Each has their own teachings and were founded over the last 4 centuries. (Read Martin Luther and the 5 Solas for more information)</p>
              <p>Eastern Christianity consists of the Catholic Church, in the form of the 21 Eastern Catholic Churches, and the Eastern Orthodox Church. They have different philosophies and understanding of basic Christian teachings.</p>
              <p>There also a number of different sects who doesn't adhere to the major doctrines - Mormons, JW etc</p>

              <p>Whatever you choose, why not try both Protestant and Catholic church and see which one you like better.</p>
              <p>Take it easy. Faith needs time to build, one step at a time. Get rid of the bigger sins first and repent, the smaller ones are most likely to be a daily struggle but try to remain faithful. I hope you will find God a living God in your life. Try to love God, literally too. May God give you the kind of peace that is overpowering(if not ask it) and give you His blessings.</p>
              <p>When God gives you his overpowering peace, do not have any attachment to sins, otherwise the peace would be taken away again. God is a gentle and kind God He doesn't require you to be perfect to receive His blessings but you can't have any attachment to sins.</p>

              <p>Anyone well versed in the history of the Roman based Catholic church and the church of the Byzantium which centered on Constantinople?</p>
              <p>Anyway I don't belive that we are saved by joining a particular religion. But we are saved if we do what God commands us to do through Jesus and faith in Jesus.</p>
              <p>Because I don't think God equates to any particular denomination.</p>
              <p>Besides religion can and has been abused so many times in our history. Ya think those were God's will?</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents anyway.</p>

              <p><br>I suggest a reading of patristics or writings of the Church fathers to examine their thoughts on Christian issues. A few of them like St Ignatius below (who was ordained by Peter and a disciple of John) were students of the Apostles.</p>
              <p><em>Let no man do anything connected with the Church without the bishop. Let that be deemed a proper Eucharist, which is [administered] either by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude also be; by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church." Ignatius of Antioch, Epistle to the Smyrneans, 8:2 (c. A.D. 110).</em></p>
              <p>The history of christianity is very important to Christians and more so if you are Catholic since the faith of the fathers (which pays testimony to sacred Tradition) together with Scripture is the rule of faith.</p>

              <p><br>You should revise your Sec 4 mathematics textbook regarding the definition of a subset.</p>
              <p>For Catholicism to be a subset of Christianity, the definition of the term 'Christianity' itself must be certain.  Given that there are around 30,000 non-Catholic denominations in the world that claim to be 'Christian', it is painfully obvious that no one can agree on what 'Christianity' means.</p>
              <p>By definition, something cannot be a subset of another thing which is not defined.</p>

              <p>Hence, my question is why do you believe in the CC NT Canon as opposed to the JW Canon or the Montanist Canon or the Marcionite Canon? And naturally, what did the early Church used as her rule of faith prior the formation of the 27 NT Canon?</p>

              <p>How can you read the Bible ( a collection of book deemed to be
              Scripture by the Catholic Church in the first 3 centuries) 
              while refusing to trust the words of men? This is simply a major
              contradiction.</p>
              <p>It is akin to stating - I only trust Webster's Dictionary
              definition of apple but I will never trust Webster nor the team who
              compiled the dictionary definition of apple.</p>

              <p>When we understand this, we can see how erroneous it is to
              suppose that the corporate church, at some council of its leaders,
              voted on certain documents and constituted them the canon. The
              church cannot subsequently attribute authority to certain writings.
              It can simply receive them as God's revealed word which, as such,
              always has been the church's canon. Authority is inherent in those
              writings from the outset, and the church simply confesses this to
              be the case.</p>

              <p>be it catholics,protestants,Jehovah Witnesses,the so called NT or the greek scriptures is the same.it is not empowered by man to deem it divine.early true christians based their faith in jesus words and also his disciples.until the council of Nicaea and subsequent councils compile the bible.</p>
