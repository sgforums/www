              <p>more juicy bits from the SEX-CAPADES of Catholic
              priests....................you church-goers with young children
              better be careful....................</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reports of priests raping or abusing minors have now emerged in
              Brazil, Bolivia, Uruguay, Mexico and Chile causing growing anger in
              the continent.</p>
              <p>In Brazil an 83-year-old priest was arrested after he was
              secretly filmed in bed with a 19-year-old altar boy. The footage
              was broadcast on national television which led to the arrest of
              Monsignor Luiz Marques Barbosa and two other priests in the state
              of Alagoas who are accused of abusing boys as young as 12
              yrs-old.</p>
              <p>The Catholic Church in Chile confirmed this week that there have
              been 20 alleged or confirmed cases of child abuse by
              priests. </p>
              <p>In Uruguay, a priest charged with raping three children in
              Bolivia had returned to his homeland and was living openly with
              full knowledge of local church officials.</p>
              <p>Juan Jose Santana has been on the run from Bolivian
              authorities since May 2008. Asked if allegations that he had abused
              children were true, Santana said, "It's true. That's all I can
              say... You know something? I'm dead."</p>
              <p>In Mexico, The Legionnaires of Christ, a shadowy but
              powerful Catholic sect founded by Maciel Degollado. It emerged that
              the staunchly conservative theologian had a series of sexual
              affairs with MEN, women and BOYS in many different parts of the
              world.</p>
              <p>The Mexican church has also been drawn into a legal
              battle in the United States. A Mexican citizen is suing Catholic
              cardinals in Mexico City and Los Angeles, accusing them of
              purposely hiding the background of a Mexican priest accused of
              sexually abusing dozens of children.</p>

              it, with full intention to, as they say here, 'troll'.</p>
              <p>Why do you insist on doing that? You accuse people of being

              <p>You are stereotyping extremely not just with respect to church
