              <p>more juicy bits from the SEX-CAPADES of Catholic priests....................you church-goers with young children better be careful....................</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reports of priests raping or abusing minors have now emerged in Brazil, 
                Bolivia, Uruguay, Mexico and Chile causing growing anger in the continent.</p>
              <p>In Brazil an 83-year-old priest was arrested after he was secretly filmed 
                in bed with a 19-year-old altar boy. The footage was broadcast on national 
                television which led to the arrest 
                of Monsignor Luiz Marques Barbosa and two other priests in the state of Alagoas who are accused of abusing boys as young as 
                12 yrs-old.</p>
              <p>The Catholic Church in Chile confirmed this week that there have been 20 
                alleged or confirmed cases of child abuse by priests. </p>
              <p>In Uruguay, a priest charged 
                with raping three children in Bolivia had returned to his homeland and was 
                living openly with full knowledge of local church officials.</p>
              <p class="font-null">Juan Jose Santana has been on the run from Bolivian authorities since May 
                2008. Asked if 
                allegations that he had abused children were true, Santana said, "It's true. That's all I can say... You know something? 
                I'm dead."</p>
              <p class="font-null">In Mexico, The 
                Legionnaires of Christ, a shadowy but powerful Catholic sect founded by Maciel Degollado. It 
                emerged that the staunchly conservative theologian had a series of sexual 
                affairs with MEN, women and BOYS in many different parts of the world.</p>
              <p class="font-null">The Mexican church has also been drawn into a legal battle in the United States. A Mexican citizen is suing Catholic cardinals in Mexico City and Los Angeles, accusing 
                them of purposely hiding the background of a Mexican priest accused of 
                sexually abusing dozens of children.</p>

              <p>The pope is being sued for failing to do anything about priests who used boys under their care for sex.</p>
              <p>A long running series of scandals in
              which US Catholic priests are alleged to have had sex with young boys,
              only to have their crimes covered up by the church hierarchy, has
              resulted in extensive legal action, which now <a href="http://www.sankakucomplex.com/goto/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8638798.stm">targets the pope himself</a>.</p>
              <p>The man at the centre of this case claims he was sexually abused by
              Father Lawrence Murphy, who has been accused of sexually abusing
              hundreds of the boys under his care at a Milwaukee school for deaf
              children in the 1970s. Murphy died in 1998, without facing any official
              action from the church.</p>
              <p>At the time, the church responded to complaints by simply moving the
              priest to another diocese, without pursuing any legal action against
              him or expelling him from the clergy.</p>
              <p>Critics contend such treatment was routine, with priests caught at
              it often going on to pursue their taste for pederasty in new positions.</p>
              <p>Complaints should have been referred to a church body then headed by
              Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who is now Pope Benedict XVI. However, the
              body did nothing and claimed it only heard about the case later.</p>
              <p>The Vatican has called the claims that it knew about the affair but failed to do anything “ignoble,” and denied any wrongdoing.</p>
              <p>The man’s lawsuit, naming the pope and several cardinals, seeks full
              disclosure of all such cases. He is not demanding financial
              compensation.</p>
              <p>Moral improprieties in the Catholic church, particularly pederasty,
              have for over a thousand years been a major area of criticism.</p>
              <p>Theories as to why it is so afflicted range from the church
              recruiting a disproportionately high number of homosexuals to its
              priests being warped by their vows of celibacy; whatever the cause,
              after persisting for so long it seems to have become an accepted and
              deeply ingrained part of Catholic tradition, at least amongst priests.</p>

              <p>You are clearly and blatantly showing gross generilisation and stereotyping again. Moreover very knowingly and consciously doing it, with full intention to, as they say here, 'troll'.</p>
              <p>Why do you insist on doing that? You accuse people of being biased and blind yet you exhibit the very qualities you claim to be against.</p>
              <p>You are stereotyping extremely not just with respect to church goers in general but even just with reference to catholics itself.</p>

              <p>There are concerns about Lee's religious beliefs presenting a threat 
              to <a title="Buddhism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism">Buddhism</a> in Korea. When Lee was mayor of Seoul, he declared the city "a holy 
              place governed by God" and the citizens of Seoul "God's people." He went
               on to dedicate the city "to the Lord." In 2006, Lee also sent a video 
              prayer message to a Christian rally where the worship leader called on 
              God to "let the Buddhist temples in this country crumble down!" Lee 
              reportedly received 80% of Korea's Christian votes.<sup id="cite_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Myung-bak#cite_note-92"><span>[</span>93<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In August 2008, Buddhist monks protested against Lee's pro-Christian

              intensified in South Korea in recent years. Christians have maltreated

              <p>I do not think that is a bad idea and if really any wrong-doing is found, then these people need to answer for what they have done. Be it with God, with the authorities, with the Church or to the people. These people need to answer for what they have done, good or bad.</p>
              <p>However, it would still be wrong to assume the same of all Churches or all Church-goers. Just like how it is equally wrong to assume all muslims are terrorists, or that all Buddhists are vegetarians. To add, not all Buddhists pray to the same God/Gods either.</p>
              <p>And like you yourself know, for some buddhits it's not even about any God or Gods but about how you live your life and how you reflect or look at life. At people around you, and at things in the material world.</p>
              <p>Do not assume that Christians do not know, I have a friend who even considered being a monk and I respected him for it.</p>

              <h3><span>Its in the news, but let me copy a summary from

              <h3><span>Religion</span></h3>
              <p>There are concerns about Lee's religious beliefs presenting a
              threat to <a title="Buddhism" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism">Buddhism</a> in Korea. When Lee was mayor
              of Seoul, he declared the city "a holy place governed by God" and
              the citizens of Seoul "God's people." He went on to dedicate the
              city "to the Lord." In 2006, Lee also sent a video prayer message
              to a Christian rally where the worship leader called on God to "let
              the Buddhist temples in this country crumble down!" Lee reportedly
              received 80% of Korea's Christian votes.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Myung-bak#cite_note-92"><span>[</span>93<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In August 2008, Buddhist monks protested against Lee's
              pro-Christian politics.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Myung-bak#cite_note-93"><span>[</span>94<span>]</span></a></sup> Lee Myung-bak
              and his government have been accused by many Buddhist groups,
              including the influential <a title="Jogye" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jogye">Jogye</a> order, of discriminating against and promoting
              hostility toward Buddhism.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Myung-bak#cite_note-94"><span>[</span>95<span>]</span></a></sup> According to
              Buddhists, Christian persecution of Buddhism has intensified in
              South Korea in recent years. Christians have maltreated and
              humiliated Buddhist laity and monks, burned down temples, and
              vandalized Sutras and devotional items.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Myung-bak#cite_note-95"><span>[</span>96<span>]</span></a></sup> A former pastor
              and presidential secretary showed the government's hostility and
              intolerance toward Buddhism when he compared the protesters against
              religious discrimination to “Satan’s minions.”<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Myung-bak#cite_note-96"><span>[</span>97<span>]</span></a></sup> The
              Buddhist community accepted (Sept 9) President Lee's expression of
