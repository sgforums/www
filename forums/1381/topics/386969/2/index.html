              <p>Yes, indeed there are cases whereby people are
              healed.   As I said, it is according to the will of God,
              if he wants to heal then he will.   I also heard of many

              <p>To get healing there is no checklist, you can't say "oh they christian they never get well haha God is fake" because there is a combination of factors. Non-believers get healed and don't get healed; Believers also get hailed and also don't get healed. It's circumstantial. I know this sounds like a cop-out, but it really depends. Alot of the results are to do with faith - whether you believe in God's healing power or not. But sometimes people are skeptical and still get healed anyway, because God's gracious like that, or He is trying to convict you.</p>
              <p>Of course believing in God doesnt give anyone definite healing or physical immunity, because we're only human. And being weak is only human. It's only that when I believe in God, I have the power to pray illnesses away through faith.</p>
              <p>Sometimes illnesses can't go away merely through prayer though... it depends on the root. Like anger, for instance? If you have a heart disease that is because of hatred, it is likely you'll only be made well after you forgive.</p>
              <p>Just an example. My brother had persistent viral warts on his toes that get growing back. But after he forgave someone he had a grudge against, they never came back. Seems coiincidental right, but it is scientifically proven alot of ailments arise from stress/anger/hatred etc. It's not only airy-fairy faith.</p>

              <p>A book can't cure cancer. You can knock yourself with it, burn it &amp; drink it up, sleep with it everynight, read it 24/7, and you'll just get concussed/infected/terribly bored.</p>
              <p>But faith can heal; faith in the right thing that is.</p>
              <p>The Bible says that "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." - because God keeps his word. So I guess yeah, <strong>indirectly</strong>, this book can cure cancer.</p>

              <p>Actually, you can also say they heal themselves. It's all in your mind.</p>
              <p>Our mind is pretty strong, like we can condition ourselves to endure more than we physically can simply by telling ourselves we can do so.</p>
              <p>It's like faith, if you kept telling yourself God loves you etc you made yourself mentally prepared for almost anything coming your way. Like you got struck by a disease but if you kept yourself from resigning to fate, you will live longer than others who had resigned to fate. You might think it's God healing but I believe our mind is more complex than what we currently know.</p>

              <p>Scientific studies of faith and healing have throughly debunked it, it is strange that you bring it up. In April 2006 there was an experiment conducted on patients, some prayed over, some not. Some knew they were prayed over and some didn't.</p>

              <p>Which scientific study is this? It is not the 1988 study that makes the researcher interested, but because it remains true that many actually hold what I might deem a false belief in the supernatural. An article may not change many minds, but neither do articles like football ones in the papers do anything other than inform. The effect of the article does not contribute to its believability. As for your assertion, what significant proof is there for the validity of the claim? Medical science does not fail, but reaches the limit that is set by our level of knowledge. When Europe was suffering from the black death, did healing by faith play a part? Medical science also was said to have "failed" then, causing the absurd claims of religious trying to advocate a cure. Fools whipped themselves bloody, bled themselves dry etc. Only in the 1930s did sulfonamide drugs become effective treatments. <strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #e0e3ef;"></span></strong></p>

              <p>2. god miracles can be explain in so many ways. But there no solid proof to show these miracles are by god. (trust me..i know many miracles perform by other religion or individual...)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. There so many proof on how god is unreal and those who claim god is real use book as their back-up which is very..^^</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Even if god is real, there no way he can show me he real because of the restrictions and rules...i know "cant take away our free will"</p>

              <p>6. And only true faith toward god can go heaven and for that..i can never do it EVEN if god appear before me..because i will see him as alien with power we never understand..(if u go back to 1900s and can cure cancer..they will see u as god)</p>
