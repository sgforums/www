              <p><strong><span style="color: seagreen;">Just a short history tidbit on how we got our
              Bibles. It had taken nearly 4 centuries before our modern-day Bible
              were accepted by Christians. </span></strong></p>
              <p>Btw I am Christian :) Just sharing more about Christian history.</p>
              <p><br> <strong>New Testament Period (c.35-90)</strong><br> <br> In this period there is little formal sense of a Canon of Scripture<br> <br> <strong>Apostolic Fathers (90-160) </strong><br> <br> Heretic Macion from Rome introduces a NT Canon to back up his Gnostic
              beliefs - 2/3 of Luke and all of the Pauline Epistles except for
              Hebrews.<br> <br> Polycarp first uses all four Gospels now in Scripture. Acts scarcely
              known or quoted. Pauline Corpus generally accepted by 130AD, yet
              quotations are rarely introduced as scriptural. <br> <br> Books not considered canonical: Philippians, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy,
              Titus, Philemon, Hebrews, Clement of Rome, James, Peter, Jude,
              Revelations<br> <br> <strong>Irenaeus to Origen (160-250)</strong><br> <br> Canon: 4 Gospels, Acts, Certain Pauline Epistles, Jude<br> <br> Books not considered canonical: 2 Timothy, Philemon, Hebrews, Revelations<br> <br> <strong>Muratorian Canon 190AD</strong><br> <br> Excludes Hebrews, James, 1 Peter, 2 Peter<br> <br> Includes The Apocalypse of Peter, Wisdom of Solomon<br> <br> <strong>Origen to Nicaea (250-325)</strong> <br> <br> Gospels, Acts, Pauline Corpus Accepted<br> <br> Hebrews accepted in the East<br> <br> Disputed: Revelations, 2 &amp; 3 John, Jude, 2 Peter, James<br> <br> The rest were widely accepted though lack comfirmation.<br> <br> <strong>Council of Nicaea (325)</strong><br> <br> Questions canonicity of James, 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, and Jude <br> <br> <strong>From 325 to the Council of Carthage (397)</strong> <br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Athanasius first lists our present 27 New Testament books as such in 367</span>. Disputes still persist concerning several books, almost right up until 397, when the Canon is authoritatively closed by the Catholic Church.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>It was also determined that besides the Canonical Scriptures nothing be
              read in the Church under the title of divine Scriptures. The Canonical
              Scriptures are these: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy,
              Joshua the son of Nun, Judges, Ruth, four books of Kings, 3 two books
              of Paraleipomena, 4 Job, the Psalter, five books of Solomon, 5 the
              books of the twelve prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezechiel, Daniel,
              Tobit, Judith, Esther, two books of Esdras, 6 two books of the
              Maccabees. Of the New Testament: four books of the Gospels, one book of
              the Acts of the Apostles, thirteen Epistles of the Apostle Paul, one
              epistle of the same [writer] to the Hebrews, two Epistles of the
              Apostle Peter, three of John, one of James, one of Jude, one book of
              the Apocalypse of John. Let this be made known also to our brother and
              fellow-priest Boniface, or to other bishops of those parts, for the
              purpose of confirming that Canon. because we have received from our
              fathers that those books must be read in the Church. Let it also be
              allowed that the Passions of Martyrs be read when their festivals are
              kept.</p>

              <p>There are many such stories but none of them have really been verified. As mentioned, placebo effect is a very real thing that happens in drugs tests often so there is nothing stopping this from being a placebo as well rather than a real miracle.</p>
              <p>Most religions have too many flawed beliefs to be really worth believing in this age of science and technology which has confirmed many findings that contridicts the beliefs of most religions.</p>
