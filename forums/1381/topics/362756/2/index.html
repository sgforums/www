              <p>Miscarriage is nature's way of abortion, and if it fails, man has to personally do it. I am very sorry about your lost of your child but it came to term as it was birthed naturally although early. I have heard of cases of women carrying their dead carcass of unborned child in them for 2 decades.</p>
