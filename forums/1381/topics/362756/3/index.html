              <p>without going into biblical references, technically this line of reasoning fails</p>

              <p>i see every effort from christian to absolve god from responsibility when there is a clear cause and effect from his action, ie the creation of man, the design of man to have choice</p>

              <p>your son can grow up to be a successful businessman but he can also grow up to be a notorious criminal. if he decides to choose the latter does that really mean that you fail as a father? an adult 18 years of age can already make major decisions in his life, he becomes responsible for any of his actions, his parents does not need to be present in a court hearing.</p>

              <p>as if you kid grew up in a lab and apply the economic principle of ceteris paribus, sheesh</p>
              <p>you do intervene in one way or another in his childhood education and moral upbringing, even till adulthood u do interact in some way with your kid, giving advice or discuss with him his marriage, career etc and therefore, you do have some part to be responsible, although not 100% because you dont have capability to intervene fully</p>
              <p>compared that to a god who is omnipotent, who created you in his image and has every cability to intervene, gave you free choice but the choice of one is to suffer eternal hell and damnation</p>
              <p>if god do exist, in court of law, the judges would be more prepared to call god to the stand than parents</p>

              <p>Lol, there is one thing mother teresa and pope john paul did not do and could not do. Jesus die for our sins, and that is what matter. What do you think give mother teresa the push to help the needy? It is written that Jesus is only one man, we[many] can do greater works[not include die for sin].

              <p>Oh the cross, Jesus cry my God my God why have you forsaken me, so that we can cry my father my father thank your for blessing me.

              <p>Thats where you dont make sense. Between someone who "died for our sins" and someone who helped the needy, I'll choose the latter. I am speaking of Mother Teresa in christian context, but in reality, anyone can do it, jesus or no jesus.</p>
              <p>It also doesnt relate to what caroline says about god showing the world we can be like jesus and about choices. If god send a laurence82 and show that we are able to make choices just like him, i'll do it, but not someone with superpowers. Its like telling a disabled guy to run as fast as a national sprinter.</p>
              <p>One thing i realise from christianity discussion is point by point it might make sense, but it doesnt reconcile. Everyone is so way off</p>

              <p>as if you kid grew up in a lab and apply the economic principle

              <p>you do intervene in one way or another in his childhood
              education and moral upbringing, even till adulthood u do interact
              in some way with your kid, giving advice or discuss with him his
              marriage, career etc and therefore, you do have some part to be
              responsible, although not 100% because you dont have capability to
              intervene fully</p>
              <p>compared that to a god who is omnipotent, who created you in his
              image and has every cability to intervene, gave you free choice but
              the choice of one is to suffer eternal hell and damnation</p>

              <p>You do agree that the child may fail once right?Maybe lie to you or something of that genre? Let's say you have a apple at home, you tell your child not to eat it, if he eat it he cannot stay with you anymore. And when he does eat it, and you just ingore the fact that he does and allow him to stay with you. Does that make you a liar? God cannot lie, lying is a sin.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>God's middle name is just, He canot just ingore the fact that adam sin. God cannot ingore your sins, they are all punish on the body of Jesus [this is the love of God].</p>
              <p>At the cross, God's justice and God's love kissed.</p>
              <p>If the court of law, the judge can just sumon God for a hearing, does it make the judge superior to God?</p>
              <p>God don't have to answer for man's sin, man fall, man fault.</p>
              <p>Similarly its not your fault if your child ate the apple, your child fall, your child's fault.</p>

              <p>Thats where you dont make sense. Between someone who "died for
              our sins" and someone who helped the needy, I'll choose the latter.
              I am speaking of Mother Teresa in christian context, but in
              reality, anyone can do it, jesus or no jesus.</p>
              <p>It also doesnt relate to what caroline says about god showing
              the world we can be like jesus and about choices. If god send a
              laurence82 and show that we are able to make choices just like him,
              i'll do it, but not someone with superpowers. Its like telling a
              disabled guy to run as fast as a national sprinter.</p>
              <p>One thing i realise from christianity discussion is point by
              point it might make sense, but it doesnt reconcile. Everyone is so
              way off</p>

              <p>i can get the fact that free choice is a cause of his action and decision, hence why the denial of responsibility?</p>
              <p>do you ever think court of law will let a board of directors get away with mistake they made?</p>
              <p>if he cant stop, i guess he is not omnipotent, or rather, he has 99% of the power perhaps, i need to look for stronger god then</p>
