              <p>i can get the fact that free choice is a cause of his

              <p>do you ever think court of law will let a board of directors get
              away with mistake they made?</p>
              <p>if he cant stop, i guess he is not omnipotent, or rather, he has
              99% of the power perhaps, i need to look for stronger god then</p>

              <p>The reason for his decision is because he don't want to create robots. Robots don't have free choice, human do.</p>
              <p>No the court of law don't let their directors get away with mistake they man, God did not let us get away with the msitake we make as well.</p>
              <p>If God have try to stop adam and eve from taking the fruit it will be not right for him, because he is the one who gave them the free choice, if he take away that free choice at that moment, would'nt make God unfair?</p>
