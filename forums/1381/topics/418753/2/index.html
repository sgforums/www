              <p>Rebirth and karma is not a dogma. People in my forum have remembered their past lives and traced their karmas. It is possible through Buddhist meditation.</p>
              <p>Do know that whatever the Buddha realized, we too can experience it ourselves. None of them is theory. All of them are facts that can be observed.</p>
              <p>Next: No Self is not 'achieved'. It is realized. As I have mentioned before:</p>
              <p><em><br>First I do not see Anatta as merely a freeing from personality 
              sort of experience as you mentioned; I see it as that a self/agent, a 
              doer, a thinker, a watcher, etc, cannot be found apart from the moment 
              to moment flow of manifestation or as its commonly expressed as ‘the 
              observer is the observed’; there is no self apart from arising and 
              passing. A very important point here is that Anatta/No-Self is a Dharma 
              Seal, it is the nature of Reality all the time -- and not merely as a 
              state free from personality, ego or the ‘small self’ or a stage to 
              attain. This means that it does not depend on the level of achievement of a practitioner to experience anatta but <strong>Reality has always been Anatta</strong> and what is important here is the intuitive insight into it as the nature, characteristic, of phenomenon (dharma seal). <br><br>To put further emphasis on the importance of this point, I would like to borrow from the Bahiya Sutta (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/ud/ud.1.10.irel.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/ud/ud.1.10.irel.html</a>)
               that ‘in the seeing, there is just the seen, no seer’, ‘in the hearing,
               there is just the heard, no hearer’ as an illustration. When a person 
              says that I have gone beyond the experiences from ‘I hear sound’ to a 
              stage of ‘becoming sound’, he is mistaken. When it is taken to be a 
              stage, it is illusory. For in actual case, there is and always is only 
              sound when hearing; never was there a hearer to begin with. Nothing 
              attained for it is always so. This is the seal of no-self. Therefore to a
               non dualist, the practice is in understanding the illusionary views of 
              the sense of self and the split. Before the awakening of prajna wisdom, 
              there will always be an unknowing attempt to maintain a purest state of 
              'presence'. This purest presence is the 'how' of a dualistic mind -- its
               dualistic attempt to provide a solution due to its lack of clarity of 
              the spontaneous nature of the unconditioned. It is critical to note here
               that both the doubts/confusions/searches and the solutions that are 
              created for these doubts/confusions/searches actually derive from the 
              same cause -- our karmic propensities of ever seeing things 
              dualistically </em></p>

              <p>gtg for now.. maybe post more later</p>
              <p>oh btw, I don't think Ven Ming Yi is enlightened. At least, I haven't read or found any indications of it.</p>

              <p>This is the reason why the Buddha refused to teach at first:</p>

              <div class="chapter">
              <p>I have heard that on one occasion, when the Blessed One was newly Self-awakened, he was staying at <a id="uruvela" name="uruvela">Uruvela</a> on the bank of the <a id="neranjara" name="neranjara">Nerañjara</a> River, at the foot of the Goatherd's Banyan Tree. Then, while he was 
              alone and in seclusion, this line of thinking arose in his awareness: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> "This Dhamma that I have attained is deep, hard to see, hard to realize,
               peaceful, refined, beyond the scope of conjecture, subtle, 
              to-be-experienced by the wise. But this generation delights in 
              attachment, is excited by attachment, enjoys attachment. For a 
              generation delighting in attachment, excited by attachment, enjoying 
              attachment, this/that conditionality and dependent co-arising are hard 
              to see. This state, too, is hard to see: the resolution of all 
              fabrications, the relinquishment of all acquisitions, the ending of 
              craving; dispassion; cessation; Unbinding. And if I were to teach the 
              Dhamma and if others would not understand me, that would be tiresome for
               me, troublesome for me."</strong></span></p>
              <p>Just then these verses, unspoken in the past, unheard before, occurred to the Blessed One:</p>
              <div class="freeverse">Enough now with teaching
              	what
              	only with difficulty
              	I reached.
              This Dhamma is not easily realized
              by those overcome
              with aversion &amp; passion.
              What is abstruse, subtle,
              	deep,
              	hard to see,
              going against the flow —
              those delighting in passion,
              cloaked in the mass of darkness,
              	won't see.</div>
              <p>As the Blessed One reflected thus, his mind inclined to dwelling at ease, not to teaching the Dhamma.</p>
              <p>Then <a id="sahampati" name="sahampati">Brahma Sahampati</a>, having 
              known with his own awareness the line of thinking in the Blessed One's 
              awareness, thought: "The world is lost! The world is destroyed! The mind
               of the Tathagata, the Arahant, the Rightly Self-awakened One inclines 
              to dwelling at ease, not to teaching the Dhamma!" Then, <a id="strongman" name="strongman">just as a strong man</a> might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm, Brahma Sahampati 
              disappeared from the Brahma-world and reappeared in front of the Blessed
               One. Arranging his upper robe over one shoulder, he knelt down with his
               right knee on the ground, saluted the Blessed One with his hands before
               his heart, and said to him: "Lord, let the Blessed One teach the 
              Dhamma! Let the One-Well-Gone teach the Dhamma! There are beings with 
              little dust in their eyes who are falling away because they do not hear 
              the Dhamma. There will be those who will understand the Dhamma."</p>
              <p>That is what Brahma Sahampati said. Having said that, he further said this:</p>
              <div class="freeverse">In the past
              there appeared among the Magadhans
              an impure Dhamma
              devised by the stained.
              Throw open the door to the Deathless!
              Let them hear the Dhamma
              realized by the Stainless One!
              Just as one standing on a rocky crag
              	might see people
              	all around below,
              So, O wise one, with all-around vision,
              	ascend the palace
              	fashioned of the Dhamma.
              Free from sorrow, behold the people
              	submerged in sorrow,
              	oppressed by birth &amp; aging.<br> Rise up, hero, victor in battle!
              O Teacher, wander without debt in the world.
              Teach the Dhamma, O Blessed One:
              There will be those who will understand.</div>
              <p>Then the Blessed One, having understood Brahma's invitation, out of 
              compassion for beings, surveyed the world with the eye of an Awakened 
              One. As he did so, he saw beings with little dust in their eyes and 
              those with much, those with keen faculties and those with dull, those 
              with good attributes and those with bad, those easy to teach and those 
              hard, some of them seeing disgrace and danger in the other world. Just 
              as in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses, some lotuses — born and 
              growing in the water — might flourish while immersed in the water, 
              without rising up from the water; some might stand at an even level with
               the water; while some might rise up from the water and stand without 
              being smeared by the water — so too, surveying the world with the eye of
               an Awakened One, the Blessed One saw beings with little dust in their 
              eyes and those with much, those with keen faculties and those with dull,
               those with good attributes and those with bad, those easy to teach and 
              those hard, some of them seeing disgrace and danger in the other world.</p>
              <p>Having seen this, he answered Brahma Sahampati in verse:</p>
              <div class="freeverse">Open are the doors to the Deathless
              	to those with ears.
              Let them show their conviction.
              Perceiving trouble, O Brahma,
              I did not tell people the refined,
              	sublime Dhamma.</div>
              <p>Then Brahma Sahampati, thinking, "The Blessed One has given his 
              consent to teach the Dhamma," bowed down to the Blessed One and, 
              circling him on the right, disappeared right there.</p>
