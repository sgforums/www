Instead, let them pursue the healing of the nations!Â”<br><br>They said that the establishment of Â“illegalÂ” settlements and the construction of a wall in the Â“confiscatedÂ” Palestinian Territories Â“undermine the viability of a Palestinian state as well as peace and security in the entire region.Â”<br><br>Christian churches that have remained silent must Â“break their silence and speak for reconciliation with justice in the Holy Land,Â” the four said.<br><br>They committed themselves to non-violent resistance to end the Israeli occupation, affirmed that Israelis and Palestinians can live together in Â“peace, justice and security,Â” and rejected Â“all attempts to subvert and fragmentÂ” the oneness and unity of Muslim and Christian Palestinians.<br><br>Â“All people are created in the image of God,Â” they said, and Â“called to honor the dignity of every human being and to respect their inalienable rights.Â”<br><br>Â“God demands that justice be done,Â” the four religious leaders said. Â“No enduring peace, security or reconciliation is possible without the foundation of justice. The demands of justice will not disappear. The struggle for justice must be pursued diligently and persistently but without violence.Â”<br><br>Â“This is where we take our stand,Â” they said. Â“We stand for justice. We can do no other.Â”<br><br>Â“Justice alone guarantees a peace that will lead to reconciliation with a life of security and prosperity for all the peoples of our land,Â” the Christian leaders stated. Â“By standing on the side of justice, we open ourselves to the work of peace Â– and working for peace makes us children of God.Â” </blockquote><a href="http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=21089" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=21089</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My first reaction on seeing this post is<br>"what the heck is a Christian Zionist?"<br>Did some searching and found a webby on them, so here it is, for the benefit of those who have this same question as me..<br><blockquote><br><a href="http://christianactionforisrael.org/ronning.html" rel="nofollow">THE LAND OF ISRAEL - A Christian Zionist View</a><br><br>By Halvor Ronning, Board Member of the ICEJ<br><br>A long spiritual pilgrimage would be required of most Christians today before they would ever consider calling themselves "Christian Zionists". This is true of the writer who was trained at a seminary where the predominant theology was REPLACEMENT THEOLOGY, i.e., the teaching that the Church has replaced the People of Israel, and that therefore the land of Israel today is no longer theologically significant.<br><br>In contrast, a Christian Zionist is a Christian who looks with favor on the Jewish return to Zion, the city of Jerusalem and the land of Israel, specifically because of the biblical significance of this return.<br></blockquote>*disclaimer: posting this does not means I know about them or support them, just want to answer the question of : who are they?</div>
