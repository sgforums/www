            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Repented John 2:</div><div class="quote_body">The catholics seem to have gone into mysticism &amp; occultism. I talked to a catholic once &amp; she is so mystical. She claims to have seen Mother Mary in heaven, claims many healings in the adoration room, puts pictures of Jesus &amp; Mary &amp; the bible in our workplace &amp; is so religious doing the cross sign(i dunno what you call that-i was doing it the whole of my primary school without being a catholic). Many strange mystical things being done by the catholics even during the masses. They don't preach so much i heard like the protestants. They do more rituals. Catholics also accept the apocryphal books &amp; other extrabiblical books which can be very occultic. I have read some before &amp; very scary like the book of Enoch. Even Jesus as a boy can paralyse people who knocked into Him. They even described hell in detail with all the levels just like the eighteen levels of hell in chinese folklore. They also described heaven with all the levels.<br></div></blockquote>You would not be shocked about healings in the adoration room if you knew who was being adored.<br><br>The celebration of the Eucharist during Holy Mass is a mystery itself.<br><br>What's wrong with mystery? You can't rationalize everything you know.</div>
