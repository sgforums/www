            <div class='col-md body'>Seems like we are now into the subject regarding prayers, and since we were on this, lets have a look at Jesus' response to this subject.<br>here in Luke, the writer wrote Him as saying, when you pray, say this, but in Matthew, it is as, This then is how you should pray.<br>The common part of these is that the address is to the God the Heavenly Father directly. While some may argue that this previledge is accorded only to Jesus, if this is so, why then Jesus himself says, "This, then is how you should pray."?<br><br><blockquote><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jesus' Teaching on Prayer </span><br><br>Luke 11:1-13 (NIV)<br>One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples."<br>He said to them, "When you pray, say:<br>" 'Father,<br>hallowed be your name,<br>your kingdom come.<br>Give us each day our daily bread.<br>Forgive us our sins,<br>for we also forgive everyone who sins against us.<br>And lead us not into temptation.' "<br><br>Then he said to them, "Suppose one of you has a friend, and he goes to him at midnight and says, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread, because a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have nothing to set before him.'<br><br>"Then the one inside answers, 'Don't bother me. The door is already locked, and my children are with me in bed. I can't get up and give you anything.' I tell you, though he will not get up and give him the bread because he is his friend, yet because of the man's boldness he will get up and give him as much as he needs.<br><br>"So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.<br><br>"Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead? Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!"<br></blockquote><blockquote><br>Matt 6:7-15 (NIV)<br>And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.<br>"This, then, is how you should pray:<br>" 'Our Father in heaven,<br>hallowed be your name,<br>your kingdom come,<br>your will be done<br>on earth as it is in heaven.<br>Give us today our daily bread.<br>Forgive us our debts,<br>as we also have forgiven our debtors.<br>And lead us not into temptation,<br>but deliver us from the evil one.' For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.<br><br></blockquote></div>

How do you then justify praying to the saints in the light of all the bible has to say about praying.<br><br>In Luke 11, when Jesus taught the disciples how to pray, He said when you pray, Say Our Father in Heaven...

Even the passage from Revelation, it says if you read it carefully that the angel was given much incense to mingle with the prayers of all the saints, the angel was just given incense to mingle with the prayers, the verse did not say that the angel received our prayers. The prayers were already on the altar before the throne of God. Also who are the saints? WE ARE THE SAINTS, the prayers are prayers of the living saints, not the dead, not saints as in "St. Paul etc", but saints as in the living believers.<br><br>How does "Bless the Lord, O you his angels, you mighty ones who do his word, hearkening to the voice of his word! Bless the Lord, all his hosts, his ministers that do his will!" (Psalm 103:20-21) have anything to do with praying to the saints and angels?

There are things i would like to put forward to you to refute your claims about praying for the dead. But sometimes i make it short because........i have difficulty in writing in English.<br>But do not worry....i will make it as concise as possible. The reason i am writing this also is for the reason that other fellow Christians  who are new in the faith might be instructed not to do these stuff.<br><br>Spiritually speaking they are not dead. the Lord promised eternal life to those who will trust in HIm alone for salvation. But it doesn't mean that they will not die physically.<br><br>Joh 11:25 Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. <strong>He who believes in Me, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">though he may die, he shall live</span>.</strong><br><br>I wonder what would our friend SM would do here if he were there in Thessalonica listening to the letter of Paul as it is being read to them:<br><br>1Th 4:16 "For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>dead in Christ</strong></span> will rise first."<br><br>"NO!!!!!!!!!!!!! Paul. They are not dead. They have eternal life!!!!!!!!!"<br>Would you say that to Paul my friend?<br><br>I hope not because what Paul has said here are the words of the Lord Himself.<br>Move up just one verse before this to verse 15, Paul claims this to be the word of the Lord:<br><br>1Th 4:15 <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>For this we say to you by the word of the Lord,</strong></span> that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep.<br><br>16 For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>And the dead in Christ will rise first.</strong></span><br><br>Do you believe Paul my friend that this very words he wrote were the utterance of the Lord to him? Sure you do.<br><br>God is speaking through Paul: "...........<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and the dead in Christ will rise first</strong></span>."<br><br>What does the Lord call those saints whose hearts have stopped beating?<br>DEAD IN CHRIST.<br><br>Will we see you standing up in that congregation saying: "NO. The saints are not dead Lord.They have etenal life."<br><br>And if you object that these are not saints. That these are just ordinary Christians:<br><br>What about this verse:<br><br>" 1Co 1:2 To the church of God which is at Corinth, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called <span style="font-style: italic;">to be</span> saints</strong></span>, with all who in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours"<br><br>The body of Christ, the Church, are those who are santified in Chist Jesus.<br><br>And what does Paul say about those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus? They are called saints. You see that phrase there "CALLED TO BE SAINTS".<br><br>Actually there should be no 'TO BE'  there.<br><br>one of the reasons why i prefer the NKJV over NIV is because the NKJV italicized words that are not in the original Greek Bible. Italicized words in the NKJV, KJV or NASB tell you that these are not in the original and therefore  not inspired. They are just supplied there by the translators.<br><br>The literal rendering of 1 Corinthians 1:2 is:<br><br>1Co 1:2 "To the church of God which is at Corinth <strong>to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, CALLED SAINTS, </strong> of God which is at Corinth, with all who in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours..."<br><br>Sanctified people are saints. That's the principle we are trying to get here.<br>Sanctified means set apart or separated people. They are separated from the world to God. They are not anymore of the world but they are IN CHRIST whether they live or die.<br><br>All who are IN CHRIST are sanctified people. And the Bible calls those who are sanctified as saints.<br><br>So when Paul says: "the dead in Christ will rise first" he means those saints who have physically died<br><br>What does the Bible say of those who have physically died, saints or not? THEY KNOW NOTHING OF THIS WORLD. OF WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.<br><br>I think i shall stop here...........i will however continue with this next time. i have other things to do. Thanks.<br><br>Ec 9:5 For the living know that they will die; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But the dead know nothing</strong></span>, And they have no more reward, For the memory of them is forgotten.<br><br>De 18:10 "There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, or one who practices witchcraft, or a soothsayer, or one who interprets omens, or a sorcerer,<br><br>11 "or one who conjures spells, or a medium, or a spiritist, or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>one who calls up the dead.</strong></span><br><br>P.S. these are not my words. These are from the Bible. Look and read for yourself. They are plain and easy to understand. God made it plain. He is an excellent communicator.<br><br>take them at face value.<br><br>Granting without conceeding that we are allowed to communicate to the saints and you obeyed those words above. You did not pray to the saints because of those verses.<br><br>By the time you will face judgment you will still have an excuse to God. You can say: "God i did not call upon the saints because Your Word prohibited me. And i understood it at face value. I believed the verses in the Bible that Brey quotetd that Christ alone is our Mediator.............SORRY IF I FOUND CHRIST ENOUGH."<br><br></div>
