And thatÂ’s GodÂ’s Word. The verse doesnÂ’t mean that they have been annihilated or has ceased to exist forever.  That is clear in the concluding portion of the book [12:14], they will yet have to face judgment. It is also clear in other portions of GODÂ’S WORD that the departed ones does not soul-sleep or cease to exist. The soul of the departed is conscious either in Hades or heaven.<br><br>[Of course, no one is to build his theology based <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>solely</strong></span> on the book of Ecclesiastes since it is a book of horinzontal outlook, a book looking primarily from an "under the sun" perspective, but portions of other Scriptures tell us which is doctrinal in this book or not]<br><br>2)	What this portion of GODÂ’S WORD is telling us however is that the departed ones 	have no knowledge of whatÂ’s happening here on earth. They canÂ’t hear your 	prayers and etc. Death disrupts their interaction with our world.<br><br>In advance I woud like to posit the case of Samuel appearing to Saul, in case someone will use this event in the Bible to justify calling up the dead and that they can hear us here:<br><br>others advance Samuel's apparation to Saul to refute that the dead cannot hear what's taking place here. But that portion is highly debatable as to whether it was really Samuel who appeared to Saul during that instance or a demonic spirit seeking to decieve Saul. Evidence though strongly indicate that it was a demonic spirit who appeared to Saul and not Samuel.<br><br>1 Chronicles helps us interpret that episode of "Samuel's"  apparition to Saul, was it really Samuel or not..........God will tell us here:<br><br>1Ch 10:13 So Saul died for his unfaithfulness which he had committed against the LORD, because he did not keep the word of the LORD, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and also because he consulted a medium for guidance.</strong></span><br><br>14 <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But he did not inquire of the LORD</strong></span>; therefore He killed him, and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse.<br><br>The divine commentary of that episode says: He did not inquire the Lord. So it was not Samuel. [old testament people inquire the Lord through His genuine prophets]<br><br>Although, there may be others who will use portions in Revelations to justify that the dead can hear the living here on earth. This Samuel incident should suffice for now.<br><br>3)	About the excuse of the R.C. that thee is a difference between praying to the dead saints and just talking to them to ask for help:<br><br>This excuse is cogent at first glance, it sounds convincing. But looking at the way R.C. asks for help to Mary and the dead saints is quite disturbing. With great devotion they approach Mary and the saints. They call her and them their advocate, their hope and refuge, thanks them for the boundless graces they have received, kneels to them, sing songs to them, makes a procession in honor to them and other disturbing practices.<br><br>Would you call that just a mere asking for help and just having plain conversations with another fellow creature? Certainly not!!!! That is plain worship.<br><br>4) PLUS GodÂ’s Word is unequivocally clear that we should not have any communications with those who have died:<br><br>De 18:10 "There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, or one who practices witchcraft, or a soothsayer, or one who interprets omens, or a sorcerer,<br><br>11 "or one who conjures spells, or a medium, or a spiritist, or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ONE WHO CALLS UP THE DEAD</strong></span><br><br>That's so plain. That's as plain as :"thou shall not steal" and others. We don't need to have high level interpretive skill to understand that........................... that should be enough for now.<br><br>So where do i go for help in time of trouble?<br><br>Heb 4:15 For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin.<br><br>16 Let us therefore come <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BOLDLY</strong></span>  to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>in time of need</strong></span>.<br><br>Why?<br><br>because "God is our refuge and strength, <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>A very present help in trouble</strong></span>. Psalms 46:1<br><br>However, these gurantees can only be ours if we repent and trust in the saving work of Christ alone in Calvary<br><br>P.S. i have a question though..........although i was an altar assistant once in the Roman Catholic Church......... i never got to ask my priest about this:<br><br>How is it that Roman Catholics ask the intercession of inanimate objects?<br><br>"Tower of david.................................." pray for us"<br><br>mirror of...... [something i forgot].........."pray for us"<br><br>"house of gold"........................"pray for us"<br><br>ark of the covenant .................."pray for us"<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  can you fill me on this one? where is the biblical support that we ask the ark of the covenant to pray of us or the tower of David to pray for us? can they even pray in the first place?<br><br>bless you thanks  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Liberalism most probably. [i don't mean of course that we will not <strong>absolutely</strong> use logic anymore. There is what we call a "sanctified and illuminated" logic].<br><br>The Jews superimposing logic over God's revelation came up with countless different doctrines that the clear revelation of God in the Scriptures was obscured and set aside.<br><br>Tit 1:14 "not giving heed to Jewish fables and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>commandments of men </strong></span>who turn from the truth [<span style="font-style: italic;">revealed in God's Word</span>]."<br><br>Mt 15:9 And in vain they worship Me, Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'"<br><br>If we make logic  the <strong>primary</strong> barometer of truth, then all the doctrines of orthodoxy of Christianity would be thrown out the window.<br><br>Logic is good but it must be regulated, limited and restricted by God's revelation. It is God's revelation over logic not logic over God's revelation.<br>A good and God-fearing theologian follows that principle. Men in the late 1800's strayed off from that principle and became liberals in their theology. What a sad plight.<br><br>The Bible said: that we are not to call on the dead, that the dead know nothing. But you still hold on to what you think. What you must do is to bow down to the authority of Scripture. After all it is God's Word right? for sure you believe that also right?<br><br>When you bow down to the teachings of Scripture......you are submitting to the authority of God. You are worshipping Him.<br><br>Make the Bible your sole guide my friend. As i have said you can never go wrong.<br><br></div>

But you still hold on to what you think. What you must do is to bow down to the authority of Scripture. After all it is God's Word right? for sure you believe that also right?<br><br>When you bow down to the teachings of Scripture......you are submitting to the authority of God. You are worshipping Him.<br><br>Make the Bible your sole guide my friend. As i have said you can never go wrong.<br><br></div></blockquote>I told you, they are not dead, they are in eternal life with Christ.<br><br>Luke 20:38, "Now He is not God of the dead, but of the living: for all live to Him."<br><br>John 11:25 "Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believes in me, though he dies, yet shall he live. 26 And whosoever lives and believes in me shall never die."<br><br>And you cannot prove that the Bible alone is sufficient. The hundreds of churches out there who claim to follow the Bible but have countless permutations of differing interpretations cannot do so either. Why should I believe in your personal interpretation? Do you have authority?<br><br>No, I rather trust in a Church that has existed for 2000 years, founded by Christ himself on the apostle Peter. Churches that have only existed for only 500 or even less cannot possibly have the authority to interpret scripture, for they were founded by men.</div>

Even the angel honoured mary because she was righteous. If by honour as she is the mother of Christ or the mother of God, then no. She is the mother of Jesus while he was on this earth that is all.<br><br>So will you stop praying to mary? Like I said why pray to mary when we are specifically commanded not to? The RC church has made idols of all of the saints and mary, therefore we are specifically commanded not to pray to idols, even in the act of praying to them, you have made them an idol and put them before God. And God clearly states in the commandments you shall not pray to idols.<br><br>God says very clearly in the verse that I have quoted that we have one and only ONE mediator who is Jesus.</div>
