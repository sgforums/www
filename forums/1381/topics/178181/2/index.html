            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong><br>So, St Valentines Day is not a Christian festival and its not a mockery of Christians teachings? Right? </strong></blockquote>Valentine's day is definitely not a Christian festival, but because of it's western connotation (and sadly, Christianity is still seen as a western religion) and the fact that there is a "St" connected to the name, is it perceived to be Christian festival. The fact that Muslims and Hindus are not encouraged to celebrate this festival of "love" also testifies the fact that it is a "Christian"  festival. This is no different from Santa Claus being seen as part of Christian lore, although this character has no relation to the birth of Christ whatsoever. Hence, it will not be too incorrect to say that Valentine's day (and Santa Claus) is in a way, making a mockery of fundamental Christianity. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Whether the Valentine character exists or not remains to be seen. Even though if he exists, the lore tells us that the festival was to commemorate his "martyrdom", it does not seem that the festivities were ordained by the church.<br>Link: <a href="http://www.historychannel.com/exhibits/valentine/?page=history" rel="nofollow">http://www.historychannel.com/exhibits/valentine/?page=history</a><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>And which is which?

The problem really, is those starry eyed youths who spluged on flowers and hope to get lucky that night. Obviously there are also those starry eyed lustful adults who hope to get laid.<br><br>But all said and done, it is too simplistic to attribute to the rate of divorce over a once a year event.<br><br>Cheers.</div>

While occasionally secular law upholds any religion's moral direction, it is incidental and the purpose is uphold the country, eg filial piety. Secular law does not care if two married people (not to each other) have an affair or a legally aged individual decide to be promiscious.<br>The issue on halal food is there because of the large number of muslim in this country. If the country has very very few muslim, such a law will not exist.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">Due to ignorance, if a restaurant catering to the muslim offer roast pork made of flour, it will be a mockery of islamic teaching.<br></div></blockquote>Yes it is. Likewise Swensen has to withdraw the Piglet character in their Winnie the Pooh ice cream cake. This is NOT secular law, per se, this is business decision for Muslims to eat there, therefore generating more revenue.

One argument (not mine) is that because Christmas is so close to new year, any decoration done may not specifically be targeted for Christmas. Can we say that this argument is wrong? Also if all I want is to make money and bring in the customers, and calculated that any risk is minimal, don't I have the right to do any decoration I want? - approach it from a non-Christian business standpoint.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">I cannot see how restaurants offering buffet can be a mockery of the Christian teaching that our body is the temple of God.

To say that valentine will lead to divorce or immoral lifestyle is also to say that the abundant choice of food will lead to gluttony. Yes you are right, you can choose what you want to eat, but another can choose to indulge in glutton (or sexual deprivation, for that matter) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
