If you are a HR person, this type of situation is quite normal and does not conflict with your faith.<br>To be gracious, merciful, compassionate etc at a personal level is given, however, if, because of our job function, we need to fulfil our roles and responsibilities, we need also to understand that because we are Christian, being a good steward in your work is also equally important. The requirement to be gracious and merciful does not overule to requirement to be responsible for our job and the company that we work for.<br><br>I'd stop short of being pressured to cheat for the company.</div>
