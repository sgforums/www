            <div class='col-md body'>This is a verse a lot of Atheist use to justify that Man can save themself<br><br>Job 40:14<br><br>Then I myself will admit to you<br>that your own right hand can save you.<br><br>I got this from a commentary to shed light into what it really means:<br><br>Verse 14. It is the prerogative of God alone to save the human soul. Nothing less than unlimited power, exerted under the direction and impulse of unbounded mercy, can save a sinner. This is most clearly asserted in this speech of Jehovah: When thou canst extend an arm like God, i.e., an uncontrollable power-when thou canst arm thyself with the lightning of heaven, and thunder with a voice like God-when thou canst deck thyself with the ineffable glory, beauty, and splendour of the supreme majesty of Jehovah-when thou canst dispense thy judgments over all the earth, to abase the proud, and tread down the wicked-when thou canst as having the keys of hell and death, blend the high and the low in the dust together; then I will acknowledge to thee that thy own right hand can save thee. In other words: Salvation belongeth unto the Lord; no man can save his own soul by works of righteousness which he has done, is doing, or can possibly do, to all eternity. Without Jesus every human spirit must have perished everlastingly. Glory be to God for his unspeakable gift<br><br>But we dun have to look far.
