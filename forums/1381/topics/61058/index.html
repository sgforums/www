            <div class='col-md body'>What's so surprising? ... the very reason that such a thing can happen is because the church has been inadequate in responding to such people in the way Jesus would have. Instead of loving them irregardless of who they are and try to guide them to what that is right, many of us respond with a mixture of revulsion and keep them at an arms length throwing firey verbal barbs warning of hellfire at them constantly.<br><br>Given such things, it's no surprise many of them find it hard to reconcile Jesus with his believers, and would hence come up with their own thelogy on why their behaviour is acceptable and find love in a church irregardless of it's dubious thelogy that does not reject them.<br><br>Hence while we may hold the corner on truth and right in this case, what good is it if we only how to use it to drive them away?<br><br>Hence things like this happen. The stigma of rejection is so deeply ingrained in them that the rightness or wrongness of their orentation is now irrevelant to them, they just want to be accepted and loved. And I believe that the rise of churches that accept homosexuality have arisen to meet this need, sad, because the churches with the truth on this matter (us) are the ones who have pushed them away in the first place.<br><br>In the absence of grace, it's no surprise pretty wacky makeshift replacements arise.</div>

I am not believing a denomination, just happen my church is an anglican...I believe in Christ.  But the fact that such things happen in a Christian world is shocking and most of all, shameful. That's human...being foolish even after the saving knowledge of Christ. I can comment much just waiting to see what comes next.<br><br>To all the believers, hope this news does not stumble you nor should u be surprised that such things will happened. Anchor your faith in the right place(Jesus Christ) and you will never fall. If you build ur faith upon local churches, church leaders and friends you have in church etc...remember, these are merely pebbles and sands and when the storm comes you will fall with a loud crash.  Build your faith solely upon Christ and you will be like what i always remember from BB, SURE &amp; STEADFAST<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would agree with the statement that "being single is a calling for an elect group". With God has ordained a person to be single, let no man mock him or her. I believe that God has His purpose for them in the ministry and Paul is an excellent example.<br><br>However, the criteria still holds. Interestingly, if you look at 1 Timothy 3 : 1-13, list quite a number of "qualification" that a bishop(pastor in other denominations) and elders/deacons must hold.<br><br>verse 2 says, "A bishop then must be blamless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;"<br><br>Flip a page or two in the bible and we see in 1 Timothy 4:1-3 about doctirnal posion mentioned by Paul to Timothy. Forbidding to marry and abstaining from meats are doctrines of the Devil. (Hmm...makes you wonder why that the Roman Catholics are doing with the monks, nuns and abstaining of meats on Fridays).<br><br>Was Timothy really 19 years old. I only knew that he was young. My understanding is that Paul sent Timothy to oversee the affairs the church in Ephesus. As far as I know, the Bible did not mention that Timothy was actually leading the congregation in the church akin a bishop or pastor.<br><br>I would think that Timothy, despite his youth, has been well taught by Paul and God had allowed him such wisdom to oversee the affairs in the church in Ephesus.<br><br>Just a few more verses about homosexuality.<br>1) Homosexuality is an abomination and put to death<br>Lev 20:13 "If a man lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have commited an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; thier blood shall be upon them."<br><br>2) Homosexuality is ungodly<br>2 Peter 2:6 "And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an example unto those that should live ungodly;"<br><br>3) Homosexuality is filthy and wicked<br>2 Peter 2:7 "And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked."<br><br>So its quite clear on God's stand on homosexuality.</div>
