Because that was and never will be the intention of true Christian teachings.<br><br>The kind of posts and accusations you are making are really sad and only show how much hate and misconception has been caused inside you. And I certainly would like it to stop. Christmas is around the corner and it is supposed to be a time of giving and sharing. Not a time of accusations, suspicions and hostility towards each other.<br><br>Like a family or group of friends, the idea of invitation is just to invite you to take part in a time of fellowship and gathering with one another. You are free to your choice to not believe in the bible and in Christian teaching, but please do not slander Christians by saying that their invitations have a hidden agenda to make up for any wrong doing or anything like that.<br><br>The invitations are real and genuine, the sweets and meal are not a guilt offering or anything like that. The gospel is shared with you and you are invited to the christmas celebration is to invite you into this family of ours.<br><br>I would understand you concerns and reasons for not wanting to do so and there is nothing wrong in declining. I would just want to end this post by saying that not all Christians are the same and there is more than one church in Singapore and in the world.<br><br>Peace to all.</div>

Those people are in the wrong and you are welcome to call the traffic police on them if you like. Going to church should not be an excuse for them to break the law. Just like going to the temple should not be an excuse for robbing the bank (just an example, nothing against buddhists).<br><br>A similar thing happened at church near my place. And I felt that it wasn't right of these people to obstruct others just because they are going to church.<br><br>However, no matter how those christians may have been in the wrong, it does not justify the kind of hate campaign you are doing here. When in general, most Christians in this forum or in Singapore are not those who have caused you any harm of any sort.<br><br>Please do not let your blind hate cloud your rationality.</div>
