Sounds like the name of a muscle group.<br><br>To my understanding, there is a central doctrinal guide if that's what you mean from the Vactican in the Catholic church.

That's why you see there are things like pentocostal catholics.<br><br>The practise of different catholic churchs can be quite different, or maybe even doctrinally different. So you have some catholics who are very "christian-like" and some who are quite erm...dodgy.

            <div class='col-md body'>What I think.<br><br>The first pope was Peter. I think it started out as the right motives but as the time passed it just became corrupted. I dont know, again never really studied this.<br><br>The ecumenicial movement, I believe, started not with the catholics. It came up something during the 1960s when churches strived to have national council of churches and world council of churchs. The movement is flawed in many ways.<br><br>Btw, Fandango, I think you and everyone else should state what denomination you are from or a non-denominational christian, if you want to state it.

I think that's their "solution". Because everyone will read and interprete the bible differently so as organisation, they need a "final say" on any issue. And they choose the Pope.<br><br>But I dun think that mean the Pope can happily say whatever he wants and make it doctrinal. The Vactican has a lot of politics and operates like a government really. The details of their operations i do not know. Just like in any church if there is difference in opinions, what the senior pastor says goes in the end.

If Mary is the Mother of God, then how is God the beginning and the end? pls explain!</div></blockquote>My dear friend. Is Jesus God? We all know he is. So if Mary is the mother of Jesus, is she not the mother of God?<br><br>FYI , Mary is called Mother of God because Jesus Christ her son who was born of her as man is not only man but is also truly God. Mary is not a goddess. She is as human as our own mothers. The big difference lies in the sons - Mary's Son and our mothers' sons. Mary's Son is the Son of God! Our mothers' sons are human, very human. How true then were the words of the cousin Elizabeth when she greeted Mary in the Gospel, "Blessed are you amongst women and blessed is thy fruit of your womb. And why is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?" (Luke 1:42-43)<br><br>By the way, I am Catholic.<br></div>

Some bible verses are quoted but there do not seemed to be any firm ground on this doctrine given the finish and perfect work of Christ on the cross.

The RC see Eucharist as a miraculous experience in which the substance of bread and wine becomes truly the flesh and blood of Christ although the outward appearance remains the same(transubstantiation).<br><br>- Priesthood (another form of Christ)<br><br>Celibacy and vow of poverty are required to become priests.
