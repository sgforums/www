Mary is not a goddess. She is as human as our own mothers. The big difference lies in the sons - Mary's Son and our mothers' sons. Mary's Son is the Son of God! Our mothers' sons are human, very human. How true then were the words of the cousin Elizabeth when she greeted Mary in the Gospel, "Blessed are you amongst women and blessed is thy fruit of your womb. And why is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?" (Luke 1:42-43)</div></blockquote>Just to add , lest someone thinks or accuses the verse in Luke to be twisted in the Catholic version, here's the verse in NIV:<br><br>41When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. 42In a loud voice she exclaimed: "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! 43But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?<br><br>Note that Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, so the blessing technically came from God.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha i hope i am not too late...  but anyway... just wondering how much of openess would everyone be willing to listen to the other side of the story.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Oh well...<br><br>Role of Mary...<br>I think one of the users have rightly say that because Christ is GOd... and Mary is the mother of God.. and hence... we call her Mary our mother, Mother of God.<br>I don't think protestants in general would be able to accept Mary, a mere human, as someone catholics give much honor and respect to...<br>In the first place why do catholics think so highly of her... From the greeting of the angel when he said, "Hail Mary, Full of grace the lord is with you" to the greeting of Elizabeth, "Blessed are u amongst women and blessed is the fruit of your womb Jesus". And not forgetting the magnificat Mary proclaimed right after the visitation.<br>Subsequently, at the wedding of Cana, Mary noticed that the wine is running out and approached jesus to do something about it, and even though jesus said "it's not my time yet", Mary just told the servants to "do whatever he tells you to". Later at the cross, before Jesus died, he told John, "behold your mother" and to mary, "behold your son".<br>Firstly, let me clarify that the wedding of cana is a good example as to show what a powerful mediator mary can be.. Don't be mistaken, Catholics do not recognise that Mary answers prayers, What she does is basically to pray for us too, like how we ask our friends to pray for us. Now then the arguement would be extended out to saints and all... some say they are dead.. BUT are they? Scientically maybe... spiritually doubt it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>I'm sure when we die, we will say something really important... or do we say something real dumb? Jesus, before he died, gave us a special gift... someone he held very dearly when he was alive.. his mother.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> When someone gives us a gift, we can either accept or reject it.. but if you don't like it, don't hurt the giver by saying nasty things about the gift...<br>Sure, everyone can go straight to god... No one is doubting that... and no one is arguing against it.. but putting it in humans terms, in a normal family, the father is the head at most times, but do we go to the father always? I'm sure, here and there, we go through our siblings and our mum or whatsoever.. Point is, who's to say what's the right route to take when every way leads back to the same source? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Purgatory<br>The catholic church believes that it's more a state rather than a place or whatsoever. Please understand the catholics do not just come up with a dogma or doctrine and just accept it immediately... it follows with the holy spirit and the group of believers then.. And for donkey years, catholics do believe in this thing called the purgatory. It used to be thought as a place but under the new vatican and new enlightenment, it seemed to come in the form of a state.<br>Many protestants argue here from the verse "I am the way the truth and the life, no one can come to the father accept through me" which seemed to be highly supportive of the first arguement about mary. However, i guess, what is neccessary to point out is not the exact words of the bible, but the message it had. The language then and now is different though the message remained the same.<br>Purgatory is a state of time where souls, after they died and are not ready to meet god, prepare for that encounter. Not everyone can forgive themselves, even when God forgives you. Or likewise, they are not ready to let go to leave their loved ones behind. And for people who are not exactly saintly and have little blotches here and there.. it's a place for them to "wash their robes".<br><br>Priesthood<br>It seems cruel huh that to be a priest you can't have a family. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Oh well, the vatican had this ruling NOT because the bible said so, but for practical reasons.<br>it was known that most of the disciples had families, only one. So what's wrong? No one said it's wrong, but it's not practical.<br>one of the reasons why we respect priests because they can give this up to serve. Put it this way, if you are a priest, you got a family, your family wants to spend time with you but your parish needs you.. who's more important? Many would say parish.. but then how much of a dad, a husband can you play?<br>Priests renew their vows every year to mark their determination to cont to want to serve christ in church. Not everyone though has the vow of poverty. This is only for certain orders of the priests. When i say orders it would mean the Franciscans, Jesuits, Carmalites, Diocese etc. They are not the same as denominations, they are just different parts of the one body working in different ways to pass that message of Christ. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Franciscans are one of them who take the vow of poverty. vow of poverty is not that they have to be poor and all... though some would want to live that vow in their everyday lives, vow of poverty would be more to give up what they have if needed to their brother who needs it more than them. In singapore it's quite hard to achieve that but in other countries, certain orders are really strict about this and even live poorly.<br>Staying commited to someone or something you love in these sacrifices you make, may not be a sacrifice to those who are called to the religious vocations. Afterall, marriage is something you give wholeheartedly, why not the "Holy orders" (Sacrament catholics call for men becoming priests)<br>Hmm... now as to why we go to confessions... hmm.. ok.. we take from the bible that jesus said to Peter (whom we thought to be the 1st pope) that 'whatever you bind shall be bound, whatever you loose shall be loosen" or so... we take it that peter representing all priests, that jesus gave peter the authority to absolve us from our sins. But he's just the physical mediator/instrument, god uses to speak to us.<br>Also, the priest represents the one big catholic community. When we sin, we not only hurt ourselves, but the bigger whole. Thats why during mass, catholics say "i confess to almighty god and to you my brothers and sisters that i've sinned through my own fault"... It's a sorry to our bigger family for failing to be a christian at times and hurting you with my actions intentionally. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> It's impossible to say sorry to the big family without going through the priestss for practical reasons. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I guess i will stop here... I don't say what i say is the absolute truth. and i used to be unconvinced by catholics because not many know what they are doing. and i used to pin point catholics for whatever they do, but i've learnt that what i am not comfortable with may not be wrong. I don't intend to convert anyone in my posting neither do i wish to have both sides bashing each other up... till now there's more important things to do like praying for peace and for change of hearts to terrorism and lesser killings... Maybe as christians or as just a being, part of this world, we should start doing something about that instead. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Hi stupidissmart..<br>I don't know what's your background knowledge in christianity... that's why it's a bit hard to explain.. but anyway...let me explain from the catholic's point of view.<br>We believe in the trinity.. God  the father, God the son and God the holy spirit. The doctrine of the Trinity is encapsulated in Matthew 28:19, where Jesus instructs the apostles: "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."<br>Let's take the example of the sun. With the sun, there's the rays and heat... These complete each other... they don't outdo each other.. but together they form the sun... Same as the trinity. They don't outdo each other, they don't represent 3 different gods but just 1 in different forms. God the father who watches us from heaven, God the son who become flesh to teach us and gives us salvation and God the holy spirit who guides us there. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Now, to come down on earth, it'll be hard to accept out of the blues, a guy appear from nowhere... hence that's why the use of Mary as an instrument is used.<br>I don't understand why you would say that jesus never declared himself god... Let's put it this way, he always humbled himself to his Father and not claiming anything for himself but for the greater glory of god... But In Philippians 2:10Â–11, we read: "[A]t the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord." This is a reference to Isaiah 45:18Â–24, which tells us: "I, Yahweh, speak the truth . . . I am God, and there is no other. By myself I have sworn. . . . To me every knee shall bow, every tongue confess. Â‘Only in Yahweh,Â’ it shall be said of me, Â‘are righteousness and strength.Â’ " Here Paul applies the prophecy of every knee bending and every tongue confessing to Jesus, resulting in the prophecy that they will "confess that Jesus Christ is Yahweh." The stress on Christ as God is also picked up by the early Church Fathers (e.g., Ignatius, below).<br>Jesus himself declares that he is Yahweh ("I AM," in English translation). In John 8:58, when questioned about how he has special knowledge of Abraham, Jesus replies, "Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM." His audience understood exactly who he was claiming to be. "So they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple" (John 8:59).<br>With the personal name of God, Yahweh, being applied to both the Father and the Son, it is almost certainly applied to the Spirit, and thus to all three members of the Trinity.<br><br>i am not too sure what u mean about the part on purgatory.. kind to clarify? Hope it helps.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi there stupidissmart, it's been a while since you posted something here and i am sure glad you asked the questions that you did.<br><br>To answer you question in brief, yes, the word "Trinity" was not found in the Bible but its reference is. Trinity refers to The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit (which can be found in the WHOLE bible!). It is coined by early Christians only for the purpose of referencing so that we don't always have to says say "The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit". It's just as simple as that. There are a lot of other so called 'terms' which are regularly used but not found in the Bible but are used to refer to the scripture text. One classic example is Rapture. The reason is the same, the terms are used simply for refencing. go figure.<br><br><blockquote>Tat is why i am puzzled why mary became the mother of god when he is just mother of jesus.</blockquote>I posted the same question to the Roman Catholics here in this forum but have yet to get an answer. You see, Christians don't call Mary the 'Mother of God' because thats simply blasphemy at the highest order. God choosed Mary to be the vessel to carry the Lord Jesus to this world and this tells us that Mary is the mother of Jesus and this is her most honourable title. But it just stops here.<br><br><blockquote>Subsequently, at the wedding of Cana, Mary noticed that the wine is running out and approached jesus to do something about it, and even though jesus said "it's not my time yet", Mary just told the servants to "do whatever he tells you to".</blockquote>If you read the post of Chelle2009 about, i assume she is a lady, her reply about Mary using the marriage at Cana is really intersting because that exact context speak against the Roman Catholic act of elevating Mary to being the Mother of God or to be the intersessor.<br><br>The text is found in John 2:1-12. In verse 4 it says:<br><br>"Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come."<br><br>Why did Jesus called Mary "Woman" and not "mother" in this verse? If you think that Jesus was rebuking Mary, you are right. In verse 3, Mary was strangely expecting a miracle from Jesus. But Jesus wanted Mary to check herself for imposing a matter which is a act for Jesus and God alone, which have no dependency on her. As a man, Jesus was her son, but as God, Jesus was her Lord.<br><br>This verse is also a prophecy from Jesus about what will happen to Mary. Its a very clear warning for us that Mary tried to interceed but the Lord Jesus stopped her saying, "what have I to do with thee", This is very apparent in that Mary the mother of Jesus was never meant to be an intersessor for us. She will never be elevated like what the Roman Catholics Church had done to her. The Son of God is appointed our Advocate with the Father; but the mother of our Lord was never designed to be our advocate with the Son.<br><br>I will end here with a note about another declaration from the Roman Catholic Church about Mary as the "Queen of Heaven" because she is the Mother of God.<br><br>"The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the <strong>queen of heaven</strong>, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.  Do they provoke me to anger? saith the LORD: do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces?  Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched."<br>Jeremiah 7:18-20<br><br>wow....</div>
