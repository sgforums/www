Christian these days refer only to Protestant.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Even Protestants don't call themselves Protestants but Christians. Only Catholics like to call themselves Catholics and not Christians. Wah .. very confusing hor?<br><br>The reason is simple. Catholics swear their allegiance to the Church. Protestants swear their allegiance to Christ. So if a charismatic don't like his church and want to join a methodist church, he is still a Christian. A Catholic if want to leave the Church will have name change to Christian.<br><br>Am I talking nonsense?<br><br></div>

God is my father and Church is my mother. I know God through the Church (sacraments) and more about His Church from God (scripture and tradition or Word of God) as well.<br><br>I personally feel protestantism of today neglect the former. They should study more about thier Reformers. The Me &amp; God mentality ( creeping into catholics as well) is devastating.</div>
