I dont believe in making sacrifices for atonement of sins.  Only God can forgive men from sins.  And that forgiveness is done when Jesus said "Its Finished."<br><br></div></blockquote>1) God passed authority of forgiving sins to his Church.<br><br>"And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.'" John 22:23<br><br>We also note that the apostles were not only given the authority to forgive sin, but to retain sin as well. What does this mean? This means that the apostles were given the gift of rendering judgment on the sincerity of the penitent, and binding the penitent to works of penance in order for him to be forgiven of his sin. If, in the apostles' judgment, the penitent was not sincere, or should be required to perform acts of penance in reparation for his sins, the apostles could retain the sin (withhold forgiveness) until their conditions were satisfied. While such authority is reserved to God alone, Christ shared this authority with the apostles.<br><br>If it is FINISHED, why does God even bother granting the power of retaining and loosing sins to his Church? Since it is done, why bother granting a useless gift? See Matt. 9:8 where the authority to forgive sins "was given to men."  There is at least 10 bible verses in support of Man forgiving sins.<br><br>Btw Christ calls us to pray and fast....that is sacrifice.</div>

God appointed Christ to live a life of perfect obedience to the law and to die a penal, substitutionary, sacrificial death as the covenantal representative for all who trust in him. </blockquote><a href="http://www.thirdmill.org/answers/answer.asp/category/th/file/99786.qna" rel="nofollow">http://www.thirdmill.org/answers/answer.asp/category/th/file/99786.qna</a><br><br><blockquote>Question<br>What is the covenant of redemption? Did it involve all three divine Persons? How did this doctrine develop historically? Isn't it a post-Reformation doctrine? Can it be supported scripturally?<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Answer<br>The covenant of redemption is typically described as a <strong>covenant between the Father and the Son</strong> rather than as a covenant between all three members of the Godhead. This is because the Bible presents the Son as the Redeemer, not the Holy Spirit, and it presents the Father as the one who permits, commands and accepts the Son's sacrifice. The Holy Spirit is critically important to the salvation process, but the condition of redemption was to be fulfilled by the Son in obligation to the Father, and the Father was to reward the Son's obedience. This is the <strong>essence of the covenant of redemption: a condition laid on the Redeemer, and a reward promised to the Redeemer upon fulfillment of the condition. </strong>Biblical texts supporting this doctrine are quite extensive, but for a sampling of texts and proofs see my article Biblical Soteriology: Limited Atonement, part 12.<br><br>I'm afraid I'm not aware of when the term "covenant of redemption" first came into play. But the concept has been around much longer than the term. In fact, I can't think of any old, mainstream system of theology that would deny its basic ideas (though some newer systems do), although the specific terms of that covenant are disputed. Certainly the idea is present in Calvin (e.g. Institutes 2.12.4).<br><br>As in Calvin, I suspect that in very old systematic treatments the idea would be addressed under the heading of the purpose of the incarnation. One work that comes to mind is <strong>Anselm</strong>'s "Why God Became Man" (late 11th century). Anselm certainly does not lay out the Reformed doctrine of the covenant of redemption. But he does indicate that the Son of God came to earth with the express purpose of redeeming mankind at the will of the Father and by satisfying God's Law, and he assumes that the Father assured the Son of success.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Johann Ech also sucessful defeated Luther in debates as well...<br><br>Wikipedia:<br><br>A mutual desire for a public disputation led to a compact between Eck and Luther by which the former pledged himself to meet Karlstadt in debate at Erfurt or Leipzig, on condition that Luther abstain from all participation in the discussion. In December 1518, Eck published the twelve theses which he was prepared to uphold against Karlstadt, but since they were aimed at Luther rather than at the ostensible opponent, Luther addressed an open letter to Karlstadt, in which he declared himself ready to meet Eck in debate.<br><br>The disputation between Eck and Karlstadt began at Leipzig on 27 June 1519. In the first four sessions Eck maintained the thesis that free will is the active agent in the creation of good works, but he was compelled by his opponent to modify his position so as to concede that the grace of God and free will work in harmony toward the common end. Karlstadt then proceeded to prove that good works are to be ascribed to the agency of God alone, whereupon Eck yielded so far as to admit that free will is passive in the beginning of conversion, although he maintained that in course of time it enters into its rights; so that while the entirety of good works originates in God, their accomplishment is not entirely the work of God.<br><br><strong>Despite the fact that Eck was thus virtually forced to abandon his position, he succeeded, through his good memory and his dialectic skill, in confusing the heavy-witted Karlstadt and carried off the nominal victory</strong>. He was far less successful against Luther, who, as Eck himself confessed, was his superior in memory, acumen, and learning. <strong>After a disputation on the absolute supremacy of the papacy, purgatory, penance, etc., lasting twenty-three days (4 JulyÂ–27 July), the arbitrators declined to give a verdict, but the general impression was that victory rested with Eck. He did succeed in making Luther admit that there was some truth in the Hussite opinions and declare himself against the pope, but this success only embittered his animosity against his opponents, and from that time his whole efforts were devoted to Luther's overthrow. Eck was greeted as victor by the theologians of the University of Leipzig,</strong> who overwhelmed him with honors and sent him away with gifts.<br><br>In addition to his inquisitorial duties, every year witnessed the publication of one or more writings against iconoclasm and in defense of the doctrines of the Mass, purgatory, and auricular confession. His Enchiridion locorum communium adversus Lutherum et alios hostes ecclesiae (Landshut, 1525) went through forty-six editions before 1576. As its title indicates, it was directed primarily against Melanchthon's Loci Communes, although it also concerned itself to some extent with the teachings of Huldrych Zwingli.<br><br>At Baden-in-Aargau from May 21 until June 18, 1526 a <strong>public disputation on the doctrine of transubstantiation was held, in which Eck and Thomas Murner were pitted against Johann Oecolampadius. The affair ended decidedly in favor of Eck, who induced the authorities to enter on a course of active persecution of Zwingli and his followers (Conference of Baden).</strong><br><br>The effect of his victory at Baden was dissipated, however, at the Disputation of Bern (January 152<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, where the propositions advanced by the Reformers were debated in the absence of Eck, and Bern, Basel, and other places were definitely won for the Reformation. At the Diet of Augsburg (1530) Eck played the leading part among the Roman Catholic theologians.<br></div>
