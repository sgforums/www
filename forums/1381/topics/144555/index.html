The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil's work. No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God's seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God. This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are: Anyone who does not do what is right is not a child of God; nor is anyone who does not love his brother. This is the message you heard from the beginning: We should love one another. Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil and his brother's were righteous. (1 John 3:8-12)<br><br>For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander. (Matthew 15:19)<br><br>But each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death. (James 1:14-15)<br><br>Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires. (2 Peter 1:4)<br><br>Living in Lust<br><br>All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath. (Ephesians 2:3)<br><br>Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator--who is forever praised. Amen. Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done. They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless. Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:24-32)<br><br>This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the sinful nature and despise authority. Bold and arrogant, these men are not afraid to slander celestial beings; yet even angels, although they are stronger and more powerful, do not bring slanderous accusations against such beings in the presence of the Lord. But these men blaspheme in matters they do not understand. They are like brute beasts, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed, and like beasts they too will perish.They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done. Their idea of pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their pleasures while they feast with you.With eyes full of adultery, they never stop sinning; they seduce the unstable; they are experts in greed--an accursed brood! They have left the straight way and wandered off to follow the way of Balaam son of Beor, who loved the wages of wickedness. But he was rebuked for his wrongdoing by a donkey--a beast without speech--who spoke with a man's voice and restrained the prophet's madness. These men are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest darkness is reserved for them. For they mouth empty, boastful words and, by appealing to the lustful desires of sinful human nature, they entice people who are just escaping from those who live in error. They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of depravity--for a man is a slave to whatever has mastered him. If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning. It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them. Of them the proverbs are true: "A dog returns to its vomit," and, "A sow that is washed goes back to her wallowing in the mud." (2 Peter 2:10-22)</div>

There are many desires we have as human beings. A desire for sex, a desire to eat, a desire to drink, a desire to be loved, a desire for spiritual fulfillment and many more. The problem isnÂ’t in the desire, but in how the desire is fulfilled. When we satisfy our desires in our timing and in our way, we lust and have to suffer the consequences of the actions we have taken.<br><br>We are all familiar with sexual desire, but remember God is also familiar with our sexual desire; after all He gave it to us. One thing we tend to forget and/or override is when this desire is to be satisfied.<br><br>God saved something sacred for that special person but we have lost the meaning and sacredness of sex or we never Â“choseÂ” to learn it in the first place. The command God gave to man and woman to be fruitful and multiply was to a married man and woman; not an unmarried man and woman or two women or two men. When a desire turns obsessively selfish, it then becomes lust. Lust is selfish which is contrary to the selflessness the Bible promotes. The Bible lets us know sin is the byproduct of the conception of lust and then from sin there is death. (Â“Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth deathÂ” (James 1:15 KJV). So in essence, we are actually killing something when we satisfy our natural sexual desire outside of the will of God. There is a part of your soul that is killed every time your desire turns into lust.<br><br>Someone reading this article may be thinking, Â“I feel fine after my sexual desire has been fulfilled.Â” Well, just because you feel fine doesnÂ’t mean you are doing fine. People with AIDS, depending on the stage theyÂ’re in, can feel fine and look fine, but internally they are dying. Read the aforementioned scripture in the book of James. Death is brought forth Â“when it is finishedÂ”. When what is finished? When sin is finished. Sin is a process working in you with the finale of death. One way or another we will feel or see the result of sin, BUT we thank Jesus Christ for His resurrecting power. The power to produce life where there was once death. This comes from confessing and repenting (turning away) of our sins.<br><br>The devil is a master at keeping us ignorant to spiritual life, while keeping us in a state of spiritual destruction because of our lack of knowledge ( Â“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.....Â” Hosea 4:6 KJV) . Someone who has been doing wrong, and was never taught right, will continue to do wrong thinking it is right and not feeling, or knowing, the difference. If you are doing your job a certain way and someone educates you on a faster and easier way you are then liberated from the slower and harder way. There is a burden lifted off you. The same applies to being educated on not falling into sexual lust. When you have truly tapped into the liberation of not satisfying your sexual desires, there is a freedom in your soul and spirit. You feel it!! Even more once you have tasted freedom you are keener to what bondage feels like. It seems right to lust because it derives from a natural desire and we have never been taught how to operate with our sexual desire under the control of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>The children of Israel were in Egypt under bondage. God freed them, but while on the journey of freedom they grumbled because their desires to eat and drink were not being satisfied and they wished to be back in Egypt (Exodus 17:3, 16:3). Certain desires werenÂ’t being met at a given time so they longed to satisfy those desires back in a place of bondage. IsnÂ’t that just like us at times? When we want something and we canÂ’t have it our way or in our timing things outside of what we would normally want is what we go after.<br><br>While weÂ’re fasting, food we donÂ’t even like starts to look and smell good. When we were single and waiting for that spouse, women or men that werenÂ’t even our type started to look good to us. LetÂ’s tell the truth and shame the devil. The reason why a place of bondage seemed better to the children of Israel or food we donÂ’t like seems good or that woman or man is attractive now is because a God given desire has turned to lust. God no longer has control, but you do. This story relates to our sexual desire.<br><br>We, the children of Israel, can be free but when the trials (sexual temptation) come we are drawn away by our own lust (Â“But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticedÂ” , (James 1:14 KJV) In other words we are drawn to satisfy our desires our way (lust), rather than stay in the will of God and have our desires fulfilled GodÂ’s way. The children of Israel wouldnÂ’t have wanted to go back to Egypt if it wasnÂ’t of their own lust to do so. It surely wasnÂ’t in GodÂ’s desire, because God, through Moses wanted them free (Exodus 3:7-10) . God didnÂ’t bring them out of Egypt to starve them or to have them die of thirst, but that is how it seemed to them. This is how it seems to us.<br><br>When we were young and hadnÂ’t eaten, we would say to our mom or dad, Â“IÂ’m starving, when are we going to eat?Â” No, we were just straight up Â“hungryÂ”. Issues are always magnified beyond what they really are when we want what we want - when we want it. Just remember God knows and he wonÂ’t put more on you than you can bear (Â“There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.Â” 1 Corinthians 10:13 KJV).<br><br>To the married and engaged, itÂ’s been such a false perception that when you are married itÂ’s okay to lust after your spouse. Not so! Remember lust is a selfish desire. If you are lusting then basically you are not thinking about your spouse and their satisfaction. The entire focal point of pleasure is on you. This diminishes the sacredness and the beauty of sex. Someone is going to be lacking physically and most importantly Â“spirituallyÂ”. There is a duty to be fulfilled to one another (Â“Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.Â” 1 Corinthians 7:3 KJV).<br><br>Through the inspiration of God the Apostle Paul also gives insight to avoiding lust outside of marriage in the book of 1 Corinthians (Â“So do not deprive each other of sexual relations. The only exception to this rule would be the agreement of both husband and wife to refrain from sexual intimacy for a limited time, so they can give themselves more completely to prayer. Afterward they should come together again so that Satan won't be able to tempt them because of their lack of self-control.Â” 1 Corinthians 7:5 KJV) .<br><br>There is an exception to not giving yourself unto your spouse based on spiritual reasons, but after those reasons are satisfied, the intimacy presses on. Using abstinence as a weapon against your spouse other than the reasons Paul has outlaid is witchcraft (Â“For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft,......Â” 1 Samuel 15:23) .<br><br>Lust is not restricted to sex, yet it is mostly associated with sex; it could be an obsessive selfish desire for money, power, etc. Lust in any form brings forth death. God wants us to live for Him, but first we must deny ourselves.<br><br>Â“Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. Matthew 16:24)<br><br>God Bless You All and Glory To Our Heavenly Father<br><br></div>
