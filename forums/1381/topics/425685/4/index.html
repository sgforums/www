              <p>Most importantly is when we speak of God's only begotten son.</p>
              <p>It does not mean God have a wife and give birth to a son.</p>
              <p>God does not reproduce as God is without gender.</p>
              <p>God is a spirit.</p>
              <p>It means the miraculous virgin birth of mary and Mary is not God's wife.</p>

              <p>eh no, biblically God is heavenly Father so his gender is a he...but yes, God doesnt reproduce...does a man have to reproduce himself in order to be a son to his father after being a father to his child?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thats why its called miraculous birth cos it didnt happen the natural way...btw, do u noe why a virgin birth was necessary?</p>

              <p><br>Ok. Ur theology is good.</p>
              <p>and without virgin birth he cannot have a physical human body  to die for ur sins.</p>
              <p>Virgin birth is important for the problem of original sin.</p>
