              <h4>1. Does God exist? The complexity of our planet points to a 
              deliberate Designer who not only created our universe, but sustains it 
              today.</h4>
              <p>Many examples showing God's design could be given, possibly with no end. But here are a few:</p>
              <p><strong>The Earth</strong>...its size is perfect. The Earth's size 
              and corresponding gravity holds a thin layer of mostly nitrogen and 
              oxygen gases, only extending about 50 miles above the Earth's surface. 
              If Earth were smaller, an atmosphere would be impossible, like the 
              planet Mercury. If Earth were larger, its atmosphere would contain free 
              hydrogen, like Jupiter.<sup>3</sup> Earth is the only known planet 
              equipped with an atmosphere of the right mixture of gases to sustain 
              plant, animal and human life.</p>
              <p><img class="articlephoto" src="http://www.everystudent.com/pics4/isthere2.jpg" border="0" alt="existence of God" align="right">The
               Earth is located the right distance from the sun. Consider the 
              temperature swings we encounter, roughly -30 degrees to +120 degrees. If
               the Earth were any further away from the sun, we would all freeze. Any 
              closer and we would burn up. Even a fractional variance in the Earth's 
              position to the sun would make life on Earth impossible. The Earth 
              remains this perfect distance from the sun while it rotates around the 
              sun at a speed of nearly 67,000 mph. It is also rotating on its axis, 
              allowing the entire surface of the Earth to be properly warmed and 
              cooled every day.</p>
              <p>And our moon is the perfect size and distance from the Earth for its 
              gravitational pull. The moon creates important ocean tides and movement 
              so ocean waters do not stagnate, and yet our massive oceans are 
              restrained from spilling over across the continents.<sup>4</sup></p>
              <p><strong>Water</strong>...colorless, odorless and without taste, and 
              yet no living thing can survive without it. Plants, animals and human 
              beings consist mostly of water (about two-thirds of the human body is 
              water). You'll see why the characteristics of water are uniquely suited 
              to life:</p>
              <p>It has an unusually high boiling point and freezing point. Water 
              allows us to live in an environment of fluctuating temperature changes, 
              while keeping our bodies a steady 98.6 degrees.</p>
              <p><img class="articlephoto" src="http://www.everystudent.com/pics4/isthere3.jpg" border="0" alt="proof of God" align="right">Water
               is a universal solvent. This property of water means that thousands of 
              chemicals, minerals and nutrients can be carried throughout our bodies 
              and into the smallest blood vessels.<sup>5</sup></p>
              <p>Water is also chemically neutral. Without affecting the makeup of the
               substances it carries, water enables food, medicines and minerals to be
               absorbed and used by the body.</p>
              <p>Water has a unique surface tension. Water in plants can therefore 
              flow upward against gravity, bringing life-giving water and nutrients to
               the top of even the tallest trees.</p>
              <p>Water freezes from the top down and floats, so fish can live in the winter.</p>
              <p>Ninety-seven percent of the Earth's water is in the oceans. But on 
              our Earth, there is a system designed which removes salt from the water 
              and then distributes that water throughout the globe. Evaporation takes 
              the ocean waters, leaving the salt, and forms clouds which are easily 
              moved by the wind to disperse water over the land, for vegetation, 
              animals and people. It is a system of purification and supply that 
              sustains life on this planet, a system of recycled and reused water.<sup>6</sup></p>
              <p><strong>The human brain</strong>...simultaneously processes an 
              amazing amount of information. Your brain takes in all the colors and 
              objects you see, the temperature around you, the pressure of your feet 
              against the floor, the sounds around you, the dryness of your mouth, 
              even the texture of your keyboard. Your brain holds and processes all 
              your emotions, thoughts and memories. At the same time your brain keeps 
              track of the ongoing functions of your body like your breathing pattern,
               eyelid movement, hunger and movement of the muscles in your hands.</p>
              <p><img class="articlephoto" src="http://www.everystudent.com/pics4/isthere4.jpg" border="0" alt="existence of God" align="right">The human brain processes more than a million messages a second.<sup>7</sup> Your brain weighs the importance of all this data, filtering out the 
              relatively unimportant. This screening function is what allows you to 
              focus and operate effectively in your world. The brain functions 
              differently than other organs. There is an intelligence to it, the 
              ability to reason, to produce feelings, to dream and plan, to take 
              action, and relate to other people.</p>
              <p><strong>The eye</strong>...can distinguish among seven million 
              colors. It has automatic focusing and handles an astounding 1.5 million 
              messages -- simultaneously.<sup>8</sup> Evolution focuses on mutations 
              and changes from and within existing organisms. Yet evolution alone does
               not fully explain the initial source of the eye or the brain -- the 
              start of living organisms from nonliving matter.</p>
              <h4>2. Does God exist? The universe had a start - what caused it?</h4>
              <p>Scientists are convinced that our universe began with one enormous 
              explosion of energy and light, which we now call the Big Bang. This was 
              the singular start to everything that exists: the beginning of the 
              universe, the start of space, and even the initial start of time itself.</p>
              <p>Astrophysicist Robert Jastrow, a self-described agnostic, stated, 
              "The seed of everything that has happened in the Universe was planted in
               that first instant; every star, every planet and every living creature 
              in the Universe came into being as a result of events that were set in 
              motion in the moment of the cosmic explosion...The Universe flashed into
               being, and we cannot find out what caused that to happen."<sup>9</sup></p>
              <p>Steven Weinberg, a Nobel laureate in Physics, said at the moment of 
              this explosion, "the universe was about a hundred thousands million 
              degrees Centigrade...<strong>and the universe was filled with light</strong>."<sup>10</sup></p>
              <p>The universe has not always existed. It had a start...what caused 
              that? Scientists have no explanation for the sudden explosion of light 
              and matter.</p>
              <h4>3. Does God exist? The universe operates by uniform laws of nature. Why does it?</h4>
              <p>Much of life may seem uncertain, but look at what we can count on day
               after day: gravity remains consistent, a hot cup of coffee left on a 
              counter will get cold, the earth rotates in the same 24 hours, and the 
              speed of light doesn't change -- on earth or in galaxies far from us.</p>
              <p>How is it that we can identify laws of nature that <em>never</em> change? Why is the universe so orderly, so reliable?</p>
              <p>"The greatest scientists have been struck by how strange this is. 
              There is no logical necessity for a universe that obeys rules, let alone
               one that abides by the rules of mathematics. This astonishment springs 
              from the recognition that the universe doesn't have to behave this way. 
              It is easy to imagine a universe in which conditions change 
              unpredictably from instant to instant, or even a universe in which 
              things pop in and out of existence."<sup>11</sup></p>
              <p>Richard Feynman, a Nobel Prize winner for quantum electrodynamics, 
              said, "<strong>Why nature is mathematical is a mystery...The fact that there are
               rules at all is a kind of miracle.</strong>"<sup>12</sup></p>
              <h4>4. Does God exist? The DNA code informs, programs a cell's behavior.</h4>
              <p><img class="articlephoto" src="http://www.everystudent.com/pics4/istherecomp.jpg" border="0" alt="existence of God" align="right">All
               instruction, all teaching, all training comes with intent. Someone who 
              writes an instruction manual does so with purpose. Did you know that in 
              every cell of our bodies there exists a very detailed instruction code, 
              much like a miniature computer program? As you may know, a computer 
              program is made up of ones and zeros, like this: 110010101011000. The 
              way they are arranged tell the computer program what to do. The DNA code
               in each of our cells is very similar. It's made up of four chemicals 
              that scientists abbreviate as A, T, G, and C. These are arranged in the 
              human cell like this: CGTGTGACTCGCTCCTGAT and so on. There are three 
              billion of these letters in every human cell!!</p>
              <p>Well, just like you can program your phone to beep for specific 
              reasons, DNA instructs the cell. DNA is a three-billion-lettered program
               telling the cell to act in a certain way. It is a full instruction 
              manual.<sup>13</sup></p>
              <p><img class="articlephoto" src="http://www.everystudent.com/pics4/istheredna.jpg" border="0" alt="existence of God" align="right">Why
               is this so amazing? One has to ask....how did this information program 
              wind up in each human cell? These are not just chemicals. <strong>These are 
              chemicals that instruct, that code in a very detailed way exactly how 
              the person's body should develop.</strong></p>
              <p>Natural, biological causes are completely lacking as an explanation 
              when programmed information is involved. You cannot find instruction, 
              precise information like this, without someone intentionally 
              constructing it.</p>
              <h4>5. Does God exist? We know God exists because he pursues us. He is constantly initiating and seeking for us to come to him.</h4>
              <p>I was an atheist at one time. And like many atheists, the issue of 
              people believing in God bothered me greatly. What is it about atheists 
              that we would spend so much time, attention, and energy refuting 
              something that we don't believe even exists?! What causes us to do that?
               When I was an atheist, I attributed my intentions as caring for those 
              poor, delusional people...to help them realize their hope was completely
               ill-founded. To be honest, I also had another motive. As I challenged 
              those who believed in God, I was deeply curious to see if they could 
              convince me otherwise. Part of my quest was to become free from the 
              question of God. If I could conclusively prove to believers that they 
              were wrong, then the issue is off the table, and I would be free to go 
              about my life.</p>
              <p><img class="articlephoto" src="http://www.everystudent.com/pics4/isthere5.jpg" border="0" alt="proof of God" align="right">I
               didn't realize that the reason the topic of God weighed so heavily on 
              my mind, was because God was pressing the issue. I have come to find out
               that God wants to be known. He created us with the intention that we 
              would know him. He has surrounded us with evidence of himself and he 
              keeps the question of his existence squarely before us. It was as if I 
              couldn't escape thinking about the possibility of God. In fact, the day I
               chose to acknowledge God's existence, my prayer began with, "Ok, you 
              win..." It might be that the underlying reason atheists are bothered by 
              people believing in God is because God is actively pursuing them.</p>
              <p>I am not the only one who has experienced this. Malcolm Muggeridge, 
              socialist and philosophical author, wrote, "I had a notion that somehow,
               besides questing, I was being pursued." C.S. Lewis said he remembered, 
              "...night after night, feeling whenever my mind lifted even for a second
               from my work, the steady, unrelenting approach of Him whom I so 
              earnestly desired not to meet. I gave in, and admitted that God was God,
               and knelt and prayed: perhaps, that night, the most dejected and 
              reluctant convert in all of England."</p>
              <p>Lewis went on to write a book titled, "Surprised by Joy" as a result 
              of knowing God. I too had no expectations other than rightfully 
              admitting God's existence. Yet over the following several months, I 
              became amazed by his love for me.</p>
