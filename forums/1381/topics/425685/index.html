              <p>I'm surpised that you believe in god because I've seen your other posts which you mentioned karma. Which god are you referring to ? Are you referring to christian god ? If yes, then you are wrong, their god judge. Only karma don't judge because it is no man operator.</p>
              <p>To me, god is just a higher being than humans, just like humans are higher beings than animals.</p>

              <p>Individual Spirit / Soul = consciousness + energetic structure<br><br>As
               a soul, just imagine yourself as extremely minature extension of God, 
              coming all the way out here to 3D Earth, to participate in a grand 
              experiment. <br><br>The dynamics of soul evolution is very complex -&gt;
               How souls get fragmented into smaller pieces from their soul parent, 
              and also how souls get integrated, grow, expand and matures...<br><br>Your
               level of consciousness determines your vibration states, your ability 
              to percieve your reality. The higher the cousciousness (higher 
              freqnency), the easier for you to see things from a higher perspective 
              (see the big picture).<br><br>Each soul has a unique energetic 
              signature, an energy field that it emits. It is used to identify a soul.
               There are people on Earth now who have clairvoyant vision, they can 
              sense the energetic structure of a soul, this ability is very useful 
              when you are into energetic healing or telepathy.</p>
