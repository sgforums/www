              <hr>
              <p>Karma is a Sanskrit word, meaning "action". Every action produces an effect and it is a cause first and effect afterwards. Therefore, do refer Karma as the Law of cause and effect. In Christianity, it is just known as "you reap what you sown".  <br><br>The Law of cause and effect is independent from all kinds of judgment. Few people can fully understand what Karma really is with no judgment involved, <a href="/forums/1728/topics/387044">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/387044</a>, because Karma is a very wide topic which requires scientific knowledge and spiritual understanding. You can really write hundreds of thousands pages about Karma if you really understand what Karma is.</p>

              <p>The quote extracted below comes from a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>real Buddhist</strong></span>, The<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Arahat</strong></span>: Daniel M. Ingram</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>THE GOD MODELS<br>On a very different tangent, we have the God Models. While<br>Buddhism pretends to be an exception to the theological traditions,<br>many Buddhists essentially worship the Buddha as a God just as<br>Christians worship Jesus as a God. Further, the vast majority of the<br>traditions that promote awakening involve some sort of theological<br>background or underpinning, including Hindu Vedanta’s focus on the<br>divine nature of things, Islam’s Sufi’s focusing on The Friend or<br>dissolving in Allah, and Christianity’s various dissolution in God<br>metaphors, such as the Divine Marriage. Buddhism has the same<br>problem at times with the phrase Buddha Nature. These are interesting<br>models to talk about, and basically the question comes down to the<br>distance between “God” and one’s life. Those who believe in a God that<br>is a separate entity are already in trouble. Those who believe this entity<br>is far off in Heaven or largely unavailable are really in trouble. However,<br>those who believe in a “God” that is right here, right now, and present in<br>all things, including themselves, have a fighting chance, and this is as<br>practical a model for awakening as any other, if done correctly, which it<br>almost never is.<br>The problem comes for those who believe in God Free Zones, that<br>is, those places where God is not. These tend to be people who believe<br>in a limited, abstract God. Most people who believe in God have not<br>taken the time to consider the question of whether or not they believe in<br>God Free Zones or a limited God. In fact, most people who believe in<br>God in the monotheistic sense would be offended by the notion that<br>their God was somehow limited. However, if you question them about<br>whether or not God is in their toilet paper or in a rock, or perhaps<br>more specifically IS the toilet paper, and is the rock, is their weird<br>popcorn fetish, is the annoying itch in their armpit, and actually is<br>everything else, even most people who in theory believe in an<br>omnipresent, unlimited, all-powerful God won’t go that far. This is too<br>bad, because if they did, they would have a good working model for<br>realizing that THIS IS IT, and so we are back to my original, simple,<br>excellent premise and test for good models of awakening.<br>Here’s how this works: if you believe that you are trying to see God,<br>and you believe that all creation is a manifestation not just created by<br>God, but in fact IS GOD, they you are back to basic insight practices:<br>seeing the sensate world exactly as it is, because there you will find<br>ultimate reality, or “God”, if you want to call it that. When the center<br>point is seen through by your careful investigation of all these<br>sensations, or all the aspects of God, then all that is left is just all these<br>sensations as before, that is, all this God. Thus, if one is willing to really<br>believe in a omnipresent God, then by truly, deeply, directly perceiving<br>all sensations to be just part of the causal, natural unfolding of what they<br>label God, all the boundaries between what were self and other can be<br>seen through, and the phenomenal world is left doing its thing, thus the<br>practitioner realizes they always were part of God, in a sense, though<br>these designations are merely terminological one way or the other.<br>Thus, the problem with God models typically is that people don’t<br>take them far enough, because if they do they can get into something<br>really good, though they could get their just as easily without them. All<br>the other ideals that are involved in becoming God or seeing God are<br>just more odd dreams and possible side effects of spiritual practice. I<br>have a few friends who saw visions while on LSD in which “God” told<br>them useful stuff, and this is fine, but this is back in the realm of the<br>powers and has nothing to do with awakening and only a very limited<br>amount to do with “God” in the ultimate sense.</em></p>

              <p>God is divine. An experience u cannot see but you can feel. God is nothing like us. We are nothing like God. God was, is and will always be superior than man. God is the creater, however He is a destroyer (judgment day).</p>
              <p>As for the theory about the existence of God, its pointless to argue if He exists. We will never, atleast for the next century, be able to prove the existence of God i.e by seeing, but it's all about believing what has been created around us. Praise Him for He shall never let us down for those who believes in Him. :)</p>

              <p>But the fear and deaths, as u said religion creates are due to the fact that the people mis-inteprete it? I think ne religion will advise the followers to deter other religion. We must respect in fact. Ofcourse if u go to Malaysia, and build a church beside a mosque will be a suicide, but things shouldnt be that way. These fear and death, are i think cause by humans who mis inteprete their holy texts.</p>
