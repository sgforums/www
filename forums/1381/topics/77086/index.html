            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br>Another point i have noted is that a lot of time Christians have the fear of listening to people's views. Some Non-believers when being preached to may be provoked when Christians tell them they should not think things in certain ways. It seems to me that we're afraid of our peers or leaders telling us that our faith is not strong because we listen to these ideas. I have heard many times Pastors, in an attempt to ensuring their people stand firm, actually tell them that everything else is inspired by the Devil into confusing and swaying their faith. But occassionally some of these "ideas" are not actually wrong. We can never say something is perfect or flawless. in everything that exists, every system, there has to be an error somewhere. Even when it comes to sets of beliefs. Which is unfortunate that many Christians shun ideas because they think it isn't true. Or just because it's not from the Bible, even though it sounds right, it has to be wrong. Once again, i'd like to remind all that the Bible was written by the Hand of Man. The Christian view is that it was inspired by God but it was still written by Man in the end. Maybe He is still doing the inspiring job and giving people ideas to share and to add on to what we've been given - the Bible. So are we refusing to hear these new ideas simply because of the last chapter in Revelations?<br><br>Maybe i should give an illustration. The Satanic Bible is written by Anton Szandor LaVey. some of you have read it, some of you have never heard of it, most of you avoid it because you're afraid of it. The excuse you give is that it is full of lies and it is unholy. Well if your faith is strong then you would read it and try to understand it, and tell all the Satanists who believe it why they are wrong and prove it using their own words against them. You wouldn't say, "i'm not going to read it cause it's going to cause me to Sin." there are things in it about Christianity that can actually help you to understand Christianity more. i believe that to fight the adversary, you have to know the adversary. but some of you wouldn't agree with me, you'd think i'm trying to influence your thought. Well, i'm open to ideas. There's no harm in that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We r commanded to preach..not to convince. Read satanic bible so as to knows wats inside and correct them...sounds holy..but wat for? We are not concerned abt filling our minds with unholy stuffs. The Protestant affirms that the Holy Bible is infallible(not some human leader), and the words inside are authoritative(not some human leader's words) and every doctrine should come from the contents of the Bible.<br><br>Every prophecy, predictions, or even new teachings should be checked againts the word of God. The two must tally..if not it will be considered as false prophecy and originated from satan.<br><br>Watever we need to know, believe in and watever instructions and revelations are completed eversince the last page of Revelation was penned down. Do not worry...God wont suddenly appear and tell us new ideas which we sometimes hear from cults....strange and new teachings which with a discerning mind and ample biblical knowledge is able to test and differentiate.<br><br></div>
