Popularly known as the lovely Amor, he then existed in a world where an endless parade of physical beauty takes place. Dressing himself in beaded gowns matched with paint all over his face, he wanted to change what nature ought to be. He desired to be a lady.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Kaanib.Net: What are the major changes you underwent as brethren?<br><br>Amor: First is on how I dress myself. My routine also changed altogether. I no longer live in the world and of illusion. I even learned to accept and respect myself. I am now able to use my capabilities with the help of the ALMIGHTY LORD. Before, I wanted to achieve many things. I always aim for the best. I desired to reach the pinnacle of success Â– to be always on top no matter what. But it has many downfalls. I just wanted to prove to everybody that I can do it as a gay person. I wanted to prove that I can overshadow the real male and female. I imagined that gays are man and woman combined so they are of two persons causing them to be stronger. I refuse to believe that we are not above normal. But now it is different. All the things I do are of God.<br><br>Kaanib.Net: How do you comment on people who talk of the sudden changes in you?<br><br>Amor: <span style="color: blue;">I may not be beautiful for them anymore. But I know I am beautiful to the eyes of the ALMIGHTY LORD.</span><br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Kaanib.Net: How about Bro. Eli?<br><br>Amor: He is the preacher who is always ready to campaign for our welfare. He also <span style="color: red;">explained to us that being a gay is not a sin. It is only the act that makes it a sin. </span><br></div>

He has been proven right. </span>The condition comes, as does being heterosexual, by a combination of genetic, hormonal, and very early societal development. It is both nature and nurture. It is not a disease to be caught."  - Rev Dr Yap Kim Hao<br><br>"When the Bible condemns the Â“homosexualityÂ” of the Greco-Roman society, it was condemning all forms of ancient pederasty, not modern homosexuality.

So they lift up and quote certain chapters and verses from the Bible associated with this issue and regard them as divine truth revealed by God. The Bible is a difficult book written by inspired men and women of faith believing that it was revealed to them. At one time they even claim that it was dictated by God and they just recorded it. Soon it was realised that it was not dictation but interpretation of what they believed to be GodÂ’s revelation.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Let us look at 1 Corinthians 6:9. <span style="color: red;">The two Greek words malakoi and arsenokoitai have been translated differently at different times in different versions of the Bible in English.</span> The King James Version in 1611 regarded them to mean those who are effeminate and abusers of themselves with mankind, which was close to the Greek meaning.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">The original Revised Standard Version (the New Testament first appeared in 1946) was the first translation ever to use the word "homosexual.Â” </span>It translated the two words to mean homosexuals or sexual perverts. Then in 1978 the New International Version translated them as male prostitutes and homosexual offenders. It was the New Revised Version in 1989 which renders them as male prostitutes and sodomites. It must be noted that the word homosexual was not used in the earlier period. It was in 1180 that the word sodomy was first used. <span style="color: orange;">There is no such word as "sodomite" in the original languages (Ezekiel 16:49-50 describes the sin of Sodom as pride, gluttony, not caring for the poor and needy). </span><br><br></div>

The opposition that arose during the third to sixth centuries was due to the demise of urban culture, government regulation on personal morality and church pressures toward asceticism.

My routine also changed altogether. I no longer live in the world and of illusion. I even learned to accept and respect myself. I am now able to use my capabilities with the help of the ALMIGHTY LORD. Before, I wanted to achieve many things. I always aim for the best. I desired to reach the pinnacle of success Â– to be always on top no matter what. But it has many downfalls. I just wanted to prove to everybody that I can do it as a gay person. I wanted to prove that I can overshadow the real male and female. I imagined that gays are man and woman combined so they are of two persons causing them to be stronger. I refuse to believe that we are not above normal. But now it is different. All the things I do are of God.<br><br>Kaanib.Net: How do you comment on people who talk of the sudden changes in you?<br><br>Amor: <span style="color: blue;">I may not be beautiful for them anymore.

So they lift up and quote certain chapters and verses from the Bible associated with this issue and regard them as divine truth revealed by God. The Bible is a difficult book written by inspired men and women of faith believing that it was revealed to them. At one time they even claim that it was dictated by God and they just recorded it. Soon it was realised that it was not dictation but interpretation of what they believed to be GodÂ’s revelation.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Let us look at 1 Corinthians 6:9. <span style="color: red;">The two Greek words malakoi and arsenokoitai have been translated differently at different times in different versions of the Bible in English.</span> The King James Version in 1611 regarded them to mean those who are effeminate and abusers of themselves with mankind, which was close to the Greek meaning.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">The original Revised Standard Version (the New Testament first appeared in 1946) was the first translation ever to use the word "homosexual.Â” </span>It translated the two words to mean homosexuals or sexual perverts. Then in 1978 the New International Version translated them as male prostitutes and homosexual offenders. It was the New Revised Version in 1989 which renders them as male prostitutes and sodomites. It must be noted that the word homosexual was not used in the earlier period. It was in 1180 that the word sodomy was first used. <span style="color: orange;">There is no such word as "sodomite" in the original languages (Ezekiel 16:49-50 describes the sin of Sodom as pride, gluttony, not caring for the poor and needy). </span><br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Heresy!
