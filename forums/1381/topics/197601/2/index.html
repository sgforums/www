Real "pagans" never called themselves such - a pagan exists only in a dichotomy with a Christian. In fact "pagan" was a derogatory term applied by Christians to "pagans".

One fundamentalist who wants to hammer anyone, and is in a multi-faceted position to do so, is like the return of the Inquisition. And frankly, those fundamentalists are not part of mainstream Christianity or one that seeks to further inter-faith dialogue and community peace-hood. Therefore, we should guard against them.</div>
