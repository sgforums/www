            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">Dun think he sound apologetic at all, somemore post this in a anti-christian blog belong to his fren</span><br><br><a href="http://gssq.blogspot.com/2006/06/so.html" rel="nofollow">http://gssq.blogspot.com/2006/06/so.html</a><br><br>So... am I going to hell for this?<br><br>I may be, with hell being a 3-year, $5,000 stay in a Singapore prison.<br><br>But let me tell my story, free from any third-party reporting, and let people judge for themselves what the case is like. Gabriel has kindly consented to allow me to use his blog for my "official press releases", so yeah. I guess I've to thank him, in that sense.<br><br>In January 06, I posted one picture which I found on the now-defunct hamncheez.com as a filler between my regular blog posts (hamncheez.com eventually got shut down due to the owner not wanting to continue paying for its maintenence). This picture eventually came to be known as "Police Annex A" in my case file - the picture of a zombie version of Jesus biting on a little boy's head. (MediaWatchWatch has traced the original picture, and the article and picture has been reproduced here: [Caution! Potentially seditious material.])<br><br>During this period of time, I was actively participating in a online discussion forum on international news, and it just so happenned that the Jyllands-Posten/Mohammed cartoons issue was raised.<br><br>Well, to be honest, the discussion on forum was pretty decent and mature, but inevitably, it went diverged to discuss about Christianity as a reference point, due to the link between the Judeo-Christian-Islam zionist religions. Eventually, there arose a question about the difference in the Christian denominations, to which a particular forum member (we'll call him DP) pointed out that the difference of denominations lay mainly in the different fundamental beliefs; for instance, Catholics had a fundamental belief in Mary, and to believe otherwise, one could still be counted as a Christian, but not a Catholic.<br><br>Shortly after, this known troublemaker (we'll refer to him as FundieP) replies to the post with a very confrontational tone, going "I don't see why poor Mary needs to be dragged into this, and there shouldn't be any discussion about Christianity in the first place; moderators, shut this thread down now, etc."<br><br>Perhaps it was my own experience and distaste with religous fundamentalists which turned me towards renouncing my former religion (being that of Christianity), but I pretty much jumped to DP's defence, insinuating that FundieP was a religous fundamentalist bigot who knew less about his own religion than he should be, with his blind defence of it. Eventually, the thread turned into a flame war, and it was shut down.<br><br>Unfortunately, I used my blog URL as a signature on my forum posts.<br><br>One day after the thread was shut down, I recieved a very curt message from FundieP through the forum's private message system, going "take down the Jesus picture on your blog."<br><br>(It was around that period of time when it was revealed that the dossiers circulated to the Arab world contained extra, much more inflammatory cartoons included by the Danish imams, and were never published in the Jyllands-Posten)<br><br>Probably due to my ironically fundamental view against fundamentalists, I went out of my way to find more pictures to irk FundieP, which eventually came to be known as Police Annexes B, C, and D respertively - licenceplateworld.com - picture of licenceplate saying "Jesus loves you, everyone else thinks you're anasshole"; somethingawful.com, photoshop phriday "sensational news stories" - fake CNN image of Jesus on paper (Potentially seditious link) - third picture; and somethingawful.com, photoshop phriday, "the biggest movie of theyear" - edited photo of Last Temptation of Christ, with Jesus looking at a KFC bucket (Potentially seditious link) - first picture.<br><br>So there's the end of the story, sans the Uniquely Cantoment experience.<br><br>----------<br><br>Many people have been asking me why I decided to actually break the news, considering the fact that I could have stayed in relative anonomity, and have it eventually blow over, with the six month window for obtaining the public prosecutor's decision (Sedition act, chpt 290, 5 (1) No prosecution for an offence under section 4 shall be begun except within 6 months after the offence is committed... (2) No person shall be prosecuted for an offence under section 4 without the written consent of the Public Prosecutor).<br><br>But somehow, I'm guessing that after three and a half months, I do want to let it be known, somewhat. Because it's not about me, but for people to know where the OB markers are, whether the legal system can be hijacked by religious fundamentalists over (possibly) personal issues, and what has been done about it.<br><br>Personally, I do not have issues with Christians per se, despite having de-converted, now being a free-thinker-tending-towards-deism. And on that note, I'd definitely have to thank the number of my personal friends whom, while Christian, have been supportive of me all this while (and it's no small number, considering I pretty much grew up in a Christian environment which included my family and schools).<br><br>With that said, I'd do have to point out that the only people I meant to offend was, in particular, one individual fundamentalist Christian, whom I personally felt was an insult upon the name of his own religion; I felt him no better than the sadistic torturers in the spanish inquisition, nor the "holy knights" committing rape during the crusades. To FundieP, if you're reading this, I hope you will be able to look at the face of whatever god you see at the end of your time, and prouldly say " I have fought the good fight, I have run the race."<br><br>and amen to that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">Char's response to a newspaper article abt him</span><br><br>Singapore's Sedition Act, part deux?<br><br>Hi Zakir,<br><br>Congragulations on your article making the front page of Tuesday's<br>newspaper. I'm certain that "Blogger who posted cartoons of Christ<br>online being investigated." was a lot more eye catching a headline and<br>interesting a storyboard compared to "People left in limbo by police<br>cases", where you quoted me issues such as the Martin See episode,<br>whereby his recording equipment is still being held by the police<br>"pending investigation", in order to get me to agree to your interview<br>last Thursday evening.<br><br>It's no wonder your story did make the headlines, and no wonder the ST<br>is still the most read broadsheet newspaper in Singapore.<br><br>Anyway, here's to clarify a couple of points which probably ended up<br>being edited out in the rush for your story going to print; I will be<br>referring to your original article hereon in.<br><br>(I hope that you don't mind that I've included some friends, bloggers,<br>and the foreign media, of whom are included within the bcc list; so<br>that they'd get the story as well. I'm sure they would be interested<br>to know how I'm doing, as well as what's happenning. Of course, they<br>are very much free and welcome to reproduce and use the contents of<br>this email.)<br><br>----------<br><br>&gt;June 14, 2006<br>Blogger who posted cartoons of Christ online being investigated<br>&gt;By Zakir Hussain<br><br>&gt;A 21-YEAR-OLD accounts assistant is being investigated for allegedly<br>flouting the Sedition Act by publishing pictures on his blog that were<br>thought to depict Jesus Christ in an offensive manner.<br><br>&gt;The blogger, who used the online moniker Char, had found the cartoons<br>on the Internet and began posting them in January.<br><br>[While there is no real issue in this point, it did make it sould like<br>I posted more than four pictures, and was posting them regularly too.]<br><br>&gt;He told The Straits Times last week that he was called in by the<br>police for questioning in March, after they received a complaint.<br><br>[Yes, I was called in by the police for questioning. However, I<br>believe that you failed to note that the complainent had prior<br>dealings with me before, after I implied on a forum that he was a<br>fundamentalist Christian bigot, and that I believed that he had<br>personal issues with my implied insult.]<br><br>&gt;Yesterday, the police confirmed they are investigating the matter but<br>declined to give details as 'investigations are still ongoing'.<br><br>[No issue with that, as I do believe that investigations are still<br>ongoing three and a half months after my computers were siezed, when<br>you mentioned to me that for the first 3 sedition cases, the parties<br>involved were brought to court and sentenced within two months.]<br><br>&gt;News of the investigation was announced online by Char himself last<br>week when he sent an e-mail to a mailing list of more than 300 young<br>Singaporeans. He told them of his experience and how it came about. He<br>removed the cartoons from his blog after he was questioned.<br><br>[Technically, I removed the pictures, then subsequently deleted the<br>blog, on advice of the investigating officer, as the pictures there<br>might "agitate others". My original email on the 7th of June is<br>replicated at:<br>http://gssq.blogspot.com/2006/06/story-friend-of-mine-told-me-while.html]<br><br>&gt;When contacted by The Straits Times, Char asked that he not be<br>identified for he fears he may lose his job, which he wants to keep<br>before entering a local university in August.<br><br>&gt;Describing himself as a free thinker, he said he had posted a cartoon<br>that depicted Jesus as a zombie biting a boy's head in January.<br><br>[Technically, I'm an ex-christian-turned-deist/free thinker.]<br><br>&gt;The following month, he received an online message asking him to<br>remove the image. It came amid the global furore over the publication<br>of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad by several newspapers.<br><br>&gt;Char did not reply to the message but chose to irk the person<br>instead. He searched the Internet for more pictures depicting Jesus<br>and published three of them on his blog.<br><br>[Interesting that by not revealing what exactly I posted after the<br>Jesus zombie picture, it made it seem that my followups were even more<br>offensive, so much so, that they had to be obscured. Perhaps you<br>remember the description of police annexes B, C, and D, right? You did<br>have the printout of the original email when I met you. But<br>respectively, they are: licenceplateworld.com - picture of<br>licenceplate saying "Jesus loves you, everyone else thinks you're an<br>asshole"; somethingawful.com, photoshop phriday "sensational news<br>stories" - fake CNN image of Jesus on paper<br>(http://www.somethingawful.com/index.php?a=3193&amp;p=9) - third picture;<br>and somethingawful.com, photoshop phriday, "the biggest movie of the<br>year" - edited photo of Last Temptation of Christ, with Jesus looking<br>at a KFC bucket (http://www.somethingawful.com/index.php?a=2995&amp;p=5) -<br>first picture.]<br><br>&gt;Looking back, he felt he made an 'unwise' move. 'I never thought<br>anyone would complain to the police because the pictures were not<br>insidious,' he said.<br><br>----------<br><br>I do have to include a point that a friend noted; that it would be<br>interesting to know what exactly IS offensive enough to threaten the<br>population. Otherwise, unchecked, this leads not to preservation of<br>harmony, but the creation of a frivolously litigious society. Or even<br>worse, a frivolous litigation via police proxy society.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">More from Char</span><br><br>Wednesday, June 07, 2006<br><br>A story a friend of mine told me a while back but has just decided to make more public.<br><br>Low crime doesn't mean no crime! I applaud our police for their efforts to keep our streets safe.<br><br>Okay, most of you know that in a couple of my recent mails, I've been hinting strongly about something about me having a few choice words the sedition act.<br><br>Well, here's the catch. I've been arrested, dumped in cantoment's lockup for three and a half hours, had my statement taken twice, and let out on a 10k bail - it's lapsed since then, so I'm no longer on bail. Anyway, the investigation is still "ongoing", with my computer and laptop having been siezed "for investigation".<br><br>The backstory?<br><br>Here goes: Three months back (today's the third month anniversary of my case. whee.), I kind of made an enemy online, thanks to a little flaming session. Back then, it was the height of the Jyllands-Posten/Muhammed pictures issue, and following some moronic arguements of his (We'll call this guy FundieP) on Christianity against someone else, I couldn't help but step in, and pretty much publicly humiliated him.<br><br>Dumb thing however, was that FundieP knew of my blog, thanks to a sigining off signature generated automatically. And being the fundamentalist Christian he was, he sent me a mail, requesting that an earlier cartoon I had on the blog be removed. [Police annex A, taken from hamncheez.com - cartoon of a zombie version of Jesus biting on a little boy's head. Boy is asking "why is my messiah trying to eat my brain?" and line below says "on the third day, Jesus rose from his tomb"]<br><br>Well, to those who know me, I'm strongly anti-fundamentalist, so I dumbly didn't reply to that mail, and instead went to search for a couple more pictures to agitate FundieP. Bad idea. [Police annex B, C, D respectively: licenceplateworld.com - picture of licenceplate saying "jesus loves you, everyone else thinks you're an asshole"; somethingawful.com - fake CNN image of Jesus on paper; and somethingawful.com - edited photo of Last Temptation of Christ, with Jesus looking at a KFC bucket.]<br><br>Well, FundieP made a police report. About 2 weeks later, I had the police knocking, got my computer siezed, was arrested and dumped into hotel Cantoment for 3.5 hours, and let out on bail for breaching 4(1)(c)-290 - our beloved sedition act.<br><br>[4. Â—(1) Any person who Â— (c) prints, publishes, sells, offers for sale, distributes or reproduces any seditious publication; shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction for a first offence to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both, and, for a subsequent offence, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years; and any seditious publication found in the possession of that person or used in evidence at his trial shall be forfeited and may be destroyed or otherwise disposed of as the court directs.]<br><br>6 days before I was due for a three and a half week US trip.<br><br>I was pretty much a nervous wreck those few days, I eventually went, although it took 2 of my best friends (and an insanely high US phone bill) to convince me that I would need the trip - my passport wasn't impounded, and the police extended the bail to 4 weeks to let me fly, although I almost wanted to call the flight off.<br><br>Switch back to present, and well, I've told the story to only a select few so far, but to be honest (and to sound stupid), I never actually decided to read the entire Sedition Act till today, after 3 months. Sure, I read the earlier portions (about section 1-5, but not the later portion. Yes, berate me on my stupidity, but I was seriously freaked out for that long to not notice article 6.<br><br>[Evidence. 6. Cap. 97. (2) No person shall be convicted of any offence referred to in section 4(1)(c) if such person proves that...he did not know and had no reason to believe that the publication had a seditious tendency.]<br><br>and, linking back,<br><br>[Seditious tendency. 3. Â—(1) A seditious tendency is a tendency Â— (e) to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population of Singapore.]<br><br>While Malays and Islam are interwined, it would take a long shot to link Christianity as a dividing issue between races or classes of the population of Singapore.<br><br>For an additional note, the Da Vinci Code would be probably be more seditious, if one goes by the severity of the "evidence" - mildly put, it virtually criminalises Christianity as a conspiracy, and that Christianity itself is illicit (Of course, all monotheist religions claim that all other religions are illicit anyway), plus, its publicity is about a few hundred times more (now showing?) than my now-defunct blog.<br><br>(anyway, I called the police today to ask on the case, as well as my computer, and the investigating officer sounded pretty miffed, just telling me that the case was still "under investigation")</div>

They surrounded the town and demanded that the Cathars be handed over; the demand was refused. The town fell the following day when an abortive sortie was pursued back into the town. Although BÃ©ziers is believed to have held no more than 500 Cathars, the whole population was slaughtered. According to the Cistercian writer Caesar of Heisterbach, one of the leaders of the Crusader army, the Papal legate Arnaud-Amaury, was asked by a Crusader how they might distinguish the Cathars, their enemies, from other citizens. He answered: Caedite eos! Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius" Â— "Kill them, for the Lord knows those who are his own."[1] Contemporary sources give estimates of the number of dead that range between 7,000 and "nearly 20,000"; this highest figure is in Arnaud-Amaury's report to the Pope. The news of the horror at BÃ©ziers quickly spread and many settlements were cowed.<br><br>Note that Cathars and catharism is a form of christianity considered heretical. They hold similiar beliefs to modern day protestanism.<br></div>
