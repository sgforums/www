Linux should be easy for you to pick up. I am currently using RedHat 7.3. I have experimented with Suse, Mandrake and ASPLinux. Apart from Linux, I tampered with FreeBSD. So far, I think I like Redhat most. One can safely say that most of the linux programs online can work in the Redhat distro and RPMS rarely become an issue unlike Suse linux{No offense to Suse users, just that you know RPMs can be a pain in the neck at times <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">}<br><br>Debian and Slackware are sort of the harder ones to install...but it will allow you to gain most knowledge. I would suggest Redhat or Mandrake first and moving on to Debian or Slackware when you are more confident.</div>
