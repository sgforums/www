Also, nurses are not united here - instead of agreeing with your points and standing behind you so we can all present a united front and fight for better terms and working conditions for ourselves, the likelier scenario will be nurses trying to do the one-up on each other.  For instance, if you say we could do with less bullying in the workplace, there'll definitely be a handful who'll grab the opportunity to curry favour, lick boots and retort with smart aleck comments like 'Oh, you are so negative!  There's no bullying, you're too sensitive!  People are just trying to correct you and teach you and it's for your own good' or something along that thread.  Instead of saying, 'Yes, it's time things change for the better', they'll say, 'Oh, you're the one at fault.  I don't have such problems' thus implying that they're the model employee.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> With short-sighted, nasty folks like that for colleagues, who needs enemies, really?  hahaha!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I am considering Australia, specifically Perth.  I've got a best friend who migrated to Sydney with her husband, both non-nurses, and she keeps complaining about the high cost of living there.  She studied in Perth for almost 8 years and loves it deeply and she keeps recommending Perth to me.  I heard that it's a pretty laid-back place and I'm not so sure that I can get used to the less vibrant shopping and makan scene there but the scenic photos of Perth just wow me totally!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Besides, the salary there isn't that much lower compared to Sydney but the cost of living is much lower!  Sounds like a better deal to me.  I'm eyeing this hospital there that has a Neuroscience Ward with a High Dependancy Unit as well as an ICU.  It's also a teaching hospital for Post-graduate Diploma (what we call the Advanced Dip in Singapore) so it ties in with my goals.<br><br>I haven't read anything about Victoria yet but shall do so now that you recommend the place.  Thanks!<br><br>I'll be attending a talk held by a US Nursing Recruitment company soon.  I actually had the privilege of attending a clinical attachment in a US hospital and it was a real eye-opener and till today, I regret having boarded the flight back.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Anyways, like the Chinese say, 'good horses never eat grass from the pastures they left behind'.  (hao mah bu chi hui tou cao)  Someday, I might be back in the US working and studying for my Masters.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div></blockquote>Hrm ...neuroscience - if you want neurosurgical I can tell you , my hospital is the forefront  neurosurg hospital in australia  www.mh.org.au  Royal Melbourne Hospital - they do research there . I know a few people there so I can talk to them if you are interested. <strong>  RMH sponsors you for post grad dip  as well if you are pr and worked for them at least one year.</strong>  Most of the experimental surgery is carried out in RMH . They are smack in the middle of the research triangle . Helipad is operational soon as well as trauma care units. RMH just been upgraded to level 1 trauma center . Alfred however is still the established trauma center.<br><br>ICU - more of Alfred Hospital in victoria . www.alfred.org.au - they are also looking for overseas staff . Don't do private hospitals . they are no good here.<br><br>If you go to the talk on US nursing : ask them how much  your indemnity will cost and how are u insured against healthcare (HMO costs) . Their healthcare costs is expensive . You fall sick  , you have to get insurer to pay and you really need indemnity if you want to do icu.</div>

I did my degree in australia and got my registration in NSW which I transferred to Victoria.<br><br>Melbourne is pretty good. Nurse patient ratios are best among other states : 1 nurs to 4 patients . U just need to find a partner to help u around. Yes you can get pr but never ever let the hospital bond u through the employer sponsorship - 3 years . You apply for it yourself through skilled migration onshore. I think it is better to apply now though if you have 1 more year of bond to go . I got mine in 1 year, my friend who applied recently got it in 7 months.<br><br>Better to arrive as pr than not arrive as PR. Medicare card can save u alot. Medical costs are expensive here. Post registration bachelor degree course will also be cheaper for PRs - about 4.8k per anum because nursing is now a priority area.  Alternatively work first then wait for PR then do a post reg bachelor. Before you go, make sure you confirm a job with someone first then go because rent is bloody expensive in australia.<br><br>Visit Alfred hospital too . http://www.alfred.org.au - pretty good for a trauma level 1 center, they are the only hospital who do heart lung transplants as well and have a burns unit.<br><br>If you have any more questions ...feel free to post <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I got a shock to find out the nurse helping me to clean a patient was my NUM when I was new.<br><br>Second : bonding - is to get you stuck with the hospital <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> . With so many turnovers, hospital needs to bind you into the system. Over in australia they bond you for 6 months if you take a post grad dip<br><br>Third : Uniform is actually good I think .....because I hate buying work clothes outside and get told it is not suitable LOL. We have a lot of smokers amongst nurses here in australia  ...so uniform is not a good idea .<br><br>4th: Nights here in australia can be this bad but u can negotiate with NUM ...I just took the way out and fixed my nights ...muahahah<br><br>5th : Singapore follows the UK system still . If you want to work in UK , no problem . I only see UK nurses coming to Australia not the other way around.<br><br>6th :Full time here is  5 day weeks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> 1.5 times pay on weekends . ADO every month ( an extra day off)  . Problem : no maternity or hospitalization benefits ...Solved : public health care cost near to nil.<br><br></div>
