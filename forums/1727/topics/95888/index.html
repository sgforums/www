While over here, State of Victoria has been pressured by nurses' strike april this year to keep 4pt to 1 nurse ratio , increase pay by another 3%. There were a few strikes early this year , teacher strikes, tram driver strikes...etc.<br><br>So basically if you want change , striking is not really an option for Singapore - u get arrested . It is up to the goodwill of the Health minister regarding the welfare of nurses. They only implement incentives when the health ministry sees a large exodus of nurses .</div>

Doctors do backstab each other but not in front of people. Nurses however berate each other in front of people . That culture needs to be changed. When my mom was hospitalised , I have seen nursing officers back home scolding their junior staff  in the corridor for not doing this not doing that.<br><br>However UK there is a split between old school and new school nurses. UK nurses are still stuck in handmaiden roles unless you are referring to USA.   I know a few nurses from UK and they told me that they were supposed to prepare files in the morning, follow the consultants on their rounds and do what the doctors say still - similar to singapore.</div>

First of all if NUS  want to establish a masters in nursing , theorectically it should establish a bachelor program for the nursing poly grads. The reason why they don't encourage degree in nurses - it pushes their cost coefficent up when it comes to payin for manpower.<br>I just think that it is just a superficial show to exhibit "their recognition".<br><br></div>

Pay from our hard earned money for the piece of paper qualification lor <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote>You know me...I pretty much guess who you were from ah tong and ur birth year.<br><br>The reason why they are implementing all these degrees now is not because of paper chase. It is to give you guys a chance to study in Singapore since it is cheaper and of course , not to let you guys see other places overseas . Why go overseas when you have a cheaper degree at home (reasonable mentality) .  Good ones who are highly unlikely  to migrate out,  train overseas with government bonds. This much I know.<br><br>Like people in my university back then , 10 singaporeans/singapore pr I know  came over .....only 4  remained in Singapore. One talking to me now about returning to australia. I only know there are quite a few singaporean nurses out here in my area to form a club - all say the same thing about back home but in front of australian colleagues, we say everything is good everything is perfect ...like mey hiam buay pai , but inside we are thinking  ai hiam kana sai .<br><br>In Singapore I remember I had to take over extra patients back then ...and I work like shit til 12 mn because night staff say it's my problem.  Always a few sick calls and then u take over sick colleague's patients...then if not done...the phrase was called " you don't have time management". Sorry I learn a phrase here if they ask me to take extra over here : PATIENT SAFETY , NURSES' SAFETY. There are far more in depth politics if you observe. Only the selected exclusive club are allowed to go overseas to train ( matron sorta hinted that concept to me when I spoke to her) . Go guess who those are.<br><br>So about nurses staying back because of incentives... ...ha ha ha....sure they are staying back but count how many got out to USA/UK/Australia over the years. I am not encouraging mass migration of nurses. Singapore needs the nurses but nurses need some more recognition instead of cursory ones. Yes we can always employ foreigners ....they are so much cheaper, keep cost down. Foreigners also use singapore to jump to australia.....I got a few here in australia laughing at singapore ....and I tekan them when I can, quietly of course but that really infuriates me. What to do? No one, other than those who truly want to do nursing,  wants to do nursing except in times of joblessness.<br><br>You guys don't have the power to say anything because union is virtually good for getting ntuc discounts at supermart , booking a chalet ,or playing bingo at the ntuc club. You say a single thing against them...u get marked ...in your career in everything  unless you have connections. Like me , I connected out of the country .<br><br>At least over here , I have indemnity insurance, my union retains a law firm in case of any disputes , we have 3% pay increments every year now, fixed patient ratios ( meaning the hospital cannot dump any more patients on us above the quota - they have to engage an extra nurse from agency or bank or we shut down beds).<br><br>I don't care about how much it will cost the health system to provide better nursing conditions which directly affects patients. Human life is priceless , nurses are humans , so are patients.<br><br>What I have a problem with is also the individual is responsible for health thing.  Not every health issue is linked to individual responsibility like what they are telling us back home. So if you are a non smoker and u got cancer.....maybe it's the food u eat....so you are responsible for your medical bills.what kind of bullshit is this?<br><br>So there goes my general opinion about our wealthier health system .....when I compare it with the underfunded health system in australia which is doing its best to hang on.<br><br>Not that nurses don't want to serve. But really like the banner of the  Australian Nurses Federation (nurses' union) : Care for nurses because they care for you.</div>

That much I can tell you <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> . Don't do anything , just go overseas like me .  Be nice to sisters. They are your references and Australians like to check references , and english sometimes....americans also. If they have to make that long distance call , they will. They checked on my references (I was lucky I was working for a nice doctor when I got out of the hospital system) , they called up my ex boss, nyp lecturer and university lecturer.<br><br>If I were you  , tip : Australia , Victoria to be specific. The ratios there are good , pay is not as good as sydney but environment is ok . Join the union and get indemnity insurance (which is included in union fees). The Union (australia nurses' federation) retains a law firm for nurses' usage.<br>Not as high tech as Singapore but surroundings are comfortable. You are expected to take on more responsibility depending on where you are. Medical wards - not that much . High dependency wards or specialised surgical wards - alot. I worked in neurosurgical HDU before , neurosurg ward , now in medical ward because my nursing unit manager allowed me to pick my days of work . Once Singapore train you , australia become damn nice to work ....work is easy peasy if patients are all ok. Crap if the patient has to go to ICU .<br><br>At least in my ward , nursing unit managers and associate nursing managers (the ones we call sisters) are more of the "we can work together " attitude rather than "I command you so you must do".  So far I never seen anyone get yelled at for my whole 3 years here. They are really anti-bullying - you can report a person if they abuse you or yell at you constantly .<br><br>In australia, Doctors do their own clearing of sharps and what's not especially if there is blood , they also get their own files for rounds. When I used to do day shifts ,  I just liked following them on consultant rounds and the consultant gets uneasy about it.<br>He goes " urm nurse u need anything?"<br>I go " I am just doing the rounds"<br>He goes "oh ..I thought nurses didn't want the handmaiden role image, that's why you fellas don't do rounds"<br>I go " well I don't want that , but I like to know what is going on".<br>All his doctors look so uneasy with me trailing them heehee but he also taught me a few things extra .One of them keep asking me "don't u have work to do?" I replied "finished ...now waiting for you to give me more work to do"<br>They do not scream at you unless it is an emergency where everyone is shouting for equipment , help , medical history etc<br><br>No one can initiate any changes in Singapore  - all I see are courtesy changes - nothing spectacular . Degree nurses means increase in health care costs. If nurses want better conditions - means increase in health care costs. How to pay the top like that? Some doctors back home may not want to lose their handmaidens either or their personal right to scream at us, "stupid" is the common scream.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>fymk, hey thanks for your comments.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I do sometimes feel that it will be futile to even attempt to write to Forum because I do suspect that they will not publish it.  Also, nurses are not united here - instead of agreeing with your points and standing behind you so we can all present a united front and fight for better terms and working conditions for ourselves, the likelier scenario will be nurses trying to do the one-up on each other.  For instance, if you say we could do with less bullying in the workplace, there'll definitely be a handful who'll grab the opportunity to curry favour, lick boots and retort with smart aleck comments like 'Oh, you are so negative!  There's no bullying, you're too sensitive!  People are just trying to correct you and teach you and it's for your own good' or something along that thread.  Instead of saying, 'Yes, it's time things change for the better', they'll say, 'Oh, you're the one at fault.  I don't have such problems' thus implying that they're the model employee.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> With short-sighted, nasty folks like that for colleagues, who needs enemies, really?  hahaha!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I am considering Australia, specifically Perth.  I've got a best friend who migrated to Sydney with her husband, both non-nurses, and she keeps complaining about the high cost of living there.  She studied in Perth for almost 8 years and loves it deeply and she keeps recommending Perth to me.  I heard that it's a pretty laid-back place and I'm not so sure that I can get used to the less vibrant shopping and makan scene there but the scenic photos of Perth just wow me totally!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Besides, the salary there isn't that much lower compared to Sydney but the cost of living is much lower!  Sounds like a better deal to me.  I'm eyeing this hospital there that has a Neuroscience Ward with a High Dependancy Unit as well as an ICU.  It's also a teaching hospital for Post-graduate Diploma (what we call the Advanced Dip in Singapore) so it ties in with my goals.<br><br>I haven't read anything about Victoria yet but shall do so now that you recommend the place.  Thanks!<br><br>I'll be attending a talk held by a US Nursing Recruitment company soon.  I actually had the privilege of attending a clinical attachment in a US hospital and it was a real eye-opener and till today, I regret having boarded the flight back.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Anyways, like the Chinese say, 'good horses never eat grass from the pastures they left behind'.
