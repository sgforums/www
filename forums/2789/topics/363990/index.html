              <p><em>Wednesday, June 10, 2009</em><br><br>As astronomers gaze toward nearby 
              planetary systems in search of life, they are focusing their attention on each 
              system's habitable zone, where heat radiated from the star is just right to keep 
              a planet's water in liquid form. <br><br>A number of planets have been 
              discovered orbiting red dwarf stars, which make up about three-quarters of the 
              stars close to our solar system. Potentially habitable planets must orbit close 
              to those stars – perhaps one-fiftieth the distance of Earth to the sun – since 
              those stars are smaller and generate less heat than our sun. <br><br>But new 
              calculations indicate that, with planets so close, tidal forces exerted on 
              planets by the parent star's gravity could limit what is regarded as a star's 
              habitable zone and change the criteria for planets where life could potentially 
              take root. <br><br>Scientists believe liquid water is essential for life. But a 
              planet also must have plate tectonics to pull excess carbon from its atmosphere 
              and confine it in rocks to prevent runaway greenhouse warming. Tectonics, or the 
              movement of the plates that make up a planet's surface, typically is driven by 
              radioactive decay in the planet's core, but a star's gravity can cause tides in 
              the planet, which creates more energy to drive plate tectonics. <br><br>"If you 
              have plate tectonics, then you can have long-term climate stability, which we 
              think is a prerequisite for life," said Rory Barnes, a University of Washington 
              postdoctoral researcher in astronomy. <br><br>However, tectonic forces cannot be 
              so severe that geologic events quickly repave a planet's surface and destroy 
              life that might have gotten a foothold, he said. The planet must be at a 
              distance where tugging from the star's gravitational field generates tectonics 
              without setting off extreme volcanic activity that resurfaces the planet in too 
              short a time for life to prosper. <br><br>Barnes is lead author of a paper to be 
              published by The Astrophysical Journal Letters that uses new calculations from 
              computer modeling to define a "tidal habitable zone." Co-authors are Brian 
              Jackson and Richard Greenberg from the University of Arizona and Sean Raymond 
              from the University of Colorado. The research was funded by NASA. 
              <br><br>"Overall, the effect of this work is to reduce the number of habitable 
              environments in the universe, or at least what we have thought of as habitable 
              environments," Barnes said. "The best places to look for habitability are where 
              this new definition and the old definition overlap." <br><br>The new 
              calculations have implications for planets previously considered too small for 
              habitability. An example is Mars, which used to experience tectonics but that 
              activity ceased as heat from the planet's decaying inner core dissipated. 
              <br><br>But as planets get closer to their suns, the gravitational pull gets 
              stronger, tidal forces increase and more energy is released. If Mars were to 
              move closer to the sun, the sun's tidal tugs could possibly restart the 
              tectonics, releasing gases from the core to provide more atmosphere. If Mars 
              harbors liquid water, at that point it could be habitable for life as we know 
              it. <br><br>Various moons of Jupiter have long been considered as potentially 
              harboring life. But one of them, Io, has so much volcanic activity, the result 
              of tidal forces from Jupiter, that it is not regarded as a good candidate. 
              Tectonic activity remakes Io's surface in less than 1 million years. <br><br>"If 
              that were to happen on Earth, it would be hard to imagine how life would 
              develop," Barnes said. <br><br>A potential Earth-like planet, but eight times 
              more massive, called Gliese 581d was discovered in 2007 about 20 light years 
              away in the constellation Libra. At first it was thought the planet was too far 
              from its sun, Gliese 581, to have liquid water, but recent observations have 
              determined the orbit is within the habitable zone for liquid water. However, the 
              planet is outside the habitable zone for its sun's tidal forces, which the 
              authors believe drastically limits the possibility of life. <br><br>"Our model 
              predicts that tides may contribute only one-quarter of the heating required to 
              make the planet habitable, so a lot of heat from decay of radioactive isotopes 
              may be required to make up the difference," Jackson said. <br><br>Barnes added, 
              "The bottom line is that tidal forcing is an important factor that we are going 
              to have to consider when looking for habitable planets." <br><br>###
