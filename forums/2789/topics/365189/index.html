              <p><em><span style="color: #800000;">Wednesday, June 17, 2009</span></em><span style="color: #993300;"><br><br>A University of Colorado at Boulder 
                  research team has discovered the first definitive evidence of shorelines on 
                  Mars, an indication of a deep, ancient lake there and a finding with 
                  implications for the discovery of past life on the Red Planet. <br><br>Estimated 
                  to be more than 3 billion years old, the lake appears to have covered as much as 
                  80 square miles and was up to 1,500 feet deep -- roughly the equivalent of Lake 
                  Champlain bordering the United States and Canada, said CU-Boulder Research 
                  Associate Gaetano Di Achille, who led the study. The shoreline evidence, found 
                  along a broad delta, included a series of alternating ridges and troughs thought 
                  to be surviving remnants of beach deposits. <br><br>"This is the first 
                  unambiguous evidence of shorelines on the surface of Mars," said Di Achille. 
                  "The identification of the shorelines and accompanying geological evidence 
                  allows us to calculate the size and volume of the lake, which appears to have 
                  formed about 3.4 billion years ago." <br><br>A paper on the subject by Di 
                  Achille, CU-Boulder Assistant Professor Brian Hynek and CU-Boulder Research 
                  Associate Mindi Searls, all of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, 
                  has been published online in Geophysical Research Letters, a publication of the 
                  American Geophysical Union. <br><br>Images used for the study were taken by a 
                  high-powered camera known as the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment, or 
                  HiRISE. Riding on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, HiRISE can resolve 
                  features on the surface down to one meter in size from its orbit 200 miles above 
                  Mars. <br><br>An analysis of the HiRISE images indicate that water carved a 
                  30-mile-long canyon that opened up into a valley, depositing sediment that 
                  formed a large delta. This delta and others surrounding the basin imply the 
                  existence of a large, long-lived lake, said Hynek, also an assistant professor 
                  in CU-Boulder's geological sciences department. The lake bed is located within a 
                  much larger valley known as the Shalbatana Vallis. <br><br>"Finding shorelines 
                  is a Holy Grail of sorts to us," said Hynek. <br><br>In addition, the evidence 
                  shows the lake existed during a time when Mars is generally believed to have 
                  been cold and dry, which is at odds with current theories proposed by many 
                  planetary scientists, he said. "Not only does this research prove there was a 
                  long-lived lake system on Mars, but we can see that the lake formed after the 
                  warm, wet period is thought to have dissipated." <br><br>Planetary scientists 
                  think the oldest surfaces on Mars formed during the wet and warm Noachan epoch 
                  from about 4.1 billion to 3.7 billion years ago that featured a bombardment of 
                  large meteors and extensive flooding. The newly discovered lake is believed to 
                  have formed during the Hesperian epoch and postdates the end of the warm and wet 
                  period on Mars by 300 million years, according to the study. <br><br>The deltas 
                  adjacent to the lake are of high interest to planetary scientists because deltas 
                  on Earth rapidly bury organic carbon and other biomarkers of life, according to 
                  Hynek. Most astrobiologists believe any present indications of life on Mars will 
                  be discovered in the form of subterranean microorganisms. <br><br>But in the 
                  past, lakes on Mars would have provided cozy surface habitats rich in nutrients 
                  for such microbes, Hynek said. <br><br>The retreat of the lake apparently was 
                  rapid enough to prevent the formation of additional, lower shorelines, said Di 
                  Achille. The lake probably either evaporated or froze over with the ice slowly 
                  turning to water vapor and disappearing during a period of abrupt climate 
                  change, according to the study. <br><br>Di Achille said the newly discovered 
                  pristine lake bed and delta deposits would be would be a prime target for a 
                  future landing mission to Mars in search of evidence of past life. <br><br>"On 
                  Earth, deltas and lakes are excellent collectors and preservers of signs of past 
                  life," said Di Achille. "If life ever arose on Mars, deltas may be the key to 
                  unlocking Mars' biological past." <br><br>### <br><br>University of Colorado at
