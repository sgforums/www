              <p><em>Monday, June 15, 2009</em><br><br>Astronomers have at last uncovered 
              newborn stars at the frenzied center of our Milky Way galaxy. The discovery was 
              made using the infrared vision of NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. <br><br>The 
              heart of our spiral galaxy is cluttered with stars, dust and gas, and at its 
              very center, a supermassive black hole. Conditions there are harsh, with fierce 
              stellar winds, powerful shock waves and other factors that make it difficult for 
              stars to form. Astronomers have known that stars can form in this chaotic place, 
              but they're baffled as to how this occurs. Confounding the problem is all the 
              dust standing between us and the center of our galaxy. Until now, nobody had 
              been able to definitively locate any baby stars. <br><br>"These stars are like 
              needles in a haystack," said Solange Ramirez, the principal investigator of the 
              research program at NASA's Exoplanet Science Institute at the California 
              Institute of Technology, Pasadena. "There's no way to find them using optical 
              light, because dust gets in the way. We needed Spitzer's infrared instruments to 
              cut through the dust and narrow in on the objects." <br><br>The team plans to 
              look for additional baby stars in the future, and ultimately to piece together 
              what types of conditions allow stars to form in such an inhospitable environment 
              as our galaxy's core. <br><br>"By studying individual stars in the galactic 
              center, we can better understand how stars are formed in different interstellar 
              environments," said Deokkeun An of the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center 
              at Caltech, lead author of a paper submitted for publication in the 
              Astrophysical Journal. "The Milky Way galaxy is just one of more than hundreds 
              of billions of galaxies in the visible universe. However, our galaxy is so 
              special because we can take a closer look at its individual stellar components." 
              An started working on this program while a graduate student at Ohio State 
              University, Columbus, under the leadership of Ohio State astronomer Kris 
              Sellgren, the co-investigator on the project. <br><br>The core of the Milky Way 
              is a mysterious place about 600 light-years across (light would take 600 years 
              to travel from one end to the other). While this is just a fraction of the size 
              of the entire Milky Way, which is about 100,000 light-years across, the core is 
              stuffed with 10 percent of all the gas in the galaxy -- and loads and loads of 
              stars. <br><br>Before now, there were only a few clues that stars can form in 
              the galaxy's core. Astronomers had found clusters of massive adolescent stars, 
              in addition to clouds of charged gas -- a sign that new stars are beginning to 
              ignite and ionize surrounding gas. Past attempts had been unsuccessful in 
              finding newborn stars, or as astronomers call them, young stellar objects. 
              <br><br>Ramirez and colleagues began their search by scanning large Spitzer 
              mosaics of our galactic center. They narrowed in on more than 100 candidates, 
              but needed more detailed data to confirm the stars' identities. Young stellar 
              objects, when viewed from far away, can look a lot like much older stars. Both 
              types of stars are very dusty, and the dust lying between us and them obscures 
              the view even further. <br><br>To sort through the confusion, the astronomers 
              looked at their candidate stars with Spitzer's spectrograph – an instrument that 
              breaks light apart to reveal its rainbow-like array of infrared colors. 
              Molecules around stars leave imprints in their light, which the spectrograph can 
              detect. <br><br>The results revealed three stars with clear signs of youth, for 
              example, certain warm, dense gases. These youthful features are found in other 
              places in the galaxy where stars are being formed. <br><br>"It is amazing to me 
              that we have found these stars," said Ramirez. "The galactic center is a very 
              interesting place. It has young stars, old stars, black holes, everything. We 
              started mining a catalog of about 1 million sources and managed to find three 
              young stars -- stars that will help reveal the secrets at the core of the Milky 
              Way." <br><br>The young stellar objects are all less than about 1 million years 
              old. They are embedded in cocoons of gas and dust, which will eventually flatten 
              to disks that, according to theory, later lump together to form planets.
