              <p><em>Monday, June 15, 2009</em><br><br>The controversial new paper published in 
              New Journal of Physics (co-owned by the Institute of Physics and the German 
              Physical Society), 'Secular variation of the Earth's magnetic field: induced by 
              the ocean flow?', will deflect geophysicists' attention from postulated motion 
              of conducting fluids in the Earth's core, the twentieth century's answer to the 
              mysteries of geomagnetism and magnetosphere. <br><br>Professor Gregory Ryskin 
              from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science at Northwestern 
              University in Illinois, US, has defied the long-standing convention by applying 
              equations from magnetohydrodynamics to our oceans' salt water (which conducts 
              electricity) and found that the long-term changes (the secular variation) in the 
              Earth's main magnetic field are possibly induced by our oceans' circulation. 
              <br><br>With calculations thus confirming Ryskin's suspicions, there were also 
              time and space correlations - specific indications of the integral relationship 
              between the oceans and our magnetospheric buffer. For example, researchers had 
              recorded changes in the intensity of current circulation in the North Atlantic; 
              Ryskin shows that these appear strongly correlated with sharp changes in the 
              rate of geomagnetic secular variation ("geomagnetic jerks"). <br><br>Tim Smith, 
              senior publisher of the New Journal of Physics, said, "This article is 
              controversial and will no doubt cause vigorous debate, and possibly strong 
              opposition, from some parts of the geomagnetism community. As the author 
              acknowledges, the results by no means constitute a proof but they do suggest the 
              need for further research into the possibility of a direct connection between 
              ocean flow and the secular variation of the geomagnetic field." <br><br>In the 
              early 1920s, Einstein highlighted the large challenge that understanding our 
              Magnetosphere poses. It was later suggested that the Earth's magnetic field 
              could be a result of the flow of electrically-conducting fluid deep inside the 
              Earth acting as a dynamo. <br><br>In the second half of the twentieth century, 
              the dynamo theory, describing the process through which a rotating, convecting, 
              and electrically conducting fluid acts to maintain a magnetic field, was used to 
              explain how hot iron in the outer core of the Earth creates a magnetosphere. 
              <br><br>The journal paper also raises questions about the structure of our 
              Earth's core. <br><br>Familiar text book images that illustrate a flow of hot 
              and highly electrically-conducting fluid at the core of the Earth are based on 
              conjecture and could now be rendered invalid. As the flow of fluids at the 
              Earth's core cannot be measured or observed, theories about changes in the 
              magnetosphere have been used, inversely, to infer the existence of such flow at 
              the core of the Earth. <br><br>While Ryskin's research looks only at long-term 
              changes in the Earth's magnetic field, he points out that, "If secular variation 
              is caused by the ocean flow, the entire concept of the dynamo operating in the 
              Earth's core is called into question: there exists no other evidence of 
              hydrodynamic flow in the core." <br><br>On a practical level, it means the next 
              time you use a compass you might need to thank the seas and oceans for 
              influencing the force necessary to guide the way. <br><br>Dr Raymond Shaw, 
              professor of atmospheric physics at Michigan Technological University, said, "It 
              should be kept in mind that the idea Professor Ryskin is proposing in his paper, 
              if valid, has the potential to deem irrelevant the ruling paradigm of 
              geomagnetism, so it will be no surprise to find individuals who are strongly 
              opposed or critical." <br><br>### <br><br>Institute of Physics</p>
