              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><br>Roughly a billion years from now, the ever-increasing radiation from the sun 
              will have heated Earth into inhabitability; the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere 
              that serves as food for plant life will disappear, pulled out by the weathering 
              of rocks; the oceans will evaporate; and all living things will disappear. 
              <br><br>Or maybe not quite so soon, say researchers from the California 
              Institute of Technology (Caltech), who have come up with a mechanism that 
              doubles the future lifespan of the biosphere—while also increasing the chance 
              that advanced life will be found elsewhere in the universe. <br><br>A paper 
              describing their hypothesis was published June 1 in the early online edition of 
              the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). <br><br>Earth 
              maintains its surface temperatures through the greenhouse effect. Although the 
              planet's greenhouse gases—chiefly water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane—have 
              become the villain in global warming scenarios, they're crucial for a habitable 
              world, because they act as an insulating blanket in the atmosphere that absorbs 
              and radiates thermal radiation, keeping the surface comfortably warm. <br><br>As 
              the sun has matured over the past 4.5 billion years, it has become both brighter 
              and hotter, increasing the amount of solar radiation received by Earth, along 
              with surface temperatures. Earth has coped by reducing the amount of carbon 
              dioxide in the atmosphere, thus reducing the warming effect. (Despite current 
              concerns about rising carbon dioxide levels triggering detrimental climate 
              change, the pressure of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has dropped some 
              2,000-fold over the past 3.5 billion years; modern, man-made increases in 
              atmospheric carbon dioxide offset a fraction of this overall decrease.) 
              <br><br>The problem, says Joseph L. Kirschvink, the Nico and Marilyn Van Wingen 
              Professor of Geobiology at Caltech and a coauthor of the PNAS paper, is that 
              "we're nearing the point where there's not enough carbon dioxide left to 
              regulate temperatures following the same procedures." <br><br>Kirschvink and his 
              collaborators Yuk L. Yung, a Caltech professor of planetary science, and 
              graduate students King-Fai Li and Kaveh Pahlevan, say that the solution is to 
              reduce substantially the total pressure of the atmosphere itself, by removing 
              massive amounts of molecular nitrogen, the largely nonreactive gas that makes up 
              about 78 percent of the atmosphere. This would regulate the surface temperatures 
              and allow carbon dioxide to remain in the atmosphere, to support life, and could 
              tack an additional 1.3 billion years onto Earth's expected lifespan. <br><br>In 
              the "blanket" analogy for greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide would be represented 
              by the cotton fibers making up the blanket. "The cotton weave may have holes, 
              which allow heat to leak out," explains Li, the lead author of the paper. 
              <br><br>"The size of the holes is controlled by pressure," Yung says. "Squeeze 
              the blanket," by increasing the atmospheric pressure, "and the holes become 
              smaller, so less heat can escape. With less pressure, the holes become larger, 
              and more heat can escape," he says, helping the planet to shed the extra heat 
              generated by a more luminous sun. <br><br>Strikingly, no external influence 
              would be necessary to take nitrogen out of the air, the scientists say. Instead, 
              the biosphere itself would accomplish this, because nitrogen is incorporated 
              into the cells of organisms as they grow, and is buried with them when they die. 
              <br><br>In fact, "This reduction of nitrogen is something that may already be 
              happening," says Pahlevan, and that has occurred over the course of Earth's 
              history. This suggests that Earth's atmospheric pressure may be lower now than 
              it was earlier in the planet's history. <br><br>Proof of this hypothesis may 
              come from other research groups that are examining the gas bubbles formed in 
              ancient lavas to determine past atmospheric pressure: the maximum size of a 
              forming bubble is constrained by the amount of atmospheric pressure, with higher 
              pressures producing smaller bubbles, and vice versa. <br><br>If true, the 
              mechanism also would potentially occur on any extrasolar planet with an 
              atmosphere and a biosphere. <br><br>"Hopefully, in the future we will not only 
              detect Earth-like planets around other stars but learn something about their 
              atmospheres and the ambient pressures," Pahlevan says. "And if it turns out that 
              older planets tend to have thinner atmospheres, it would be an indication that 
              this process has some universality." <br><br>Adds Yung: "We can't wait for the 
              experiment to occur on Earth. It would take too long. But if we study 
              exoplanets, maybe we will see it. Maybe the experiment has already been done." 
              <br><br>Increasing the lifespan of our biosphere—from roughly 1 billion to 2.3 
              billion years—has intriguing implications for the search for life elsewhere in 
              the universe. The length of the existence of advanced life is a variable in the 
              Drake equation, astronomer Frank Drake's famous formula for estimating the 
              number of intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations in the galaxy. Doubling the 
              duration of Earth's biosphere effectively doubles the odds that intelligent life 
              will be found elsewhere in the galaxy. <br><br>"It didn't take very long to 
              produce life on the planet, but it takes a very long time to develop advanced 
              life," says Yung. On Earth, this process took four billion years. "Adding an 
              additional billion years gives us more time to develop, and more time to 
              encounter advanced civilizations, whose own existence might be prolonged by this 
              mechanism. It gives us a chance to meet." <br><br>### <br><br>California
