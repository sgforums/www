              <p><em>Wednesday, June 10, 2009</em><br><br>Astronomers are announcing today that 
              a sequence of images collected with the Smithsonian's Submillimeter Array (SMA) 
              clearly reveals the presence of a rotating molecular disk orbiting the young 
              binary star system V4046 Sagittarii. The SMA images provide an unusually vivid 
              snapshot of the process of formation of giant planets, comets, and Pluto-like 
              bodies. The results also confirm that such objects may just as easily form 
              around double stars as around single stars like our Sun. <br><br>These findings 
              are being presented by UCLA graduate student David Rodriguez in a press 
              conference at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Pasadena, Calif. 
              <br><br>"It's a case of seeing is believing," says Joel Kastner of the Rochester 
              (NY) Institute of Technology, the lead scientist on the study. "We had the first 
              evidence for this rotating disk in radio telescope observations of V4046 
              Sagittarii that we made last summer. But at that point, all we had were 
              molecular spectra, and there are different ways to interpret the spectra. Once 
              we saw the image data from the SMA, there was no doubt that we have a rotating 
              disk here." <br><br>Co-author David Wilner of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for 
              Astrophysics (CfA) adds, "This is strong evidence that planets can form around 
              binary stars, which expands the number of places we can look for extrasolar 
              planets. Somewhere in our galaxy, an alien world may enjoy double sunrises and 
              double sunsets." <br><br>Wilner is one of the world's experts on 
              radiointerferometry, the technique used in this study to form images with the 
              SMA's multiple radio antennas. The other contributor to the SMA study of V4046 
              Sagittarii led by RIT's Kastner and UCLA's Rodriguez is Ben Zuckerman of UCLA. 
              <br><br>According to Rodriguez, the images clearly demonstrate that the 
              molecular disk orbiting the V4046 Sagittarii binary system extends from within 
              the approximate radius of Neptune's orbit out to about 10 times that orbit. This 
              region corresponds to the zone where the solar system's giant planets, as well 
              as its Pluto-like Kuiper Belt objects, may have formed. <br><br>"We believe that 
              V4046 Sagittarii provides one of the clearest examples yet discovered of a 
              Keplerian, planet-forming disk orbiting a young star system," Wilner says. "This 
              particular system is made that much more remarkable by the fact that it consists 
              of a pair of solar-mass stars that are approximately 12 million years old and 
              are separated by a mere 5 solar diameters." <br><br>"This could be the oldest 
              known orbiting protoplanetary molecular disk. It shows that, at least for some 
              stars, formation of Jovian-mass planets may continue well after a few million 
              years, which astronomers have deduced is characteristic of the formation time 
              for most such planets," Zuckerman says. <br><br>Findings of this study build on 
              previous work published in the December 2008 issue of Astronomy and Astrophysics 
              in which Kastner and his team first suggested that the case of V4046 Sagittarii 
              illustrates well how planets may form easily around certain types of binary 
              stars. <br><br>"We thought the molecular gas around these two stars almost 
              literally represented 'smoking gun' evidence of recent or possibly ongoing 
              'giant' Jupiter-like planet formation around the binary star system," Kastner 
              says. "The SMA images showing an orbiting disk certainly support that idea." 
              <br><br>The evidence for a molecular disk orbiting these twin young suns in the 
              constellation Sagittarius suggested to the scientists that many such binary 
              systems should also host as-yet-undetected planets. <br><br>"The most successful 
              technique used so far for the discovery of extrasolar planets - that of 
              measurement of precision radial velocities - is exceedingly difficult for close 
              binary stars such as V4046 Sagittarii. So these radio observations are probing a 
              new region of discovery space for extrasolar planets," says Rodriguez. 
              <br><br>"At a distance of only 240 light-years from the solar system, the V4046 
              Sagittarii binary is at least two times closer to Earth than almost all known 
              planet-forming star systems, which gives us a good shot at imaging any planets 
              that have already formed and are now orbiting the stars," he continues. 
              <br><br>Kastner and collaborators had previously used the 30-meter 
              radiotelescope operated by the Institut de Radio Astronomie Millimetrique (IRAM) 
              to study radio molecular spectra emitted from the vicinity of the twin stars. 
              The scientists used these data to identify the raw materials for planet 
              formation around V4046 Sagittarii - carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide - in 
              the noxious circumstellar gas cloud. <br><br>"In this case the stars are so 
              close together, and the profile of the gas - in terms of the types of molecules 
              that are there - is so much like the types of gaseous disks that we see around 
              single stars, that we now have a direct link between planets forming around 
              single stars and planets forming around double stars," Kastner says. <br><br>###
