              <p><em><span style="color: #666699;">Tuesday, June 9, 2009</span></em><span style="color: #666699;"><br><br>The red supergiant star Betelgeuse, the 
              bright reddish star in the constellation Orion, has steadily shrunk over the 
              past 15 years, according to University of California, Berkeley, researchers. 
              <br><br>Long-term monitoring by UC Berkeley's Infrared Spatial Interferometer 
              (ISI) on the top of Mt. Wilson in Southern California shows that Betelgeuse 
              (bet' el juz), which is so big that in our solar system it would reach to the 
              orbit of Jupiter, has shrunk in diameter by more than 15 percent since 1993. 
              <br><br>Since Betelgeuse's radius is about five astronomical units, or five 
              times the radius of Earth's orbit, that means the star's radius has shrunk by a 
              distance equal to the orbit of Venus. <br><br>"To see this change is very 
              striking," said Charles Townes, a UC Berkeley professor emeritus of physics who 
              won the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics for inventing the laser and the maser, a 
              microwave laser. "We will be watching it carefully over the next few years to 
              see if it will keep contracting or will go back up in size." <br><br>Townes and 
              his colleague, Edward Wishnow, a research physicist at UC Berkeley's Space 
              Sciences Laboratory, will discuss their findings at a 12:40 p.m. PDT press 
              conference on Tuesday, June 9, during the Pasadena meeting of the American 
              Astronomical Society (AAS). The results were published June 1 in The 
              Astrophysical Journal Letters. <br><br>Despite Betelgeuse's diminished size, 
              Wishnow pointed out that its visible brightness, or magnitude, which is 
              monitored regularly by members of the American Association of Variable Star 
              Observers, has shown no significant dimming over the past 15 years. <br><br>The 
              ISI has been focusing on Betelgeuse for more than 15 years in an attempt to 
              learn more about these giant massive stars and to discern features on the star's 
              surface, Wishnow said. He speculated that the measurements may be affected by 
              giant convection cells on the star's surface that are like convection granules 
              on the sun, but so large that they bulge out of the surface. Townes and former 
              graduate student Ken Tatebe observed a bright spot on the surface of Betelgeuse 
              in recent years, although at the moment, the star appears spherically 
              symmetrical. <br><br>"But we do not know why the star is shrinking," Wishnow 
              said. "Considering all that we know about galaxies and the distant universe, 
              there are still lots of things we don't know about stars, including what happens 
              as red giants near the ends of their lives." <br><br>Betelgeuse was the first 
              star ever to have its size measured, and even today is one of only a handful of 
              stars that appears through the Hubble Space Telescope as a disk rather than a 
              point of light. In1921, Francis G. Pease and Albert Michelson used optical 
              interferometry to estimate its diameter was equivalent to the orbit of Mars. 
              Last year, new measurements of the distance to Betelgeuse raised it from 430 
              light years to 640, which increased the star's diameter from about 3.7 to about 
              5.5 AU. <br><br>"Since the 1921 measurement, its size has been re-measured by 
              many different interferometer systems over a range of wavelengths where the 
              diameter measured varies by about 30 percent," Wishnow said. "At a given 
              wavelength, however, the star has not varied in size much beyond the measurement 
              uncertainties." <br><br>The measurements cannot be compared anyway, because the 
              star's size depends on the wavelength of light used to measure it, Townes said. 
              This is because the tenuous gas in the outer regions of the star emits light as 
              well as absorbs it, which makes it difficult to determine the edge of the star. 
              <br><br>The ISI that Townes and his colleagues first built in the early 1990s 
              sidesteps these confounding emission and absorption lines by observing in the 
              mid-infrared with a narrow bandwidth that can be tuned between spectral lines. 
              The ISI consists of three 5.4-foot (1.65-meter) diameter mirrors separated by 
              distances that vary from 12 to 230 feet (4-70 meters), said Townes. Using a 
              laser as a common frequency standard, the ISI interferometer combines signals 
              from telescope pairs in order to determine path length differences between light 
              that originates at the star's center and light that originates at the star's 
              edge. The technique of stellar interferometry is highlighted in the June 2009 
              issue of Physics Today magazine. <br><br>"We observe around 11 microns, the 
              mid-infrared, where this long wavelength penetrates the dust and the narrow 
              bandwidth avoids any spectral lines, and so we see the star relatively 
              undistorted," said Townes. "We have also had the good fortune to have an 
              instrument that has operated in a very similar manner for some 15 years, 
              providing a long and consistent series of measurements that no one else has. The 
              first measurements showed a size quite close to Michelson's result, but over 15 
              years, it has decreased in size about 15 percent, changing smoothly, but faster 
              as the years progressed." <br><br>Townes, who turns 94 in July, plans to 
              continue monitoring Betelgeuse in hopes of finding a pattern in the changing 
              diameter, and to improve the ISI's capabilities by adding a spectrometer to the 
              interferometer. <br><br>"Whenever you look at things with more precision, you 
              are going to find some surprises and uncover very fundamental and important new 
              things," he said. <br><br>### <br><br>University of California - Berkeley</span></p>
