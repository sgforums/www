                                  <p><em>'Fog!" the kids shout excitedly as we round the bend above
                                  Bronte. "Look at the fog!"</em></p>
                                  <p><em>"That's not fog," the adult voice lobs from the front seat like
                                  the wrath of God. "See the dirty brown of it? That's
                                  pollution."</em></p>
                                  <p><em>It put a pall on the conversation, I can tell you. But that pall
                                  was nothing compared with the one that lay across the ocean like a
                                  great brown cat asleep on its sequined cushion. It was 7pm Tuesday.
                                  A stinker of a day. Before dawn, the Bureau of Meteorology had
                                  warned Sydneysiders to avoid outdoor exercise for fear of breathing
                                  difficulties. <span style="color: #ff0000;">In Sydney. Not Beijing. Not Seoul. Sydney.</span></em></p>
                                  <p><em>The pollution was expected to peak at 7pm. But at Bronte, within
                                  that thick brown blanket, the water was clear and cool, the seven
                                  o'clock crowds frolicked oblivious and we with them, almost like
                                  there was no tomorrow.</em></p>
                                  <p><em>Parking was at a premium because, except for the locals and the
                                  leisured few who can wait on the bus system, every one of the
                                  sweltering thousands drove there. Hence the smog.</em></p>
                                  <p><em>This will be remembered as one of the great ironies of modern
                                  planning, that the system we call suburbia, whose main promise was
                                  sunshine and fresh air for all, ended up destroying those things
                                  for everyone. Even now, people - thinking people who should know
                                  better (and do, in fact, but somehow choose not to) - defend
                                  suburbia on the basis of how nice it is to wake up with birds and
                                  trees outside the window.</em></p>
                                  <p><em>And it is nice. There's no denying it. I like. You like it. We
                                  all like it. And that's the point, really. Because just as one
                                  binge is fine but every weekend means you're an alkie, or one house
                                  among the gum trees is fine, but millions? Millions of suburban
                                  houses means millions of cars, millions of smog-belching passenger
                                  kilometres and millions of kids with chronic asthma and
                                  bronchitis.</em></p>
                                  <p><em>And sure, these warnings happen a few times every summer. We're
                                  blase because it's invisible and the sea breezes, we think, blow it
                                  away. Off to someone else's atoll, ready for the sparkling new
                                  South Pacific day.</em></p>
                                  <p><em>In fact, what happens is that the muck drifts around the Sydney
                                  basin for days or weeks, hemmed in by the higher ground and
                                  frequent temperature inversions. Each day, from about mid-morning,
                                  the land breezes waft it out to sea and there it sits, just
                                  offshore, until the afternoon sea breezes send it back, settling it
                                  over all of us but most densely on Sydney's south and west.</em></p>
                                  <p><em>The upshot? Lung cancer hot spots that correlate strongly with
                                  pollution densities and CSIRO figures that show more than twice as
                                  many Australians die from air pollution as on the roads.</em></p>
                                  <div id="contentSwap2" class="pageprint" style="display: none;"><a name="contentSwap2"></a>
                                  <p>Clearly, something must be done. Equally clearly, though, when
                                  it comes to planning, the states, bless them, are one car short of
                                  a traffic jam.</p>
                                  <p>So Rudd made Infrastructure Australia. This is something Labor
                                  governments do. Every 15 years or so they have a go. Whitlam did it
                                  with Tom Uren's gorgeously acronymed but largely ineffectual DURD
                                  (Department of Urban and Regional Development). Keating did it with
                                  Brian Howe's Building Better Cities, which produced Pyrmont, East
                                  Perth and the more worrying Honeysuckle redevelopment in
                                  Newcastle.</p>
                                  <p>But Infrastructure Australia, sadly, is no power grab. In the
                                  child's play of Pulling the Planning Powers Off Governments, the
                                  feds are much kinder to the states, albeit with less reason, than
                                  the states are to local councils.</p>
                                  <p>Infrastructure Australia - don't you hate how they're still
                                  doing that ugly '80s-type nomenclature that makes government
                                  departments look like they're trying to look privatised? - was
                                  invented last year by the same Commonwealth Act that established
                                  COAG, the Council of Australian Governments. It has no planning
                                  powers, but is designed strictly to advise the Infrastructure
                                  Minister, Anthony Albanese, and COAG.</p>
                                  <p>And yet, Infrastructure Australia is seen as the planning hope
                                  for our cities. This is partly because the states - NSW, especially
                                  - seem so without hope in this regard. And partly because it has
                                  always been thus. Even at state level, there are two separate
                                  streams of activity, planning and infrastructure.</p>
                                  <p>Planning, mostly run by women, does the words and pictures;
                                  making and announcing plans (such as the Metro Strategy) that never
                                  hit the ground. Public Works, by contrast, has no strategic
                                  capacity, no cerebellum, but just builds things - roads, tunnels,
                                  bridges and rail lines. This, you will be unsurprised to learn, is
                                  generally a boy thing.</p>
                                  <p>So our cities are shaped not by planners but by ad hoc resource
                                  allocation decisions; a bridge to this marginal electorate, a
                                  tunnel to that donor developer. And it is this quasi-planning power
                                  that the feds hope to usurp.</p>
                                  <p>More power to them. One metro line carries as many people as a
                                  20-lane freeway. A clean, leafy, tower-flanked Parramatta Road
                                  would be a vast improvement on the filthy drain we have now. Far
                                  from destroying the pretty village-like pockets, a decent rail
                                  system will preserve them by concentrating development where it is
                                  most beneficial.</p>
                                  <p>But the Sydney proposals - the $4 billion northern rail freight
                                  corridor, the $4.8 billion CBD Metro and the $8.1 billion West
                                  Metro under Parramatta Road - are three projects out of the 94 in
                                  Infrastructure Australia's report, ranging from housing in the
                                  Pilbara to a South Australia-Darwin fibre optic cable.</p>
                                  <p>The prioritising process is next. We should offer oblations to
                                  the apple-cheeked Ruddbot or the future of our emerald city looks
                                  grubby indeed.</p>
