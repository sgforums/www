              <p>During this lunar new year, me have been ignored and treated like nobody so many times. Me is getting very frustrating.</p>
              <p>1) Office: one colleague came to me cubicle ask me about something. So me stop my own work for awhile out of respect and answer him. Before I finish my sentence, he ran off. So rude. Not the first time he did this to me.</p>
              <p>2) Office: Me suppose to bring some auditor to see one ego logistic manager to check some stock. THe ego logistic manager tell me off to go bring the auditor to check stock myself.</p>
              <p>3) I call a friend to chit chat. When me say goodbye, he never reply goodbye back. So rude.</p>
              <p>4) CNY. Me own cousin who gone Hong Kong for work for 2 years, came back during reunion. So me took initiative to talk to her. As me talk to her, she impatiently look at her watch and then left abruptly before i can finish my sentence. So rude !</p>
              <p>Action:</p>
              <p>1) Go to the stupid colleague. Tell him off for being so rude. Reason he is rude to me: because I didn't want to join his church when he invite me. Tell him me don't want to be part of his stupid church and tell him off that me know that reason for him to be so rude is because he want to attack me for refusing to join his church.</p>
              <p>2) Complain to my boss about this stupid logistic manager. Send out email, cc to all the big boss and scold this stupid logistic manager for not doing his job, instead ask me to do his dirty work. Next time when logistic manager need my help back, I refuse to come out under hot sun to help this jerk to check his stock.</p>
              <p>3) Call this stupid friend more often and harass him. Make obscene phone call. Call until his phone explode and when he pick up, say a lot of complain complain complain. then slam phone without goodbye. This stupid indian friend, never even wish me happy new year.</p>
              <p>4) Complain to uncle auntie about this rude cousin. Give no face wan.</p>
              <p>Time to stand up for myself ! Time to defend myself ! From rude people. I Hate rude people.</p>
