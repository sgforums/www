            <div class='col-md body'>Ok since this is whinehouse apparently i presume this is the right place for me to state my feelings.. Its meant to be a whine and no discrimination..<br><br>Post war baby blooms really create alots of newlives. However,i am really really so sick of meeting/seeing aunties,aunties &amp; aunties everywhere i go.... its holiday for me and apparently i had already switched many jobs.<br><br>i held a optimistic attitude towards each of my job i applied for and sucessfully selected,i've got 3 so far.. one is sales related at cityhall area ,another is factory production and another which im currently working at now at a cafe..  but there aren't really any girls or xmm anywhere.. 3jobs which i had been tru majority of my colleges are all aunties (about 80%)..<br><br>dunno whether there's some adnormal hormones growing in me or is it just a normal symptoms of a teenage boy.After 2 weeks of working in an environment where there are totally no girls to even draw any motivation and sense of belonging,i begin to feel really miserable although i still maintain to put up a professional image infront of my senior management staffs..<br><br>neither was my work with these majority aunties happy.. i have to state clearly that i dun dislike them neither do i hate them.. i feel totally neutral towards them but the lack of girls in an environment where i have to work 8hours++^^ aday is really a pain in my ass..<br><br>Was wondering if these aunties are suffering from menopause..  the only expression from their face seems to be dull and sulky face with a never satisfied expression..  well.. at the very least there could be some sense of life and laughters with some or even just 1 girl around..<br><br>Well,i clearly aware of work quality we have to deliver and i m consistently forcing a smile on my face while keeping my work performance the best i could..  However.. in my previous job's experiences last year i was working under a young female boss coupled with some girls in our working environemnt we only carried a happy-go-lucky attitide towards out work an managed to sustain satifactory achievements from my boss. I brought a smile from my journey to work till the sunsets and into be dreamland..  but seems like availability from girls are limited with Massive amounts of aunties generated from the post war baby bloom in contra to the girls produced in the 90s is seriously unportional or maybe m i jus suay to always get jobs which is filled up with only aunties,aunties and aunties.. seriously.. for a teenage boy to be in an enviroment like this is...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>neither does this aunties' problems appear just in my jobs but as well as academic as well.. i was asked to take part in a tution course in a private school as supplement as i had lost faith in private tutoring with so many fake/inept tutors around..   however to my surprise when i first got into the class which provides tution at night i found the class to be consisits of only pure aunties..  i was like omg?? have i entered the wrong class??  aunties taking secondary school subjects?? i doubled check.. well...... it turns out to be real.. alright imagine again a tuition class that is intensively held with just aunties around..<br>my thought was like-there just seems to be AUNITES EVERYWHERE!<br>TOO MUCH AUNTIES;TOO FEW GIRLS!!!!<br><br>pretty aware that this might also spout some anger from some "aunties" here or ppl of senior generation i repeat -<br>i chose to post this in whinehouse and is taking this only as a whine from a miserable teenage boy...  not meant to carry any hostile ideas nor any discrimination..take it as a whine from a teenage boy maybe with abnormal hormones to carry this kinda feelings....<br><br>-Fireindahouse</div>
