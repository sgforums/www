              <p><br>It happened to me before.  I placed my order loud enough the assistant simply could not be bothered to acknowledge he kept looking down.    I went to collect my order they treated that I did not order and the assistant asked the cook to prepare my order and I have to wait .    I simply walked away went home.       Some hawkers are arrogant just becos they have good business.    I am for teaching them a lesson to make them learn.</p>

              <p>I've ever asked for more chilli sauce packets from a western food hawker....the auntie scolded me for asking. Nah bei........I never patronised that stall again.</p>

              <p>A lot of farked up hawkers around but no point raising your bp over this. Just boycott. Hit them where it hurts...the pocket.</p>
