            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by zorro82:</div><div class="quote_body">Was at serangoon garden around 7pm just now. As i reach there, i head over to 7-11 to have a look at some magazine. Once i was at the magazine corner, i took one of the magazine to have a quick look and place it back. This staff keep asking me whether i am buying the magazine and i replied that i am just looking around. Then she said that i am standing there for a long time and ask again whether i am buying any magazine. Then i tell her that i will not be standing there and keep reading but was already quite pissed by her remarks because i am in the store for less than 2 minutes! Then ok, i wanted to go off and guess what she tell me? "Sir, you want newpaper? Its free." She holds TODAY edition to let me see. I was quite angry and went off.<br><br>Shortly a while, i head back to the store to buy sweets and make my way to the counter. She ask me whether i want the free newspaper and i told her that i am not interested. She then clarify to me that why she was doing that and her rationale. I told her i understand her position not to have customer damaging or reading free magazine but i told her that i was not happy at her remarks and her use of language. She immediately defends herself and tell me that if i am not satisfied with her, she do not mind that i lodge a complaint against her. How rude!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> </div></blockquote>From your post, I don't think she is wrong la...  there are many people reading the mag at the stand and then put back without buying.  In the process the mag got crumbled etc...  she could have been told to look out for free loader ... ( you may look like one - ha ha ) ...  at least she still offer you the free newspaper ...  Anyway, she may have sound rude .. then perhaps she was wrong in that sense ..<br><br>I was at Funan Havey Norman last night checking out Creative MP3 with the intention to buy.  When I approach a sale man, all his answer is " don't know " !! ..  he claimed that the vendor put the product there for display and they do not have any information on the product !.,  Imagine how they sell there ...  when I asked for the manual since got display, he say don't have.  If I want, I can buy one and open the box for the manual.  Then he point to me the counter.  At the counter, there were brochure which have all the specification that answered my question  !!!  swear not to buy from them whenever possible !!!!!!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well...some of ya here may have clearer picture on what the incident happens or perhaps due to my poor describe of my story. I make some clear indication of some pts.<br><br>1) I just took one magazine with a quick browse with less than 10 seconds and by then she ask the qns<br><br>2) when she asked the qns, i have already place back the magazine and just standing there looking at other magazine. Once again, she prompt me with the same qns. Upon opening the door to exit, she ask me this, "Sir, you want newpaper? Free." which i find it sacarstic in my own point of view.<br><br>3) Coming back to the store for 2nd time. Despite that i was not too happy with her choice of words and attitude , i did not scold her off but told her my unhappiness with regards to the incident. As mentioned in the first post, she defend herself and just tell me to go ahead to lodge a complain against her.<br><br>I have worked in front line job before and now working as a retail sales, i would never expect her to challenge me to lodge a complain. I have received a call from their management and was told that they would be looking into it.<br>Perhaps i was not big hearted to accept her free newpaper, i have actually wanted to just forget the incident until she tell me to lodge a complain if i want to.<br><br>As for now, i have forgotten about the issues about it. When i think back about it, i just wondered if this would happen during my secondary school times, lots of colourful words would be coming out from my mouth by then.
