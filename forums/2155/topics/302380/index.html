            <div class='col-md body'>Was at serangoon garden around 7pm just now. As i reach there, i head over to 7-11 to have a look at some magazine. Once i was at the magazine corner, i took one of the magazine to have a quick look and place it back. This staff keep asking me whether i am buying the magazine and i replied that i am just looking around. Then she said that i am standing there for a long time and ask again whether i am buying any magazine. Then i tell her that i will not be standing there and keep reading but was already quite pissed by her remarks because i am in the store for less than 2 minutes! Then ok, i wanted to go off and guess what she tell me? "Sir, you want newpaper? Its free." She holds TODAY edition to let me see. I was quite angry and went off.<br><br>Shortly a while, i head back to the store to buy sweets and make my way to the counter. She ask me whether i want the free newspaper and i told her that i am not interested. She then clarify to me that why she was doing that and her rationale. I told her i understand her position not to have customer damaging or reading free magazine but i told her that i was not happy at her remarks and her use of language. She immediately defends herself and tell me that if i am not satisfied with her, she do not mind that i lodge a complaint against her. How rude!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

As i reach there, i head over to 7-11 to have a look at some magazine. Once i was at the magazine corner, i took one of the magazine to have a quick look and place it back. This staff keep asking me whether i am buying the magazine and i replied that i am just looking around. Then she said that i am standing there for a long time and ask again whether i am buying any magazine. Then i tell her that i will not be standing there and keep reading but was already quite pissed by her remarks because i am in the store for less than 2 minutes! Then ok, i wanted to go off and guess what she tell me? "Sir, you want newpaper? Its free." She holds TODAY edition to let me see. I was quite angry and went off.<br><br>Shortly a while, i head back to the store to buy sweets and make my way to the counter. She ask me whether i want the free newspaper and i told her that i am not interested. She then clarify to me that why she was doing that and her rationale. I told her i understand her position not to have customer damaging or reading free magazine but i told her that i was not happy at her remarks and her use of language. She immediately defends herself and tell me that if i am not satisfied with her, she do not mind that i lodge a complaint against her. How rude!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> </div></blockquote>All the 711 stores hate people reading their magazines... go to Borders.</div>
