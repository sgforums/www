              <p>My friend and I had bad experience taking cab in jB.   The sicko old Malay man charged us extra for being Chinese.    JB cabs now all metre operated for fare charge.     I threatened to complain about him by calling cab company he was very angry and threw his temper at us.    I just paid slightly more than the metre charge rate and told him not to give us change.  I was very firm not to pay extra as he charged on racial discrimination reason.</p>

              <p>I learnt a valuable lesson and thanks every forumers who post your views here.</p>
              <p>1. Never Never pay half or full for to and return trip fare to a driver. Insists pay 1/4, so the 1st driver will come and fetch us home. My bad experience is the driver AH LEAONG (brought us to malacca and then he claim he forgotten) (*&amp;(&amp;(*&amp;(*&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;$^%$^&amp;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Never never engage a johor transport services if you are travelling in small groups. They malaysian people are out to chop sporean money.</p>
              <p>;</p>
              <p>3. Never never give in, if the driver (in my case : AIDIL WVV4164 white 13 seater Chery min bus. Live in Johor, small time groups of managers doing such a dirty tricks on sporean, especially he demand money to stop over for you to take food.</p>
              <p>Also...another bad bad experience, I got injured while staying in malacca hotel! Deep cut on my toe!!!!!</p>
