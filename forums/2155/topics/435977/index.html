              <p>Just 2 days ago was National day, I am soooo sickened to the gut to see so many FTs singing our National Anthem and saying our pledge !!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The influx of foreigners has really spun out of control. I cant go anywhere without seeing some fellas from Pinoy, PRC, or Blangadesh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I almost puked when I heard the National Day rally speech. All the booze talk in accepting foreigners within our midst.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many PMETs are jobless nowadays due to the influx of foreigners and there is also a lack of legislation protecting the aged workers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Singapore, once you hit 40s, employers tend to shun us as if we are useless by that age when in fact, we can be  the most experienced and productive workers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With a wide pool of workers to choose from, they will go for the cheapest, most abled and youngest. Aged PMETs will face a lot of unfair competition from foreign workers nowadays.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Remember, we were told FT increases our pay? and now due to massive influx, the pay goes lower and lower.</p>
              <p>And honestly, i got mba friend still looking for job almost coming to 2 years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because of this influx of foreigners, many pple including some of my friends, have to lower expectations to survive. But did you ever think who caused this problem?</p>
              <p>The living standard is so high and we have family to feed. we are not some foreigners stacked on top of another, 4 people in a rented room.</p>
              <p>We served national service, we wasted time and we paid taxes for so many years, isnt it reasonable to have a comparable pay to that?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All these makes me wonder, what is the worth of being a Singaporean these days? All those pple celebrating in the NDP parade.. what the hell are they so proud of ? There dont seem to be any value to the Singaporean citizenship especially to us local guys when the cons seem to outweigh the pros.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right now our pay is going lower and lower. but look at basic neccessities and living cost?</p>
              <p>So you need to look at the source of this misery and poor citizens being punished.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Welcome to singapore, they dont care about its citizens, only for their own coffers and wins at elections.</p>

              <p>Not really, foreigners make our morale lower, sian and full of frustration, this is proven in the weakness of our productivity which shown a negative result since 2005, in the early 80s and 90s, our productivity can be 10 to 15%, today is at negative, notice our govt had been trying to ask us to be productive, but how tbe productive when the morale of the ground is low and sentiment that foreigners are here to help us, could be foreigners are here to destroy us.</p>
              <p>As I said long ago, nobody, i mean nobody will like strangers into their homes, for these, your govt still fail to comprehend. Even if your family is to end up hungry and starving, at least they go poor with glory, but going poor because some strangers is allowed to come in and  took away things and space from their homes, even the croakroach also will get fed up. Territory dominate is part of all animals instinct</p>

              <p>Be on good terms with others, even the dull and ignorant, for they too have their story.</p>

              <p>I am not one of those who get disadvantaged by foreigners. But i am still very disgusted about their overwhelming presence here !!  I feel pity for those friends who are just honest, decent, hardworking locals yet get victimised by the FT situation !!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously, so long you live in spore, you'll get inconvenienced by FTs one way or the other where-ever you go.</p>

              <p>Sorry lor ~~~ When we Singaporeans go work overseas, we are genuinely talents and we do our part to contribute for that country's welfare. However when foreigners come here, most of them are merely trash and nothing more !!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am not against foreign talent per se, but against the liberal immigration policies which opened the floodgates for foreigners to overwhelm the locals in their huge numbers, causing social problems, depressing wages and competing with the locals for jobs.</p>
