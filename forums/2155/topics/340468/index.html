              <p>Last friday, I was supposed to meet a property agent by the name of Asther to view 2 units in jurong east &amp; jurong west, before that, I have asked her if she is willing to co-broke because i already have an agent who happens to be my bf's sister. And she said yes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After confirming the time and date to view the unit, she msg me to get my confirmation that she will be my only agent. I replied by saying that for unit 218, I have alreayd told her before hand that I have a agent to represent me, therefore, she cannot be my agent but for the other unit, 417, as she is the one who recommended me, she can represent me for Blk 417. She asked if my agent will be coming with me and i said no because she is is busy with her own things. When i didn replied her msg, she send me another msg asking me not to feel uncomfortable and she can always go on with the arrangement agreed earlier on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When i called her up later in the evening to confirm again on the timing, she told me that she couldnt bring me to view the house if my agent is not coming. I was really fumming mad. One moment she said ok to co-broke and can arrange for the viewing (Note, i have alreayd told her that my agent is not coming with me), another moment she said no. she cant bring me to view cause my agent is not with me. WTF!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why are all agents behaving like these, Why cant i as a buyer look for the unit myself and if i like the unit, i can ask my agent to follow up on the paper work. To me, they just want to earn my money and act as my agent so that they can get commission from the owner and buyer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a genuie buyer, I don understand it, if i'm going to get the unit, they can also close the deal by earning from the owner's side rather than continueing to advertise and trying to get owner and buyer as their client.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am so tired of those house hunting because of all these irritating agent. And i couldnt get a new flat despite balloting for 5 freaking times from HDB over the past 1 year plus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S My bf's sister who is the agent agreed not to charged us any agent fee, but we have to look for a flat ourselves and she will help to follow up with the paper work, we just wanted to save on the cost and as a young couple, our financial resources are limited.</p>
              <p>Not the first time meeting such agent.</p>

              <p>Well.. If the problems lies with me. Then the agent should have tell me earlier on that I cant view the house without bringing any agent. Instead, She said ok and even msg me to say that: "pls do no feel uncomfortable, I can always arrange for you".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When i called her up again, then she said no, i cant view the unit without my agent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The problems is she said ok to everything earlier on, only to said no when i called to confirm again later on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I didn wanna change anything, I was also told to go ahead with all the viewings first. And also to asked if they are willing to co-broke.</p>

              <p>Since you mentioned that you have met some other agents, you must have proposed such arrangement with them before. You should have know by now that this is not the practise and norm of the market.</p>
              <p>No hard feeling, please. I understand your part on saving cost. Count yourself lucky that you have not signed any deal with any agent. If you have and in worse case situation, you could have faced with legal issue.</p>

              <p>Put yourself in her shoes or any sale person's shoes. All of them have to meet client before they can cut deal. She has to meet you personally to understand your need and requirement. In your case, your additional condition. Over the phone, she may has miscommunicated over certain matter. Let it rest.<br><br>As I said, you can't dictate term and condition which is not of the market. Over the years, real estate firms have been consolidating and they are able to come together to protect themselves with legal means. <br><br></p>

              i guess the competition is always valid. We have to understand that the house resale line is that of a survival for everyone out there. We too have to put ourselves in her shoes.
              
              However, her flickering mind; that is not acceptable.

            <div class='col-md body'>the agent was too fickle but you also need to understand it's how she makes her living....what's happening is that she's doing the legwork and all all your agent has to do is to show up...clearly this is not too nice on your part to half her income....even if you intention is to save cost but at her expense....since agents' fee has been deregularised, you ought to negotiate her fee upfront in the event of a deal....it's a buyers' market now, so advantage is yours....</div>
