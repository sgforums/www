              I was with 5 of my friends earlier on just now Sunday, 19th Oct, bout 9 pm.
              
              We entered Fourskin to take a look, while one of my friends started to
                      realised this guy sales person kept staring at him. My friend then came telling
                      us "eh, that sales man donno why, nb, kept staring at me wtf". Soon
                      after, we went off, not before my friend looked back at him, to double confirm
                      if he's really intentionally staring at him, which he did.
              
              Soon, we passed by Fourskin again, and realised the sales person, again,
                      stared at my friends. So my friend was really annoyed, and stared back at him.
              
              The sales person then gestured with his hand for us to wait. After few
                      moments, he went out from his working place and confronts us right outside his
                      working place.
              
              
              He said something like "OI, you wanna find trouble isit? We go down
                      settle la!"
              So my friend replied "What the hell were u staring at me for, while i
                      was just looking around in the shop?"
              
              He didn’t answer my friend's question and continue acting like typical ah
                      bengs, by saying "not happy one on one la? We go down la!"
              
              I then asked him nicely "the problem is, we were just looking around,
                      why were u like staring at us for?"
              
              
              My intention was not to start a fight, cause im not a typical low class,
                      brainless ah beng u see.
              
              Again, he refused to answer the question and goes "Not happy we fight
                      la! We go down!"
              
              
              My friend then started to get annoyed and said "No need go down, we
                      settle here!"
              
              
              He then replied, we go down settle la!
              
              My friend then ask again "what the hell were u staring at man in the
                      1st place?"
              
              He then finally replied with a stupid answer "i cannot look at how u wear
                      isit?"
              
              
              My Friend: Then need to stare so long meh?
              
              Soon, my others friends started to voice out since he kept insisting to have
                      a fight.
              
              My random friends were like shouting "Eh, then come fight la talk so
                      much bla bla bla bla...."
              
              Suddenly, he reaches into his pocket, and took out a knife or a screwdriver
                      or whatever, can’t see it clearly as he was waving it, and yell, "wanna fight come la!"
              
              All my friends took a step back while i quickly grap his hand.
              
              My friends then kicked him, trying to get him away from us cause he got a
                      weapon in his hand obviously.
              
              His manger (i assume) then came out and ask us to stop. The sales person was
                      like "but...but...", and the manger was like "GET IN".
              
              His manger told us to leave, if not he will call the police.Like what the hell? 1stly, he stared at us, secondly, he was the one who
                      confronted us, thirdly, he asks for a fight, and lastly, he threatened us with
                      a weapon.
              
              
              Ok i admit my friends were abit rush to have verbal confrontation back at
                      him, but it was clear that he was looking for trouble for no damn reason. What
                      do you expect us to do after getting stared, and confronted? Worse, asking for
                      a fight. Run off? For what? Not that we were want to find trouble, we can’t
                      just walk away since he already started the confrontation.<p></p>
              
              
              He wears spects, bout 175cm tall, age bout 18 or 19, Chinese, male
              
              I want to file a complaint, but i cant find their website.I want the ass to go down
              What are your views on this incident guys?

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I was with 5 of my friends earlier on just now Sunday, 19th Oct,
              bout 9 pm. We entered Fourskin to take a look, while one of my
              friends started to realised this guy sales person kept staring at
              him. My friend then came telling us "eh, that sales man donno why,
              nb, kept staring at me wtf". Soon after, we went off, not before my
              friend looked back at him, to double confirm if he's really
              intentionally staring at him, which he did. Soon, we passed by
              Fourskin again, and realised the sales person, again, stared at my
              friends. So my friend was really annoyed, and stared back at him.
              The sales person then gestured with his hand for us to wait. After
              few moments, he went out from his working place and confronts us
              right outside his working place. He said something like "OI, you
              wanna find trouble isit? We go down settle la!" So my friend
              replied "What the hell were u staring at me for, while i was just
              looking around in the shop?" He didn’t answer my friend's question
              and continue acting like typical ah bengs, by saying "not happy one
              on one la? We go down la!" I then asked him nicely "the problem is,
              we were just looking around, why were u like staring at us for?" My
              intention was not to start a fight, cause im not a typical low
              class, brainless ah beng u see. Again, he refused to answer the
              question and goes "Not happy we fight la! We go down!" My friend
              then started to get annoyed and said "No need go down, we settle
              here!" He then replied, we go down settle la! My friend then ask
              again "what the hell were u staring at man in the 1st place?" He
              then finally replied with a stupid answer "i cannot look at how u
              wear isit?" My Friend: Then need to stare so long meh? Soon, my
              others friends started to voice out since he kept insisting to have
              a fight. My random friends were like shouting "Eh, then come fight
              la talk so much bla bla bla bla...." Suddenly, he reaches into his
              pocket, and took out a knife or a screwdriver or whatever, can’t
              see it clearly as he was waving it, and yell, "wanna fight come
              la!" All my friends took a step back while i quickly grap his hand.
              My friends then kicked him, trying to get him away from us cause he
              got a weapon in his hand obviously. His manger (i assume) then came
              out and ask us to stop. The sales person was like "but...but...",
              and the manger was like "GET IN". His manger told us to leave, if
              not he will call the police.Like what the hell? 1stly, he stared at
              us, secondly, he was the one who confronted us, thirdly, he asks
              for a fight, and lastly, he threatened us with a weapon. Ok i admit
              my friends were abit rush to have verbal confrontation back at him,
              but it was clear that he was looking for trouble for no damn
              reason. What do you expect us to do after getting stared, and
              confronted? Worse, asking for a fight. Run off? For what? Not that
              we were want to find trouble, we can’t just walk away since he
              already started the confrontation.He wears spects, bout 175cm tall,
              age bout 18 or 19, Chinese, male I want to file a complaint, but i
              cant find their website.I want the ass to go down What are your
              views on this incident guys?</p>
