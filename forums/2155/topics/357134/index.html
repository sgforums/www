              <p>What do we mean by natural Justice? It is a process whereby justice is served in a natrual way without any from of bias, under careful analysis and thought and confirmation. The accused is given the opportunity to explain himself and the law sees the issue from all sides. In the most general sense, there are two kinds of law—natural law and positive law. Natural law has been recognized since the ancient world to be a general body of rules of right conduct and justice common to all mankind. This concept grew from the observation of the operation of the laws of nature and their uniformity. Positive law, on the other hand, consists of regulations formulated by the heads of a country or society. Positive laws are meant to curb social problems and the justice served out may not be worthy of the crime committed like e.g Death Penalty for drugs ect and in many cases, becomes too harsh a punishment.</p>
              <p>Now let's talk about death penalty for  the drug trafficking in singapore. What went wrong?</p>
              <p>While we have the technology and resources to  stop the flow of drugs into the country, why is there a need for the death penalty?. Is it truly necessary? To act as a deterrent? It may do so if there is no other means to control the problem but when control measures are available, is there a necessity for such a  treatment as death penalty? In my opinion, the death penalty is not a natural justice law as it convicts everyone without giving a chance to explain their stance in circumstances where the offender is a victim  be used by others unknowingly to commit crimes.</p>
              <p>Natural Justice is the only universal and fair law that should exist.</p>

              huh? so if there is no death penalty, people will be able to trace back to the cunning criminals?
              
              criminal making use of others will always happen what? And to sentence people to death IS a heavy sentence, obsess with handing out punishment? You mean the judge likes ordering people to be put to death?

              err... ok. so the problem is not using that tool? " natural Justice gives the person a right to be prove or be proven guilty or innocent." That sounds great? But i can't visualize how it is different from the current system.

              <p>I believe you are not very well aquainted with the law</p>
              <p>Motive is never a deciding factor in the determination of murder. Criminal law talks about intention, not motive, and it's the same all over the world, including US. I can have the motive of killing you to inherit all your $$, but if I do not have the intention to kill you, I should not be punished just for my evil motive alone.</p>
              <p>The purpose of lie detector tests, motive assessment etc is to impute the intention on the accused, it's not to find out the motive. This is just the tip of the iceberg, there's a whole lot more stuff about criminal law that you have misinterpreted and wrongly stated here.</p>
              <p>In fact, the judicial system in Singapore is definitely top-quality, the judgements (besides the 'certain suits') are cogent and reasoned based on the penal code and precedents. Go read them before commenting, if you can find anything unjust then come look for me again.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
