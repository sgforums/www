              <p>As my mother and I approached the shop to look at the shoes, there was already a Caucasian family, most probably tourists, in the shop trying on the shoes. Anyway, my mother and I thought that the designs and price were really affordable and hence decided to step into the shop to look around some more. None of the shop staffs came over and greet us, let alone make eye contact at all. One of the shop staffs, a girl in a green sweater, gave us the "Can't you see we're busy with the tourists?" look while the rest of her colleagues were cooing and fussing over the caucasian family. My mother happened to receive a phone call from my brother asking which shop unit where we in, and the girl in the green sweater actually start to give us an accusing stare, like as if we were going to cause a commotion at the shop front and steal a pair of shoes when they are not alert. I confirmed with my mother a couple more times if any of the staffs came over and greeted her at all and my mother firmly insisted that no one came over and ask if we need help or what kind of shoes are we looking for. One shop staff was serving the caucasian family while the rest of them simply stood around the caucasian family, oblivious to the fact that we are also customers wiating to be served. Lousy service, especially with shop staffs who served only tourists, caucasian tourists to be exact while ignoring Singaporean customers. The ony time there was any other reaction was when the shop staff in the green sweater shouted a friendly greeting to the shop owner next door, and still no greetings to us at all! It's not like we were nasty or rude when they came over and greeted us, they simply ignore us from the moment we stepped into the shop until we stepped out . Anyway, I've already forward this complaint to various medias like STOMP and OMY and forums in singapore. Next step is to think about writing in to various newspapers to complain about the rude, unattentive and racist attitude that I've encountered in this shop.</p>
              <p>P/S: Please do not go to this shop and buy any shoes/footwear as you're better off buying shoes somewhere else that gives much better service, regardless of whether you're Singaporean, Asian or a tourist.</p>
