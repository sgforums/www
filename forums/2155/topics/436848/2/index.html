              Singaporeans are smart, those who retaliated and fought are in jail with no chance to play computer and sgforums. Appears in Singapore, even if you are self defence and kill someone, you go jail or maybe death sentence.
              
              So don't give me the crap of violence, it is not a good solution. If violence is an encouraged solution, why the christian bible, the koran, the buddhist scriptures seeks peace?

              So next time you choked on fish bone, means you should avoid eating fish? Eating meat can cause high blood pressure too. Some plants are poisonous to human... so just drink water?

              <p>Extracted from Stomp : Foreigners shoo family away from Botanic Gardens landmarks because they "booked it"</p>
              <p>Comments by one person I found require attention.</p>
              <p>By SophiaRosieHart</p>
              <p>1. if Foreigners weren't in singapore singapore would have heaps of poor people or heaps of people in jail</p>
              <p>2. if we werent here singapore would of been run to the ground singapore cant live without Foreigners because they the ones who are bringing all the money in and they the ones who are building all your malls like if i wasn't here also mbs wouldn't be up and running like it is now</p>
              <p>3. singaporeans race is mostly chinese and malay mixed</p>
              <p>4.everyone is a Foreigner to singapore because singapore doesnt even have its own real race</p>
              <p>5.my own real race is maori and english<br>and mbs is the only good looking building in singapore but crap inside sadly hahahaha i got here to late when it started flooding because these dumb *****s dont know anything about building</p>
              <p>6.@Darn walk out on a job i get paid 30 grand a month for mate you must be joking,found a job like that in new zealand nope because they all taken and i would rather travel the world i've been to most of asia i must say singapore was the worse place i ever landed in and i cant wait in till i get to move</p>
              <p>7.and u see i already have another job lined up thats mine if i want it and most of the new zealanders here get moved around by the same company they dont keep them here because they know they dont like it just like my boss knows i hate singapore thats why next is Bangkok or Dubai or Aussie.<br>he probably worked his ass of an lied to get the job thats why he cant move anywhere because he sucks and no one wants him ouch that must hurt hahahahahahahahahaa like no one wants you</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess our Governement is not aware of all these. Keep talking about about "talent". The Government need to have a system to weed out such Foreigner.</p>

              <p>Yes your way is only write in singapore. Singapore laws are very strict and it is good because they protect the gud citizens. But in Oz, the laws very lax, that is why the Ang Mo very brave to whack up Asians. If you don't know how to protect yourself against the big size, Ang mo, they will bully n rape u.</p>
              <p>Last month, i read a story about two teenagers who broke into an elderly woman's house in Australia. She is 71 years old. They stole all her money and then not satisfied, they raped the grandmother. Then they bludgeon her to death. After that they left, they use her handphone to make obscene phone call to the grandma's 27 year old daughter. They got caught, know wat sentencing they got? Only 4 years juvenile detention.</p>
              <p>And then the judge refuse to reveal the two teenager's identity because they're underage.</p>
              <p>In another case, a turkish guy was unsatisfied with the waiter service in one Australian restaurant. So he took a beer mug and smash it into the waiter's face. The injury caused the waiter to need $20,000 plastic surgery to fix his face, but his face is ripped beyond recognition, he look like the elephant man.</p>
              <p>The turkish guy escape back to his country. Australia requested he return to face sentencing. He agreed. He only receive 6 months jail sentencing.</p>
              <p>That is why Ang Mo like violence because their country don't believe in passing harsh sentences. In Britain recently got riot, the kids dare to burn down houses because they know they can get away wif it.</p>

              Ok, I don't know about you, but I read from the news alot of those involved in the riots was caught and sentenced to a heavier than normal jail sentence. I think in most civilized countries there are laws and regulations, and of course, even in the most civilized world, there are criminals.

              LOL, seems like you're the stupid one. You need to go church and repent and do confession. Cory was one of those trying to defend himself from being hurt and killed someone else. He was sentenced to death. Please tell me how is that considered smart?
              
              I certainly don't condone violence because why? An eye for an eye makes the whole world go blind. Tell me who win in a fight, one go hospital, the other go prison... Did the guy who go hospital win? Did the person who go prison win?
              
              Please lah, you need to use your brains.
