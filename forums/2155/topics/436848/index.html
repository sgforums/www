              <p>Yesterday I had an unpleasant experience on the MRT.</p>
              <p>I was taking the train in the morning and normally it would be very pack, so when the train arrives, everyone would rush in. After I move in, there was this barbaric foreign commuters after me who loudly said "Please move in" and proceeded to really SQUEEZE his way through. When he squeeze, his big long bag SMACKED DIRECTLY ONTO MY FACE. BUT THAT IS NOT THE WORST PART, HE PROCEED TO SAY LOUDLY (He was with a female friend).....</p>
              <p>"I DON'T CARE, SHE'S NOT MOVING IN."</p>
              <p>OMG WTF. HOW RUDE CAN HE BE. THE FACT THAT HE PUNCHED ME IN THE FACE WITH HIS BAG AND DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO APOLOGISE AND STILL HAS THE CHEEK TO PASS THAT COMMENT REALLY PISS ME OFF! And I swear, I had really made an effort to MOVE IN. The fact that he squeezes his way through of course would allow the retard to move in.</p>
              <p>OKAY! To prevent the same thing from happening, I would kindly post a pic of him. SO GUYS, if you see him, please siam okay?? In case you got hit in the face and all he did was to throw you some dirty remarks. SHIT HIM! He board the train at Clementi station at around 8.50am.<img src="http://img845.imageshack.us/img845/3631/barbaric.jpg" alt=""></p>

              <p>Yesterday I had an unpleasant experience on the MRT.</p>
              <p>I was taking the train in the morning and normally it would be very pack, so when the train arrives, everyone would rush in. After I move in, there was this barbaric foreign commuters after me who loudly said "Please move in" and proceeded to really SQUEEZE his way through. When he squeeze, his big long bag SMACKED DIRECTLY ONTO MY FACE. BUT THAT IS NOT THE WORST PART, HE PROCEED TO SAY LOUDLY (He was with a female friend).....</p>
              <p>"I DON'T CARE, SHE'S NOT MOVING IN."</p>
              <p>OMG WTF. HOW RUDE CAN HE BE. THE FACT THAT HE PUNCHED ME IN THE FACE WITH HIS BAG AND DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO APOLOGISE AND STILL HAS THE CHEEK TO PASS THAT COMMENT REALLY PISS ME OFF! And I swear, I had really made an effort to MOVE IN. The fact that he squeezes his way through of course would allow the retard to move in.</p>
              <p>OKAY! To prevent the same thing from happening, I would kindly post a pic of him. SO GUYS, if you see him, please siam okay?? In case you got hit in the face and all he did was to throw you some dirty remarks. SHIT HIM! He board the train at Clementi station at around 8.50am.<img src="http://img845.imageshack.us/img845/3631/barbaric.jpg" alt=""></p>

              <p><br>Mebbe he didn't know he hit yer face with his long bag. Instead of taking pictures n whimpering around, you should have confronted him n tell him how offended u felt.</p>
