              <p>Hi AhTiong, </p>
              <p>You must be suffering a lot.  Hum, someone asked who got prefect family, and that is true.  Their (parents) duties is to bring us to this earth.  Following that, is to bring us up properly, which many may not know how, and I am one in the number.</p>
              <p>I left school at 15, what O-level.  But I plunge into school again, got enough points to do a 4 yrs diploma without honour in Ngee Ann, follow by a degree.  My parents help? hum . . . never. </p>
              <p>Have you ever come home and witness that your room was cleared?  Yea, my books, notes from poly was thrown away.  :)  Interesting yea?  </p>
              <p>Whatever their responsible was, it was restricted to the first 20 yrs or less, beyond that, we need to answer to the society and ourselves. </p>
              <p>I saw problem at home, and decieded at young age not to let the problem cascade down wards, else i will be like them.  I cannot save the society, let alone the world. But I determine to do what i can.  Like offering free tuition to orphanage etc.  Of cause, to have children and bring them up to be useful to the society.</p>
              <p>Let them (your parents) go, and look beyond your horizon.  You are, in the end, to answer to your own action.  Many in the society with bad parents made it, and i believe you too have to capability to do so.</p>
              <p>I wish you the best. </p>

              <p>it is hatred that makes you and your parents unhappy. you are responsible for your own happiness. why make yourself unhappy just because of your parents, isn't that very stupid ? you must tell yourself, you want to live a happier life than your family members because you are smarter than them. you must strive for a better life and show them that you are different from them. wish you good luck !</p>

              <p>don't care what your father says. they are old and sometimes talk nonsense. my dad used to talk nonsense too. he always compares me with my cousins who are lawyers and doctors but i don't feel inferior at all. i told myself, i am better than my dad because i feel happier than him. i don't compare myself with others.</p>
              <p>my father lives miserably because he likes to compare.äººæ¯”äººæ°”æ­»äºº. whenever he compares me with my cousins, i will just switch off, let him go and nag. i live freely and happily, contended with what i have. unlike my cousins, some are married into super wealthy family and i understand that they are under a lot of pressure from those super wealthy in laws. ha ha ha.</p>
              <p>happy or not is up to you, don't let anybody affect you, not even your closest ones like your parents. in their generation, they do not know what is happiness and freedom, they only know money and status.</p>

              <p>You see, the thing about comparing actually has its good and bad. Bad
              in a sense you are never contented and always greedy for more, there
              are always people thats ''better'' than you and of course ''worse''
              than you are. Good in a sense you strive to improve yourself to a higher level.</p>
