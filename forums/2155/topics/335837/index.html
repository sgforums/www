              <p>Great i got cheated again . Here`s how the story goes :</p>
              <p>On wednesday i went down to califorina fitness gym because they suddenly called me up and asked me to go down to take a look at their gym and maybe become a member AND THEY ALSO PROMISED ME A 3 WEEKS FREE MEMBERSHIP as a trail. I also donno where they got my number from in the first place. So anyway since i`ve been going to the gym like 4 times a week .</p>
              <p>And i`ve heard from friends that their gym is quit nice and all. So i went down and take a look lar. I went to the raffles outlet btw. When i went in they ask me fill in some guest form . Then after filling in the form they asked for my ic . But i didn`t bring it that day . So instead i gave my driving license. Then after awhile one lady came and talk to me and brought me around the gym to have a look .</p>
              <p>I see their gym not very good . They only thing they have that other gyms dont have is a suna bath and a steam bath. The rest all can find at other gyms . Ok then the PROBLEM STARTED . The bitch keep asking me sign up for their membership . Then i keep saying that i wanted to try out their gym first and asked for the free 3 weeks membership tehy promised me over the phone. She then said oh ur only 19 this year we cant give u the 3 weeks free membership cause we only can give it to those 21 and above .</p>
              <p>WTF is that man . U mean u can offer a membership to a 19 year-old  for 80 bucks a month and u can`t give me a free trail first ? Where is the logic in that?</p>
              <p>So then i took my driving license and walk out with out even saying bye . The gal also know that i was kina pissed so she just walk me out without saying anything.</p>
              <p>Anyone could tell me who can i type a complain e-mail to ? I`ve typed a e-mail to their gym but no reply . I think they just deleted it with out reading. Dont blame me i`m singaporean after all . And they are the ones who screwed up in the first place. If they would have given me the trail maybe i would have been a member now . Since i`m working near the gym .</p>
              <p>So pls advice on who can i COMPLAIN to ?</p>

              <p>Is not about money . Is like they are just bluffing people to go down (Promising them a free trail memebership) and then they forcing people to get a membership.</p>
              <p>And Btw when i first told the lady that i dont want to rush into becoming a member at their gym cause it`s not really cheap . She kept forcing me saying, If u save $3 a day u could be a member at our gym already and some other rubbish .</p>

              <p>Ya maybe i should have asked .</p>
              <p>But i really dont see the reason in offering me a price on the first day of my visit to the gym . Instead of letting me use it first like they promised then maybe i`ll join as a member.</p>
              <p>I think they are just cheating people by telling them that there will be a free trail of 3 weeks and then when the person actually goes down to the gym, they`ll keep pestering the person to join their member for a price.</p>
              <p>What a sneaky way of doing business.</p>

              <p>Its their policy... deal with it... got some night clubs that allow 21 y/o girls in but guys got 25 y/o age limit... you want to complain to that? They will ignore you one...</p>
              <p>Anyway, they made that policy for a reason, what ever that reason maybe... That's why you must ask what are the REQUIREMENTS to the policy.... every contract today has a REQUIREMENT...</p>
              <p>I also got that call before and after long talk on the phone, I ask what is the requirement... She say no requirement, just need to be 21 y/o... I say I not 21, story ends here...</p>

              <p>erm iirc, CF recently upped their membership rate, thus alot of peepur decided to cancel their membership. So now, in recession, looks like they are going to promote again.</p>

              <p>California Fitness called me some time back and offered me a trial membership.</p>
              <p>It sounded fishy, because I certainly didn't give them my contact details.</p>
              <p>I asked the fella how they got my number, and he just mumbled something about 'You must have filled a survey form or something.....'</p>
              <p>I told the bugger that I wasn't interested and hang up.</p>
              <p>Looks like fish, smells like fish, tastes like fish. Conclusion: high chance that it's fish.</p>
