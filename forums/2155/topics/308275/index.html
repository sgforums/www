              <p>well, i need to rant a bit to let off steam.</p>
              <p>today, i was totally **ssed off by the mrt security guard.</p>
              <p>(mrt security guards = those middle-aged guys wearing the long sleeve white shirt, black pants and dark-blue sleeveless jacket, standing around the station observing everyone)</p>
              <p>i was on my way to work as usual and just passed the gate and about to proceed to the escalator when this clown came up to me and wanted to check my bag!!!</p>
              <p>and i open my bag, he merely look at it 1 second without even touching i or searching, and say "ok, thanks!"</p>
              <p>and there were a lot of people behind me you know??!!!</p>
              <p>i'm a 24 year old, super-clean-shaven, fair complexion, spectacle-wearing, spiky-hair, true-blooded SG-Chinese male and have completed my ****ing NS 3 years ago!!!!</p>
              <p>KNN........that means i'm Osama or some other "potential terrorists" who will bomb the mrt station is it?!! i don't understand!</p>
              <p>and when i open my bag, he only look 1 second, never touch, never search....wanna wayang is it? find other people lah!!!!!!</p>
              <p>KNN.....that time i was darn angry and i feel so super-insulted it happened to me and i really want to flung my ****ing bag into his ****ing face.</p>
              <p>i vow that if he does that again tomorrow or some other time, i'll either blow up the matter big big so everyone knows that SMRT is so security-conscientious and hardworking, or i'll dress up in turban + thick beard and walk past him to see what he will do.</p>
              <p>KNN!!!!!!!!!!</p>
              <p>thanks for reading.  end of rant.</p>

              <p><br>Dude.... if terrorists want to bomb the station, they would want someone who is nondescript and non attention-seeking to do the bombing. No point having the fella attract suspicion before he can detonate the bomb. Guess who would fit the profile of 'nondescript and not attracting attention'? The answer would be 'the average Singaporean'.</p>
              <p>Like Seoti has said... not all terrorists look like Osama. They come in all shapes and sizes and from all walks of life. They do not have to be dirtily or shabbily dressed for them to be a terrorist. If anything, people would be more likely to notice a dirty and shabbily-dressed person.</p>
              <p>Though I have to agree with the wayanging part..... if the guards want to check passengers' bags, then they ought to do a proper check. </p>
              <p>I've personally been stopped twice.... the first time was a quick one-second wayang, and I do remember rolling my eyes at the guard after that.</p>
              <p>The second was more thorough. The guard asked me about my laptop and some other stuff in my backpack. That took a bit of time.. but I guess at least the guard wasn't wayanging.</p>

              <p>tis reminds me of my sec sch teacher. she told us abt her experience too. she, being a woman, wif long hair, tall, and looking like a mix b/w chinese and caucasian, was oso held up. however, her case is tt she was carrying a luggage. n being a nice n friendly person, she was quite shocked to be checked.</p>
              <p>ya. n she told us she was oso angry when she was held back. guess its the shame tt was bought to the person while being checked.. </p>
