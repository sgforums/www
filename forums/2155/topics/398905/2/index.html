              <p>but actually la.. most I meet tends to sway on the side of extreme materialism. But I am o.k with it, until they try to squeeze my wallet instead of me willingly burning money on them. They are mostly good company. Its like GRO. N they are good source of information on who n who is who's unf unf buddy or small wife n what nots. So u KNOW.. who to avoid. Cause they tend to hang together.</p>

              <p>i'm sad to admit but TS is right... most Singaporean chinese girls are materialistic... but we are living in a society that measures people by the number of cards, number of cars and number of digits in their bank account...</p>
              <p>for that i have to openly criticize my own mother...</p>
              <p>when my sister was about 18, my mum told her this; check the boy's NRIC... if the back has no "block" or you know it's HDB, cannot take as boyfriend... must go for those stay in landed properties or at least condominiums...</p>
              <p>when i heard this, i interrupted them asking my mum, "er... i stay in HDB flat, so means confirm cannot find girlfriend lah if all mothers teach their girls like this... no need to get married liao lor". well she kept quiet at first but then when i left the living room, continued to "brain-wash" my sister...</p>
              <p>today, my sister is a lesbian with a rich "butch"... so now my mum everyday headache...  </p>

              <p>I dun want to say local girls are materialistic, because I dunno
              much about malay and indian girls. so far I can see that local born
              chinese girls are plain materialistic. I do not own a credit card
              and I have a ATM card only. I went out with an ex colleague to eat
              at a korean restaurant. When come to billling after dinner, as I do
              not have a credit card for discounts, my ex colleague took out her
              credit card for a 10% discount. she made disparage remarks and
              shake her head, saying I am a failure in mandarin. I was shocked
              and dulan inside, but didnt retort or rebut her. as the bill is 80,
              I gave her $40 in cash.</p>
              <p>If one does not have a credit card, is one fair enough to be
              called a failure? I know of one Associate Prof from NTU, he doesnt
              carry a credit card either, but his annual salary is of 6 figure
              sum. Is he also a failure for not carrying a credit card as
              well?</p>
              <p>I just have contempt for girls who think like this, really look
              down on them for being vain, materialistic, petty and
              greediness not to mention their intellect. I hope our local born
              chinese women are not like this.</p>

              <p>i beg to differ... though i kpkb about materialistic singapore girls, i'm married today to a local girl... though not materialistic, she still do pester me to buy her branded goods once in a while... as husbands, we cannot stop the pampering even after marriage so buy lor... what else? </p>
              <p>as i've said, most but not all singaporean girls are materialistic... they may like branded, like expensive stuffs but they can still be sensible when the situation requires them to do so. like my wife who stood by me when i was almost bankrupt even before we got married... she could just walk off like many others would but instead stood by me and helped me financially until i was able to find a job and pay off my debts.</p>
              <p>personally i had a friend who on the verge of her wedding preparations wanted to call off the whole relationship because her husband to be refused to buy a condominium, instead opted for a 5 room HDB... she came to me to "justify" her actions but kana scolded by me instead. she said as her husband to be is a lawyer and she herself is an accountant (by the way, she was only 25 then) so it is only right for her to demand to stay in a condominium to "fit" her standards. her husband to be did mentioned that they could stay in a HDB flat first then later when his financials are a lot more stable, upgrade to a condominium but of course she felt it was beneath her... today she is married to the same guy and stays in a condominium... pity the husband...</p>

              <p>I would say they are lucky the wife is materialistic... now the price of the property soar like rocket. Imagine how much more they can earn if they sell it out now.</p>
              <p>I would say greed is inside each and everyone of us. when money = life, you can't complain people to just want more. Both gals and guys included.</p>

              <p>but actually la.. most I meet tends to sway on the side of
              extreme materialism. But I am o.k with it, until they try to
              squeeze my wallet instead of me willingly burning money on them.
              They are mostly good company. Its like GRO. N they are good source
              of information on who n who is who's unf unf buddy or small wife n
              what nots. So u KNOW.. who to avoid. Cause they tend to hang
