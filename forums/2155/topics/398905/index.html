              <p>I dun want to say local girls are materialistic, because I dunno much about malay and indian girls. so far I can see that local born chinese girls are plain materialistic. I do not own a credit card and I have a ATM card only. I went out with an ex colleague to eat at a korean restaurant. When come to billling after dinner, as I do not have a credit card for discounts, my ex colleague took out her credit card for a 10% discount. she made disparage remarks and shake her head, saying I am a failure in mandarin. I was shocked and dulan inside, but didnt retort or rebut her. as the bill is 80, I gave her $40 in cash.</p>
              <p>If one does not have a credit card, is one fair enough to be called a failure? I know of one Associate Prof from NTU, he doesnt carry a credit card either, but his annual salary is of 6 figure sum. Is he also a failure for not carrying a credit card as well?</p>
              <p>I just have contempt for girls who think like this, really look down on them for being vain, materialistic, petty and greediness not to mention their intellect. I hope our local born chinese women are not like this.</p>

              <p>no I have no interest in her whatsoever. I know citibank card got a no minimum income requirement for credit limit of 500, but I do not want to apply as I am happy using ATM card and cash.</p>
              <p>but the thing is, isnt she vain and rude? even if I am poor, is that her business?</p>

              <p>no need to bother with these type of people la... they want to sign up card and show off is their own problem la... so many cards needed for wat, even though sometimes using a particular card to pay for expenses got discount. Other than that I do not know why need so many card? 1-2 is more than enough.</p>
              <p>Ya friend is the real failure instead, not you. If you are unhappy with it, then let her know. Personally I myself only have mastercard card (debit) and Diners Card. Other that I do care about other cards.</p>
              <p>Do not be too sad about ya "failure" since its not really a failure.</p>

              <p>So? You can show me ten thousand materialistic Chinese girls. However, if just ONE Chinese girl is not materialistic, then the title is no longer tenable.</p>
              <p>If the title had been 'I met a materialistic girl', with no reference to race or generalization, then this thread would have made sense.</p>
              <p>So, still phail.</p>
