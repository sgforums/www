              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I'm stealing 5min of my working time to write this...to vent my frustrations and release some pressure....</p>
              <p>First, I miss all my SB pals. Period.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Back
              to topic. I have created a nation wide campaign and everyone is eager
              and ga-ga over it - peeps get to get things for free! While-stocks-last
              and first-come-first-served that is.....</p>
              <p>Fastforward to the end of
              campaign...as usual, Sillyporeans hogged up the website and jammed the
              server, complained that all the freebies are fully redeemed, and
              blasted our emails and hotlines.</p>
              <p>Of course we are covered by our
              T&amp;Cs. But that won't suffice. One particular costomer even
              complained all the way to the top by shouting and being abusive...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Guess what? Mgt even bother to entertainment him.</p>
              <p>That's not it. So come the evaluation. Even internal dept back-stabbed the campaign when they didn't do their parts. Corp comms said the creator of the campaign must carry out the duty of answering customer's requests and queries because 'that is our baby'!!! Wtf?</p>
              <p>Now everyone who believed in the campaign started to question it's purpose. People believing it are jaded and weary.</p>
              <p>The mgt is a let-down. My boss supports us still....but we are against the mgt and board.</p>
              <p>I am exsperated... : (</p>

              <p>Imagine this:::</p>
              <p>People missed the promotions...then they turned around and demand that you owe them something.</p>
              <p>When you polite imply to them that it's their onus to login to get their freebies, they question you why you didn't inform them!!!</p>
              <p>When you ask them why they never subscribe to newsletter, they say they can't be bothered!!</p>
              <p>They you ask them how do they find out about our promotion, they say their friends told them.</p>
              <p>Then you ask them for their email address so that you can log into their account, they say they cannot remember what email they registered with!!!!</p>
              <p>They you ask them how you can email to them information, they tell you you are full of shit they do not want to talk you and they want you to get your manager.</p>
              <p>Then you tell them you are the manager, then they say get your AVP.</p>
              <p>When you get your AVP, your AVP ask why are you doing this and not the relevent dept??</p>
              <p>Then you explain the other dept pushed the complaints to you, the other dept said it's your baby and they are short handed.</p>
              <p>Then the issue buah long long and ding dong all the way to the chairman, so the COO ask you to see him with all the long stories.</p>
              <p>When you bring all the dead trees into COO's room, COO asked you to sympathise that the helpdesks are just O-levels so you should do their job!!!</p>
              <p>So the question is, if a BA is to do an O-level's job, who is going to do a BA's job??</p>
              <p>The master student? The scholar?</p>

              That's the idea of the sillyporeans isn't it, it's the problem where they didn't get it but they now think that you owe them something, you should pick up a friendly yet professional tone that if they didn't get it, that they are too late and it's while stocks last.
              
              You don't owe them anything and their just trying to dig it out of you. Singaporean stereotype, pfft.

              <p> </p>
              <p>1] Active job hunting; keeping my options open again. Maybe oversea is the answer....not sure...hopefully there are no earthquakes or tsunamis there!</p>
              <p>2] Await the announcement of my new boss. Hopefully she is who I think she is. Then at least it's worth chionging!</p>
