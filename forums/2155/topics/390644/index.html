              <p>was at siloso beach last night with new valentine day date.</p>
              <p>while walking along around siloso beach on the tiled floor near the entrance, i stepped on puke!</p>
              <p>i think its drunkard's puke. which idiot puked?? damn it. i think some of it got onto my havaianas slippers n bottom of my wet jeans. (jeans bottom cuff was slightly wet due to walking along the water edge on the beach)</p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"> so disgusting. lucky i never puat toh, or else i will be malu in front of my date. But i act tough pretend never step on that at all.</p>
              <p>n earlier on i went to watch Songs of the Sea, it was a kiddies show! what a disappointment. But then the pyrotechnics and flame throwers towards the end was impressive.</p>
              <p> n one more thing, i ate at Tastes of Singapore cafeteria restaurant which was next to Images of Singapore Wax Museum. n i ate their signature dish, chicken rice which costed $11. Too bad i forgot to take a picture. It was only chicken thigh meat with rice, achar, xiaobaicai with oyster sauce, n soggy cabbage soup. I felt like a tourist lol. what a ripoff. Anyway it tasted like any other ordinary chicken rice, no biggie deal. n their chili sauce taste like bottled chili sauce. Only presentation looks very neat n impressive.</p>
              <p>did anyone ate there before? Take my advice n go to a hawker instead, unless u like the ambience there...they are selling hawker food at restaurant prices.</p>
