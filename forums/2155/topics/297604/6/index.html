"heels broke liao is your own damn fault, go solve it yourself!!" that kind of indifference attitude. pls lah, which gal wants her heels to break? even if you dont want to help, also dont need to shout like that. if you dont want to buy the shoes for her, at least think of some ways out.<br><br>TS already said she will pay her first which was rather trusting to a total stranger and may risk the person disappearing with her money. but then again if you arent desperate for help would you do that? if you arent that dumb, i believe you can ask for her shoe size, what type of shoes she want. if you can get her a pair of decent shoes to walk with, who in the right mind will still hiam the shoes not nice blah blah blah when the priority is just to have a pair of shoes to walk on?<br><br>its like a scenario where you injured your head and bleeding badly from it. imagine when you ask for help and the person shouts back at you "injured liao then go walk to the hospital lah!"<br><br>are you guys devoid of feelings? are you humans or robots walking around?<br></div></blockquote>It's a broken heel. She did not break her ankle, she was not in pain. The shop was not far away. And she was being a total bitch by insinuating that she had the right to hit the girl because she didn't help. I do not have any sympathy for such characters, and I urge people here not to misplace their sympathies. Similarly if a wheelchair bound guy became verbally abusive if a request for help by him was turned down, I would have given him a piece of my mind too.<br><br>Read the title of the thread. Some people really deserve to have their heels broken. Stupid woman. Curses don't work.</div>
