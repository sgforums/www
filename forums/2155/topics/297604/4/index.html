            <div class='col-md body'>hi TS,<br>frankly, if I were in the gals' shoes, I would not know how to help you also if you were to ask me to buy shoes for you.<br><br>What I could have done is to carry/assist you back to Wisma and maybe you can then buy a pair yourself.<br><br>and perhaps I can help get some wet tissues, so that you can at least clean your feet.<br><br>but then giving money and asking someone to buy you a pair, just sounds a bit out of place for me.<br><br></div>
