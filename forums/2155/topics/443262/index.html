              <p>I've been living in this country for the last 5 years.<br> <br> Yes, I'm what they called FT, "Foreign Talent", a foreigner living and 
              working in Singapore. Just like millions of people in the human history 
              who move from one location to another, I was born in one place and now 
              live in another.<br> <br> Nothing very interesting or exceptional, right? Wrong! From a Uniquely 
              Fucking Singaporean perspective, I am less of a human being than them 
              locals.<br> <br> The FT is supposed to come here and, get this, 'DO THE JOB THAT WE DON'T
               WANT TO DO." This means work such as cleaning the toilet and digging 
              the road. It's like, "we are special, all these things are beneath us."<br> <br> But "we got fucking Singapore Dollars, it's real big deal." "All you 
              fucking FTs coming here to work are less than human and must get down on
               your fucking knees and pray to our money."<br> <br> What they do not fucking tell you is that FT provide a service which 
              brings the business cost down and as a result keep INFLATION DOWN.  That
               allows them to have their fucking disposable income to roam the 
              shopping complex and stuff their fucking face with low quality sushi 
              every weekend.<br> <br> But no, every fucking thing and every fucking problem they have, they 
              blame it on FT like me. Eh, I fucking pay my GST just like you do, ok?<br> <br> In that light, I was glad to see the piece of news below. For 
              non-Singaporean readers of this blog, taxis can ONLY be operated by 
              Singaporean citizens.<br> <br> Taxi fare is going up!!!!! I like to see how you morons are going to blame THIS on FTs.<br> <br> And I laugh my ass off when I read one of the locals complaining:<br> <br> "How does this restructuring address the problem of lazy cab drivers 
              camping in corners like behind ORQ waiting for people to call for a cab,
               and then appearing out of nowhere to collect the extra fees? As many an
               expat has said before while waiting for a taxi in the queue: 
              Singaporean cabbies are really spoiled! And many refuse to pick up 
              passengers even though it's not shift change hour; this happens even at 
              taxi stands in the CBD area with long queues. They're just waiting for 
              someone to pick up the phone to dial for a cab because there's extra 
              money! As if reducing booking fees by 20 cents will make a difference."<br> <br> http://humyeefansang.blogspot.com/2011/12/now-this-you-cannot-blame-it-on-ft.html</p>

              <p><br> <br> <strong>This Malaysian is married to a local woman but behaves like he owns 
              this place. The least he can do is to show some respect to his wife's 
              countrymen. Very arrogant, if this place sucks, at least he should go 
              back to Malaysia, bring the wife and his in-laws along. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Here's another sample of his brilliant work. He has since deleted it, but I dug it out.</strong></p>

               are one of those lazy Singapore morons I meet every day. Yes, I AM an 
              FT. And if Singapore is in peril, I will defend it, ON YOUR BEHALF.

              <p>"Let's get it straight from Blog post No. 1. I don't really like 
              Singapore and I like Singaporeans even less. But the irony is that I got
               married to a Singaporean whom I love more than anything in this world. 
              This started a chain of events that brought me across the Causeway. I'm 
              here now, with my family and a new job. I'd like to make the best out of
               it. But it does mean I'm going to stop bitching about it. Happy 
              Thoughts, hehehehe"</p>

              <p>I never classified all foreigners working in Singapore as
              foreign talents, only those that come here taking up important
              positions and earning big bucks, aka expatriates. All other
              foreigners working here I just call them foreign workers.</p>
