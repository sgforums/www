              <p>Please note that Mandarin is not Singapore's Tajik. In other

              <p>And also, are you seriously going to quote some stinking commie
              to explain the relationship between English and Singaporean

              <p>He is living in the wrong place.  He will fit in well in Chinese speaking countries China and Taiwan.   He does not seem to fit in to multiracial Singapore.  Probably in his young days he was jilted by British angmo lady and become who he is now hating the English and English language.</p>

              <p>Yeah, like you said, he may be Chinese educated. For some reason, Chinese educated Singaporeans like to treat Singapore as a mini province of China. Like that Low Thia Khiang, always talking about Chinese Singaporeans needing to focus on Mandarin and not English, and totally ignoring those who don't speak mandarin.</p>
              <p>They think that Singapore is a bilingual country that only uses English and Mandarin, when in fact, most people here are bilingual, but Singapore is a multilingual country.<br><br>If you give these people too much room, they will completely abolish English and establish Mandarin as Singapore's working language. Maybe even create a new national anthem and change our national language from Malay to Mandarin as well.</p>
