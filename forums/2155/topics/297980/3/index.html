Get your facts right before you post such stuff here. <strong>You think anybody would wanna bring down their profits simply because their client is of their own race? </strong><br></blockquote>1) Where did you get your information of non-chinese in Singapore always get discriminatied? Or are you generalizing? Big mistake pal.<br><br>If you were trying to say, "Are you trying to say that non-chinese in singapore always get discriminated", then you phrased it the wrong way and did not fully comprehend what whoever you are quoting. A mistake no experienced lawyer nor a secondary school study would make.<br><br>2) No I do not think they would bring down their profit simply because their client is of their own race, I personally think they could and happily <strong>INCREASE</strong> their profit by selling an item with a $3 price tag for $4 to another race if CASE had not forbid this kind of discrimination.<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by anfieldheroez:<br>Get to the link below if you think that a non-chinese is bull^*#^ting you.Pack your dirty bags and f*ck off to where there are no non-chinese as that would spare you from us. [quote]<br><br>So according to your second sentence, you are referring yourself to "us". Which means you are more then one person. Either that or you have someone of many someones who is behind you.<br><br>This alone is also provoking the Sedition Act of the Republic Of Singapore Law. Because you are indeed, trying to sow discord among people here. If you had not posted this, it would have rested and nothing would have happened. And no, the post had no racism intended, you included it.<br><br>Secondly, you are officially slandering him by calling him to f*ck off which is verbally abusing him using vulgarities and you are asking him to go go somewhere where there is only chinese, which again, you are promoting racism. Another mistake any law abiding citizen would not do.<br><br>These evidence alone is sufficient to prove that you, as an individual is impatient, vulgar, uncivilized as well as a fool that quote the Singapore Law like a bible.<br><br>Please do not attempt to pose as a lawyer anymore because it will :<br><br>1) Upset us<br>2) Force us to hurt your pride as  we worm around the loop holes in your statement.<br>3) Cause yourself to think you're a fool.<br><br>If you want to reply back, I'm all game to play with your little "court" cos-play.</div>

Your mastery of the English Language is not very good in my opinion.<br><br>And also, lawyers have to quote or base something on something. A lawyer that "would had written it in my words" are doomed to failure and would be dismissed as without proving ground.<br><br>Sometimes, it is better to think in the shoes of others. But clearly, you did not. I would appreciate someone talking to another person using vulgarities. Very convincing huh?<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by anfieldheroez:<br>Try being in the shoes of a non-chinese and if you didn't feel the sting, then i guess you are god.</blockquote>If I am a non-Chinese, which I AM by the way, I'm Swedish, I DID NOT feel the sting. Lets put it that I am a Malay. There are many ways to talk, which does not include flaming.<br><br>And clearly, no one here has said it's the Malay's fault in general. But it IS the Malay's fault INDIVIDUALLY for charging him more then what the price tag is.<br><br>Please, read before you reply.</div>
