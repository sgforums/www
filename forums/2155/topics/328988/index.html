              <p>I attended a exhibition at Suntec city IT Show on 30 August 2008. Unfortunately, my experience of the product trying was totally spoiled by the OTO sale staff. I am disappointed because his behaviour was totally selfish and unconsiderate of other people fealings.<br><br>It happened during the time I was sitting and experiencing your new product (back massager), the sale staff just right beside me and was talking with another 3 philippine customers, so I didn't want to distube him. However, he suddenly come to my chair and pulled away my power cable from the equipment and it was stopped rightaway, I was so shocked at that moment as my brother also watched it too. <br><br>He seem never learnt how to be polite? he was not even asking or saying anything to me first. OK, I understand he was using the power cable to test another same product to his current customers. then I keep siting there for another minuate and see whether he will plug it back for me. No he didn't, he just keep ignoring me all the way, I was sitting there like a stupid person. After that, I decided to stand up from the sit and watching him for more than 2 mins, but he still keep ignoring me again as usual, I didn't scold him but I took a picture of him.<br><br>I wonder anyone know who is sale person in the picture?  how can someone ignore a customer like this way, he seem never learnt how to be polite in school. from the beginning to the end, he didn't even look at me. maybe he think I was shopping around and would not buy anything from there. Before I leave the OTO booth, I walked infront of him and told him directly: "I was really disappointed with your behavior", think what? he showing me a face which he doesn't matter.<br><br>Infacts, I am a real OTO customer and even purchased 4 products from their company like Eye Massager, Trimax 808, Spinex massager and Blood Pressure Monitor. Anyway, I believe the customer service training courses they provided is surely good enough, only thing is the personal attitude and behavior was not easy to be changed. I was just the unlucky person in the wrong place at the wrong time. This my bad but  valuable experience about OTO.</p>
              <p>I wonder is there anybody here have the same experience like me in IT show or any other places else?</p>
