              <p>Had account closed in Pretty Ok &amp; Smart Bank byÂ them without a call or notice. My falut that I dint know they can only deduct the $2 on the last day of the month so even though i make few transfers in/out of this account and admittedly each time very very small amount 20-50bucks, still more than enough for the $2 la. why they dont deduct I dont know la maybe their computer only works on last day of month la. Also com[pletely understand their operators are too busy calling people to sell stuff so no time to call me when they want to close my account la, i understand la since now not many people want to buy those what evre bond mini, medium or large la unless its James Bond la so their operator must be having hard time trying to sell anything... where got time to call me over $2. Anyway, they got 24hr hot line for people like me who not buying anything to call la. some more its a 1800 toll free number wor, so who am i to complain leh?</p>
              <p>So old and wrinkled me call the 1800 "Pretty Ok &amp; Smart Bank" hot line to check how come now cannot transfer my small 20-50 bucks into acount leh? Nice foreign tele-customer service lady tells me "Sori, you have to open a new account because we could not deduct the $2 from your account". So now I owe the "Pretty Ok &amp; Smart Bank" $2.</p>
              <p>Now I very scared, owe bank money dont play play, sure kena sue. So I tell nice foreign lady on phone can poor and wrinkled me transfer the usual 20-50bucks into account to re-activate it leh? cos so simple and easy, they get their $2, I get to keep account everyone happy. Sigh~~~ but nice lady say cannot, die die need to deposit $500 open new account than they take e $2 lor.</p>
              <p>Now I blur liao, "Pretty Ok &amp; Smart Bank" got so many computer system, IT expert etc etc but they cannot let me transfer 20bucks to pay them their $2. They prefer to waste all the paper, forms, time, new atm card, new pass book to open new account for me to get their $2... it seems the $2 really very big wor! so big that it can cover their cost of all the paper, forms, time, new atm card, new pass book to open new account for me wor.</p>
              <p>But only one problem, poor me where got $500 la? but I got account with the "got any problem also can ask them bank" lor, so now every month transfer small money there instead lor.</p>
              <p>But stil owe "Pretty Ok &amp; Smart Bank" $2, i waiting everyday to get letter telling me that i kena sue by bank cos i owe them $2 never pay. But I think i will tell judge not i dont want to pay, they dont let me pay wor. Anyway, they are "Pretty Ok &amp; Smart Bank" la so I dont think they so stupid will waste time and money to sue people for $2 la.... Than my friend tell me dont forget they are now part of "Dumbest Bank in Singapore" wor... Alamak...maybe they really will sue wor...</p>
