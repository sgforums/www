              <p>On 11 February, at around 1030pm. I went to purchase a drink of bandung from the Mr Teh Tarik outlet at Tampines East CC. As always, i would address the person at the drink store "uncle" as he was quite old.</p>
              <p>To my astonishment, not only did he dislike being called uncle, he started to mock me! I clearly gave my order in a loud clear manner and he went on to make a sarcastic sound of inquisition.</p>
              <p>Uncle:HUH?!?!? ARHUH!?!?!</p>
              <p>Me: 1 bandung take away</p>
              <p>As he makes the drink, he prepared my drink in a rather discontented manner. Shown by his body language of slouching, scooping of the ice and add the syrup to the condensed milk. He didn't even ensure that the drink was mixed properly. This wasn't the usual standard of the drink as i've bought the drink from there before. It was not made by him then but others. Most likely his subordinates.</p>
              <p>Uncle: UNCLE HAVING HERE OR TAKE AWAY?*Sarcastic tone</p>
              <p>Me: Take away</p>
              <p>Uncle: UNCLE 1.30 UNCLE!*Sarcastic tone</p>
              <p>Me:(passes him the money)</p>
              <p>Uncle: THANK YOU UNCLE! BYE UNCLE! SEE YOU AGAIN UNCLE *very sarcastic tone*</p>
              <p>I was rather angry by his actions as he was giving a bad service just because he was called in a manner he didn't deem fit. I didn't think calling uncle was a rude way of addressing him as in Singapore culture it is the norm to call an elder uncle. I was quite shocked he called me uncle as I am just 17 year old. This "uncle" is a man in his late 30s/ early 40s Indian man with highlighted streaks of brown in his hair.Â </p>
              <p>With service being of utmost important in Singapore, how could this inappropriate behaviour go overlooked. He can be certain i would not be patronizing this stall anymore</p>
