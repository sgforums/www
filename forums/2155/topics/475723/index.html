              <p style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;" dir="ltr">I am writing to express my absolute dismay with the management of city square residence on a $150 that was ridiculously charged just because of a piece of paper that was not placed on the dashboard of my vehicle.</p>
              <p style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;" dir="ltr">Right from the start, I was not informed by anyone at all that i had to do so . If i were told, i would had done so accordingly. The security guard on duty had already took down my particulars together with my car plate no and told me that I had to park my vehicle at the yellow lot  located at basement 2 which i did as per instructed. So what is the point of this paper?  I am completely stunned to see my wheels clamped when i was about to leave  an hour later. This is completely ridiculous. </p>
              <p style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;" dir="ltr">The  security guard whom i approached to clarify was just unhelpful and irresponsible. First of all, it was he who did not informed visitors about this unbelievable rule and what  came out from him was just money. Just pay and go and write appeal letter to management!  As I was in a rush, I had no choice but to pay first. The next horrible thing happened. As only cash payment is accepted, I told him I do not have enough cash. And a very helpful suggestion was being provided to me,to get someone to come all the way down to the city residence to made the payment for me. I wasted time and effort to go to atm machine and paid him.</p>
              <p style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;" dir="ltr">Upon submitting the appeal letter, i asked the security how long does it take to receive a reply. All he could reply is i had to keep calling back to check after 2 days which later on turn out to be one month. When i tried to call again after a month, the person who answer the call was not helpful at all. He was trying to brush me off by saying that the result will be posted to me and abruptly hang up the call.</p>
              <p style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;" dir="ltr">I finally received an unfavourable revert after waiting for so long telling me these are house rules and it was being sent to the residents and owners on 9 March 2011. But i am not a resident or owner which i am glad I'm not one. So how would I know?</p>
              <p style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;" dir="ltr">This is a horrible experience with city square residents management for their inflexibility and unwillingness to listen. </p>
              <p style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;" dir="ltr">I have been trying to reach the management by sending them emails explaining about the situation, but there wasn't a single reply. Can Some please tell me what should i do?</p>
              <p style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;" dir="ltr"> </p>
