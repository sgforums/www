            <div class='col-md body'>There's this story about Confucius. In his time, horses were very valuable commodities. Once the stable in his lord's house caught fire. While everyone panicked about the horses, Confucius asked if anyone was hurt. Somehow, over the centuries, we have lost that humanitarianism, and our own interests and material possessions have become more important than the welfare of other human beings. This is perhaps the sad outcome of living in a selfish and materialistic modern society.</div>
