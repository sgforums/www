Your Friend is what licence? Everyone made mistake.  Your friend obviously did.<br><br>Does it qualify him as stupid?<br><br>So what if the houseowner came out to mentioned about possible damages to their property or that your friend might not have a licence?

            <div class='col-md body'>I was already walking away somewhere when it suddenly dawns on me that you storytelling needs sprucing up.<br><br>Let me try to understand this.<br><br>You and 2 friends is going for dinner/supper at 6th avenue.<br><br>Your 2 friends ride.<br><br>Friend 1 lives in 6th Avenue.<br><br>Friend 2 does not.<br><br>Both friends parked their motorcycles in Friend 1's driveway.<br><br>Friend 2 lost control of his bike while moving out of Friend 1's  driveway and most likely dropped his motorcycle at the opposite house driveway.  Where there is most likely parked the car of the opposite house's owners car.  Lets call them Couple AB+<br><br>Couple AB+ then came out to inspect their properties to make sure its not damaged.  ANd most likely, seeing their neighbour Friend 1 and his friends are fine and picking themself up. And their attitude was of indifference &amp; anger instead of being concerned.  They also threatened to call police, especially if their properties are damaged.<br><br>So here's my explanation:<br><br>It never crossed your mind that their concern is valid?  Not just for damages to their property?  That your friend might not have a licence? And he might have been drunk?<br><br>And in Traffic Rules, your friends might need police attention? Especially since losing control on a motorcycle like that, warrants a fine and demerit points on your friend's licence?<br><br>Frankly, did you actually has any idea what is a elite?  The couple AB+ can be classifed as elite.  Because they stayed in Avenue 6.  And until they called themself as one. Who frankly are you to call they are?  You already decided they are elite...then to call them wannabes?? Are you already a Elite to decide they are wannabes????  Did they tell you straight off, that They are Elite?  Or did you assume that title for them because of yourself feeling small?<br><br>And stupid? Did your friend 1 &amp; 2 knows of this thread?  What happens if your friend 1 is really a neighbour of Couple AB+. Does it make your friend a elite and you classifying him as in the same league with the couple you so despised?<br><br>And have it ever occurred to you that your Friend 2 might be laughed off his bike seat for his lousy control of his own motorcycle?  Did he want to be made the butt of the joke w/o him wanting to; by his fellow bikers?<br><br>And whether you are a driver or a motorcyclist.  Can you say the road everywhere is straight &amp; level?  Your complaints sure excuse your friend, though it does not excuse your ignorance.</div>
