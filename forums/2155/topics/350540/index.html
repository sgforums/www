              <p>i think thats the main problem with people who claim singapore sucks around me. thoe ones who talk about how singapore is boring and wants to move abroad seemed to be the poorer ones. they crave certain things in life but don't have the means to get them on a regular basis.</p>
              <p>compared to a customer i know who claims she loved it here in singapore and would never think about migrating. anyway she seems to travel around for more than half the year so i guess its hard to think of singapore as boring if you spend most of your time aboard.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>The fact of the matter is, the grass is always greener on the other side. Singaporeans will say you have no life because it's relative to people from another place.</p>
              <p>In actuality, it's the same wherever you are. I lived in Singapore until ORD from NS, then came to the US and have been here the last 12+ years. Even though many people think the US is happening, I also sometimes feel I have no life, but mainly because at that instant I was nuah and didn't feel like going out to do stuff.</p>
              <p>Every time I visit Singapore now, I feel it is quite happening. So many interesting places to visit so close by, like M'sian, Thailand, etc. and so cheap some more. Then there are many nature-related things to do in Singapore where there's hardly ppl around, like Botanic Gardens, Sungei Buloh, Bukit Timah, etc. Also more musuems nowadays then when I remembered back then.</p>
              <p>But I guess, if you talk about the variety of stuff Singaporeans are allowed to do by law,  there are some things you can't do lah. Like go to the shooting range, go hunting, mostly gun-related for what I can thing of...maybe becos I'm living in Texas...</p>

              <p>i think thats the main problem with people who claim singapore
                  sucks around me. thoe ones who talk about how singapore is boring
                  and wants to move abroad seemed to be the poorer ones. they crave
                  certain things in life but don't have the means to get them on a
                  regular basis.</p>
              <p>compared to a customer i know who claims she loved it here in
                  singapore and would never think about migrating. anyway she seems
                  to travel around for more than half the year so i guess its hard to
                  think of singapore as boring if you spend most of your time
                  aboard.</p>

              <p>That was what I was trying to say in the earlier post, that it is not Singapore boring, it is Singapore small. There are just so much/so many things you can put into the small place. You can get sick and tired of doing the same things/going to the same places over and over again.</p>
              <p>So back to topic header, Singaporeans have "no life" compared to say Thais in Thailand or even Singaporeans in Thailand, is true but then Thais in Singapore have "no-life" as well. That is partly because Thailand is big and Singapore is small.</p>
              <p>But for your customer, because she has the means to travel out of Singapore, the lack of size in Singapore is no barrier to having a "life".</p>

              <p>But then there are those that do not have a life, not because they lack the means but because they are busy making money and are too busy making money/working to get a life. In this case it is not a question of size of the country but the person's attitude.</p>

              <p>...or what TS is trying to say is that, people have to work so hard /study so hard to survive in Singapore, there is just no time to "get a life". Therefore, Singaporeans have "no life".</p>
              <p>...those that have "a life" are "slackers" (unless of course you are already super rich and can afford to slack).</p>

              <p>The fact of the matter is, the grass is always greener on the other side. Singaporeans will say you have no life because it's relative to people from another place.</p>
              <p>In actuality, it's the same wherever you are. I lived in Singapore until ORD from NS, then came to the US and have been here the last 12+ years. Even though many people think the US is happening, I also sometimes feel I have no life, but mainly because at that instant I was nuah and didn't feel like going out to do stuff.</p>
              <p>Every time I visit Singapore now, I feel it is quite happening. So many interesting places to visit so close by, like M'sian, Thailand, etc. and so cheap some more. Then there are many nature-related things to do in Singapore where there's hardly ppl around, like Botanic Gardens, Sungei Buloh, Bukit Timah, etc. Also more musuems nowadays then when I remembered back then.</p>
              <p>But I guess, if you talk about the variety of stuff Singaporeans are allowed to do by law,  there are some things you can't do lah. Like go to the shooting range, go hunting, mostly gun-related for what I can thing of...maybe becos I'm living in Texas...</p>
