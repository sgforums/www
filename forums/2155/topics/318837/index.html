Children are now tyrants, not the servants of their households. They no longer rise when elders enter the room.

They talk as if they alone knew everything and what passes for wisdom with us is foolishness with them. As for girls, they are forward, immodest and unwomanly in speech, behaviour and dress."</p>

              <p>People who are living in the city needs a routine getaway back to the nature.</p>
              <p>Going back to nature(avoid crowded holiday places) imo and ime(in my experience) would restore the humility back to us and makes us realize that we are only a small part of the natural order.</p>
              <p>When you go the the mountain the rock could be as big as your house, the cliffs goes down to a frightening depth, the night looks so dark and alive. It all makes us feel vulnerable and would restore our humility and lose our self centeredness. Hey the world doesn't revolves around me afterall or that my girlfriend or that of my parents or that of my schooling or that of my problems.</p>
              <p>Suddenly you find yourself 'alone' and all the things that you take pride in have suddenly lost its values. Your car cannot go where you are, your position is now irrelevant, your money is now useless, your grades is now too useless, you good looks is now of no value too. Your strength is now not as strong as you once thought. You now are without any armor. There's nothing standing between you and the might of God that surrounds you. You are now in His mercy(we have always been but we seldom realize that).</p>
              <p>Going to a beautiful secluded beach would also help. To see all that sands and the ocean empty of people. The waves so big that it deprives us of our pride. The ocean so vast and yet there's no single human who could live there. We are small indeed.</p>

              <p>The world has changed. Its hard to accept, I know I cannot do it sometimes.

              <p>We all, despite our age, are basically fun loving people who love to play but our fun should never be at the expense of other people and that is the only difference between men and boys.</p>
              <p>There's no maturity or immaturity in this world there is only characters. Some people just haven't developed it.</p>
              <p>There is right and wrong in this world. But there are people who doesn't want to take responsibility for what they do. Because what they do do not make them proud and they lack the courage to admit them and choose to live in denial. You think people can actually live in guilt? Of course not so they create good illusion for the bad things that they do usually in justifying their wrong by blaming others. Really. No people would walk around thinking themselves as bad people.</p>
              <p>There's likes and dislikes in this world but that is not the only thing.</p>
