              im feeling damn pissed right now.need an outlet to vent my frustrations.
                                                                    
              i was supposed to play for this stupid gig this friday(youth day).2 days ago X asked me to play together with him(and his friends)i said ok i let him choose the songs.i had to wait until 11pm just to get the fucking list of songs to learn.nvm i learn until 2am.so i asked when jamming and he said soon.2 days later he still havent contacted me.
                                                  
              i just found out its because the drummer dont want to play with me.i was like wtf?i have never even talked to the drummer before and he doesnt like me??really fucking wasted all of my time.
                                                  
                                                  
              and just to play for them i had to quit the band i was forming with my closer friends.i have wanted to play with X for quite awhile now.i have to admit he is very good,but his personality is really lousy.                 
                                                                    
              lastly to add on im feeling super depressed because i really like this girl and she likes me too but its just impossible between us for a certain reason.i just have no mood to do anything now.dont even feel like going to school tomorrow.
                                                  
                                                  
              thanks for listening.feel abit better now.
