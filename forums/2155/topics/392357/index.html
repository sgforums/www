              <p>I had a VERY bad experience buying anna nucci shoes at Jurong Point. I bought a pair of white kitty heels with a satin-ish bow. Looks very pretty. Cost me $42.80 which is very steep actually. Bought it JUST before the CNY weekend.</p>
              <p>I started wearing it that friday and by saturday, dozens of white thread had started coming off by the sides.</p>
              <p>Went back once during the cny weekend, and obviously they were closed. Work week came along, I had no time to go back. By the time I went to them, it was JUST 15 days, inclusive the CNY. And they said no refunds or exchanges because of 2 weeks policy blah blah.</p>
              <p>whatever. so ok fine I agreed to them "repairing" the shoes. They said they'll take a month cos their factory is overseas blah blah blah.</p>
              <p>whatever. ok FINE, I still agreed.</p>
              <p>I was shocked when they came back to me like a week later and told me the shoes are ready. I went back about a few days after that and was utterly disgusted. The sides were SEWN back and some of the finer threads were obviously still flying about. I don't know what constitutes "repair" to them but no person in their sane mind would buy such a pair of shoes in that condition.</p>
              <p>The lady boss "Joyce" talked to me on the phone and I had the WORST experience talking to somebody like that. VERY rude and kept making all kinds of excuses and very defensive, implying it's my fault blah blah. She said they had to do it at their "local factory" cos all closed for CNY in china and if I really want to, I will have to wait for ONE MORE MONTH to get my shoes "repaired".</p>
              <p>and the WORST part of it all is that she actually hung up on me.</p>
              <p>People do not make the same mistake as me. DOn't buy overpriced SUPER LOUSY quality shoes from anna nucci jurong point.</p>
