              <p><strong>Background story:</strong></p>
              <p>I'm currently on my internship in Japan fo 6 months. No pay, no allowance. Just subsidised accomodation and stuffs. My parents are giving me about $700SGD per month. For me, That's enough to survive and still have spare for entertainment.</p>
              <p>There's 4 of us. Excluding me, I know the other guys already, the other guy we didn't know him before and I find him a big snob.</p>
              <p>I have about $600SGD spare cash myself.</p>
              <p>With that $700SGD, I get about 10,000yen spare to spend.</p>
              <p>I'm in Kyuushu, the cheapest region so it's okay.</p>
              <p>Next month, will be going on a sponsored trip to Yokohama and Tokyo for 5 days, I told my mum and she told me that she would give me $800SGD for the next month. I told her it's okay. But she still banked in that amount. I won't say I'm not happy about it but I just feel bad.</p>
              <p>So basically, after deductions and stuffs. I would have 20,000yen spare next month, that along with my $600 converted to yen. Brings a total of 60,000yen.</p>
              <p>I'll be here until next year april, can't expect to spend all 60,000 yen. Plus there will be another sponsored trip to Osaka and Kobe next year.</p>
              <p>So I'm putting my budget for Tokyo at about 30,000yen max. I know thats not alot but I won't be shopping like crazy.</p>
              <p><strong>Rant Starts..</strong></p>
              <p>So there's 4 of us. 2 are rich. Another guy and me are poor blokes, our financial status are somewhat similar. For me, I know that if I ask my parents for more money, they would definitely give because they worry about me so much they want me to enjoy and live comfortably here.</p>
              <p>But I don't want to spend anymore of their money. Already for this internship alone, I would have potentially spend $5,000 of their money in just 6 months. And they still have to pay bills at home and support other stuffs.</p>
              <p>That's why I'm budgetizing alot and trying to save here and there.</p>
              <p>Then the other 2 are so rich, they have no qualms about spending money like water. One guy just needs to mention money and his parents would give him. The other insists that it's his rights to swipe cards and spend his parent's money like water.</p>
              <p> When they asked what was my budget for Tokyo, I said 30,000yen would be on the high. They scorn at me. And come up with alot of shit like "Oh, once in a lifetime go tokyo blah blah blah". Afterwards, one of them started to indirectly attack me like "Singaporeans are cheapskates blah blah blah".</p>
              <p>They wanted to plan the trip all for shopping, then they say they don't mind eating cup noodles everyday and spend their money all on shopping.</p>
              <p>The other guy and me wish to spend half the time on sight seeing as well but they won't agree to it. Moreover, we can't split up because our supervisor will be the one taking u around.</p>
              <p><strong>Even bigger rant..</strong></p>
              <p>This guy, the one whom I had mentioned about swiping cards keeps taking cheap shots at the other guy and me.</p>
              <p>Bragging about how he went to the US and he spent only 7000sgd and he feels its too little.</p>
              <p>He doesn't realise that he's rich, we're not. We don't have spending power. He has a good grade, that's why he can come on this trip. He's a fine epitome of high IQ no EQ</p>
