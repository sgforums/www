              I would like to share a bad experience I had recently with Loewe products, their customer service, as well as their credit note policy. I bought a wallet less than a year ago, and within that period, the item was sent back to Spain for repairs for the same defect twice. After the last repair, the store assistant advised that to prevent the same problem from happening, they will issue me a credit note, to purchase another wallet from the store. When I went down to the store to purchase items, the store person then changed her statement and told me that the exchange is based on a 1-1 wallet (with particular emphasis on the word "wallet") exchange, and not a dollar to dollar value exchange. 
              
              When pressed further for what she meant, and if I could purchase a bag, she said I could purchase anything I want, and top up the extra value, but I could only be entitled to one item. Already there is a flaw in her statement when she kept insisting that it is a 1-1 wallet exchange because she said I was entitled to goods other than wallets, how then is that a definition of a credit note? I then asked to speak with someone who is in higher authority, and her reply was that she was the highest in the store, and I could only speak to her. I then pushed her for a contact to email someone in the office, and after relating the story to a Joyance Teo, nothing was done to answer any of my queries. She just parrot-ed the same thing that Jane in the store said, and avoided my questions altogether. She was just stringing me along with her replies, and refused to answer my direct statement. She reiterated that they are giving me a credit note, but when asked if that meant I could pick up 2 items, she just replied that it was a credit note of $x.  
              
              First of all, the attitude of the service staff in the boutique is unacceptable, firstly she tells me it's a credit note, and when I went down to the store, insist that it is a 1-1 WALLET exchange, only to allow me to purchase any other goods other than a wallet, but it can only be a single item. What kind of a definition of a credit note is this? Secondly, I am not even getting a 1-1 wallet exchange because they just repaired my wallet, without changing the clasp, and they are asking me to accept that. It is not a new wallet, and should the bar come out a third time, I will be expected to pay for servicing.
              
              I managed to contact the marketing manager who also replied with a very rude email, and told me that I am allowed to walk away with only one item (with emphasis in bold on the word one). I think this kind of service is unacceptable especially for a renowned brand like this, I have received even better service from hawker centre stalls. I believe any consumer out there understands that the term credit note refers to the entitlement to purchase items up to the maximum credit stated on the credit note, and not a 1-1 item to item exchange. I just want to share with readers that this is the supposed company policy of Loewe, so please be very careful when purchasing anything from them. They will not allow you to walk away from their stores with more than one item. I am bringing this further to their main office, but as of now, this is the current status, and they are obviously just pushing the consumer to accept defective goods, without so much as a proper explanation or proper handling. Each person just says a different thing at different times to try to push me away.
