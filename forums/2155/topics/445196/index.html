              <p>Would like to bring to all attention in regards of the retail manager of IMM branch, Joanne Lim.<br><br>My whole family mobile line is with M1.<br><br>1) My home broadband was applied since 2009. At that point of time, home broadband is not entitled as 1 line to be on multiline saver. Now they have change the rules. But for those customer who sign up their broadband since 2009, will not be entitled. The customer service solution is to request for me to cancel my home broadband and reapply again. Even if I recontract my current plan, I am also not entitled with the multiline saver.<br><br>2) When home broadband was applied, there is a package to sign up with mobile broadband. Hence I sign up and 2 years later, I called in to cancel. The customer service requested for me to retain and convert to a pay as you use plan though I have already mention that I do not need the mobile broadband. To my surprise, the upcoming bill, instead of only the subscription fee, I was charge $88 extra for data usage when I never even use the device. After much checking, customer service called back and claimed that it's an internal error and will have it waived for me.<br><br>3) still believing in M1. I went down to West Mall to recontract 1 of my line. The previous line is under my mum's name and I requested to be transfer to my name. After a 1 hour queue, I had been told that transfer of ownership cannot be done at west mall. I will have to go to the nearest branch at IMM.<br><br>4) went down to IMM. Queue as per usual. At the reception, I was told again a new information that 1 person can only hold 3 iPhone plan. - had explained that I have been referral from west mall to IMM and now when Make the effort to come down. M1 say cannot do. After seeking for approval, the manager finally agreed with the additional plan.<br><br>5) transfer of ownership, there is a charge of $20. Which I agreed to pay for.<br><br>6) when I finally able to speak to the retail person for the purchase of iPhone, he claimed that the SIM card need to be charge. I had mentioned that mine was waived previously due to my vintage with M1 but the retail person refused to have it waived.<br><br>7) the retail manager of IMM, Joanne Lim came into the picture and claimed that it cannot be waived irregardless of M1 putting me to go through so many problem and time taken for all this. I requested for her to seek further deviation and her reply to me is that She is the HIGHEST authority and there is no one else I can further speak to. So I question her, do I have to speak to M1 CEO, she claimed even CEO will not take decision of waiver and she is the HIGHEST authority that can make the decision only.<br><br>I would wish to comment on her attitude as a customer service manager is really horrible. So this is how M1 treat their customers? My whole family have a total of 5 lines and 1 mobile broadband with M1. The customer service manager do not even consider our vintage with M1 and talk down on customer.<br><br>It is not that we do not have the money to pay and we are begging for the waiver. Putting yourself in my shoe.. If you had been referred from customer service hotline to head to shop, from west mall to IMM.. Taking into consideration of the long queue and waiting time and all M1 internal error, do we deserve such customer service especially knowing that she is a Retail manager with the HIGHEST authority?<br><br>M1 really need to have a review on the person they promoted - Miss Joanne Lim.</p>
              <p>Am really disappointed with M1 services.</p>
