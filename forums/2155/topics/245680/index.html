            <div class='col-md body'>To: Ang Mo Kio GRC Town Council, AMK Hub Management, LTA, SBS Transit &amp; SMRT<br><br>I was on board a bus on 31/03/2007, around 1.30pm, Service 166 towards Ang Mo Kio Temp Interchange. Just at the traffic light before the bus stop (BLK 700B), the buses infront of my bus(165, 132 specifically), stopped before the traffic light even though it was green.<br><br>I assumed it is due to the traffic, and hence didn't bother. However, the stop at the junction lasted for about 10-25 minutes, with lots of buses and cars all lining up at Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 towards the AMK MRT. I was stucked in this bus waiting and waiting and waiting.<br><br>The traffic jam are caused by a traffic light further infront, which is after the bus stop, infront of BIG MAC CENTER. The traffic light there switches very fast, causing the cars unable to pass through causing a jam. Not to forget buses such as 162, 853, which drives from the bus stop into the 3rd lane, causing large amt of spaces used up.<br><br>Your bus drivers(SBS Transit, 165, 132, 166) are not very flexible as they did not intend to think of solutions to get out of the junciton, but wait there slowly as if the cars will disperse itself. They intend to line up bus by bus to enter the bus stop (BLK 700B), which is impossible as at the other junction, buses such as 74, 88, 130, 133, 136 etc are turning right into Ang Mo Kio Ave 3(BLK 700B).<br><br>This situation lasted very long and caused buses branching! Fortunately, another bus 166 bus captain drove up to the 2nd lane and finally my bus drove into the 2nd lane and drove up infront(overtaking 165, 132) the bus stop and let the passengers alight, and not wasting time to line up to get space at the bus stop.<br><br>A large number of cars are also turning left into the carpark and not to forget cars are also lining up to get into the carpark of AMK Hub. Cars are also turning out of the carpark, and then turning left again, causing 1[left] lane to use up. Another lane at the extereme right is also used for cars turning to the right[AMK Ave 8], leaving the middle lane for buses(74, 76, 88, 132, 165, 268.) and cars. In the end, this caused a jam along the skretch of road outside AMK Hub.<br><br>I hereby urge the respective department to do something to fix the situation asap.<br><br>Heres some things I thought of<br>- take away the traffic light infront of BIG MAC CENTER[impossible...]<br>- Enlarge the road[trees have to be sacrificed....]<br>- Change the entrance/exit of the carpark of AMK HUB<br><br>I sincerely hope this situation can be solved and reduce the traffic jam, and especially the waiting time.<br><br>Thank you.</div>
