              <p>Then you glare at her, or hiss at her or something.</p>
              <p>If you shout (I quote the TS) 'CCB FUCK!', then all that other people see is some stupid idiot is yelling profanities at some woman.</p>
              <p>After all, everyone on the train did not stare at the woman for messing with the TS. They are instead staring at the TS for yelling at the woman, and might in fact sympathise with her.</p>
              <p>You behave like the TS, the joke's on you. Seriously.</p>

              <p><br>You got a point, but I think TS was emotionally charged (aka f-king angry) at the time, so he's just out to revenge his own way by making the lady embaressed, which i feel in a way, it did work because if i was the lady, i would definitely feel embaressed about the attention plus the fact that i am still in the train while TS already say bye bye.</p>

              <p>Then think with the right head.</p>
              <p>People who think with their brain will glare or hiss at the woman. The result is that the woman gets the point that she is pissing you off.... which is what you want.</p>
              <p>People who think with the wrong head will yell at the woman. In this case the result is that regardless of what the woman feels, everyone will see you as a prick who just yelled obscenities at a lady.</p>
              <p>In the end, everyone on that train sees the TS as a prick. So in the end, he lost.</p>

              <p>TS' action has some virtue.</p>
              <p>We are assuming the woman had the guts to take be embarassed in TS' eyes but not the whole train's. But what if she was an aggressive PRC battleaxe ready to yell back? TS was right to shock her into backing down.</p>
              <p>Unless TS physically looks like a looney, he might not be seen as one. His action might even stand as an inspiration to not give in to such aggression.</p>
