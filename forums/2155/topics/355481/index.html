              <p>disclaimer: i'm not prejudiced against the PRCs or any other foreigners in our country, just voicing out on some personal experiences..</p>
              <p>it's been more than once since i've been bumped into by these PRC chinese, and when they knocked into me, the very least they could do was apologize. not only did they not do that, they stared at me as though i was the one who knocked into them! like wtf man. some just knock into you, and just act as though nothing happened and walked away.</p>
              <p>sheesh, if it happened to me once or twice i wouldn't give a rat's ass about it. but damn it happened more times than i have fingers to count..</p>
              <p>and some PRCs (not sure if you guys have seen any) just sit on the floor in the middle of the train like it's perfectly alright.. didn't know the fare they paid for included personal space on the train floor. heh. if the train's not crowded and they wanna do so, go ahead by all means do so..</p>
              <p>NOT WHEN THE DAMN TRAIN IS CROWDED AND YOU'RE BLOCKING THE WHOLE WORLD.</p>

              <p>disclaimer: i'm not prejudiced against the PRCs or any other
              foreigners in our country, just voicing out on some personal
              experiences..</p>
              <p>it's been more than once since i've been bumped into by these
              PRC chinese, and when they knocked into me, the very least they
              could do was apologize. not only did they not do that, they stared
              at me as though i was the one who knocked into them! like wtf man.
              some just knock into you, and just act as though nothing happened
              and walked away.</p>
              <p>sheesh, if it happened to me once or twice i wouldn't give a
              rat's ass about it. but damn it happened more times than i have
              fingers to count..</p>
              <p>and some PRCs (not sure if you guys have seen any) just sit on
              the floor in the middle of the train like it's perfectly alright..
              didn't know the fare they paid for included personal space on the
              train floor. heh. if the train's not crowded and they wanna do so,
              go ahead by all means do so..</p>
              <p>NOT WHEN THE DAMN TRAIN IS CROWDED AND YOU'RE BLOCKING THE WHOLE
              WORLD.</p>
              <p>dammit.</p>

              <p>You should take a trip to Korea. Being knocked by a Korean is NO BIG DEAL. They don't give a hoot to what you feel, because it's part of their culture. If you knock them back, it's also no big deal.</p>
              <p>Sit on floor, talk loudly, I have met so many Singaporeans who do those stuff too.</p>
              <p>Chinese accent? Seriously, we Singaporeans can't even speak decent mandarin. Don't know what you guys are complaining about.</p>

              <p><br>Dont u think yourself poor? Dont try to think about people get changing, deal with yourself, that's no big deal.</p>
              <p>After one week or one month or one year, do u remember the tiny episode? People r different, they have their own reasons to do it.</p>
              <p> Why they do that because they grow in a different environment , so make he or she different.  Not like u growing in a polite environment thinking people become polite or something.</p>
              <p>GUY, just grow up</p>

              <p>Lemme just say this....</p>
              <p>Some PRCs are indeed rude, but then again, I know of quite a few nice ones. Like that PRC guy who willingly took some time off to teach me how to run a computer simulation.</p>
              <p>Same goes for Singaporeans. Some are rude, some are not.</p>
              <p>The fella who shoved me against my gf in his haste to catch a train was not a PRC.</p>
              <p>The makcik who invoked the name of God before shoving me from behind (I kid you not) while we were boarding a train was not PRC; she was local as well.</p>
              <p>So.... let's be a little less liberal when it comes to the tar and brush, yah?</p>
