              <p>speaking good english doesn't mean having an alien accent, look at our local thespians for example, many of the older ones speak a very proper form of english without a fake ang moh accent, people like lim kay tong etc, they speak a much more correct form of english than some of those misguided youth who thinks speaking good english is aping the black ghetto slang and bimbo speak they've picked up on TV. do you think "oh !

              <p>So, similarly, why won't you find aping an alien mandarin accent funny ? Are Singaporeans so spineless, and have such an inferiority complex, that we are ashamed to speak english and mandarin in our native accent ? ...</p>

              problem with both languages, but the problem does NOT lie with the
              accent ....</p>
              <p>speaking good english doesn't mean having an alien accent, look
              at our local thespians for example, many of the older ones speak a
              very proper form of english without a fake ang moh accent, people
              like lim kay tong etc, they speak a much more correct form of
              english than some of those misguided youth who thinks speaking good
              english is aping the black ghetto slang and bimbo speak they've
              picked up on TV. do you think "oh ! I'm like ... I'm like" is good
              english ? ... *snorts ... </p>
              <p>So, similarly, why won't you find aping an alien mandarin accent
              funny ? Are Singaporeans so spineless, and have such an inferiority
              complex, that we are ashamed to speak english and mandarin in our
              native accent ? ...</p>

              <p>Not too sure about your first statement. From what I understand from my chinese friends, the term æ™®é€šè¯� is meant to signify that Mandarin is the de-facto standard in Beijing. But then again, I could be wrong :)</p>
              <p>Also I wasn't talking about us aping an alien mandarin accent. I just meant to say that our standards aren't also up-to-par, what gives us the right to laugh at other people's accents?</p>
              <p>Coming back to Singapore accent, it's very interesting, but I find europeans do have difficulty understanding us. I had been to many places for business, research, etc, and when I present to the western audience, even when I use proper Singapore English (without the la, and lor, and slow down my speech to improve pronounciation of words), some of them will still have difficulty understanding me.</p>
              <p>Maybe my English is really bad :)</p>

              <p>Well, if you are talking about the West belittling the East, of course I agree with you. Some people in the West even think Singapore is part of China.</p>
              <p>But why don't you see it as us subconsciously adapting to the situation, instead of thinking that we fake an accent? Sometimes I feel that we are smarter than them, in that we adapt faster, and we get ourselves understood. After all, language is but only a tool. We adapt in order to ensure that we get our message across.</p>
              <p>of course, faking an accent for the sake of pretending to be a Westerner is similar to youths who dye their hair golden in an imbecile bid to make themselves look Western, is something that I feel it is unacceptable too. So I am with you on that.</p>

              <p>Well, if you are talking about the West belittling the East, of
              course I agree with you. Some people in the West even think
              Singapore is part of China.</p>
              <p>But why don't you see it as us subconsciously adapting to the
              situation, instead of thinking that we fake an accent? Sometimes I
              feel that we are smarter than them, in that we adapt faster, and we
              get ourselves understood. After all, language is but only a tool.
              We adapt in order to ensure that we get our message across.</p>
              <p>of course, faking an accent for the sake of pretending to be a
              Westerner is similar to youths who dye their hair golden in an
              imbecile bid to make themselves look Western, is something that I
              feel it is unacceptable too. So I am with you on that.</p>

              <p>well, I don't see it that way because Singaporeans seem to bend to the wind all too easily ... and the "adaptation", only comes out wrong, most of the time ... </p>
              <p>a little while back, I was at a 24 hour prata place, and there's this
              local lass with this beefy black guy .... when the black guy speaks,
              you know he's straight from africa (some african english accents are a
              lot like ours btw) ... but this girl was so cute, hamming it up with a
              funny, very unnatural ang moh accent ... I'd never know if she was trying to sound african or not ... :lol: ... then there are a lot of singaporeans down under who tries to "adapt", by speaking with an accent, but can only manage an "american" accent too ....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>so there ! ... most comically of all, .... this adaptation often leads to unintended effects ....</p>
              <p>There are a lot of different ang moh regional accents, we can never "adapt" to them all .... a canadian priarie farmboy would speak very differently from a newfie from a vancouverite, a brit would speak differently from an aussie or a kiwi or a south african ... If we were to adapt to them all, then many Singaporeans can have second careers as ventriloquists, no ? ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>so, this "adaptation", most often comes out as a rojak of confused twangs picked up from cable TV ... </p>
              <p>instead of being a laughing stock ... why even bother faking it ? ... it'll definitely comes out unnatural, no ? ... what's wrong with simply speaking clearly ? ....</p>

              <p>Again, I refer you to my previous posting. As I mentioned, faking an accent just for the sake of faking it is silly. And faking it, vs adapting it in order to improve communications, is also very different.</p>
              <p>In my field of job, I only care about the end result. I don't give a hoot to the tool. If I need to adapt my pronounciation to improve communications in order to achieve results, so be it. At the end of the day, it's results that count. And so far, I think I am considered to be doing really well, since I have been successful in my interactions with many nationalities from US to Europe to Japan to Asia Pacific, and I have been commended on my ability to gel everyone together to common objectives.</p>
              <p>It's really up to you. I don't give a hoot to the tool. I am only concerned with achieving the results I need.</p>

              <p>good for you dude ... Singlish or fake ang moh accent, as long as it floats the boats, neh ? ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>but of course, it all boils down to how secure you are in your own skin ... </p>
              <p>I don't need anyone to tell me how I should speak, be they ang mohs, PRCs, and certainly not other singaporeans with a closet inferiority complex, and I don't think anyone can be truly proud and confident of who he or she is, if the person is not even confident of how he sounds like when he opens his mouth ... but if you think affecting a "singaporean ang moh" accent is a good way to bridge bridges between everyone from kiwis, aussies, brits, canadians, americans, south africans, or any other sort of different ang mohs all with widely different accents ........ whatever works mate ! ... </p>
              <p>and back to topic ... I don't laugh at the way those fellows speak ... be they ah tiongs, ah nehs or the lesser sort of ang mohs, but I certainly take offense when they do ... this is singapore ... this is how we are, who we are ... they don't like it ? don't like any of our values ? kindly fark off back to where they come from ... there are plenty waiting in line to take their place while the grass is still green .....</p>
