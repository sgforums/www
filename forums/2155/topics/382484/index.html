              <p>SOL is very unlikely and TS does not need to double post the same thing in SAF forum and here as well. What the guard has done was not wrong except just being rude which is a very minor thing compared to him letting u into the camp without proper identification.</p>

              <p><br>Don't worry. When comes to small fries, SAF will not hesitate to give out punishment. They value civilian more than a few NSF.</p>
              <p>Btw, u shall have warn the rude NSF that u will file a complain if he continue being rude to u. I bet his attitude will change 180 degree. If he continue to do so. Make a huge fuss over it until some high rank officer comes out. I think that officer will so scare u will lodge a complaint at Mindef that jeopardise his career he will screw that small fried NSF infront of u.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #333399;">Well, I kinda experienced this when i went over to this camp to pass my brother some things. I had to head to the pass office to exchange for a pass. Well I did not bring along my IC along with me and so I asked if my other id was ok which is my club id. It has my photo, my ic, full name.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">Well the person who attended to me said no. Then he interrogated me. (1) <span style="color: #800000;">He said</span> "<span style="color: #800000;">Why you didnt bring your IC</span>". (I need a reason to not to bring, i didnt know i had to?). Well I replied, "Cos i left it at home?" WOW then guess what he said. (2) <span style="color: #800000;">HE said</span> "<span style="color: #800000;">Why you put at home</span>?" (Isnt this guy too much?) (FYI, im a civilian) I replied, " Cos I forgot to bring?" (3) <span style="color: #800000;">He asked</span> again, "<span style="color: #800000;">Why you forgot to bring</span>?!" I was so pissed that I said, "You mean i cant forget to bring?"</span></p>
              <p>Well i was rejected of my id.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">I mean what kinda attitude is that fellow trying to do to a civilian? No respect? If he doesnt even respect someone who is a civilian, how does he respect officers?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">Then I asked for his name. He covered his name on his No. 4. But ive already managed to see it. So I wanted to speak to one of his superior to clarify his disgusting way of talking. Well I know in the pass office there wouldnt be any officer around. But i asked him. He asked the SGT who happens to be oblivious as well. So i waited there for 10 min without anyone doing anything.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">Annoyed, I sent a mail to Mindef, Chief Of Army and etc. The reply I got was only from the Customer Service Officer which was, "We have already informed the camp and the person attended to me will be councelled."</span> <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>What is the actual punishment n procedure for such barbaric and uncivilised manners? You mean they put such gangsters to interact with the public? SAF taught this to them for NS? Don't think they'd teach immoral values. Lack of manners you can forget talking about discipline to protect the citizens and country. Try asking him to speak this manner to his officers and see what he get, COUNSELLING? In his dreams. So the punishment from mindef is counselling?</strong></span></p>

              <p><br> Huh! i thot the last time i visited SAF day at Jurong, that Colonel
              told me that SAF look at service to the public as the utmost
              important, like this how can, we are the taxpayers ok, and SAF live
              on Taxpayers money ya, in fact, we are the customers, what security
              are you talking about when someone can take a rifle and go orchard
              running about????</p>

              <p>Before you even talk about service in SAF, how about you go to all the shopping centers and teach their staff what is service? Their job is to REALLY serve their customers but i think they show even less service than many of the people in SAF.</p>
              <p>SAF's job is not to be polite to public who tries to breach our security. Without the SAF to deter others from trying to give us trouble, you won't even have a orchard road for you to do your shopping.</p>
              <p>If you wanna talk about 1 off incident. Should be remove the police force because MHA let Mas Selemat escape? Should we remove all teachers because 1 has commited sexual offence against a student. Should we remove everyone just because 1 person has made a mistake?</p>
              <p>What business besides trouble do u all bring to SAF that requires our service? Civilians have strictly no reason to even enter any SAF camp outside of open house so trying to enter a camp is breaching of our security and giving us trouble.</p>
              <p>TS is just 1 great example why everyone say Singaporeans are so petty and complain about every single small thing.</p>
