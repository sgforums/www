            <div class='col-md body'>Sianz tot I am doing a goodwill by helping my students to check which universities they can apply to with their diploma...then I told them some universities might be able to help them transfer credit based on what they are studying now, but how many credits i cant really say cos it is based on case by case basis...<br><br>turned out that they think the diploma is useless cos they cant even get a credit transfer to waive one year off the total 3 years of degree program. then they tried to blame it on me and told my manager that I told them the diploma is useless. I have never even said that  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>and i had thought they have treated me better these last few weeks.

No. Because if I did, I would be no better than any of them.<br><br>In the end, my conscience is clear, and what I believe is that when the time comes for me to face God, I can honestly say that I did the right thing in this respect.<br><br>I still refuse to hate those buggers.<br><br>I just pity them for their lack of conscience, that's all.</div>
