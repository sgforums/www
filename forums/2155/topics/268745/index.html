She suddenly stopped in front of my path.  I got no time to honk her and was concentrating on my brake.  It gave such a loud screeching sound that everybody just stopped and stare.  That girl was startled and frozen there. If she had dashed accross, thing would had been better.  But she just stood there.  I cannot change lane but to drive along.   I managed to stop in time but not without the smoke coming out from my car.  I thought my car was a goner then ....   I have learned to slow down especially in buzy street ..</div>
