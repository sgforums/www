              I was shopping at the ground level of Rivervale Mall &amp; saw some things from a gift shop, as I intend to buy quite a number of same items so I ask the salesperson (an old auntie) if I can take some time to choose. She was quite ok at first &amp; said no problem, their stuff were kind of like everywhere so that's why I asked her. 
                          
              I chose for a few minutes at a corner &amp; was about to make payment, then this same auntie suddenly come over &amp; shout "you mess up like that later who wants to buy" &amp; grumble things like you can come later &amp; they should not place these items here, etc. I just smile &amp; said I have no time later &amp; your items was already display like this when I came. I told her I have take my pick, would you like to make a count. She just grabbed my stuff &amp; said "yes!' &amp; stomp to the cashier.
                          
              I was really taken aback &amp; pissed off by her rudeness, her attitude seems to change 360 degree within minutes! So unreasonable &amp; its not like I'm demanding or anything, I'm actually more polite than her! Anyway, since I have spent a few minutes choosing the items &amp; I'm rushing to an appointment so I just ignored her, make a quick payment &amp; went off. I will not patronise that gift shop again!
                          
              Why is it so difficult to get good customer service in Singapore? Sometimes I feel that customers are even more polite than all these salesperson/shop owner. Always hearing stories of rude customer service from friends, etc, also.

              <p>Many people are just in the wrong job. They don't have the fu wu ren (service people) mentality, instead they have the "I'm king or queen" mentality YET they chose to work in service line.</p>
              <p>Yes, customer isn't always right but that doesn't mean the service staff gained the right to be rude. They can also be polite (if they want) to a customer who's in the wrong. Boils down to upbringing.</p>
