            <div class='col-md body'><p>Lakeside Department store, at Lakeside MRT, the auntie, who I think is the shopkeeper, is really rude to the customer even when there is no one else. At around 2plus, 29th Dec 2009, me and 2 friends went there to get a drink since we are cyclying from Boon Lay. Anyway, cut the story short. We went in there and look around for drinks. My friend though the 7-11 nearby got offer, so 3 of us decided to go to 7-11 to see. Then after discovering there is no offer and is more expensive, we decided to head back to that shop to get my drink. Why I was paying for my Coke, the auntie actually ring the bell and said in chinese Bu Yao Mai De Zai Wai Mian deng, which mean not buying the go outside and wait, when my friends are still actually looking around to see what they wanna buy. I mean if we don't look around, how the hell are we suspose to decided what to buy? I wait outside, since that auntie is so rude. After that, I heard from my friends, who decided to buy some sweets from there. When he was paying for the sweet, she still have the guts to say, mai suka suka lai, suka suka zhou, which mean don't happy happy come, happy happy leave. I was like wtf. Is this how all shop keeper should behave? This really give me a bad experience from that store.</p></div>
