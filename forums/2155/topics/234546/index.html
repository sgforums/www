            <div class='col-md body'>TS, i suggest u try the recruit express branch nearer to ur house. i went to that exact branch at JE CPF building which u had stated, but so far the service i got from them was satisfactorily good.<br><br>btw I was served by the only guy in that office lol. 1st time go there tio him as my interviewer, after which i got his namecard [impt if u need to call back]. within the same day i got an offer in the same day. that was in sept last year.<br><br>but at march last year, i couldnt get any offers from the RE branch at JTC building there. maybe the work time too short liao so they threw away my info. wasted my time lor. =.= so i just hope that u have enough luck for this season, TS.

            <div class='col-md body'>its freaking sickening these people.<br><br>just yesterday i went rtc for an interview. i applied the job online, sent them an email with my resume.<br><br>reach there, the person who replied through my email told me to go down for an interview asked me if i was working or studying. i said i'm studying part time and said i can't have the job because of rotation shift and i won't be able to choose the shifts.<br><br>though their ad stated rotation shift, i thought maybe something could be worked out. i even stated in my resume that i'm studying part time. in the end spoke to the person for less than 5 mins, i think less than 3 mins even and left for home. what the heck man.</div>
