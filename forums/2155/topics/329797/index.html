              <p>got seats better sit first.. at least you chop the seats guarantee any eldery/needy/preggy people boarding you can give the seat up..</p>
              <p>but sometimes I have problems identifying those preggy in early stages where the swell isn't that obvious.. you know you might get a slap or something.. :P but nevertheless, I still do give up my seats for them whenever possible.</p>

              <p>Before I offer my seat to any person who seem to need it, be it lady or man, I will first get eye contact, or get their attention, then I will through hand gesture, or if they are near enough verbally ask them if they want the seat. If they accept they will come over, and we exchange places. This way those shameless young men, be it local or foreign, cannot cut in.</p>
              <p>If a seat has just been vacated, I will hesitate,  look around and allow any one near to get the seat first, if no takers, then I will sit. My train journeys are always not longer than 20 minutes, so there is no problem standing all the way.</p>
              <p>Sometimes I wonder whats the beef about giving up seats.</p>
              <p>I believe if a visibly pregnant woman were to ask a passenger politely if she could have the seat, I am quite sure she would get it, or the next passenger would oblige. She don't have to go begging for a seat, she will be given one. Just ask, and not suffer in silence and then later write to the press. Same goes for others who need a seat.</p>
              <p>There are cases of heavily pregnant women, and very old people refusing seats offered to them.</p>
              <p>Most complaints of this nature is to disparage fellow passengers.</p>

              <p>I have heard and seen girls complaining that local guys are not gentleman enough, they dont give up their seats on the train and bus to ladies unlike OTHER COUNTRIES.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was on the train to work one morning. As usual, trains after 6am will be crowded like mad. I was sitting down. This young girl was infront of me standing among the crowd. Looked damn sleepy and tired, even fall asleep when standing. So tired to the extent that she almost just fell and concus on the floor. Before she fall she will open her eyes again.</p>
              <p>I stood up and offer her my seat, since shes so tired to that extent that she might just fall into the arms of some random uncles or tikos. (she almost fell on me too).</p>
              <p>Instead, she shaked her head and continue standing. And this fat indian man quickly rushed over and take my seat. People were all staring at me when they realized I wasnt getting down with the "you are so crazy, more crazy than paying $7.20 for a packet of M&amp;M" look.</p>
              <p>At first I thought cos she was getting down soon, ended up, she got down more than 10 stops after that. I looked at her in the window reflection after the indian man sat down, she was smiling, but dunno at who.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I wasnt angry la, just a little unhappy. In the end I stood all the way to my workplace for nothing.</p>

              <p><br>Ya....such things happened when you're unable to protect the seat which you wanted to give for the girl.</p>
              <p>Next time remember to protect the thing that you want to give others.</p>
              <p>For example, push the indian man away when he come near your seat, or put your foot on your seat if you don't want to hurt the indian man, or signal to the girl first and get her attention and synchronise with her to occupy your seat as soon as you lift your butt off it.</p>
              <p>Better still, if she don't mind to sit on your lappie, you can experienced being a Santa Claus in shopping mall before Christmas.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><br>Why you don't protect the seat from the indian man?</p>
              <p>No matter how quick the indian man moves, that can still only serves as an excuse to cover up your lack of attention to hold onto your seat for the lady.</p>
              <p>We should all be able to earn from our mistakes, despite all our excuses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Else, you could've started a conversation with her by telling her that you actually wanted her to occupy your seat and not that indian man.</p>
              <p>If she's pretty, then good for you lor. But I would imagine the lady should have some standards first before she even get any guys who are willing to give up their seats for her.</p>
              <p>If she is not pretty and got no standard, then I'm afraid alot of forumers here might be laughing their ass off at you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And sorry if this post is too strong for you. I don't mean it, I'm just in mood. :(</p>

              <p>I dun understand what is the problem of giving up a seat and
              taken by other ppl. So what if other guy taken ur seat instead of
              the lady? Does it hurt ur arm or leg? And do u know what is
              gentleman? Do u think gentleman applies to gals/ladies only?</p>
              <p>Fyi, i seldom sit in the mrt, unless there is empty seats and
              nobody is sitting on it</p>

              <p>me too, <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;"> i seldom sit in the mrt, unless there is empty seats and nobody is sitting on it</span></p>
              <p>and i think everyone does that too, if you exclude the one who gave up seats. there are very few reported cases of people attempting to sit in occupied seats.</p>
