              <p>As gym users know, public gym exercise machines are for all of us to use. If there are 2 person wanting to use the only one machine there, they can share with each other by queuing up and letting the others do his/her 1 set after doing their own 1 set. But some gym users with no gym etiquette would just sit on the machine set after set to monopolize it as if it's their own machine.<br><br>I was at Seng Kang gym just now, I tried to use the only low pulley cable row machine in that gym. I know what is gym etiquette, so every set I did, I will stand up, so that others can use. So i finished my second set with 4 more sets to go, this caucasian foreigner (wearing sleeveless new balance shirt) came and monopolize the whole machine even though he was aware that I'm using the machine also. I stood a bit close behind him for a while because I want him to be aware that I'm queuing up behind him. He confronted me by saying " are you standing there for a reason or you just wanna annoy me ? ". So I replied " just want to share this machine" then he say " stand away from me, one more set". So I did move away for a while as it's his last set and I don't really want to make him angry as he is a huge guy (around 190cm) and I am only a 163cm guy.<br><br>After a while, after I finished my fifth set with 1 more set to go, the caucasian's Singaporean girlfriend came (wearing orange) and monopolize the machine. So I asked politely, can we share this machine ? She replied same as his caucasian boyfriend " one more set ". After that she went away and dicuss with his boyfriend about me as I can heard them talking. I feel that they are ganging up to test me. I felt bullied.</p>

              <p>U know from almost all my posts that I'm anti-angmo. So I'm <span style="color: #ff0000;">very sorry about what happened to u</span>. However, I believe u held your dignity and I <span style="color: #ff0000;">admire</span> your longsuffering.</p>
              <p>Truly, if what happend to u happened to me, I'll be mad. (I was so anti ang mo, I spent more than 10 years writing down phrases to use should ang mos be funny, which I hope to publish one day).</p>
              <p>First, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">word 'annoy' was antagonistic</span>. If someone asked if I was trying to annoy him, my reply would be '<span style="color: #ff0000;">are u trying to be a dickhead</span>'?</p>
              <p>He will give a witty/rude reply, I'll reply with a witty/rude phrase.</p>
              <p>I am only 161cm. If he asks me 'do u want one' (this means do u want to fight?). My reply: 'make my day, the law is on my side'. He will make a first punch. If I can duck, good. If not I'll be floored. But I'll get up immediately and lunge at him with all my strength, grab his hand, <span style="color: #ff0000;">use my whole weight and drop myself to the floor</span>. Trick is touse your whole weight to bring an angmo to the floor as it'll be easier 4u. He will try to kick n punch me. I will attempt to use my elbows, kness and shin to hit try hit his face.</p>
              <p>U know <span style="color: #ff0000;">I hate them so much I am willing to get very injured or die protecting my dignity</span> (maybe to protect my pride, my muzzle complex or some oth reason, I don't know). Even if i DIE doing what I told u I will do, I'll never regret retaliating. Of course if i die, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ang mo will get hanged for murder</span>. In Singapore, whites cannot play with our law. It's <span style="color: #ff0000;">a life for a life</span>.</p>

              <p>i queued up behind him so that after he finished his set, then i will do my set, then after I done mine, he will do his set again. He shouldn't just sit down on the machine set after set to monopolize it. What if he was doing super sets ? Then i have wait for him for 30 minues so that he can complete his routine ?</p>

              <p>why do u suggest making 'indirect sarcastic remarks behind the ang mo'...why not make it <strong><span style="color: #000000;">directly to his face</span>?</strong></p>
              <p>That is why I stress unity among Indians, Chinese and Malays (Singaporeans) against the angmos. When <strong>some</strong> Sigaporeans walk pass other Singaporeans, why do they feel the need to strut and <strong>act tough</strong> in front of their fellow men, especially the local males? Why not display a humble facial disposition at each other, since we are all locals. What locals must do is to <strong>act tough toward ang mos,</strong> not amongst ourselves.</p>

              <p>People are sharing the gym, if you're unlucky, you meet the nasty ones. Won't hurt to do the workout later. Your muscles will still grow. If you insist, then hopefully the guy doesn't turn vicious. Public gyms are very crowded these days.</p>

              <p>U know from almost all my posts that I'm anti-angmo. So I'm
              <span style="color: #ff0000;">very sorry about what happened to
              u</span>. However, I believe u held your dignity and I <span style="color: #ff0000;">admire</span> your longsuffering.</p>
              <p>Truly, if what happend to u happened to me, I'll be mad. (I was
              so anti ang mo, I spent more than 10 years writing down phrases to
              use should ang mos be funny, which I hope to publish one day).</p>
              <p>First, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">word 'annoy' was
              antagonistic</span>. If someone asked if I was trying to annoy him,
              my reply would be '<span style="color: #ff0000;">are u trying to be
              a dickhead</span>'?</p>
              <p>He will give a witty/rude reply, I'll reply with a witty/rude
              phrase.</p>
              <p>I am only 161cm. If he asks me 'do u want one' (this means do u
              want to fight?). My reply: 'make my day, the law is on my side'. He
              will make a first punch. If I can duck, good. If not I'll be
              floored. But I'll get up immediately and lunge at him with all my
              strength, grab his hand, <span style="color: #ff0000;">use my whole
              weight and drop myself to the floor</span>. Trick is touse your
              whole weight to bring an angmo to the floor as it'll be easier 4u.
              He will try to kick n punch me. I will attempt to use my elbows,
              kness and shin to hit try hit his face.</p>
              <p>U know <span style="color: #ff0000;">I hate them so much I am
              willing to get very injured or die protecting my dignity</span> (maybe to protect my pride, my muzzle complex or some oth reason, I
              don't know). Even if i DIE doing what I told u I will do, I'll
              never regret retaliating. Of course if i die, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ang mo will get hanged for murder</span>. In
              Singapore, whites cannot play with our law. It's <span style="color: #ff0000;">a life for a life</span>.</p>

              <p>U are so right. It is how we handle the situation spontaneously that shows our maturity. There are a few ways pp can handle this:</p>
              <p>1) Retort with a witty remark. Then walk away. Most above 40 years will do this so that they will 'not get down to his level'. This is also especially true <strong>with people who know they can fight</strong> and injure someone but will not do so. IN FACT THIS <strong>ANG MO IS AGGRESSIVE BECAUSE (DESPITE HIS SIZE) HE IS A COWARD</strong> IN HIS HEART. A true fighter will not behave like him. True fighters will be gracious and say 'o i didn't noe u were using this machine...could u let me finish 1 set 1st?'.</p>
              <p>2) Fight him physically. This applies to young pp who are less matured and have a muzzle complex. Perhaps like me.</p>

              <p>It is sobering to be reminded that local sales staff often side with whites. Why do that to your own people? (rhetorical question).</p>
              <p>I had 2 such experiences in Carrefour n a pharmacy and at a furniture store. Each time the staff said to the white 'can i help u'. Then i jump right in between them n say '<strong>scuse me, i was here first. u r serving him 1st just bec he is white</strong>'. The staff at Carrefor said 'i served him bec i saw him first'. But I was there first.</p>
              <p>The furniture staff said 'i did not, i'm not a racist'. I replied 'yes u are, by your actions n u should be ashamed of yourself'.</p>
              <p>Besides these 3 incidents, there are many other times i've offended the white. So far I've not been bashed up. Maybe 1 day i would be.</p>

              <p>As gym users know, public gym exercise machines are for all of us to use. If there are 2 person wanting to use the only one machine there, they can share with each other by queuing up, and not just sit on the machine set after set and monopolize it.<br><br>I was at Seng Kang gym just now, I tried to use the only low pulley cable row machine in that gym. I know what is gym etiquette, so every set I did, I will stand up, so that others can use. So i finished my second set with 4 more sets to go, this caucasian foreigner (wearing sleeveless new balance shirt) came and monopolize the whole machine even though he was aware that I'm using the machine also. I stood a bit close behind him for a while because I want him to be aware that I'm queuing up behind him. He confronted me by saying " are you standing there for a reason or you just wanna annoy me ? ". So I replied " just want to share this machine" then he say " stand away from me, one more set". So I did move away for a while as it's his last set and I don't really want to make him angry as he is a huge guy (around 190cm) and I am only a 163cm guy.<br><br>After a while, after I finished my fifth set with 1 more set to go, the caucasian's Singaporean girlfriend came (wearing orange) and monopolize the machine. So I asked politely, can we share this machine ? She replied same as his caucasian boyfriend " one more set ". After that she went away and dicuss with his boyfriend about me as I can heard them talking. I feel that they are ganging up to test me. I felt bullied.</p>
