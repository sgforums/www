              <p>It is sobering to be reminded that local sales staff often side
              with whites. Why do that to your own people? (rhetorical
              question).</p>
              <p>I had 2 such experiences in Carrefour n a pharmacy and at a
              furniture store. Each time the staff said to the white 'can i help
              u'. Then i jump right in between them n say '<strong>scuse me, i
              was here first. u r serving him 1st just bec he is white</strong>'.
              The staff at Carrefor said 'i served him bec i saw him first'. But
              I was there first.</p>
              <p>The furniture staff said 'i did not, i'm not a racist'. I
              replied 'yes u are, by your actions n u should be ashamed of
              yourself'.</p>
              <p>Besides these 3 incidents, there are many other times i've
              offended the white. So far I've not been bashed up. Maybe 1 day i
              would be.</p>

              <p>Remember the PRC woman who held up the bus for 6 hours? Police begged her to get off and did not arrest her. SMRT sent a cab to fetch her home! Look at her face, easy to bully anot?</p>

              <p>You are quite wrong. Hong Kongers do not accept ang mos without question. Here they are ahead of us.</p>
              <p>Before 1997, Hong Kong was a democracy. The govt was accountable to the voters- majority chinese.</p>
              <p>Most Hong Kongers do not mix with ang mos. Ang mos may live in the nicer areas in HK, but the chinese don't view them as gods. The best thing would be to go and see for yourself. Hong Kongers speak cantonese. And <strong>you will see their attitude to ang mos.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The ang mos are forced to deal with them as equals. </strong>When there is a dispute between ang mo and HK customers, the business owner gives them equal treatment. Even if the business owner is an ang mo, he knows he better do it for his own good!</p>
              <p>After 1997, Hong Kong is no more a democracy. But the govt is still accountable to the people and limits the number of visitors and work passes from PRC.</p>
              <p><strong>PRCs have fewer rights to visit Hong Kong than international visitors, partly because so many sneak in on visit passes and find work. They are given a shorter entry visa than others. The easiest way for a PRC to enter Hong Kong: to have a boarding pass to catch flights at HKIA.</strong></p>
              <p>The Beijing government has the same objective as Singapore government: to treat HK as a cash cow. But they know that they better not mess with HK. HK has enough social problems, Beijing knows they better not make it worse. They know their own people are pieces of shit.</p>
              <p><strong>That is how far Hong Kong is ahead of us.</strong></p>

              </p><p>I am perturbed by the fact that many Singaporeans do not know how to answer whites. So I hope that u can memorise the phrases below. This is a gist of the phrases I'm going to use for publishing my book 'Verbal Counter Attacks'. I have collected these phrases for 10 years. I know it is unchristian to say these things and that is why I have not yet submitted it to publishing houses.</p>
              <p>White boy, Singapore does not owe you a living.</p>
              <p>You Are Not In A White Country, Buddy, So Don’t Try To Get All Tough.</p>
              <p>Variation: You do not have to look so fierce and try and get all tough.</p>
              <p>You Give All whites A Bad Name.</p>
              <p>Don’t push me too far.</p>
              <p>I don’t give a damn.</p>

              <p>I am perturbed by the fact that many Singaporeans do not know how to answer whites. So I hope that u can memorise the phrases below. This is a gist of the phrases I'm going to use for publishing my book 'Verbal Counter Attacks'. I have collected these phrases for 10 years. I know it is unchristian to say these things and that is why I have not yet submitted it to publishing houses.</p>
              <p>White boy, Singapore does not owe you a living.</p>
              <p>You Are Not In A White Country, Buddy, So Don’t Try To Get All Tough.</p>
              <p>Variation: You do not have to look so fierce and try and get all tough.</p>
              <p>You Give All whites A Bad Name.</p>
              <p>Don’t push me too far.</p>
              <p>I don’t give a damn.</p>
              <p>Bring it on…Give me your best shot.</p>
              <p>Nobody’s going to take your word over mine.</p>
              <p>Back off, quit hassling me.</p>
              <p>White: Get a life / You: Make me</p>
              <p>Don’t try my patience.</p>
              <p>You are a bad cold that wouldn’t go away.</p>
              <p>It was a dick move on your part.</p>
              <p>Hey arsehole, why don't you leave that guy alone (when u see a white bullying our country men).</p>
              <p>You unsmiling, cold-faced, totally driven arsehole.</p>
              <p>I think you are more bluster than bite.</p>
              <p>Load of bollocks, go away.</p>
              <p>Damn you…you moron.</p>
              <p>What kind of rat are you?</p>
              <p>If you have something to say ABOUT me, I'd rather you say it to my face.</p>
              <p>You will never faze me, MARK MY WORDS.</p>
              <p>It can take a while for my message to get through that dense brain of yours.</p>
              <p>Go to hell.</p>
              <p>Get lost.</p>
              <p>You are no help at all! / How do you categorise the two hours I spent with you in this foolish enterprise?</p>
              <p>What are you doing? / What does it look like?</p>
              <p>I relish the challenge.</p>
              <p>Do you think I'm just rubbing my gluteal maximus? I'm serious that I'm going to bash you up, white boy.</p>
              <p>You really think I give a damn.</p>
              <p>White: Are you through / You: Not even close.</p>
              <p>That’s none of your concern.</p>
              <p>Don’t stick your nose into my business.</p>
              <p>Remove your hand.</p>
              <p>White: Do you want to fight? / You: Do you want to die?</p>
              <p>You scared faggot, you can’t last two minutes in my world<br>White: What are you staring at? / You: I’m Staring At A Giant Arsehole.</p>
              <p>Go back to your cave, white bastard.</p>

              <p>Most Hong Kongers do not mix with ang mos. Ang mos may live in
              the nicer areas in HK, but the chinese don't view them as gods. The
              best thing would be to go and see for yourself. Hong Kongers speak
              cantonese. And <strong>you will see their attitude to ang
              mos.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The ang mos are forced to deal with them as
              equals.</strong> When there is a dispute between ang mo and HK
              customers, the business owner gives them equal treatment. Even if
              the business owner is an ang mo, he knows he better do it for his
              own good!</p>
              <p>After 1997, Hong Kong is no more a democracy. But the govt is
              still accountable to the people and limits the number of visitors
              and work passes from PRC.</p>
              <p><strong>PRCs have fewer rights to visit Hong Kong than
              international visitors, partly because so many sneak in on visit
              passes and find work. They are given a shorter entry visa than
              others. The easiest way for a PRC to enter Hong Kong: to have a
              boarding pass to catch flights at HKIA.</strong></p>
              <p>The Beijing government has the same objective as Singapore
              government: to treat HK as a cash cow. But they know that they
              better not mess with HK. HK has enough social problems, Beijing
              knows they better not make it worse. They know their own people are
              pieces of shit.</p>
              <p><strong>That is how far Hong Kong is ahead of us.</strong></p>
