              <p>Hi!As you mention that there are no space for HDB.By redeveloping the area will not do any help as it is alr overcrowding.So more upgrades will not do any help</p>
              <p>UPGRADES GOING ON:</p>
              <p>GENERALLY Clementi Ave 3 Central ongoing lift upgrading</p>
              <p>Block 321,322,323 will be going to be SERS <strong>(FUTURE)</strong></p>
              <p>Old Bus Interchange might have flats at the area. <strong>(FUTURE)</strong></p>
              <p>Block 445 and 444 is going to make way for other developments.</p>

              <div class="caption">Love for gardening: Retiree Siow Siew Eng grows fruit and has a pond on state land.</div>
              <div class="byline"><strong>By Joy Fang</strong><br> my paper<br> Wednesday, Mar 14, 2012</div>
              <p>SINGAPORE - A plot of land in Clementi Avenue 4 is home to lush vegetation bearing melons, bittergourd and jackfruit.</p>
              <p>One can also find ponds and makeshift bridges fashioned out of wooden planks going over them.</p>
              <p>They are all the blood, sweat and tears of Clementi resident Siow 
                      Siew Eng, 72. The retiree took over the management of the "farm" from 
                      her godfather three years ago.</p>
              <p>Her godfather, 87, built up the area and had maintained it for the 
                      past three decades, alongside other similar ones. But there is now a 
                      hitch.</p>
              <p>Madam Siow's "farm" - part of a larger 1,800 sq m plot of land bound 
                      by the Sungei Ulu Pandan canal, Clementi Avenue 4 and Clementi Avenue 6 -
                       belongs to the Government.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Land Authority (SLA) posted notices on the illegal 
                      structures last Tuesday, calling for those responsible for the 
                      encroachments to come forward by next Tuesday.</p>
              <p>If they fail to do so, the encroachments, especially those that affect public health and safety, will be removed.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, Holland-Bukit Timah GRC MP Sim Ann accompanied reporters on a tour of the site.</p>
              <p>She said that a Clementi Avenue 4 resident complained about burning leaves in the area a few weeks ago.</p>
              <p>Stagnant ponds there also serve as potential mosquito breeding grounds, noted Ms Sim. Concerned, she decided to write in to SLA.</p>
              <p>Only three families who illegally farm there have come forward to identify themselves, but Ms Sim hopes more will do so.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, it will be tough to have their views represented during 
                      consultations with SLA and the National Environment Agency, she said.</p>
              <p><strong>http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20120314-333314/2.html</strong></p>
              <p>"Many residents have an interest in gardening. But our concern is 
                      that it be done in a manner that is legal, orderly and doesn't create 
                      nuisances and hazards for other people living nearby."</p>
              <p>Ms Sim said that SLA has been gracious in allowing more time to contact the land users.</p>
              <p>An SLA spokesman said: "Pending the finalisation of development plans
                       for the site, SLA will seek and consider the views of the grassroots 
                      organisations on whether some parts of the land can be put up for some 
                      form of interim use for the enjoyment of the residents."</p>
              <p>Clementi resident Ng Ang Mui, 48, said her 76-year-old mother, who lives with her, suffers from advanced-stage lung cancer.</p>
              <p>To make matters worse, her two children have asthma and this was 
                      exacerbated when they moved into their flat - a stone's throw away from 
                      the land plot - six years ago.</p>
              <p>The burning of leaves sometimes occur three to four times a day, which, she told my paper, is hard to endure.</p>
              <p>"I feel very frustrated... We have loved ones living here and it can be quite life-threatening," said the part-time teacher.</p>
              <p>Madam Siow said she is heartbroken but will leave the land if she is required to do so.</p>
              <p>"I have so many vegetable crops here. What will I do with them?"</p>

              <p>The group of residents who have been farming on a patch of state land in Clementi Avenue 4 may now get a little breathing room.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Land Authority (SLA), which 
                  last week issued an eviction notice on the illegal vegetable garden, is 
                  now asking these farmers to come forward to discuss the issue.</p>
              <p>If they fail to do this by March 20, their vegetable patches, the sheds and other structures there will be cleared.</p>
              <p>An SLA spokesman said it has no choice but 
                  to do this, because public health and safety issues - from mosquitoes 
                  and air pollution from the burning of leaves on the site - have been 
                  raised.</p>

              <p>Hi!But u need to consider all the factors to provide bus service
              and the route is needed as there are no route for it to provide the
              bus service.</p>
              <p>Please look at http://www.onemap.sg/index.html</p>

              <p>If there's a feeder bus plying Clementi Ave 1 there will be demands. First,Nan Hua &amp; NUS students won't have to walk a distance to the bus stop at Clementi Rd and walk all the way to the Clementi Central. Second,there maybe future developments at the 9 en-bloc flats. Lastly,it also can avoid the crowds if the Clementi Ave 1 relys on Clementi Rd Bus Stop esp 96,183. But if it's a peak hour i think more students and residents will take the new feeder service to avoid the clementi rd jam and part of commonwealth ave west jam.it saves time.</p>
