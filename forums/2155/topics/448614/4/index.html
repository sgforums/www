              <p>SINGAPORE - The announcement of a Built-To-Order (BTO) project to
                               be built in Clementi, just three months after DBSS development Trivelis
                               was launched right next door, has upset a number of people who opted to
                               buy the DBSS flats, The Straits Times (ST) reported.</p>
              <p>This is as the prices of DBSS developments are usually significantly 
                              higher than BTO flats, and Trivelis buyers say they would not have 
                              bought DBSS units had they known there was a BTO project coming up near 
                              by.</p>
              <p>Last October, EL Development launched Trivelis, to be located along Clementi Ave 4.</p>
              <table border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" width="300" align="right">
              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td><br></td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
              </table>
              The 888 
                              units saw a high take up rate of about 80 per cent, as buyers snapped 
                              them up due to their good location. According to EL, the site is a five 
                              minute walk to Clementi MRT and Bus Interchange.
              <p>It is also located near three shopping centres and the National University of Singapore.</p>
              <p>In January this year, HDB announced the launch of a 670-unit BTO 
                              project right next to Trivelis - next to Clementi Avenue and 
                              Commonwealth Avenue junction.</p>
              <p>According to ST, the prices for the BTO flats could be as much as 25 
                              per cent lower than the Trivelis units. The cost of Trivelis units range
                               from $375,000 for the cheapest three-room flat, to as high as $770,000 
                              for a five-room flat.</p>
              <p>However, analysts interviewed sounded a note of caution for Trivelis 
                              buyers thinking of dropping out: The popularity of Clementi as a mature 
                              estate means that they face a high chance of not getting a BTO unit.</p>
              <p>In addition, those who do not exercise their option to buy their 
                              units will also have to forfeit the deposit., which is 1.25 per cent of 
                              the purchase price.</p>
              <p>For a five-room Trivelis unit costing about $700,000, this comes up to about $8,750.</p>
              <p>If they have already exercised their option, the penalty will be 20 per cent of the cost of the flat.</p>
              <p>About 100 people who have bought a Trivelis unit have not exercised their option, ST reported.</p>
              <p>EL said that so far, two buyers have pulled out due to the upcoming BTO launch.</p>
              <p>EL spokesperson Lim Yew Soon said that they have received feedback 
                              from buyers, but said that the Clementi BTO project also came as a shock
                               to them, having only found out in January, at the same time as the rest
                               of the population.</p>

              <p>Hi I would like to suggest on behalf of my friend of having a feeder service at <br>Clementi Ave 1 to lessen the jams there Hope to hear from you soon.</p>

              <p>Dear Mr <br><br>Our Ref: ICFMS/2012/03/0878<br>FEEDBACK NUMBER: 20120320-0692<br><br><br>We refer to your email of 20 March 2012.Â Â  <br><br>As the central bus planner, LTA's guiding principles are to plan an efficient, integrated and sustainable bus system which focuses on improving journey quality for commuters while balancing the system's costs. To achieve this, LTA has to strike a balance between better connectivity and balancing the increased cost to the system.<br><br>Â <br><br>Today, residents staying in Clementi Ave 1 can access 11 bus services (i.e. 14, 52, 96, 105, 106, 147, 154, 165, 166, 183, 185) along Commonwealth Avenue West or 5 bus service (i.e. 78, 175, 189, 282, 285) along Clementi Avenue 2 or 5 bus services (i.e. 33, 96, 151, 183, 196) along Clementi Road or 6 bus service along the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) (i.e. 97, 188, 196, 197, 198, 963). These bus services provide residents a connection to many key destinations and also to Clementi Town Centre and Clementi MRT/Bus Interchange. In view of the reasonable accessibility, there are no immediate plans to introduce a new bus service in the area. <br><br>Â <br><br>Nonetheless we note your feedback and will keep it in view when we review the bus network around the area. <br><br><br><br>We thank you for writing in.<br><br>Yours sincerely<br>Â <br><br>Â <br><br>Â SIM YIN PING<br>Â EXECUTIVE TRANSPORT PLANNER<br><br>Â <br></p>

              <p>I would like to feedback having 189B as 189 is very crowded<br><br>during the morning peak and the evening peak and having 189A is not enough<br><br>as it only service the bukit batok area.I really hope 189B will be in<br><br>operation and route is from Clementi MRT Station to Kent Ridge terminal<br><br>and to and fro only at morning and evening peak hour.<br><br>Â <br><br>Thank You.I hope to hear from you soon.</p>
              <p><strong>THEIR REPLY</strong></p>
              <p>Dear <br><br>Â <br><br>Thank you for your feedback.<br><br>Â <br><br>We wish to share that the highest utilization rate during the morning peak period usually does not exceed 92%. Average utilization rate is 60%. In the evenings, the average utilization rate is about 50% while the highest utilization rate is about 60%.<br><br>Â <br><br>Under normal circumstances, when there is no service disruption and all trips operate as per schedule, capacity provision is adequate in meeting demand. Therefore, we regret to inform you that we are unable to accede to your request to have a new service 189B. Nevertheless, we will continue to monitor the service closely and make adjustments to the schedule when necessary.<br><br>Â <br><br>Moving forward, should you experience long waiting time or overcrowding for service 189, do write to us with the exact date and time so that we can investigate and ascertain the cause of long waiting time/overcrowding.</p>

                                      of shops and facilities there.CityVibe mainly rely on PartyWorld
                                      KTV,Arcade and Virtualand in there.</p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: The 
              Housing and Development Board (HDB) will launch a bumper crop of 8,000 
              flats in Build-to-Order (BTO) and Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercises 
              on Wednesday.<br><br>The flats are in mature and non-mature estates, and cover a full range of flat types from three- to five-room flats.<br><br>HDB
               is using the ramped-up supply of new flats to help other buyer groups, 
              now that the queue of first-time flat applicants has been largely 
              cleared, National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan said in his latest 
              blog entry on Tuesday.<br><br>Slightly more than half of the flats will 
              consist of BTO flats, with about 1,200 flats in Bukit Batok, 860 in 
              Bukit Panjang, 670 in Clementi, 640 in Geylang, 410 in Bedok, 180 in Toa
               Payoh and 130 in Bukit Timah.<br><br>Mr Khaw said that with the wide 
              range of flats offered in the launch on Wednesday, flat buyers will be 
              able to apply for one that best meets their needs, and in an estate of 
              their choice.<br><br>As strong demand is expected for flats that are 
              completed or nearly completed in mature estates, Mr Khaw advised those 
              who want to have a better chance of success to widen their options and 
              consider applying for a BTO flat in non-mature estates.<br><br>Mr Khaw 
              said he will be monitoring the application rates to see how Singaporeans
               respond to the new government initiatives, adding that nothing is cast 
              in stone.<br><br>The results of the launch will help the HDB calibrate BTO rules for future launches to ensure that policy objectives are met.<br><br>The
               priority still lies with helping first-timers get their first HDB flat 
              as quickly as possible so they can start their families, Mr Khaw said.<br><br>In early March, Mr Khaw announced in Parliament a number of new measures to help various groups of home buyers.<br><br>The
               HDB is tripling the chances for second-timers to get BTO flats in 
              non-mature estates and enhancing the Married Child Priority Scheme.<br><br>It
               is also introducing a new Multi-Generation Priority Scheme to help 
              married children live with or near their parents, along with an 
              Ageing-in-Place Priority Scheme and a Silver Housing Bonus Scheme to 
              help the elderly age in a familiar environment.<br><br>300 studio 
              apartments will also be offered in Bukit Timah and Toa Payoh to cater to
               elderly residents under the Ageing-in-Place Priority Scheme.<br><br>- CNA/wm/al</span></span></p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: The Housing and Development Board (HDB) launched five Build-To-Order (BTO) projects on Wednesday.<br><br>The BTO launch, the first this year, offers 3,923 new flats in Choa Chu Kang, Punggol, Sengkang and Tampines.<br><br>And
                   a further 4,110 new flats will be offered for sale in the next BTO 
                  launch in March, in Bedok, Bukit Batok, Bukit Panjang, Bukit Timah, 
                  Clementi, Geylang and Toa Payoh.<br><br>In total, HDB plans to offer 25,000 BTO units for the entire year.<br><br>HDB
                   says at least 95 per cent of the flat supply (excluding Studio 
                  Apartments) will be set aside for first-timer households. Eligible 
                  first-timer households can also enjoy various housing grants to help 
                  them own a new BTO flat.<br><br>The projects launched on Wednesday are 
                  Fernvale Lea in Sengkang, Sunshine Gardens in Choa Chu Kang, Tampines 
                  Alcoves and Tampines GreenTerrace in Tampines, and Waterway Sunbeam in 
                  Punggol.<br><br>The selling prices for units at Fernvale Lea range from S$83,000 for a 2-room unit to S$283,000 for a 5-room unit.<br><br>For Sunshine Gardens, the price range is from S$77,000 for Studio Apartments to S$295,000 for a 5-room unit.<br><br>For
                   units at Tampines Alcoves and Tampines GreenTerrace, the price range is
                   from S$86,000 for Studio Apartments to S$292,000 for a 4-room unit.<br><br>And at Waterway Sunbeam, the price range is from S$152,000 for a 3-room unit to S$340,000 for a 5-room unit.<br><br>All these prices exclude grants.<br><br>Analysts expect strong demand for the Tampines projects, but the other projects are not likely to see 100 per cent take-up rate.<br><br>Mr
                   Lim Yong Hock, senior vice president at PropNex Realty, said: "We can 
                  see the take-up rate has moderated over the last one year, from 
                  subscription of more than five times. Now, we have moderated down to 
                  one-over times.<br><br>"I believe today's launch will probably see 
                  further moderation of the take-up rates. But of course, in a good 
                  location, the take-up rate will still be very strong, like Tampines 
                  (Alcoves). It's a hot location and it's also near a future MRT station, 
                  Tampines West."<br><br>Mr Lim said applicants are being more selective as more BTO projects, some of them in mature estates, are in the pipeline.<br><br>He
                   added: "Of course, everybody hopes to apply for a good location. So 
                  some of them may even wait for the March launch before they even put in 
                  their applications."<br><br>The vast majority of new flats are reserved for first-time applicants, and only five per cent go to second-timers. <br><br>If
                   take-up rates continue to moderate, analysts expect the government to 
                  start allocating more flats for second-timers as early as the first half
                   of the year.<br><br>Minister for National Development Khaw Boon Wan had
                   said in his blog last year that second-timers can expect more BTO flats

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: The 
              Housing and Development Board (HDB) has tweaked its rules to discourage 
              buyers who book a flat but subsequently cancel their booking, in a move 
              designed to better protect the interests of serious home buyers.<br><br>Such
               applicants who cancel their booking cannot, within one year from the 
              date of cancellation, apply or be included as an essential occupier for a
               new HDB flat, DBSS (Design, Build and Sell Scheme) unit, Executive 
              Condominium unit, or a resale flat with housing grants.<br><br>The requirement will be waived in exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the applicants.<br><br>The HDB hopes this will ensure that the flats are only allocated to serious buyers.<br><br>Currently,
               buyers only have to pay a non-refundable booking fee when they select a
               unit and a 10-per cent downpayment when they sign the agreement.<br><br>The
               HDB said it has seen a steady increase in the number of flat booking 
              cancellations over the last five years - from 309 in 2007 to 1,540 
              cancellations in 2011.<br><br>It said one of the reasons for the increase is the higher BTO supply in recent years.<br><br>The cancellations form five to six per cent of Build-to-Order (BTO) supply.<br><br>The applicants cite various reasons for cancellation, such as a change in housing plan and intention to buy another flat.<br><br>In
               order to help some families enjoy greater access to two-room flats, the
               HDB is also raising the income ceiling for two-room flats in mature 
              towns and estates from S$2,000 to S$5,000 per month.<br><br>The move 
              provides an additional housing option for households who prefer to live 
              in mature estates, but whose monthly income exceeds S$2,000. <br><br>The HDB also said it will be offering 4,640 BTO flats for sale in Choa Chu Kang, Kallang/Whampoa, Punggol and Sengkang in May.<br><br>It
               has ramped up flat supply substantially, to some 50,000 units in two 
              years, to meet housing needs and will continue to build more if demand 
              persists, the HDB said.<br><br>The HDB also launched on Wednesday 7,978 flats for sale under BTO and Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercises for March.<br><br>The public housing authority continues to place priority on first-time flat applicants.<br><br>In
               the March launch, 4,153 units are new flats in eight BTO projects and 
              3,825 are SBF flats in 26 towns and estates. Of these, 1,739 of the BTO 
              flats in mature estates and 3,609 SBF flats will render top priority for
               first-timers. <br><br>The HDB said 95 per cent of these flats will be reserved for them.<br><br>At
               the same time, the HDB is enhancing housing options for second-time 
              home-buyers, married children and parents wanting to live with or near 
              each other, as well as the elderly who want to age in a familiar 
              environment and families preferring two-room flats in mature estates.<br><br>For
               second-timers, the chances of securing a flat will be tripled from 5 
              per cent to 15 per cent for 2,094 BTO flats in non-mature estates. The 
              proportion of these flats reserved for first-timers will be reduced to 
              85 per cent.<br><br>The HDB said the chances of first-timers will not be
               too greatly affected, after successive massive BTO launches in the past
               one year.<br><br>The HDB also said there will be more housing options 
              in mature estates, with 3,174 flats in the March launch located in such 
              estates. These include 397 studio apartments and 366 units of two-room 
              flats.<br><br>More choices will be provided for married children wanting
               to stay near their parents, the elderly who want to remain in the same 
              town or estate, as well as families preferring two-room flats in mature 
              estates, the HDB added.<br><br>To help married children and parents live
               with or near each other, the HDB introduced the Multi-Generation 
              Priority Scheme (MGPS) at Ping Yi Greens in Bedok. <br><br>The scheme 
              gives priority allocation to married children and their parents who 
              jointly apply to live near each other. Married children can apply to buy
               a two-room, three-room or four-room flat at Ping Yi Greens, while their
               parents can apply to buy a two-room flat in the same project.<br><br>The
               HDB has also enhanced the Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS) to 
              increase the number of ballot chances a married child receives if he 
              applies to live with his parents. Such an applicant will now receive six
               ballot chances if he's a first-timer, and three ballot chances if he's a
               second-timer.<br><br>To help the elderly to age in a familiar 
              environment, the HDB has introduced Ageing-in-Place Priority Scheme 
              (APPS) to give priority to seniors living in the same town/estate or 
              within two kilometres of the project they apply for.<br><br>Seniors 
              applying under the scheme will receive two ballot chances, instead of 
              one. If they are also applying to live near their married child under 
              MCPS, they will receive four balloting chances altogether.<br><br>- CNA/wm/fa</span></span></p>
