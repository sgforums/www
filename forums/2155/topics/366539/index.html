              <p>haiz! how i wish i have a blog at this time.. but it will be inactive very soon..!</p>
              <p>i had a really bad day..have to wake up very early to do homework that i havent done... dam hungry.. then later mother woke up and saw me hungry so cook me a bread with onion and meat.. dam nice.. then go to sch everything was just fine.. then later o lvl chinese oral.. I AM THE LAST TO TAKE THE CHINESE ORAL FOR TODAY! making me so nervous.. then keep having gases in my tummy (most probably due to the onion, but i dun blame my mum and i thanks her for the nice breakfast)</p>
              <p>then the oral examiner asked me the 1st question, i answered.. i answered correctly (which i found out only after the oral) but the examiner tot i got the wrong idea of the question and repeated (might minus mark, all the examiner fault, i said the right thing and is answering the question very well) and then i got more nervous, cuz i tot i misheard the question... the examiner always give that stern face while the other give nice friendly face.. make me so nervous.. the usual one of the top few chinese students (me) had done badly for oral.. 40% my fault.. 60% examiner fault! i am not pushing blame or wat.. but it is dam true.<br><br>later i come back home depressed about the oral.. told everything to my mother, then she comforted me.. thanks mum. i feel much better, took a bath, eat and watch one hour TV. then very tired.. but had to force myself to do homework.. <br><br>then the stupid father comes giving me attitude (due to the thing he did last time, violence is the only i communicate with my father, and i always got the upperhand cuz i am big size) and delaying my allowance by 1 month.. (i allowed him to do so tho.. pls note that his contribution to the family as a father is around 0%.. it is kind of me to not give him negative..) he keep doing stupid things making me angry and frustrated.. really stupid stuff.. my mother even helped me scold father... i know i am right, really right.. i thought it all over and i am still right.. i know i am not stubborn.. one hell of a father.. no money still wan gamble, no money gimme allowance still gimme attitude, no money still dun wan find job fast.. always find so slow.. ( not even really trying, i force him then he find job).. stacking up with my homework, filing, pressure, oral stuff... and that father of mine.. i got really pressured.. i cried.</p>
              <p>lock myself in a room.. cried.. luckily there is this teddy dog of mine that i could at least pour my sorrow to.. punch the wall.. then come out (actually calm already) see the father again... make me angry again.<br><br>you might be curious why my father and i are like enemy.. from 1 yr old to 12 yr old he used violence on me, nv taught me a thing, no patience on me.. treat me as if i am his slave even if i am his biological son, always lose money whack me.. torture and abuse my mother and me.. and my brother.. everyday beat me and scare me.. scold me..</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>anyway if u are able to read till here, u are good..<br><br>summary would be : bad day, really a bad day<br><br>haiz just to whine here and get it all over with.. rather than a blog..<br><br>well there are still good things today.. 9 very pretty girls board the same bus as me today. the pretty girl in my class talk to me (but found out she is close to one of the nerd, i hate the nerd.. always so sarcastic in talking, think he very humorous when he took my joke, spread rumours to smear my reputation, give him good things he complain.) HAAAAAAAIZ!<br><br>seriously.. the good things are actually nothing... best thing is my mother and my dog.. and my brother.. even volunteered to give me my allowance temporarily (tho i didnt take cuz he is my brother afterall, my bro is 30 yr old and i am 16..)<br><br>HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIZ hate this life... but at least there are still a few things good in this very bad day.<br><br><br>Congratulations on reading so much words.
