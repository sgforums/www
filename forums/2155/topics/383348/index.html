              <p><span>from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/445700/1/.html">www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/445700/1/.html</a></span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore will for the first time boast a gaming industry, when two integrated resorts (IR) open in 2010.<br><br>One of the resorts, Marina Bay Sands, is having difficulty in finding enough dealers. It has only managed to fill less than half the 4,500 positions needed to man the gaming tables.<br><br>Ken Davie, senior vice president of casino operations at Marina Bay Sands, said: "In Macau for example, or the United States, if you say dealer or croupier, everybody knows what that means.<br><br>"Initially when we had the first job fair, we felt that we had the numbers we need, then realised that many of those were duplicates. And as we looked into the numbers we realised that more than likely the Singaporean group we were going after may not exactly understand what a dealing job entails."<br><br>Marina Bay Sands' first recruitment drive in March saw about 8,000 applications for all positions.<br><br>Mr Davie said the resort has had better success recruiting non-gaming vacancies - in particular, marketing positions are the most popular.<br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The company said the starting pay for dealers is S$1,800 a month, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before tips</span>. They may move up to become pit managers, earning up to S$6,000 a month. Shift managers may earn up to S$11,000.</span></strong><br><br><strong>Since March, 1,500 dealers and dealer inspectors have been recruited, but the casino needs another 1,000 more.</strong> It hopes its job fair at Suntec City this weekend will help boost numbers.<br><br>However, with a second casino opening on Sentosa island, the pool of eligible candidates is set to shrink.<br><br>"You have to remember also there are two IRs. So the dealing pool may be split between both of them," said Davie. "So I may say we have 1,500 people, but it may not be that amount when we finish up. They could be applying for both, they could have Letters of Intent from both, and we can't prevent them from doing that."<br><br>Marina Bay Sands said it is focusing its recruitment drive on Singaporeans, but what if targets cannot be met?<br><br>"We haven't crossed that bridge yet," said Mr Davie, adding that experienced senior gaming staff will be brought in from its other casinos in the initial period.<br><br><strong>An applicant for the position of a dealer need to be over 21 years old, know basic mathematics and pass a colour-blind test.<br></strong><br><strong>Prior experience is not needed as successful applicants will go through an intensive three-month training course at Mountbatten Square, fully paid for by the casino.</strong> Training will start in the fourth quarter of this year.<br><br>Those who complete the course will receive a Workforce Skills Qualifications Certificate in Casino Gaming.<br><br><br>- CNA/yb</span></p>

              <p>freaking long years spent chasing a worthless piece of paper that places emphasis on grades rather than skill sets...An education system that calls itself world class by judging people on the number of high grades .then go out to work earn  a meager salary each month. 6 years pri, 4 years sec, 3 years poly. The world class education system in Singapore is only worth $1200 per month?</p>
              <p>And we have NS and foreigners who come in to pawn us all with their free loading PR and degrees from 3rd world countries</p>
