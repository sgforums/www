            <div class='col-md body'>I had completed a small web project for 20 USD about a week ago for a client who turned out to be a bas<strong></strong>tard in disguise. He paid through PayPal and a few days later, a temporary hold on the transaction was imposed. PayPal requested for more information regarding it, but a few form fields were regarding the buyer's shipping process and the proof of it. I was like, wtf? It's a digital goods, specfically a web script. What address do you want? Universe, Milky Way, Earth? I even gave them his Skype username which is the only contact info I have of him, plus the URL where he posted his project.<br><br>Then just today, PayPal came back with an e-mail saying "Our investigation is now complete and we have returned the funds to the PayPal account holder." I thought the "account holder" refers to me. The sigh of relief was for nothing. I went to look around PayPal for more info and they don't provide any way for users to appeal against a reversal. Instead, they showed me this message on the Transaction Details page, "For your protection, this payment has been reversed and the transaction cancelled. Our investigation is complete, thank you for your cooperation." More like for the protection of your Scammers' Alliance, Sh<strong></strong>itPal. What kind of message is this? Luo jing xia shi ah? Knnccb.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Then about that as<strong></strong>shole. On both occasions, after the imposition of the funds and the reversal, he was offline on Skype. I hope that as<strong></strong>shole gets robbed and g<strong></strong>ay-raped when he goes out for celebration in this upcoming New Year's Day.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br></div>

This kind of unfortunate incident is fairly common when dealing with usa customers.  Paypal is biased towards their own country people with regards to "grey" areas.  With regards to switching provider, just keep in mind that most people use paypal.  If you insist they use something else, you might lose some business.<br><br></div>
