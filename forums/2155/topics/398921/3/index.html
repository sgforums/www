              <p>Okay, I'm just going to say this once:</p>
              <p>If I had really wanted to be evil, I'd have apathetically just let the thread go on. Then lots of people will come in to flame you. And should that girl you so unfairly slimed find out about what you've been doing behind her back, she can take drastic action against you if need be.</p>
              <p>Think about it - would you like it if someone talked about you in that way on the public domain? Don't tell me that you would like it.</p>
              <p>I would have allowed you to bear the full consequences of your actions. Instead I gave you the benefit of the doubt that you're just too young to fully comprehend the consequences. Being a moderator of Whinehouse means that I have the responsibility to actually <em>moderate</em> and step in where I see fit for the benefit of all. You can shoot your mouth off, but I have the right to stop you from doing so should you do it within my domain.</p>
              <p>If you want to shoot your mouth off, by all means create your own subforum where you do not have to submit to anyone else but yourself. If you do it where someone else in in charge, that person has the right to stop you.</p>
