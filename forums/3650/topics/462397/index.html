              <p><strong>Coolness</strong> is an admired <a class="mw-redirect" title="Aesthetic" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetic">aesthetic</a> of attitude, behavior, comportment, appearance and style, influenced by and a product of the <a title="Zeitgeist" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeist">Zeitgeist</a>.
               Because of the varied and changing connotations of cool, as well its 
              subjective nature, the word has no single meaning. It has associations 
              of composure and self-control (cf. the <a title="Oxford English Dictionary" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary">OED</a> definition) and often is used as an expression of admiration or approval. Although commonly regarded as <a title="Slang" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slang">slang</a>, it is widely used among disparate social groups, and has endured in usage for generations.</p>
              <p>There is no single concept of cool. One of the essential 
              characteristics of cool is its mutability—what is considered cool 
              changes over time and varies among cultures and generations.<sup id="cite_ref-Pountain_1-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-Pountain-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Nick Southgate writes that, although some notions of cool can be traced back to <a title="Aristotle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, whose notion of cool is to be found in his ethical writings, most particularly the <em><a title="Nicomachean Ethics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomachean_Ethics">Nicomachean Ethics</a></em>,<sup id="cite_ref-coolhunt_2-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-coolhunt-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> it is not confined to one particular ethnic group or gender.</p>
              <p>Although there is no single concept of cool, its definitions fall into a few broad categories.</p>
              <h3><span id="Cool_as_a_behavioral_characteristic" class="mw-headline">Cool as a behavioral characteristic</span></h3>
              <p>The sum and substance of cool is a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Self-conscious" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-conscious">self-conscious</a> aplomb in overall behavior, which entails a set of specific <a title="Behavior" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior">behavioral</a> characteristics that is firmly anchored in <a class="mw-redirect" title="Symbology" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbology">symbology</a>, a set of discernible <a title="Body language" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_language">bodily movements</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Human position" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_position">postures</a>, <a title="Facial expression" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_expression">facial expressions</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Voice" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice">voice</a> modulations that are acquired and take on strategic social value within the peer context.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Cool was once an attitude fostered by rebels and underdogs, such as 
              slaves, prisoners, bikers and political dissidents, etc., for whom open 
              rebellion invited punishment, so it hid defiance behind a wall of ironic
               detachment, distancing itself from the source of authority rather than 
              directly confronting it.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <h3><span id="Cool_as_a_state_of_being" class="mw-headline">Cool as a state of being</span></h3>
              <p>Cool has been used to describe a general state of well-being, a transcendent, internal peace and serenity.<sup id="cite_ref-Aesthetic_5-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-Aesthetic-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> It can also refer to an absence of conflict, a state of harmony and 
              balance as in, "The land is cool," or as in a "cool [spiritual] heart." 
              Such meanings, according to Thompson, are African in origin. Cool is 
              related in this sense to both social control and transcendental balance.<sup id="cite_ref-Aesthetic_5-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-Aesthetic-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Cool can similarly be used to describe composure and absence of 
              excitement in a person—especially in times of stress—as expressed in the
               <a title="Idiom" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiom">idiom</a> <em>to keep your cool</em>.</p>
              <p>In a related way, the word can be used to express agreement or assent, as in the phrase <em>"I'm cool with that".</em></p>
              <h3><span id="Cool_as_aesthetic_appeal" class="mw-headline">Cool as aesthetic appeal</span></h3>
              <p>Cool is also an attitude widely adopted by artists and intellectuals, who thereby aided its infiltration into <a title="Popular culture" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture">popular culture</a>.
               Sought by product marketing firms, idealized by teenagers, a shield 
              against racial oppression or political persecution and source of 
              constant cultural innovation, cool has become a global phenomenon that 
              has spread to every corner of the earth.<sup id="cite_ref-coolhunt_2-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-coolhunt-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> According to Dick Pountain and David Robins, concepts of cool have existed for centuries in several cultures.<sup id="cite_ref-Pountain_1-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-Pountain-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <h3><span id="Cool_as_an_epithet" class="mw-headline">Cool as an epithet</span></h3>
              <p>While <a title="Slang" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slang">slang</a> terms are usually short-lived coinages and figures of speech, <em>cool</em> is an especially ubiquitous slang word, most notably among young 
              people. As well as being understood throughout the English-speaking 
              world, the word has even entered the vocabulary of several languages 
              other than English.</p>
              <p>In this sense, cool is used as a general positive <a title="Epithet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithet">epithet</a> or interjection, which can have a range of related adjectival <a class="mw-redirect" title="Meaning (linguistic)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_%28linguistic%29">meanings</a>.</p>
              <h3><span id="Cool_as_social_distinction" class="mw-headline">Cool as social distinction</span></h3>
              <p>According to this theory, <em>cool</em> is a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Zero sum" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_sum">zero sum</a> game, in which <em>cool</em> exists only in comparison with things considered less <em>cool</em>; for example, in the book <em><a title="The Rebel Sell" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rebel_Sell">The Rebel Sell</a></em>, <em>cool</em> is created out of a need for status and distinction. This creates a situation analogous to an <a title="Arms race" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_race">arms race</a>, in which <em>cool</em> is perpetuated by a <a title="Collective action" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action">collective action</a> problem in society.<sup id="cite_ref-rebel_40-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-rebel-40"><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <h3><span id="Cool_as_an_elusive_essence" class="mw-headline">Cool as an elusive essence</span></h3>
              <p>According to this theory, cool is a real, but unknowable property. <em>Cool</em>, like "Good", is a property that exists, but can only be sought after. In the <em><a title="The New Yorker" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker">New Yorker</a></em> article, "The Coolhunt",<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-41"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup> cool is given three characteristics:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>"The act of discovering what's cool is what causes cool to move on"</li>
              <li>"Cool cannot be manufactured, only observed"</li>
              <li>"[Cool] can only be observed by those who are themselves cool".</li>
              </ul>
              <h3><span id="Cool_as_a_marketing_device" class="mw-headline">Cool as a marketing device</span></h3>
              <p>According to this theory, <em>cool</em> can be exploited as a manufactured and empty idea imposed on the culture at large through a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Top-down" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down">top-down</a> process by the "Merchants of Cool".<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-43"><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup> An artificial cycle of "cooling" and "uncooling" creates false needs in
               consumers, and stimulates the economy. "Cool has become the central 
              ideology of consumer capitalism".<sup id="cite_ref-rebel_40-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-rebel-40"><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup> Supporters of this theory avoid the pursuit of cool.</p>
              <p>The concept of cool was used in this way to market <a title="Menthol cigarette" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menthol_cigarette">menthol cigarettes</a> to African Americans in the 1960s. In 2004 over 70% of African American
               smokers preferred menthol cigarettes, compared with 30% of white 
              smokers. This unique social phenomenon was principally occasioned by the
               tobacco industry's manipulation of the burgeoning black, urban, 
              segregated, consumer market in cities at that time.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-44"><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup> According to <a title="Fast Company (magazine)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Company_%28magazine%29">Fast Company</a> some large companies have started '<a title="Outsourcing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing">outsourcing</a> cool.'

              <p>Although Thompson acknowledges similarities between African and European <em>cool</em> in shared notions of self-control and imperturbability,<sup id="cite_ref-art_8-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-art-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> he finds the cultural value of cool in Africa which influenced the <a title="African diaspora" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_diaspora">African diaspora</a> to be different from that held by Europeans, who use the term primarily
               as the ability to remain calm under stress. According to Thompson, 
              there is significant weight, meaning and spirituality attached to cool 
              in traditional African cultures, something which, Thompson argues, is 
              absent from the idea in a Western context.</p>
              <p>"Control, stability, and composure under the African rubric of the 
              cool seem to constitute elements of an all-embracing aesthetic 
              attitude." African cool, writes Thompson, is "more complicated and more 
              variously expressed than Western notions of <em>sang-froid</em> (literally, "cold blood"), cooling off, or even icy determination." (Thompson, <em>African Arts</em>)</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The telling point is that the "mask" of coolness is worn not only in 
              time of stress, but also of pleasure, in fields of expressive 
              performance and the dance. Struck by the re-occurrence of this vital 
              notion elsewhere in tropical Africa and in the Black Americas, I have 
              come to term the attitude "an aesthetic of the cool" in the sense of a 
              deeply and completely motivated, consciously artistic, interweaving of 
              elements serious and pleasurable, of responsibility and play.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

              frank amorality and love or illicit pleasures behind closed doors;<sup id="cite_ref-Pountain_1-3" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-Pountain-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Raphael's "Portrait of <a title="Baldassare Castiglione" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldassare_Castiglione">Baldassare Castiglione</a>" and Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" are classic examples of <em>sprezzatura</em>.<sup id="cite_ref-high_32-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-high-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> The <em>sprezzatura</em> of the Mona Lisa is seen in both her smile and the positioning of her 
              hands. Both the smile and hands are intended to convey her grandeur, 
              self-confidence and societal position.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> Sprezzatura means, literally, disdain and detachment. It is the art of 
              refraining from the appearance of trying to present oneself in a 
              particular way. In reality, of course, tremendous exertion went into 
              pretending not to bother or care.</p>
              <p>English poet and playwright <a title="William Shakespeare" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> used cool in several of his works to describe composure and absence of emotion.<sup id="cite_ref-Pountain_1-4" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-Pountain-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> In <em><a title="A Midsummer Night's Dream" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Midsummer_Night%27s_Dream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a></em>, written sometime in the late-16th century, he contrasts the shaping fantasies of lovers and madmen with "cool reason,"<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-34"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup> in <em><a title="Hamlet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet">Hamlet</a></em> he wrote "O gentle son, upon the heat and flame of thy distemper, sprinkle cool patience,"<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-35"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup> and the antagonist Iago in <em><a title="Othello" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello">Othello</a></em> is musing about "reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts."<sup id="cite_ref-Pountain_1-5" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-Pountain-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-36"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The cool "Anatolian smile" of <a title="Turkey" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey">Turkey</a> is used to mask emotions. A similar "mask" of coolness is worn in both 
              times of stress and pleasure in American and African communities.<sup id="cite_ref-Pountain_1-6" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-Pountain-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <h4><span id="European_inter-war_cool" class="mw-headline">European inter-war cool</span></h4>
              <p>The key themes of modern European cool were forged by avant-garde 
              artists who achieved prominence in the aftermath of the First World War,
               most notably <a title="Dada" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada">Dadaists</a>, such as key Dada figures <a title="Arthur Cravan" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Cravan">Arthur Cravan</a> and <a title="Marcel Duchamp" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Duchamp">Marcel Duchamp</a>, and the left-wing milieu of the <a title="Weimar Republic" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic">Weimar Republic</a>.
               The program of such groups was often self-consciously revolutionary, a 
              determination to scandalize the bourgeoisie by mocking their culture, 
              sexuality and political moderation.<sup id="cite_ref-Pountain_1-7" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-Pountain-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p><a class="mw-redirect" title="Berthold Brecht" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berthold_Brecht">Berthold Brecht</a>,
               both a committed Communist and a philandering cynic, stands as the 
              archetype of this inter-war cool. Brecht projected his cool attitude to 
              life onto his most famous character Macheath or "Mackie Messer" (Mack 
              the knife), in <a title="The Threepenny Opera" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Threepenny_Opera">The Threepenny Opera</a>.
               Mackie, the nonchalant, smooth-talking gangster, expert with the 
              switchblade, personifies the bitter-sweet strain of cool; Puritanism and
               sentimentality are both anathema to the cool character.<sup id="cite_ref-Pountain_1-8" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-Pountain-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>During the turbulent inter-war years, cool was a privilege reserved 
              for bohemian milieus like Brecht's. Cool irony and hedonism remained the
               province of cabaret artistes, ostentatious gangsters and rich 
              socialites, those decadents depicted in <a title="Evelyn Waugh" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a>'s <a title="Brideshead Revisited" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brideshead_Revisited">Brideshead Revisited</a> and <a title="Christopher Isherwood" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Isherwood">Christopher Isherwood</a>'s <a title="Goodbye to Berlin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodbye_to_Berlin">Goodbye to Berlin</a>, tracing the outlines of a new cool. <a title="Peter Stearns" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Stearns">Peter Stearns</a>, professor of history at <a title="George Mason University" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mason_University">George Mason University</a>, suggests that in effect the seeds of a cool outlook had been sown among this inter-war generation.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-37"><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <h4><span id="Postwar_cool" class="mw-headline">Postwar cool</span></h4>
              <p>The Second World War brought the populations of Britain, Germany and 
              France into intimate contact with Americans and American culture. The 
              war brought hundreds of thousands of GIs whose relaxed, easy-going 
              manner was seen by young people of the time as the very embodiment of 
              liberation; and with them came Lucky Strikes, nylons, swing and jazz—the
               American Cool.</p>
              <p>To be cool or hip meant hanging out, pursuing sexual liaisons, 
              displaying the appropriate attitude of narcissistic self-absorption, and
               expressing a desire to escape the mental straitjacket of all 
              ideological causes. From the late 1940s onward, this popular culture 
              influenced young people all over the world, to the great dismay of the 
              paternalistic elites who still ruled the official culture. The French 
              intelligentsia were outraged, while the British educated classes 
              displayed a haughty indifference that smacked of an older aristocratic 
              cool.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-38"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <h4><span id="The_Polish_cool" class="mw-headline">The Polish cool</span></h4>
              <p>The new attitude found a special resonance behind the Iron Curtain, 
              where it offered relief from the earnestness of socialist propaganda and
               socialist realism in art. In the Polish industrial city <a title="Å�ódÅº" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA">Å�ódÅº</a>,
               jazz, "the forbidden music", served Polish youth of the 1950s much as 
              it had served its African-American creators, both as personal diversion 
              and subterranean resistance to what they saw as a stultifying official 
              culture. Some clubs featured live jazz performances, and their smoky, 
              sexually charged atmosphere carried a message for which the puritanical 
              values and monumental art of Marxist officialdom were an ideal foil.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-39"><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Arriving in Poland via France, America and England, Polish cool 
              stimulated the film talents of a generation of artists, including <a title="Andrzej Wajda" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Wajda">Andrzej Wajda</a>, <a title="Roman Polanski" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski">Roman Polanski</a>, and other graduates of the <a title="National Film School in Å�ódÅº" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Film_School_in_%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA">National Film School in Å�ódÅº</a>, as well as the novelist <a title="Jerzy Kosinski" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerzy_Kosinski">Jerzy Kosinski</a>, in whose clinical prose cool tends towards the sadistic.<sup id="cite_ref-Pountain_1-9" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-Pountain-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In <a title="Prague" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague">Prague</a>, the capital of Bohemia, cool flourished in the faded <a title="Art Deco" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Deco">Art Deco</a> splendor of the <a class="new" title="Cafe Slavia (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cafe_Slavia&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Cafe Slavia</a>. Significantly, following the crushing of the <a title="Prague Spring" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Spring">Prague Spring</a> by Soviet tanks in 1968, part of the dissident underground called itself the "Jazz Section".<sup id="cite_ref-Pountain_1-10" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29#cite_note-Pountain-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
