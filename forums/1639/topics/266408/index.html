My proposal will not be focusing on Creativity and Innovation. Character building and development will be part of the plan. To be precise, it's academic-based.<br><br>I find that promoting creativity doesn't not plays a huge role in learning. You see there is only a certain level of creativity there and most people with 'creative and innovative genes' are art students.<br><br>I will be creating a Huge Institution with serveral subsidaries.

What i am trying to say is that your way of separating those students who are in and not in the school. Not about those in the school. First are those who jumped the o lvl to the a lvl, then is this route u suggested. Do you have any idea how inferior the 35 percentile will feel? MOE started the new PSLE system of separating the subjects into different levels, this is to let each students to have equal opportunities. Yours suggestion is like the opposite.<br><br>Some are late bloomers, you can't expect them to be choosing their interest so young. Parents are already complaining about the PSLE system who determines the top sec sch their child will be able to be admitted and later the type of qualification they getting in future.<br><br>Your mentality is to fast forward the whole education process. You can't purely just use your own assumption and start this type route. Who will be the ones suffering in this system?</div>

Creactivity is of no use unless you're working for an art-oriented company.<br><br>If you want a good job with high salary, you need good paper qualification. With today's rising cost of living in Singapore, you need at least a Degree to survive after paying all the bills  that stacked up as high as Mount Everest.<br><br>My goal is to let students obtain their O Level Certificate at the shortest possible time without diluting the quality of the student. And to let students to have more time to progress and make decision later in their life. Afew years earlier may be a huge difference.<br><br>And I strongly believed that artistic talent and creativity are "tian sheng". Although many people say artistic talent can be cultivated, but I still feel that it's difficult to cultivate. Take I myself for example, from Sec 1 till Sec 2, I have art lesson as a compulsory for a lower sec student. After taking art for 2 years, I neither find no improvement in my 'artistic skills' nor my 'creativity/innovative'. Some people maybe better linguistically, some are mathematically-logically inclined, while some are both.<br><br>I myself personally have watch the documentary show "In The Womb" from National Geographic Channel Series quite a few times. Right-handed or Left-handed is pre-determined when you're a fetus in the womb. And many research have been carry out to show the connection between creativity and types of hander.<br><br>But for knowledge, I feel that it's universal. Everyone can learnt, BUT at different rates. Some may learn very fast, while some may have a slower understanding.<br><br>That's why I strongly believe in Exam-based structures and format. This is the only way to determine the ability to develop critical thinking and analyzing  skills fairly.<br><br></div>
