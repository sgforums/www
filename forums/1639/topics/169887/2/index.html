            <div class='col-md body'>Quit only during the end of the year of beginning of the year. From what I understand of the LEAPS system, attendance is taken into consideration under Participation category.<br><br>So lets say for example, you are currently in NCC. You wanna join, lets say, IT Club. The attendance will be counted every school term and if your attendance is 100%, it'll be stated in your report that Term 1: 100%, Term 2: 100%. The problem with switching in the middle of the year is if you switch to IT Club in june, your attendance for NCC will still be counted for term 3 and 4, which is both 0%. Similarly, Your attendance for IT Club also includes term 1 and 2, which is also both 0%. Its really not worth it to waste those CCA points for attendance.<br><br>Approach your CCA teacher and ask to quit. My teacher said a CCA is what you join based on your interest or if you want to learn new skills. People who have selected a CCA that suits them will eventually feel that the CCA is like a second family. Just quit. Ignore all your seniors, even if they taunt you or anything, cos you'll live a miserable school life if you join a CCA you have no interest in.<br><br>Good Luck <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
