            <div class='col-md body'>In certain secondary schools, the teacher in charge of CCAs just anyhow put you into a CCA eg. NCC, which cannot be quitted according to MOE, and then they tell you to try out for half a year and see if it is really unsuitable for you.<br><br>However, after half a year, when u find that it is really unsuitable for you and u cannot take the trainings, when u tell them u want to quit, they will show you what MOE says about LEAPs points...if u quit then you cannot go to JC.<br><br>Thus, they make u stay in that CCA.<br><br>However, there is another reason why they dun allow u to quit. For example in NCC, when u quit, it is said that points will be cut off from your school and it thus may affect whether your school gets Gold, Silver or Bronze award.<br><br>I heard that some people from other schools successfully quitted NCC, but why are there still some schools which dun allow students to change their CCAs freely?<br><br>Well, i am trying to quit NCC, and i spoke to both the CCA teacher and the NCC teacher in charge in my school already. But both disagree. They ask me go see doctor and get a MC saying that i am too fat and unfit for trainings, but then would doctors give MCs easily? I may be fat, but i really cannot do pumping, and i really dun wan to stay in NCC anymore.<br><br>Can anyone suggest me a good way to quit? Thx.</div>
