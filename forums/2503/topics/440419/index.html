              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>BANGKOK - Thailand's
               premier on Wednesday warned a confused and on-edge Bangkok that 
              incoming floods could last for four weeks, as panic buying peaked and 
              rising waters shut down the city's second airport.<br><br>Prime Minister
               Yingluck Shinawatra told reporters that the capital's flood barriers 
              might not be able to hold back a mass of run-off water from the north as
               the country continued to grapple with its worst flooding in decades.<br><br>"But
               I'm fifty percent confident that the inner zone of Bangkok will not be 
              completely flooded," she said, apparently toning down her comments from 
              the previous evening when she said central Bangkok flooding was "highly 
              likely".<br><br>The crisis has been plagued by contradictory information
               from national and local authorities, further confusing the city's 12 
              million residents who have been bracing for the onslaught of water for 
              days now.<br><br>A high tide this weekend is expected to surge up 
              Bangkok's already swollen Chao Phraya river, and Yingluck said a 
              "worst-case scenario" would see parts of low-lying Bangkok submerged in 
              "more than one metre" (3 feet) of water.<br><br>"Initially, the floods in Bangkok will last for two weeks to one month," she added.<br><br>Many supermarkets were running low on essential items such as bottled water and eggs as panic-buying reached fever-pitch.<br><br>"The most critical shortage is drinking water," Yingluck said, advising people to drink boiled tap water.<br><br>On
               Tuesday, the government ordered a five-day holiday from October 27-31 
              for 21 provinces, including Bangkok, allowing the city's residents to 
              prepare for the inundation or leave the capital.<br><br>Schools and 
              government offices will be closed and the government has urged public 
              and private companies to allow their staff the time off, but the central
               bank said financial markets would not shut down and banks would stay 
              open.<br><br>The city's main air hub, Suvarnabhumi, is operating as 
              normal but domestic Don Mueang airport, in the north of the capital, 
              suspended flights until November 1 after waters started seeping onto the
               runways on Tuesday.<br><br>About 4,000 flood evacuees who had found refuge at a disused terminal on the compound were being moved to other shelters.<br><br>Despite
               the rising waters, Yingluck said the government would not to move its 
              flood relief centre, which is located on the second floor of one of the 
              airport buildings.<br><br>More than 370 people have been killed in the 
              three-month-old flood crisis caused by unusually heavy monsoon rains, 
              damaging the homes of millions of people and forcing tens of thousands 
              into evacuation centres.<br><br>The government said it has set up 
              special mental health units across the country and dispatched teams of 
              psychiatrists and psychologists to help almost 100,000 people thought to
               be suffering from flood-related stress.<br><br>- AFP /ls</span></span></p>

              <p>A tale of "two Bangkoks" amid the floods</p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>BANGKOK : Flood barriers defending Bangkok's city centre shielded the capital from critical high tides over the weekend.<br><br>While many areas remain submerged in water, the centre remains dry, and life goes on normally for residents there.<br><br>Water logged streets and children wading in filthy pools can be seen in large parts of Bangkok.<br> <br>Flooding has submerged the capital's Northern and Western districts and displaced over 100,000 Thais.<br> <br>That is just one side of the city.<br> <br>Most of central Bangkok is still dry as the city's defences have held up against floodwaters so far.<br> <br>Though
               fewer in number, Thais and tourists still visit the famous Erawan 
              shrine and nearby temples. And in the city's landmark malls like Siam 
              Paragon, it is shopping as usual.<br> <br>David Fryer, an Australian 
              tourist, said: "We have had no trouble at all, no water where we are 
              staying. And in fact in Australia, we have had floods as well, much 
              worse than here."<br> <br>At the Grand Palace, water levels are receding. <br> <br>Some cafes and restaurants are still open for business and apart from thinner crowds, life looks normal in many parts.<br> <br>But many businesses there are still suffering.<br> <br>Nongkaluck
               Arthitruangnarong, a clothes vendor, said: "Now the area is dry but 
              tourists are still scared and they have disappeared. I really hope 
              visitors will return."<br> <br>Everywhere, office buildings and malls are fortified by sandbag embankments - reminders that the worst may not yet be over.<br> <br>The government has said floodwaters could subside as early as next week, but many Thais are doubtful.<br> <br>Those who have left the city aren't returning just yet.<br> <br>And Bangkok's congested roads are now quiet. <br> <br>Sirada
               Chuayklao, a Bangkok resident, said: "I no longer believe what the 
              government says. I think otherwise. I live in Lad Prao where the 
              government said it will not flood but now water has overflowed the 
              canal. People there live in fear."<br> <br>It is almost a tale of "two 
              Bangkoks" - one half devastated by the worst flooding in half a century,
               and the other strangely normal.<br> <br>Most are hoping the latter will prevail.<br><br>- CNA/ms</span></span></p>

              <p>Personally, I also believe that moving is a bad move... mainly
              becoz it will show that the government are more concern to save
              themselves than instead of going thru thick-and-thin with the
              citizen...</p>
