            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Bangkok Wholesale Markets</strong><br><br><strong>Bo-bae Market</strong><br><br>Located just a ten-minute tuk-tuk ride (about 50 baht) from Chinatown, the Bo-Bae Towers and Market is most easily reached en-route to Sampeng Lane via the National Monument BTS station (five minutes and about 40 baht by tuk-tuk), or on your way to the National Stadium BTS station coming from Chinatown. The Towers is a large, five-storey wholesale clothing and garment complex, consisting of Bo-Bae Towers 1 and 2. On the fifth floor of tower two is the Food Center, a cafeteria where many types of affordable Thai food can be enjoyed. Most garments at the complex are cheap and the type you'd find at small local markets scattered throughout Thailand. Still, there are great deals to be had.<br><br>Walking across Krung Kasem Road, which runs along the front side of the city block where the complex is located, and then crossing over one of the many bridges is the actual Boe-bae Market - selling much the same thing, although in a nicer atmosphere. The market consists of four to five city blocks which are surrounded by canals and linked by bridges. Old and weathered yet charming shophouses provide an interesting walk through the markets narrow alleyways. Some shops here close around 16:00 although many are known to stay open until 01:00 or 02:00, depending on business transactions.<br><br>How to get there: Take a tuk-tuk or taxi from BTS National Stadium station to the market.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Baiyoke &amp; Pratunam Market</strong><br><br>The bargaining block where Pratunam's indoor transactions take place is consisted of three major shopping centers: the Bai Yoke Garment complex 1 &amp; 2, which has wholesale deals on garments; Indra Square, has fashion clothing and accessories for men and women, along with silk items, jewellery, and touristy Thai crafts; and the City Complex, which also offers fashionable clothing marketed towards young ladies, plus a few shops selling jewellery and crafts. Also in the Pratunam area are several top-notch hotels to make your shopping experience more convenient.<br><br>Outside and between the complexes vendors and small shops sell shoes, t-shirts, 'brand-name' items, CD's, and various knick-knacks. Food vendors push their way through the large crowd to hawk the usual fruit and scewered foods; if you're hungry and need a rest, there's a food center on the second floor of Indra Square. This area can become quite hectic with pushy pedestrains, so come with a patient attitude and, if possible, well-rested. This is also a wise investment, as a smile will usually knock off at least 10 to 20 baht from the asking price.<br><br>How to get there: From BTS Siam station, take the Skytrain one stop towards Mo Chit to Ratchathewi station. From there, exit down the right-hand stairs, take a right at the next main intersection and walk down Phetchaburi until you see Platinum department store; the market is directly across from Platinum Fashion Mall (total ten to twelve minute walk).

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Chatuchak Weekend Market in Bangkok</strong><br><br>Covering 70 rai (35 acres) of land with over 15,000 stalls and more than 200,000 visitors every Saturday and Sunday, Chatuchak Weekend Market in Bangkok is the mother of all markets - and possibly one of the biggest and most famous markets in the world. If bargain-hunting gives you an adrenalin rush, get ready for a head-spinning, earth-moving experience. Conquering this massive market is no easy feat though. The reward for taking a lot of patience along - together with a bottle of water - is that you can find pretty much anything here.<br><br>There are two ways to approach your shopping excursion. Firstly, to get a free map from one of the information kiosks and (try to) plan your adventure through the never-ending maze of crowded, narrow alleys that are, surprisingly, numbered. But, it's so big that even with a map you might find yourself going around in circles. Areas are also demarcated in colour zones with clothing and fashion items grouped together, a section for household goods, crafts, pets, art and collectables, plants, wholesale items, food, and everything in between. Through the years vendors haven't always abided to the colour-coding, resulting in what could be called 'organised chaos'. The second way is to just follow your instincts and leave it all up to karma. Either way, it's virtually impossible to see it all in one day - and even more unlikely that you won't find something to get excited about.<br><br>If you are able to keep track of where you're going and can cover a big part of the market, you'll be amazed with the sheer variety of merchandise. From roosters and chopsticks to vinyl records and a pair of Levi hipsters that you haven't seen in shops for years. You can buy a python, beautiful orchids, garden furniture, and camo wear. Or beads, fake antiques, the latest CafÃ© del Mar CD...  The earlier you get there, the better too. Not only to make sure you have enough time to cover it all, but also to get a head-start before it gets too crowdy and hot.<br><br>Chatuchak Weekend Market is the perfect place for bargain shopping and to put your bartering skills to the test. A friendly attitude and big smile are your biggest allies to secure the best possible deal. There are a few ATM's scattered about, but they are not always easy to find. So take along enough cash, as not many vendors or stall owners accept credit cards. A fascinating aspect of the market is that many emerging Thai artists, craftsmen and business people have started their successful careers with a stall at Chatuchak. Keep your eyes peeled for lots of raw talent, innovation and craftsmanship. And then there are some very interesting vendors who have been selling their merchandise at the market for decades, and it's clear that they love what they do.<br><br>As is customary anywhere in Thailand, you can find plenty to eat and drink all over the market. Check out some of the unusual delicacies too, like grubs, frogs and scorpions, mostly deep-fried and spiced heavily. It's very easy to get your hands on an ice-cold beer too, which is often the best way to quench a thirst in extreme heat and humidity. As long as you make sure to drink lots of liquids to avoid dehydration - and wear light clothing! Chatuchak is also like any other big market in the world; crowdy and busy. So watch out for pickpockets and keep your personal belongings safe.<br><br>How to get there: Take the skytrain (BTS) to Mo Chit station and exit down the right-hand stairs, follow the crowd for a five-minute walk, and you're there. Another option is to take the subway (MRT) to Chatuchak Park station, and follow the<br>signage directives. For the plant and flower section, get off at Kampheng Phet MRT station (exit 3).<br>Items at market: Clothing, jewellery, handicrafts, antiques, ceramics, pets, vintage magazines / stamps / coins, collector's items, knick-knacks and just about anything and everything else one could want from a Thai market, or any market. And then some!<br>Hours: 08:00 - 18:00 on weekends and Fridays (wholesale day). Plant shops are open Wednesdays and Thursdays too from 07:00 - 18:00.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Suan Lum Night Bazaar</strong><br><br>A mixture of poshly dressed, fresh-from-the-office Thai's and expats along with fisherman pant-clad tourists, Suan Lum could best be described as the VIP outdoor market of Bangkok (where you're always welcome, of course). Covered walkways with centrally-located snack bars provide perhaps the most luxurious (outdoor) market shopping experience in the city. Several bars along with Thai, Italian, German, and even Mexican restaurants are conveniently within the market area, close enough to analyze the crowd while enjoying a drink, yet away from the market's hustle-and-bustle. In the same area, dinner shows featuring classical Thai puppetry can be enjoyed at the famous Joe Louis Puppet Theatre.<br><br>On the other side of the market's curious Khmer-looking temple walkway, lies a large outdoor beer garden, food court, and concert venue all rolled into one. Here one can indulge in an assortment of inernational and Thai beers and foods, with international fare either Japanese (yakitori and Asahi) or German (sausage, Paulaner, etc).

Suan Lum Night Bazaar, one of the favorite night-time shopping areas in Bangkok, is closing down to make way for a yet-to-be-announced new commercial development. Vendors at Suan Lum have been given notice to vacate the premises by the end of April 2007 if they want to avoid legal action. Owned by the Crown Property Bureau, the land is set to be used for a new development that will consist of office buildings, a retail and entertainment complex, as well as a residential development.  The bidding process is currently underway, and the winning bid is to be announced in April next year. No announcement has yet been made whether the popular night market will be relocated to a different venue. The future of BEC Tero Hall, which is used for shows and exhibitions, as well as Thailand's only permanent puppet show, the Joe Louis Puppet Theatre, is also in jeopardy. Meanwhile, it was announced that the popular Lumpini Boxing Stadium, which is on the same land, will be relocated to a new modern venue.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Traditional Thai Massage in Bangkok</strong><br><br><strong>Type of Massage<br><br>1)  Aromatherapy &amp; Oil Massage</strong><br><br>Though the standard technique varies little, there are a few sub-styles within the traditional Thai massage context. Some practices include the external application of water, lubricants, salt scrubs and other topical preparations and devices that mimic or improve the actions of hands. Essential oils are a common supplement to Thai massage, and incorporating aspects of aromatherapy in conjunction may provide further benefits.<br><br>Many establishments in Bangkok offer aromatherapy separately or as an addition intended to enhance another style of massage. An aromatherapy massage is a treatment involving oils that are naturally extracted from plants to balance, harmonize, and promote the health of body and mind. Distinct fragrances are thought to trigger memory and enhance an individual's responses to the aroma; perhaps calming, inducing relaxation, or restoring energy. The oils used in each session are usually determined with input from both the masseur and client, seeking to remedy specific needs.  Several oils are decided upon after a consultation and blended into a massage oil to be used during the treatment.<br><br><strong>2) Facial Massage</strong><br><br>Another variation to the Thai massage is a facial massage treatment. Just like any other form of massage, facial massage relieves tension, promotes relaxation and restores energy to the face and body by increasing circulation. During sleep, circulation is decreased in the body, meaning less blood flow to the face which results in puffiness and a drained complexion. Facial massage stimulates blood flow in facial tissue, restoring a healthy glow and maintaining a firm and smooth appearance.<br><br>Thai facial therapy uses gentle, circular strokes along differing regions of the head, face, and neck. Finger movement is always in an upward motion and, when performed regularly, keeps skin appearing tight and youthful. The forehead and nose are targeted to reduce the appearance of horizontal lines and the nostril area receives focused rubbing to unclog pores and reduce blemishes. Mouth and cheeks receive wider, sweeping strokes to prevent wrinkles and the sagging of facial muscles, while the chin and neck are targeted to promote muscle tone. The gestures aimed at the neck area are often performed in order to thwart the vile and loathsome double chin. With gentle fingers gliding over closed eyes, Thai facial massage makes relaxation virtually inevitable and couples the experience with improvements in skin texture and appearance.<br><br><strong>3) Foot Massage</strong><br><br>Nearly as common as the body massage, Thai foot massage options appear almost everywhere the former is available. Though the title implies only feet are tended to, in actuality legs, lower thighs, hands and forearms also receive attention during a traditional Thai foot massage. After cleansing, the feet are anointed with a skin lotion or oil and reflex points are stimulated with fingers and occasionally a small wooden stick. Force is applied tenderly and precisely to specific nerve endings at the bottom of the feet. Each part of the foot is reputably linked to another, often distant part of the body, with influence extending to vital organs as well as muscles. Pressing at the base of the second toe is thought to rouse the nerve controlling the lungs and bronchial system, while drawing a knuckle along the instep eases pain in the spine and promotes better posture. Thai foot massage ensures that feet and legs are lavished with the consideration and attentiveness they deserve. They are the pillars of the human body, after all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Where to go for a Thai Massage</strong><br><br>Spas and salons offering traditional Thai massage are as common in Bangkok as fruit vendors and dance remixes of 'My Humps'. Finding a location is not difficult, though discovering a high quality place that suits your particular fancy sometimes requires a bit of guidance. Many of the city's fine hotels these days sport their own lavish in-house spas too, where you'd be able to enjoy a wide range of spa and massage treatments. Also have a look at the advertisers on this page who are offering some great specials.<br><br>Frequently perceived as indulgent and intended only for those accustomed to luxury, traditional Thai massage manages to disprove this preconception, performing bodywork in order to promote health.  A vast majority of individuals experience stress and tension on a regular basis, and what better way to escape pressure from everyday life than to take pleasure in one of Thailand's most illustrious forms of healing and rejuvenation?<br><br><strong>Wat Po Traditional Massage</strong><br><br>If you want to try the real thing, Wat Po (The Temple of the Reclining Buddha) offers Thai massage in its most traditional form, taken from the original inscriptions in stone commissioned by King Rama III, great-grandfather of the present king. If you are interested in learning the techniques, The Wat Pho Massage School offers a ten-day course too, for around 6,000 baht. Contact the school located in the temple compound. The easiest way to get to Wat Po is by boat. Take the Chao Phraya River Express to the Tha Thien pier, then walk through the market and up the short street. Wat Po is directly across the intersection, on your right. On the left is the rear wall of the Grand Palace.<br><br><strong>Open: 08:00 - 17:00 (massage available until 18:00).<br>Location: Maharat Road, about a half mile south of the Grand Palace</strong></div>
