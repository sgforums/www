It is up to the readers' discretion to interpret this writing.</span><br><br>For those who had never entered the world of MGS:2 Sons of Liberty (Spoilers Alert):<br>In , it was believed that the United States Government and its politics was engineered by a group called the Patriots. The president, the parliament and the elections were all ran by the Patriots. The elections in America is a farce, as the Republicans and the Democrats were all dominated by a dictatorship of twelve called the Patriots since WW2. The media was controlled, ran by the patriots to control lives of Americans. The Americans were deceived of their democracy.<br><br>Pegging back to the topic again, Singapore context.<br><br><strong>The situation.</strong><br><br>Singapore, a country with no natural resources and relies solely on its human resources, plays a symmetrical role to the America as portrayed by MGS:2. Media is controlled, information is controlled. And similarly expressed by the ending of MGS:2, the country's dictatorship wishes to control the Internet. The lack of transparency is apparent but allies of the country, democratic as they are, refuse to comment or interfere with its politics. Like how the metal gears were weapons against Communism, Singapore is their frontal line against Communism and Terrorism.<br><br>The Government thrives on its leadership and the country prospers on its special ties. Mapping, or logging as some would call it, will allow the country's dictatorship to weed out seeds of doubt. The trinity, ISPs regulated by the dominant party, isolates 'piracy'. It is actually mapping out political messages sent by the opposition which is dangerous to its special ties with its allies. They trace every highly debated political topics with the aid of foreign intelligence agencies as they monitor multiple foreign and local websites patronised by the majority of its citizens. They identify every possible loophole their competitors will exploit and play down the problems before the contest begins.<br><br>They infiltrate every level within opposition ranks as the special pact with its allies require them to do so. Every media is being regulated, every information has been monitored by foreign agencies. With the strong legislation within their control, any signs of danger is axed before the seeds could groom into flowers. Is there insufficient competition offered by foreign investors? The answer is no as competition from foreign agencies not regulated will not be allowed to grow here. License will not be issued out. There is more freedom offered by its neighbours than the country itself.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Truth or dare?</span></div>
