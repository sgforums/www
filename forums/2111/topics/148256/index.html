            <div class='col-md body'>Direct copy n paste<br>Source : http://forums.hardwarezone.com/showthread.php?t=1087695<br><br>1. Lee Kuan Yew has dozens of relatives occupying high public office, inconsistent with his claims of meritocratic government. He is the defacto ruler of Singapore, his son is the Prime Minister, his nephew in law Wong Kan Seng is the Deputy Prime Minister. There are children, siblings, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in law, former classmates of Lee Kuan Yew occupying high positions in the public sector, drawing big salaries from taxpayers money. Not even in commuist China is so much power concentrated in 1 clan.<br><br>2. Do you know what is happening with the national reserves, made up of hardearned savings and taxpayer money? Only LKY, his son, and his daughter in law knows what is going on there. The only thing we know is that industry insiders are astonished that Ho Ching, LKY's daughter in law, is still allowed to control the national reserves after a track record of loss-making outcomes. This is inconsistent with the practices of countries possessing of a similar national reserve, ie, Norway or Hongkong. The people of Singapore needs to know for themselves whether taxpayers money and CPF savings are still there.<br><br>3. The National Kidney Foundation fiasco is a result of a public body (ie, the NKF) being unaccountable to the general public whose money it is spending. Similar lack of transparency and accountability exists with most of the public linked bodies, from Temasek Holdings to the GIC. Can Singaporeans be sure that the NKF is the only, or even biggest can of worms around?<br><br>4. The President of Singapore is constitutionally empowered to make sure the finances have not been embezzled or abused has been barred from looking into the accounts. Ong Teng Chong asked to exercise his elected rights in looking into financial information privvy only to LKY, LSH and Ho Ching. He was denied, and was soon replaced as President of Singapore. After his death, OTC was refused a state funeral despite being the only ever elected President of Singapore. His replacement, President Nathan, is unelected and has a history of working with the Japanese during WW2.<br><br>5. Singapore's standard of living has declined dramatically from 4th highest in the world to outside the top 25 in the world, but PAP politicians still award themselves the 1st highest salaries in the world. Singaporeans make half the salary of the average Swiss, but PAP politicians make multiple times the salary of the average Swiss politician. Singapore is one of a very small handful of countries in the world to have undergone a decline in the standard of living over the last decade. According to the World Bank, in absolute terms, Singapore now has a standard of living much closer to Colombia than Switzerland.<br><br>6. Many in the core group of PAP and civil service pioneers responsible for Singapore's success in the first place (during the 1960s, 70s and 80s) think that the current PAP team has led the country down the wrong way. They include Ngiam Tong Dow, Singapore's youngest ever (and regarded by many as our most capable) permanent secretary, and Toh Chin Chye, the first and founding President of the PAP.<br><br>7. The PAP has an unparalleled track record for bankrupting and destroying opposition politicians such as Jeyaratnam and Francis Seow, who would have served as a check on their powers. The PAP's persecution of those from other political parties have caused the world's most respected publications like the Economist, the New York Times, and the South China Morning Post to point out that the PAP is using national institutions for individual and party gains.<br><br>8. Nelson Mandela, is the world's second longest serving political prisoner. He served 27 years before being released and is now a Nobel prize winning leader and figurehead. The world record holder for being a political prisoner is Singapore's Chia Thye Poh, a physics teacher and popular elected opposition MP, who was jailed for advocating an end to the Vietnam war. In the US, Bill Clinton, Mohammad Ali, and Martin Luther King were praised for protesting the war and being the conscience of the nation. In Singapore, Chia Thye Poh was detained for 32 years.<br><br>9. Singapore has a death penalty against drugs, but the CIA in the US lists Singapore government linked companies as being an important money launderer for the drug regime in Myanmar which has caused thousands of deaths.<br><br>10. According to government plans, in 20 years time (and 3 General Elections from now), there will be 7 million Singaporeans. Foreign migrants with Singapore citizenship will outnumber local born Singaporeans. Singapore born Singaporeans will be a minority within Singapore, outvoted by the newcomers.<br><br>11. According to evidence gathered by American researchers, new migrants always vote for the ruling party, in this case the PAP. Therefore, this coming election and the next are the only elections where NS serving, Singaporeans born citizens can make their voices heard and enforce their political will without dilution.<br><br>12. What is good for Lee Kuan Yew is not always good for the PAP. What is good for the PAP is not always good for Singapore. You and I need to remind ourselves that what is good for Lee Kuan Yew is not always good for Singapore.<br></div>
