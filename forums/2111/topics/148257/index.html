            <div class='col-md body'>Come come dont only see gers pics ..<br>muz talk serious sometimes ..<br>Let me start the ball rolling ..<br><br>do u all wana noe more abt our dear minister mentor <strong>Harry Lee </strong><br><br>Source : http://encyclopedia.laborlawtalk.com/Lee_Kuan_Yew<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew (born September 16, 1923)<br>also known as Lee Kwan-Yew or Harry Lee, was the first Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore from 1959 to 1990. He has remained the most influential politician in Singapore since his retirement as Prime Minister. Under the administration of Singapore's second prime minister, Goh Chok Tong, he served as Senior Minister. He currently serves in the newly-created post of Minister Mentor under his son Lee Hsien Loong, who became the nation's third prime minister on August 12, 2004.<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew was born in Singapore, where he was educated at Telok Kurau Primary School, Raffles Institution and Raffles College. His university education was delayed by World War II and the 1942Â—1945 Japanese occupation. Little is known about his wartime activities, some unconfirmed sources said that he acted as a double agent for both the British and the Japanese (which is quite unlikely), apart from the operation of a successful black market business: he financed the invention of a tapioca-based glue, called Stikfas, which was sold on the black market1. Having taken up Chinese and Japanese language lessons since 1942, he was able to work as a transcriber of Allied wire reports for the Japanese, as well as an English-language editor for the Japanese Hobudu (a information or propaganda department) in 1943 and 19442.<br><br>After the war, he studied law at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge in Britain. He returned to Singapore in 1949 to work as a lawyer in Laycock and Ong, the legal practice of John Laycock, a pioneer of multiracialism who, together with A.P. Rajah and C.C. Tan, had founded Singapore's first multiracial club open to Asians.<br><br>In 1954, Lee and a group of fellow English-educated, middle-class men formed the socialist People's Action Party (PAP) to agitate for self-government for Singapore and an end to British colonialism. Five years later, in 1959, Lee was elected as the first Prime Minister of Singapore, replacing the former Chief Minister of Singapore, David Saul Marshall. He was regularly re-elected in Singapore's limited democracy until November 1990, when he stepped down and assumed the post of "Senior Minister" in the government cabinet in the Goh Chok Tong government. He was once credited in the Guinness Book of Records as the longest serving Prime Minister, until the record was broken by Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, the former Prime Minister of neighbouring Malaysia.<br><br>During the three decades in which Lee was in office, Singapore grew from a Third World country to one of the most developed nations in the world, despite its small population and lack of natural resources. He is widely respected by the people of Singapore, and has often been credited as the architect of its prosperity (although a significant role was also played by his Deputy Prime Minister, Dr. Goh Keng Swee, who was in charge of the economy.)<br><br>On the other hand, he has been criticized as an elitist authoritarian, and even a dictator, for implementing many harsh policies and suppressing political opposition. For instance, he has used defamation lawsuits, claimed by critics to have little merit, to bankrupt political opponents. On one occasion, after a court ruling in favour of Lee was overturned by the Privy Council, the right of appeal to the Council was abolished. Also, during his premiership from 1965 to 1990, he incarcerated Chia Thye Poh, a former MP of an opposition party, the Barisan Socialis, for 22 years under the Internal Security Act, only to be released in 19893.<br><br>Lee was one of the leading advocates of Asian values, though his interpretation of Asian values is open to debate.<br><br>Lee has received a number of state decorations, including the Order of the Companions of Honour, Knight Grand Cross in the Order of St Michael and St George, the Freedom of the City of London, the Order of the Crown of Johore, and the Order of the Rising Sun.<br><br>Lee's wife, Kwa Geok Choo, runs a prominent legal firm, Lee &amp; Lee, and owns the property and investment company Wing Tai. His sons and daughter have held government and government-linked posts. His son, Lee Hsien Loong, is currently the Prime Minister and Finance Minister of Singapore. His daughter, Lee Wei Ling, runs the National Neurological Institute, while his other son Lee Hsien Yang manages the telecommunications company SingTel. His daughter-in-law, Lee Hsien Loong's wife Ho Ching, runs Temasek Holdings, a prominent holding company with controlling stakes in a variety of government-linked companies. His nephew-in-law is Wong Kan Seng, the Minister for Home Affairs. Lee and his son Lee Hsien Loong also sit on the board of the Government Investment Company (GIC) of Singapore as Chairman and Vice-Chairman respectively.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>nearly died when reading the following post from hwz ..sho farni<br><br><blockquote>Friday, August 05, 2005<br>Nabei, Singapore so small want to find one President also cannot<br><br>They say that this August 27 got President Election. At first I am very happy because maybe that mean got public holiday. Then I check the calendar and KNNBCCB!!!! It is a ****ing Saturday! Like that how to have ******* holiday!!!<br><br>Actually also dunno whether will have a fight or not. At first the now President, his name is Nathan (it is the Indian pronounce way, Nar-den, not the Ang Moh style, Neh-ten), he say he want to retire liao. He is already 81 years old, and got a few health problem, so **** lah, of course want to rest, right?<br><br>But then dunno so many MP, NTUC and gahmen people say no lah please don't retire, go for medical checkup and try to run for president again, so he now say he want to be president for another 6 years.<br><br>I am thinking, **** man, Singapore got so little talent until cannot find another man to be President ah? Have to make one poor old Indian man who want to rest go and try and be president again? Lan cheow ok!<br><br>Why must like this? Singapore everything good only have One, is it? One man good enough to be president, one party good enough to be gahmen, one Lao Lee good enough to be a PM, then SM, then MM? Singapore don't have other good people meh? Maybe that's why the Singapore song is One People One Nation One Singapore. Everything is ****ing ONE!!!<br><br>Maybe to become president the pass mark is too high. I heard must have some Certificate of Eligibity. Nabei! Be president also must have COE! Somemore the COE look like only the PAP kind of people can get type.<br><br>I heard got one guy running, is some JTC guy, also gahmen type. Lan pa pa lan.<br><br>I think it will be fun to see the Election during this month. Because this month is the Seven Month of the Hungry Ghost, and will got many Seven Month getai and wayang. Election is also a kind of wayang what!<br><br>Actually I think the Gahmen also want to see whether the Singaporean will vote this old President (OLD President, hahahahaha!!!!) to be the new President. Maybe see if the Singaporean is toolan the Gahmen or not. The NKF already make many Singaporean toolan and because the Gahmen Elections also coming, so must check check a bit.<br><br>I think Singaporean don't mind vote another president, if there is a choice. I think most people think president is cho bo lan one, so vote who also never mind. Don't halfway die can already.<br><br>But I think the president is not only cho bo lan. I heard he have to look after Gahmen money (which is actually OUR money, but the Gahmen always say is THEIR money). I know! Maybe can get that opposition party guy Chee! His name sound like bad word. If he is president, he can everyday ask the Gahmen "WHERE is the ******* MONEY?!!!" but confirm won't kena sue! Hahahahaha!!!<br><br>I also don't mind if I can be president. Got big house at the Isetana. Outside got so many guard and police look after my house (and my president baobei car can park inside won't kena scratch, not like parking in the ******* HDB carpark). Then next door my Isetana president house is Plaza Singapura shopping centre (last time Yaohan), and even got MRT. Outside is Orchard Road, got so many sexy chio bu to see. Good what!<br><br>But then cannot go and chiong as president, because too famous liao. Wait chiong already will become like that last time ah neh President, Devan Neh. He chiong too much in the end kena the Gahmen fry his cuttle fish.<br><br>Anyway too bad, I not smart enough, and cannot get the president COE. Car COE also got problem to get. But if they say lan cheow big can be president, I sure win one. But I think I cannot win in Election, only in Erection. I can be Rockson the Horse President! Hahahahahahaha!!!!<br><br>posted by Rockson @ 6:15 PM 128 comments</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wednesday Â• August 17, 2005<br><br>Siew Kum Hong<br>news@newstoday.com.sg<br><br>MANY Singaporeans would have been disappointed last Sunday morning, when they woke up to the news that President SR Nathan will be re-elected without a contest this week. Few would have been surprised, after last week's damaging statements from JTC Corporation, Hyflux and United Test and Assembly Centre (UTAC) about Mr Andrew Kuan.<br><br>The events surrounding Mr Kuan's abortive bid for the presidency have raised questions about the institution and the legitimacy of future office-holders.<br><br>After Mr Kuan announced his candidacy, various political figures spoke out on his bid. Their comments either touched on Mr Kuan personally or on the office of the presidency. Some, such as MP Charles Chong, chairman of the town council that Mr Kuan serves in, questioned his qualifications. Several unidentified persons described him as "arrogant" or "conceited".<br><br>Meanwhile, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for National Development Lim Swee Say warned against the consequences of a fluke result, citing the Chinese saying, "Don't fear 10,000, only fear the one-in-10,000 chance."<br><br>Others focused on the "seriousness" of the office and the need for the President to be the face of Singapore to foreign dignitaries, as if implying Mr Kuan had been judged and found wanting. There was also a call for him to be more transparent on his career history.<br><br>Most of the comments came even before JTC (and, to a lesser extent, Hyflux and UTAC) came forward and hammered nails into the coffin of Mr Kuan's aspirations.<br><br>Just as disturbing was the fact that all the comments came before the Presidential Elections Committee's (PEC) decision on Mr Kuan's eligibility. The latter had come under intense scrutiny even before he officially became a candidate.<br><br>It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the establishment felt discomfited, if not threatened, by the sudden appearance of a possibly credible candidate not endorsed by it. And judging from Internet postings (admittedly a lopsided barometer of public opinion), I am not the only one who felt so or who was bothered by this.<br><br>The role of the media was also troubling. Mr Kuan's candidacy was effectively subject to a trial by media. The politicians' comments were invariably given prominence. I think JTC's decision to release a press statement and hold a press conference disclosing their decision to ask Mr Kuan to leave, while declining to go into their reasons or the details of their report to the PEC, effectively used the media to destroy Mr Kuan's chances.<br><br>Furthermore, as the reason for its decision, the PEC gave a bare assertion that Mr Kuan's position as JTC group CFO was not comparable to the requirements under the Constitution. It did not explain in detail its reasoning in arriving at this conclusion.<br><br>It is therefore unclear what role was played by the crucial JTC report or whether the PEC had taken into account the various statements and disclosures in the media. It is also unclear whether the PEC should have interpreted the Constitution so as to err on the side of caution by allowing a contest in the interests of transparency and legitimising the presidency.<br><br>What happened with Mr Kuan's candidacy will be remembered for a long time to come. And this is where the presidency may have been damaged.<br><br>The requirements for a president are so stringent that the pool of eligible candidates is nothing less than miniscule. They will inevitably be people of substance and means. So why would they want to subject themselves to the storm of criticism that Mr Kuan experienced, which recent events would have shown to be the likely consequences of a candidacy not endorsed by the Government?<br><br>This unendorsed candidacy is precisely what is needed. The elected presidency was conceived as a check on a rogue government. In my view, people could become sceptical if only candidates endorsed by the government of the day can become President.<br><br>Yes, whoever becomes President should be suitably qualified. But that is for the PEC, not the government of the day, to decide.<br><br>Even Mr Nathan recognises that a true contest (as opposed to one engineered by the Government, as in 1993) may be necessary for legitimacy in the people's eyes. At the very least, it must be possible for a candidate not endorsed by the Government to mount a viable bid. But if the personal price of running is seen as too high or the odds perceived to be stacked against an independent candidate, then nobody will step forward.<br><br>And so, in trying to ensure that Singaporeans do not inadvertently elect a President who is not up to the job, our leaders may have Â— equally inadvertently Â— ensured that the elected presidency will forever remain a misnomer.<br><br>The writer is a lawyer commenting in his personal capacity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pulau Tekong is the largest of Singapore's outlying islands. It is found off Singapore's northeastern coast, but is actually nearer to Johor, Malaysia than the mainland itself. Land reclamation work is currently undergoing off the southern part of the island. Malaysia has referred the reclamation issue to International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea under the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea on July 2003. Subsequently, the tribunal ordered a year-long joint study on the issue. The conflict was resolved on April 2005 following a signing of agreement between the 2 countries. The agreement include modifications of the island in area D. The signed agreement is sent International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea for final judegement.<br><br>The island is used exclusively as a training base for various Singapore Army Units where Singaporean males conscripted into National Service and is home to the Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC) and the School of Infantry Specialists (SISPEC), with some 5,000 men residing there at any one time for up to several months each.<br><br>BMTC and SISPEC both feature multi-storeyed barracks at company level with their own lecture rooms, air-conditioned recruits' messes and shared basketball courts. There are also several reasonably well-equipped sports grounds and stadia with swimming pools, a medical centre with heli-evacuation capabilities, shared canteens and an E-Mart, a shop selling both army kit (paid for with servicemen's credits) and cash items ranging from toiletries to snacks. Electricity, however, is currently supplied by diesel-fed generators; an undersea cable will begin operating later in 2004. Access to the island is by state-subsidised ferry service(Penguin Ferry). However the public are not permitted entry except on official business.<br><br>Pulau Tekong was recently the hiding place in March 2004 for a group of armed robbers which consists of two Indonesians and a Malaysian. They fled from Malaysia, sparking off a massive, coordinated manhunt involving Air Force helicopters, commandos, ground surveillance radar, and troops from the 2nd Singapore Infantry Brigade. They were later charged with illegal entry and possession of firearms.<br><br>In Singaporean folklore, the island is deemed to be extremely haunted. It is unclear if these beliefs actually date back to the days when Tekong was inhabited by civilians or if they sprung up after the island was taken over as military territory.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More Foreigners than locals<br><br>By Liew Hanqing<br><br>August 25, 2005<br><br>THERE could be more foreign students than Singaporeans taking some engineering and science courses at the National University of Singapore.<br><br>Students tell The New Paper that this is particularly true in electrical and computer engineering, with local students forming less than a quarter of the class sometimes.<br><br>For instance, out of the 48 students in one industrial and systems engineering class, only 10 are Singaporeans, they said.<br><br>As many as 31 are from China, and seven are from other countries.<br><br>When asked for the details, the university said 20 per cent of its entire student body is international.<br><br>'International students are not evenly distributed across all faculties,' its spokesman said.<br><br>'Faculties such as engineering and computing may have a higher proportion of foreign students depending on foreign student interest in such courses.'<br><br>In going international, NUS has gone into partnerships with seven universities worldwide - including big names like Peking University, Australian National University, UC Berkeley and Yale.<br><br>This means there will be more exchange programmes and more collaborative research.<br><br>More competition too, as foreign students flock to our shores.<br><br>And the locals seem to be feeling the heat. One 23-year-old computer engineering student said foreigners made up about two-thirds of his class.<br><br>Three other students who are doing computer engineering confirmed that the majority of students taking the course are foreigners, mostly from China.<br><br>NUS would not comment on this figure.<br><br>Fourth-year environmental engineering student Audrey Huang, 22, said: 'With more foreign students, local students aren't given enough space to develop.<br><br>'Maybe the competitive local students would like being spurred on by these foreign intellectuals, but personally, as a normal student, it gives me excessive pressure.'<br><br>Second-year computer engineering student Chen Kaiwei, 22, felt that admitting foreigners would be meaningful only if more interaction between them and the locals was encouraged.<br><br>'Local students don't mix with the foreigners, so they don't learn anything from them,' he said.<br><br>'The only effect, then, is the intensive competition.'<br><br>But that is the key to success, the NUS administration believes.<br><br>The NUS spokesman said: 'We impose a highly competitive selection criteria for international students, more so than we would for local students.<br><br>'This is to ensure that our international students are among the most talented, and that they are truly deserving of a place in NUS.'<br><br>Some local students are taking the competition in their stride.<br><br>'There's no running away from competition,' said second-year mechanical engineering student Zeng Xian Hong, 22.<br><br>'If we don't meet foreign competitors in school, we'll meet them in the working world.<br><br>'There's no difference.'<br><br>But will this make an NUS education less accessible for local applicants?<br><br>NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University now have separate admission systems, the spokesman said.<br><br>'There are, therefore, sufficient places and a variety of courses - no deserving local students will be turned away.'<br><br>For reference:<br>1.

            <div class='col-md body'>World Toilet Organisation to set up world's first Toilet College in Singapore<br><br>http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stor.../165260/1/.html<br><br>The World Toilet Organisation is pioneering an effort that will bring the sparkle into toilet cleaning jobs.<br><br>It is setting up the world's very first Toilet College in Singapore.<br><br>Toilet cleaning has long been bogged down by low pay, low morale and low image.<br><br>Meet Mr Liu, a 65-year-old toilet cleaner who makes just $500 a month.<br><br>"We must clean it very well, there must be no faeces, not a trace of urine, and no bad odour," he said.<br><br>But sometimes, that can be a daunting task.<br><br>Mr Liu said: "Sometimes some elderly people can't make it to the toilet in time, just take off their soiled trousers and dump them here. Once, I almost threw up because the man threw it in the toilet and clogged up the whole thing. I had to use my hands to dig up the soiled trousers and throw it away."<br><br>The World Toilet Organisation hopes to change all that.<br><br>Cleaners will be given hands-on training at its new Toilet College, which promises to change the scope and perception of toilet related jobs.<br><br>Funded partly by government agencies, its courses will teach cleaners to use new equipment and techniques from Japan in which cleaners are given full ownership of their toilets.<br><br>Jack Sim, president of World Toilet Organisation, said: "We are going to train the toilet cleaners to upgrade himself or herself to a level where he or she can take care of the entire toilet, including changing bulbs, repairing locks, repairing leaky taps, doing periodical heavy cleaning, technical cleaning, taking away urine salt inside the toilet and recommending changes to the toilet layout."<br><br>When re-entering the workforce, the newly skilled restroom specialists will see their salaries increase to over a $1,000 a month.<br><br>Classes will be held at the Republic Polytechnic, and will begin in October for the first batch of 30 cleaners from a local cleaning company.<br><br>But the school hopes to reach out to a much wider student base.<br><br>So it's also offering a course on ecological sanitation to teach volunteers how to cater to sanitation needs in rural and disaster stricken areas.<br><br>Mr Sim said: "There are 2.6 billion people in the world who have no toilets, they are toilet-less and what we are trying to do is to build capacity for field engineers to go down to the farms, to the rural areas, to build ecological sanitation."<br><br>A course on toilet design and architecture is in the pipeline for next year.<br><br>With more courses, the Toilet College hopes to make toilets, quite rightly, everybody's business. - CNA/ir</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>http://politics.abovetopsecret.com/thread167017/pg1<br>posted by ROMAD<br><br>Islam is the real problem<br><br>I have read and read and read all the book I could on Islam and terror. Most have some pathetic story of the poor Muslims and how the west is the problem and that we just don't understand the true Muslim. Folsk that was until I read the Quran and studied a bit of Islamic history. Let me start by saying that I am an Independant and not a Dem or Rep. I do hope and pray for our courty every day, regardless of occupies the seats of government.<br><br>That being said, let elaborate. The very word "Islam" means submission. A muslim one who submits.<br><br>O you who believe! Obet Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad) and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority.<br><br>-Surah 4:59 Noble Quran<br><br>The Quran is broken into chapter and verse similar to that of any book, they are called Surah. But what most do not know is that it is not in chronological order. What they may also not be aware of is that there are two very different Qurans. One is out of Saudi Arabia :The Noble Quran and another translated by Abdullah Yusef Ali. You should be aware of this and know that western version is using the Ali version, as it is more palatable for conversions. When people make thier first trip to Mecca they learn what real Islam is all about the first time they hear from the Noble Quran. Here is one of many examples:<br><br>Surah 8:39<br><br>And fight them on until there is no more tulmult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in Allah altogether and everywhere.<br><br>Ali translation<br><br>Fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and polytheism, i.e. worshipping others besides Allah) and the religion (worship) will be for Allah alone.<br><br>Noble Quran<br><br>See the difference? Pressing on.<br><br>Next we come to the hadith. These are the books that record Muhammad's life from his wives and close friends. These come in a set of six books. They are referrenced by the author of the book who recorded them.<br><br>There are two major groups of Muslims. The sunni and Shiites. The Sunni's claim all of the Hadith as holy while the Shiites claim all but the books of Muhammads second wife.<br><br>You need to be aware of the hadith because it instructs Muslims how they are follow the example of Muhammad.<br><br>The last item you should be aware of that is followed by Muslims is the Sharia, which is the Islamic law regarding duty to Allah.<br><br>The Quran and hadith are based on what are know as the five pillars of faith. They are:<br><br>Statement of belief: i.e There is only one God and his name is Allah and Muhhamad is his prophet<br><br>Prayer: They must pray five times a day<br><br>Giving Alms: Similar to a tax at the end of the year<br><br>Fasting: Done during Ramadan during daylight hours<br><br>Pilgrimage: Once in thier lives they must travel to Mecca<br><br>Why is it so improtant that Muslims follow to the letter the words of the Quran? Because it is a religion of works. You must earn your way to Paradise. The only way to bypass this is die in Jihad. I'll prove it:<br><br>Then as for him whose balance (of good deads) will be heavy, he will live a pleasant life (in Paradise). But as for him whose balance will be light, he will have his home in Hawiyah (hell).<br><br>-Surah 101:6-9 Noble Q<br><br>In other words there is no guarantee of heaven even if you do good. It all depends on Allah.<br><br>But...if you die fighting the infidel in Jihad, you are guaranteed a place in Paradise.<br><br>Jihad is fighting anybody who stands in the way of spreading Islam. Or fighting anyone who refuses to enter Islam.<br><br>-Surah 8:39 Noble Q<br><br>Let those (believers) who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter fight in the Cause of Allah, and whoso fights in the Cause of Allah, and is killed or gets victory, We shall bestow on him a great reward.<br><br>-Surah 4:74 Noble Q<br><br>For them Allah has got ready Gardens (Paradise) under which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.<br><br>- Surah 9:89 n Noble Q<br><br>During a burial procedure the ones who died normally are washed and given a clean robe. Those who in Jihad are kept bloody as a testement of thier worth.<br><br>So, dying in Jihad is the only SURE way of reaching heaven. What would you do? Duh, where is the plastic explosive?<br><br>The last thing you need to know is that the life of Muhammad was very instrumental in how the Quran is interpreted. the early verses say lots of good things and later on her talks of the sword being the answer to the infidels. The reasons are simple. Just like most dictators who espouse change in society (in whatever form) lie early on and turn baby killer after the words are not recieved well. He started off in Mecca preaching and trying to convert folks and when they kicked him out he went to Medina. There he found followers and turn the sword on his countrymen who turned him out. After that is was all downhill.<br><br>Why are telling me this history crap for anyway (some folks are thinking). It is important because lie the early verses he says good things even about Jews and Christians. Like most of the "Heifer" (read about it) there are 114 verses saying sweet things. What about those? Well here is the deal, there are great deal of contradictions in the Quran and the way they fix them is take the later part to replace the former part if they are in contradiction. It is as if they do not exist. Here is an example:<br><br>Surah 2:219 compaired to Surah 5:90 (you look them up and stop being ignorant)<br><br>When these things happen they are referred to as Naskh, or a later revelation to Muhammad. So it must be more current and therefore more valid.<br><br>Example of this Surah 2:62-109 (warm and fuzzy) being cacelled by Surah 9:5:<br><br>Fight and slay the pagans wherever you find them, and sieze them, beleager them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent and establish regular prayers and practice regular charity, then open the way for them; For Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most merciful<br><br>Riiiiight.....<br><br>This is the verse know as the verse of the sword, and explains why Muslims must fight anyone who chooses not to convert to Islam, inside a Muslim country or out.<br><br>The principle of Jihad is ever present in a muslims life if he read the Quran and just because the Queen of Jordan says it isn't so should look to the book she is referrinf to. It isn't one of peace but on of war and extremism.<br><br>She said women are eual and don't really have to wear the Hijab. well let's just see if she was right.<br><br>Surah's<br><br>4:3 2:229 4:11 4:34 33:53 33:33 4:34 33:59 33:35<br><br>Hmmmm, not Exactly what she said huh?<br><br>But why would she say that the Quran was such a peaceful book and that Islam is such a great religion?<br><br>Hello...converts and another way of Jihad is to make converts through lies and softness, fuzzyness and charity.<br><br>Here is the thing about people...they are sheep and need a shepherd. They won't look things up for themselves and take what the media pushed as gospel. People are lazy and want everything handed to them on a silver platter.<br><br>I am not going to get all Bible on you guys but if you are in Islam get out. You are going down a road that will lead to either a black nothing (as agnostics think) coming back as bug (as the Hindu and Buddist think) or hell as Christians think). There will be no heaven for you unless you strap a bomb on yourself and kill others. Don't be lied to look it up. And when you see it thank me a bit for showing you the light.<br><br>ROMAD...out</div>
