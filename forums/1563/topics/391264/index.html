The veteran actress, who will be taking part in next month’s NUS Arts Festival, tells us she has no regrets about spending much of her life on stage.</p>
              <p style="color: #000000 !important; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; font-size: 13px !important; line-height: 15pt !important; margin: 0px;"><strong>I grew up as an only child and my mom called me </strong><br>a latchkey kid because I was very independent. And I’ve always wondered what it was like to have a sibling because it’s human nature to want things you don’t have, like if you have short hair you want long hair and if you have curly hair you want straight hair. But things worked out because I had cousins whom I was close to as well.</p>
              <p style="color: #000000 !important; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; font-size: 13px !important; line-height: 15pt !important; margin: 0px;"><strong>I was naughty and mischievous in school but </strong><br>I was also very principled. Whenever something happened, I would be picked out as the ringleader or trouble maker. But when I wasn’t and someone else was wrong, I’d stand up for that person. I was principled in that way. But now I’m not as principled, lah.</p>
              <p style="color: #000000 !important; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; font-size: 13px !important; line-height: 15pt !important; margin: 0px;"><strong>When I was 12 my best friend since kindergarten </strong><br>told me that she didn’t want to be my friend anymore because her mom said I was bad company. She was the most popular girl in the school and it felt good being her best friend; but when we were no longer friends, it was traumatic and a real life lesson for me. But as a kid, you don’t think so much; you just survive it and make new friends.</p>
              <p style="color: #000000 !important; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; font-size: 13px !important; line-height: 15pt !important; margin: 0px;"><strong>Meeting Ivan (Heng) in university changed my </strong><br>life. Ivan is the kind of person who excels and makes a mark with everything he does. So when he started a music and drama company in university and roped me in; things went downhill for me, studies wise. I was more concerned about our concerts and Rag and Flag Day, so much so that I was voted Absentee Of The Year in my law school year book, which I thought was quite cool.</p>
              <p style="color: #000000 !important; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; font-size: 13px !important; line-height: 15pt !important; margin: 0px;"><strong>Lim Kay Siu and I met on stage in a play where </strong><br>I was playing his mother. I’m always playing mother roles—I don’t know why! But we only got together a few years later, just before I was to leave for Scotland on an acting scholarship. He then pursued the voiceover market and made lots of money so he could come to Scotland and be with me.</p>
              <p style="color: #000000 !important; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; font-size: 13px !important; line-height: 15pt !important; margin: 0px;"><strong>I love gaming and you know how addictive and </strong><br>mindless it is. There was a play where Kay Siu was the director. I wasn’t giving my best and he got so angry with me and said, “Are you going to stop your gaming or not?!” and no other director would’ve known that about me, so I thought, ‘OK OK, better stop playing.’ But I’ve worked with a lot of directors and he’s one of the best I have worked with.</p>
              <p style="color: #000000 !important; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; font-size: 13px !important; line-height: 15pt !important; margin: 0px;"><strong>The theatre audience has grown and people like </strong><br>Selena Tan are doing wonders for the arts and it’s good because there is nothing like going to the theater. It’s really that live element of being in the same place with people who have practiced for so long and at the same time, anything can go wrong but it’s that excitement and that thrill that’s irreplaceable.</p>
              <p style="color: #000000 !important; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; font-size: 13px !important; line-height: 15pt !important; margin: 0px;"><strong>After <em>Anna and the King</em>, we </strong><br>explored working in L.A. but it was even harder for us than in Scotland. Unless you can do kungfu like Michelle Yeoh, there wouldn’t be much for us in the West. And of course, it was family that made us decide not to uproot.</p>
              <p style="color: #000000 !important; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; font-size: 13px !important; line-height: 15pt !important; margin: 0px;"><strong>I don’t regret not practicing law because </strong><br>I really enjoy what I do now and when I dig deep, I like to live life without regrets. If there’s something you want to do, it’s always possible. I mean, I’ve been acting for so many years and I’m still acting so that speaks volumes.</p>
              <p style="color: #000000 !important; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; font-size: 13px !important; line-height: 15pt !important; margin: 0px;"><strong>If I were Prime Minister for a week, I’d definitely </strong><br>try to repeal Section 377A, which is the law that makes homosexuality illegal because it’s happened in so many countries, so it’s about time we did it as well. And I‘d get every minister over the age of 70 to step down and have a nice retirement—go relax man! —Interview by Rachelle Low</p>
