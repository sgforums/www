              <p>There's this stupid Singapore (locally produced) ghost movie now playing in Australia about hungry-ghost festival and all the retarded old-fashioned superstitions and a Philipino maid.

              <p>The same should go for those who make lame films. If they can't make a good film, then find another job that they are actually good at.</p>

              <p>I can offer no suggestion to make such stupid people who goes around making stupid comments become more intelligent. The same goes for our film industry. It is up to them to improve or alternatively, they could always quit and stop embarrasing all of us Singaporeans to the world. All we can do is to complain to let them know that they suck and hopefully this will get through to them and things might improve in time, or not.</p>

              <p>The only suggestion I can possibly provide is for those untalented film-makers to either improve or stop making films, and those funding it to raise their standard by ALOT and be significantly less tolerant of film-makers producing crap like what I've just seen.</p>

              <p>Smart folks would simply turn off their television or even switched to another channel, retards like yourself would force yourself to watch it then use this movie as an excuse to vent your arrogance to tell others how educated you are and also to brag that you're actually residing in Australia.</p>

              <p>Smart folks would simply turn off their television or even
                          switched to another channel, retards like yourself would force
                          yourself to watch it then use this movie as an excuse to vent your
                          arrogance to tell others how educated you are and also to brag that
                          you're actually residing in Australia.</p>

                          a glimpse of the local Singaporean actresses?</p>
              <p>I hope you're not upset and disappointed because you have
                          wasted your time recording the entire show and found no worthy
                          actresses suitable for your wanking session.</p>

              <p>Are you mentally challenged? Since when did I say that I've watched the movie till the end? One could easily tell what it is about from the first 10 minutes. And is "wanking session" the best you can come up with? Makes me wonder what kind of creep you are as a person. How is it that I'm "bragging" when I've indicated where I'm currently at moron? You're not making any sense.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I take it that you agree with everything that I've said about locally produced shows are of extremely low standard, since your post clearly reflects that. So thanks for at least agreeing with me.</p>

              <p>The problem with creativity is that you (usually) have to think outside the box but still stay within a larger box if you want to go anywhere with it. It has to be socially-acceptable. In Singapore's case, the "larger box" isn't a whole lot bigger.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, one could be completely batshit insane like I am and nobody would have any idea what you're on about.</p>

              <p>i understand TS's point......because i've been observing for a long time that SG English shows (Channel 5) are all really lame.</p>
              <p>story is so-so, but the way they act and speak, is where the lame part is.</p>
              <p>you've pseudo-America, pseudo-British, pseudo-Mexican, pseudo-Spanish accent all thrown around. Thai-mix-blood guy speaking American slang. Rojak-blood actress speaking singlish in ang-moh accent.</p>
              <p>you've seen them, you know them.</p>
              <p>their actions are over-exaggerated to mimic those American actors and actresses in American shows, and the part where they fail in is that they are un-natural and trying too hard, and makes people cringe and their goose pimples all blast out.<br>(btw, Westerners have a habit of having wild elastic expressions on their face compared to asians when they speak)</p>
              <p>Channel 8 local-made shows are boring but at least they don't make people cringe.</p>
              <p>the only natural actor who has acted on channel 5 shows and yet doesn't make me cringe is Mark Lee, who speaks in true singlish and acts like a 100% singaporean.</p>
              <p>with regards to creativity, what can you expect from a population who has been slave-trained to pass their exams memorizing the Ten Year series?</p>
              <p>it was mentioned in yesterday's Straits times.</p>
