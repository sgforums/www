              <p>There's this stupid Singapore (locally produced) ghost movie now
                                      playing in Australia about hungry-ghost festival and all the
                                      retarded old-fashioned superstitions and a Philipino maid. Their
                                      retarded Singlish and annoying high-pitched voice and occasional
                                      third-world sounding Hokkien just made me cringed. Furthermore, why
                                      are there so little good looking actors in our media industry that
                                      are easy on the eyes?</p>
              <p>But most of all, the plot and the dialogues just plain lame (as
                                      usual). This is reflecting to the world that majority of
                                      Singaporeans are ugly, lame and uncreative. Why are such shameful
                                      junk being allowed to be played in other countries?</p>
              <p>Next time, when you're watching a locally made movie/TV-show,
                                      imagine how people of other countries would percieve it.</p>

              <p>The faults lies with Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>He was the one who imposed alien language, culture (which is why you cringed).</p>
              <p>He was the one who suppressed local culture.</p>
              <p>He was the one who stifled criticism and creativity.</p>
              <p>He is the one who repressed the country.</p>
              <p>The root cause of your frustration is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LEE KUAN YEW</strong></span>.</p>

              <p>i understand TS's point......because i've been observing for a
              long time that SG English shows (Channel 5) are all really
              lame.</p>
              <p>story is so-so, but the way they act and speak, is where the
              lame part is.</p>
              <p>you've pseudo-America, pseudo-British, pseudo-Mexican,
              pseudo-Spanish accent all thrown around. Thai-mix-blood guy
              speaking American slang. Rojak-blood actress speaking singlish in
              ang-moh accent.</p>
              <p>you've seen them, you know them.</p>
              <p>their actions are over-exaggerated to mimic those American
              actors and actresses in American shows, and the part where they
              fail in is that they are un-natural and trying too hard, and makes
              people cringe and their goose pimples all blast out.<br> (btw, Westerners have a habit of having wild elastic expressions on
              their face compared to asians when they speak)</p>
              <p>Channel 8 local-made shows are boring but at least they don't
              make people cringe.</p>
              <p>the only natural actor who has acted on channel 5 shows and yet
              doesn't make me cringe is Mark Lee, who speaks in true singlish and
              acts like a 100% singaporean.</p>
              <p>with regards to creativity, what can you expect from a
              population who has been slave-trained to pass their exams
              memorizing the Ten Year series?</p>
              <p>it was mentioned in yesterday's Straits times.</p>

              <p>One of the more intelligent posts so far, buried under all the nonsensical infantile rubbish posted here by retards.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, I also feel that it might not be the fault of the actors themselves, but of the poor quality of the script and dialogue. With such crappy scripts, no matter how good an actor/actress is, he/she would probably find it hard getting into the role and deliver.</p>
              <p>Also, rarity of good looking acting-talents on screen here, although not the main issue, is also not very encouraging.</p>
