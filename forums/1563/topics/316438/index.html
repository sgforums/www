Thus, she made up her mind to leave both her husband and son.<br><br>Feeling lost, Junjie searched everywhere for his mother. However, she was gone forever.<br><br>Stooping
              in the rain, he tried to hold back the fear and rage he felt inside. At
              this moment, a little hand holding a piece of bread reached out to him.
              Junjie lifted his eyes, and there standing before him was a little girl
              with a sweet smile, just like an angel. Her name is Zhiling, which is
              10 years old.<br><br>Junjie’s life would have been even more lonesome had he not known Zhiyuan, Zhiling and Tiaobao.<br><br>One
              day on a hill, Junjie, Zhiyuan and Tianbao shared about their ambition
              and dreams for the future. Being high in spirits, they swore to be
              sworn brothers and to share fortune and woes together. Unfortunately,
              the road ahead would not be as smooth sailing as they imagined.<br><br><strong>Accent</strong><br><br>Despite
              Junjie and his father living together for so many years, they are still
              unable to break the communication barrier. Junjie cannot forgive his
              dad for driving his mother away. Zhiling tries to act as a mediator
              between them.<br><br>Like the earth that revolves around the sun, she
              has grown to revolve her everyday life around Junjie, and cannot do
              without him. However, he often takes her for granted.<br><br>Tianbao
              was in love with Zhiling, but he knew that in order to be with her, he
              has to defeat his rival, Junjie. Unfortunately, he was never able to
              outshine Junjie.<br>Fate played a cruel joke on Junjie and Zhiyuan.
              They both met and fell deeply in love with Xiaorou at the same time.
              The two had to make a choice between friendship and love.<br><br>At
              this time, a brutal truth unravelled. Xiaorou caught up with her past
              relationship, could not delve into the future but often lived in the
              blissful memories of yesteryears. Zhiyuan was merely a replacement for
              Mingwen, her ex-boyfriend who had died.<br><br>Even though Zhiyuan knew
              the truth, he was willing to be Mingwen’s substitute. However, Xiaorou
              know that only Junjie can release her from her past.<br><br><strong>Chorus</strong><br><br>The
              notorious Zhang Nan, nicknamed Cockroach, wants to change for the
              better after knowing the kind-hearted Zhiling. Unfortunately, Zhiling
              met with an accident and died.<br><br>At times in life, one can have more than two choices to choose from and an insignificant decision can alter the lives of others.<br><br>Junjie
              had the opportunity to save Zhiling. However, he missed it when he went
              after Xiaorou who wanted to leave him.Choosing Xiaorou over Zhiling, he
              lost Zhiling instead.<br><br>After Zhiling’s death, Junjie, Zhiyuan, Tianbao and Xiaoru’s lives underwent a tremendous change.<br><strong><br>Variation<br></strong><br>After
              Zhiling’s death, Junjie started to feel emptiness in his heart. Junjie
              feels that there is a barrier between Xiaorou and him. He began to
              engage routinely in activities that Zhiling used to do, hoping to
              relieve himself from his guilt. However, he is unsure of his feelings
              for Zhiling.<br><br>On the other hand, Xiaorou tries her best to let go
              of her previous entangling relationship. However, memories from the
              past still linger within her. She realises that there is a distance
              between Junjie and her, and once again, he became another substitute
              for Mingwen. Humans keep repeating the same mistakes they make.<br><br>Besides
              facing difficulties in his career, Junjie found himself manipulated by
              a woman named, Zhishan. He made an erroneous decision and in order to
              cover his initial mistake, he committed one wrongdoing after another.
              In the end, he not only lost his father, but also his love ones and his
              friends.<br><br>Junjie found his way back to the `wishing well’ pool
              where he used to frequent and make a wish. He wished, if he could start
              afresh, he would make right all his wrong decisions. Then, as if in a
              dream, he saw Zhiling and went after her.<br><br>Suddenly he lost his footing, fell into the water, and was dragged to the bottom of the pool by a mysterious force.<br><br>When he regained conscious, he found himself back in time at the scene just before Zhiling died.<br><br>Could he turn all his wrong decisions right? Will the future be for the better or the worse?<br><br>Perhaps, not everything can possess a perfect ending and we will have no definite answers to certain questions….</span></span></p>
