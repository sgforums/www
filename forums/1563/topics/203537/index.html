            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Measure of Man</strong><br>Debuts Aug 7 2006, weekdays 9pm<br><br>Cast: Huang Wenyong (as Cai Lian Wei), Aileen Tan (as Patricia Wong), Ben Yeo (as Root), Ezann Lee (as Kate), Lynn Poh (as Melissa), Li Yin Zhu (as Liu Xue Hua), Liang Tian (as Cai Lian Zhong), Zhang Yao Dong (as Norman), Constance Song (as Hazel Gan), Zheng Ge Ping (as Jeremy)<br><br>What is the measure of a man? Is it his ability to bring home the bacon or is it his ability to command respect as head of the family? Or is it defined by his relationship to his loved ones around him - wife, girlfriend, kids, parents? This warm and heartfelt drama delves on issues relating to men in the modern world with a touch of humour!<br><br>Three men at various stages of life confronts the reality and circumstances of their surroundings in their own ways. There's a henpecked husband who tries his best to balance his responsibilities to his ageing parents with his duties as father and husband to his demanding wife and young son. There's also a young man who struggles to grapple with more responsibilities as a young father and husband to an immature wife. And finally, there's the commitment-phobic who flees at the mention of marriage and commitment after he witnesses the stresses of having a family from his married friends.<br><br>Forty-three-year old Cai Lianwei is an AVP in the gold card department of a bank. He has been married to his wife, Patricia for 7 years. They have a 5-year-old son. Lianwei and Patricia are both quite accomplished in their respective jobs. Work is pretty busy for the both of them, and they are very caught up trying to cope with the stress and workload. Romance has been completely overshawdowed by the daily stress and hosuehold chores. Lianwei is a filial son who takes care of his parentsÂ’ living expenses, even though they are not living with him under the same roof. He does this willingly without a single complaint. But his wife Patricia is unhappy over the arrangement, because Lianwei has an elder brother who does not lift a finger or spend a single cent to help support their parents. This is one of the issues that is a sore point in their marriage.<br><br>Lianwei has a 22-year-old nephew, Cai Shengen, who is currently in National Service. His wife is Kate, also 22-years-old, who has just given birth to their baby girl. But this is unexpected because the doctor had certified during regular examinations that the foetus is supposed to be a boy. Thus, ShengenÂ’s mother, who favours boys like many of her generation, is naturally disappointed.<br><br>Shengen and Kate are very young parents indeed. Their decision to get married was hastened only because Kate got pregnant. Kate has no knowledge or experience of parenthood and babies. She is also unwilling to listen to her mother-in-lawÂ’s old-fashioned advice. Mother and daughter-in-law are always bickering and poor Shengen is unwittingly caught in the middle. The young wedded couple squabbles so much that the dreaded word 'divorce' is constantly at the tip of their tongues.<br><br>Lianwei has a colleague at work, Norman, with whom he gets along very well. Norman is LianweiÂ’s subordinate, as well as confidante. They both enjoy a game of soccer, as well as soccer betting. Once in awhile on weekends, Lianwei, Norman and Shengen will play a game of soccer together just to relieve stress. Norman witnesses the various troubles bogging down Lianwei, caused by his family. Therefore, Norman views marriage with suspicion and doubt. Humourous and charming, Norman is nevertheless quite a Casanova. One day, a colleague Simon begs him to help stand in for a matchmaking appointment. Norman thus gets to know Melissa, a beautiful and classy lady. He is bowled over by her looks immediately, and so pretends to be Simon so he can date her. Norman finds out that Melissa longs for marriage. With his own inability to commit, he hesitates in bring their relationship further. With the advice from her good friend Hazel, Melissa decides to give up and forget Norman.<br><br>Hazel is a divorcee, who is 29 years old. Not only is she beautiful, she is a kind and understanding person as well. She joins LianweiÂ’s department at work and becomes his subordinate. LianweiÂ’s maturity, integrity and strength of character impress Hazel deeply and she begins to develop feelings for him. She takes every opportunity to shower him with care and concern, while sharing his woes and happiness. LianweiÂ’s relationship with his wife deteriorates, and on top of that, his sickly mother is hospitalised. As if the situation is not bad enough, Lianwei is retrenched and then his father passes away suddenly. With all these troubles weighing him down, Patricia fails to give the demoralized Lianwei any support and continues to squabble with him. Instead, with the support and encouragement from Hazel, Lianwei picks himself up again and even helps out in HazelÂ’s business.<br><br>Patricia and Lianwei had been living only as a couple in name. When gossip of Lianwei and HazelÂ’s affair reaches PatriciaÂ’s ears, Patricia hits the roof and takes the chance to divorce Lianwei. She even tries to claim alimony from Lianwei. However to her anger, the judge turns down her claim because of her qualifications and current salary. So will Lianwei and Hazel develop from their status as Â‘partners in spirit and moral supportÂ’ into a real relationship?<br><br>NormanÂ’s spendthrift ways plunges him into debt. He is unable to pay up and has to declare himself bankrupt. He loses his job as well. What makes him feel even worse at this point is that Melissa is about to marry a plastic surgeon. How will Norman win the love of his lady? And what will happen to Shengen and Kate, the young couple in a love-hate relationship?<br><br><img src="http://ch8.mediacorptv.com/imagegallery/store/phpL88xqu_m.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://ch8.mediacorptv.com/imagegallery/store/phpwWjkby_m.jpg"><img src="http://ch8.mediacorptv.com/imagegallery/store/phpQe4r2N_m.jpg"><img src="http://ch8.mediacorptv.com/imagegallery/store/phpvl8Tlf_m.jpg"></div>
