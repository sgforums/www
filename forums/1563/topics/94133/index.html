            <div class='col-md body'><strong>MediaCorp and SPH complete staff rationalisation exercise </strong><br><br>SINGAPORE : The word is final - and the numbers are out.<br><br>This in the wake of the merger of the mass-market TV and free newsapaper operations of media companies MediaCorp and Singapore Press Holdings (SPH).<br><br>The two-month staff rationalisation exercise involved 429 staff from SPH.......the majority from SPH Mediaworks.<br><br>Of these, 200 will be transferred to MediaCorp, 97 absorbed by SPH, and 132 will be retrenched.<br><br>Separately, MediaCorp also carried out a rationalisation programme, retrenching 72 staff in total.<br><br>On average, for those with more than three years of service, each retrenched person gets one month pay for each year worked, capped at 25 months.<br><br>The total retrenchment bill? $5.3 million for SPH and $3.9 million for MediaCorp.<br><br>The aim of the rationalisation is to stop the bleeding.<br><br>Mr Ernest Wong, Group CEO of MediaCorp, said: "The rationalisation is that with 330 people from MediaWorks and about half of them coming over here - in that sense, the half coming over here, we don't bring full overheads to run one channel...if you bring entire overheads, no rationalisation, you will bring over $40 million losses too."<br><br>As for the mood of the staff, SPH and MediaCorp said it was generally positive.<br><br>And with bruising competition put aside, the focus would now be on moving into the regional market.<br><br>Mr Man Shu Sam, COO of SPH MediaWorks, said: "This consolidation of resources and talent will help us to move even faster to compete in the region. I think we need to catch up these past four years competing locally."<br><br>But the staff rationalistaion process was anything but easy.<br><br>The five-man Manpower Synergy Commitee met several times a week over the past two months, communicating by phone and emails as well, and reviewing 1,200 staff to run the merged TV and studio operations - in which MediaCorp owns 80 percent and SPH 20 percent.<br><br>Mr Soo Kok Leng, Chairman of Manpower Synergy Committee, said: "Really to determine how you compare one person with another person because when we look at the list, 1,200 of them, to make sure the job they are doing currently matches and grading on this side is the same as the other side - often they are about the same.<br><br>"The question is who is the best...for everyone there was a debate it was not an easy thing...some are really easy - can be a matter of seconds, some took 2-3 meetings."<br><br>Mr Alan Chan, Ceo of Singapore Press Holdings, said: "The deliberation has been very open, very objective and when there are any doubts about any individual, sometimes the supervisor is called in to give testimony or evidence, on the suitability of the individual staff and through this long process, came up with a list. From the SPH side, we are very satisfied that all our staff have been given a fair weightage."<br><br>The changes kick in by year end.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is bad news for the angmohs amongst us.  Channel 5 has been getting worse by the year (WWE, lousy and tacky announcements with awful American accents, cutting to ad-breaks mid-sentence), and Channel I was a refreshing alternative.  Now it seams that even Central is turning to tacky entertainment 'documentries'.<br><br>What I wonder is, do the authorities realise the affect that mass media has on the people, do they realise how poor the quality of said mass media is, and if so, why is it letting it degrade to such abysmal levels?</div>
