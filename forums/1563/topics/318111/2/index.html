              <p>Recently its only huang jin lu and just in Singapore that are the good shows released by mediacrap.</p>
              <p>Its because mediacrap does not do any wu xia or period shows with the setting in the 1950s-60s thats why every show seems like a clone of the previous one.</p>
              <p>Its not really all the actors are crap lah I feel. They are not really given a chance to shine with the rubbish scripts thrown to them.</p>
              <p>However, I agree that Elvin Ng is merely a pretty face with no acting ability. Makes me cringe most of the time when I see him acting. And don't even get me started on Dawn Yeo's acting...</p>

              <p>well, i have to agree that last time, singapore drama is good, eg, during the time of SBC and TCS, cos last time, the backstage are made up of all hong kong crew that the then SBC hired from HK..... the kind of genre that we used to have are plentiful, have you watched the old dramas? many of them are still very good, up to now</p>
              <p>But during the times of Mediacorp, i would say that they have walked downhill, have any of you realised how long they didnt make any å�¤è£… drama??? many years already...........cos they think that its more economical to make similar kinds, like those family drama, cos easy to produce and cheap</p>
              <p>I believe that the best period was during when channel u and mediacorp before merger, cos got competition. Now, without competition, they throw all kinds of trash to us........ we become their trash bin...</p>
              <p>But i would just like to highlight that, nowadays sources of entertainment is so much... eg internet tv, satelite tv, SCV, computers.... etc etc, i hope any of the higher level mediacorp ppl read this, and pull up their socks, dun throw any more trash to us.

              <p>yups. last time used to have HK scriptwriters also. thats why past years dramas really was so fantastic... also last time those HK cameramen also more professional, the way they shoot stuff really is commendable.</p>
              <p>mediacock is afterall a profit organisation what, their drama time belt (aka advertisement revenue) all for family to watch one.</p>
              <p>was recently watching The Vagrant (Bao Zi Dan) at 12am from Mon - Wed, gotta admit Li Nanxing acting skills was superb, shots were nice also. Storyline was equally awesome.. :)</p>
              <p>drama is going downhill here! ROAR! HELP!</p>

              <p>watched from young but havent watch local drama since years
              ago... the scripts lacked in creativity and it was damn predictable
              to the point that i sometimes know what what certain actors would
              say...</p>
              <p>why we cannot have 'smart' serials like Kurosagi, Death Note and
              Liar Game ? though it probably would be an epic fail with all the
              ??? in our elderly locals' heads.</p>

              <p>The scripts are utterly dull and usually rehash the same old themes, and that applies to both Channel 5 and Channel 8. Comedies tend to take after Under One Roof or PCK, but the gags are lame. Family dramas, as mentioned earlier, always have some kind of love triangle, crazy webs of love and hate, some silly feud over money and plenty of weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
              <p>The scriptwriters need to be allowed, or allow themselves to, move away from the same old cathartic formula. They need to be given a free reign, and to write what they can imagine, as if it were art, and enjoy it.</p>
              <p>Screw the family-friendly, neighbourly and nation-building themes for once. Break the old stereotypes. Give us über-cool,  complex and original characters like Gregory House and Adrian Monk, and build teams and plots around them.</p>
              <p>Oh, and I didn't find 'The Noose' funny at all. For proper humour, try watching 'Have I Got News For You' or 'Nevermind The Buzzcocks'. There's no need for queer wigs and costumes, give us satire and mickey-taking straight from the hip. And the censors need to ease up on this.</p>
