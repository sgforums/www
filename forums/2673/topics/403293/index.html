              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Unless you’re Lionel Messi – currently probably the best football player in the world – chances are good that you spend a fair portion of your day sitting at a desk. The average European works about 40 hours a week, and many spend a large portion of that time sitting at a desk. Unfortunately for desk-bound workers, research has shown that these people are likely to suffer from weight gain, decreased muscle tone, back pain and increased stress. <br> <br>Despite our best intentions, it can be difficult to balance exercise with the rest of your life. However, those employees in desk jobs can find ways to incorporate healthy habits into their daily routine that will help alleviate the negative impact of sedentary work.* <br><br><strong>1. Skip the coffee and take a walk instead.</strong> <br>If you’re looking for an energy boost, walk straight past the coffee machine and just keep on walking. Taking a 15- to 20-minute walk will make you feel more alert, get your heart pumping and help you relieve stress – without caffeine or sugar!<br><br><strong>2. Avoid the snack machine.</strong><br>Many businesses have vending machines that dispense any number of tempting snacks such as crisps and chocolate. To beat the temptation to indulge in these unhealthy items, try to keep some healthy, tasty treats nearby. Good choices include fruit, chopped vegetables, yoghurt, nuts or low-fat cheese. <br><br><strong>3. Enjoy a healthy lunch.</strong><br>Even if you manage to bypass the snack machine, there are still other food-related pitfalls at the office. One culprit could be canteen food or take-out lunches, which are often high in calories. Special coffee drinks can also pack a punch – sometimes upwards of 400 calories per coffee! So whenever possible, try to bring a healthy lunch from home; this helps you control portions and is less expensive, too. If you must go out for lunch, choose a lighter option from the menu, like a salad. Trade your morning café mocha for a green tea, and be sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day.<br><br><strong>4. Pretend the lift is broken.</strong><br>If you work in a multi-storey building, take the stairs as often as you can. About 10 minutes of stair-climbing burns approximately 50 calories, so the next time you need to take a report upstairs to the boss or go down to check on the fax machine, take the stairs rather than the lift.<br><br><strong>5. Get fit while you sit. </strong><br>Stuck at your desk waiting for an important call? If you can't get up, don’t – do a few exercises while you sit. Try push-ups: hold on to the armrests of your chair, and push up until arms are fully extended. Lower your body until you’re almost seated, then push up again. Alternatively, do stretches at your desk. Place your hands behind your lower back while sitting up straight. Move your right ear toward your right shoulder and then slowly move your left ear toward your left shoulder. Then, look down at your desk while pulling in your stomach muscles and straighten your back. Then look up at the ceiling. These and other stretches can help protect your back during the work day.<br><br><strong>6. Cycle or walk to work.</strong><br>If it’s possible, leave your car at home and walk or cycle to the office. You might be amazed how invigorating it is to start your day in the fresh air, or how relaxing it is to decompress and think over the day’s events as you stroll home in the sunshine. It saves money on petrol and can provide you with a day’s recommended amount of exercise.<br><br>These are just a few of the many ways you can keep your desk job from negatively impacting your weight and health. But there are many more… be creative (and use common sense) to find new ways to stay moving and stay healthy!</p>
