              <p>we are happy. LOL</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Reena</strong> told STOMP that after both she and her boyfriend cheated on each other, she realised how much she truly loved him.<br><br>It was only after he begged for a second chance did everything change.<br><br>“Each time someone ask how I first get to know my boyfriend, I will be too shy to tell,” she said.<br><br>“It was back at the end of year 2003, well, I made the first move because I was slacking at home with my cousin and I was bored, so I asked her, ‘any guy friend to introduce to me?’<br><br>“She gave me her mobile and I started to scroll down her contact list.<br><br>“Suddenly, a name caught my attention, (I found his name cute, that’s why).<br><br>“So, I got hold of that number and started to text him. I found out he was single, and I was too and that’s when it all started.<br><br>“We exchanged text messages almost everyday, 24/7.<br><br>“It was really crazy; I remembered when I used to top-up my mobile credit each day, just to keep in touch with him. (I just had this gut feeling, maybe he was the one)<br><br>“And, one month later we decided to have our first meet-up, (Damn, he’s cute!) Then, a few days later, we got ‘hitched’.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> “It was like love was in the air for the first few months, our so-called our ‘Honeymoon’.<br><br>“I was feeling all great whenever I was with him.<br><br>“Maybe, it was the first time I felt I’m truly in Love.<br><br>“Well, I was only 16 years old at that time. It was a few months later when I suddenly spiced up the relationship.<br><br>“I started to hang out with some rookies, and I was uncontrollable. (I even forgot that I had a Boyfriend).   <br><br>“I was dating with another guy, and I even told my Boyfriend I couldn’t be with him anymore.<br><br>“But, he persuaded me that I should give my decision a second thought, and that he will wait for me.<br><br>“And I simply, ignored him. (Oh my, what was I thinking at that time?)<br><br>“I admit, I was such a bad Girlfriend. It was only a few weeks later, then I came to my senses.<br><br>“After ignoring his multiple calls and messages, I finally gave in.<br><br>“We sorted things out, and I promised myself that I would change. Then on, everything was so fine. We were so happy together.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">“On our second year of being together and we were both in ITE College by then, things started to spiced up again. (No, it’s not me again...)<br><br>“My Boyfriend did it this time round. (Now, I have to believe Karma does exist)<br><br>“It was even crazier this time round. I was really getting it all back.<br><br>“His personality, his attitude changed totally towards me. And I think I don’t know who he was at that point of time.<br><br>“I had the most terrible time of my life, trust me, I was really suffering. I couldn’t sleep at night, I couldn’t concentrate on my studies, and I even shunned my friends.<br><br>“And I repeatedly ditched school, and got barred from taking one of my examinations. (My parents didn’t know about this)<br><br>“And it was one of those days when I ditched school, because my Boyfriend was really sick (I found out from his Mum) that I visited him at his place.<br><br>“Seeing how weak he was at that point of time, I couldn’t bring myself to confront him about the issues we had. So, I acted as if nothing happen.<br><br>“But, everything changed when my Bf’s mobile rang. (He was in his room, and I was at his living room) I picked up the call, and it was a girl wanting to speak to him.<br><br>“My hands were shaking, and I felt like I could explode anytime soon.<br><br>“It was only then that I knew my Boyfriend had a ‘Scandal’.<br><br>“Knowing that my Boyfriend was still asleep, I suggested to that Girl, that it’s better if we meet up, and she agreed. (Damn, she even knew where my Boyfriend stays!)<br><br>“We had a good talk, and at the same time, I felt like punching her in the face too. She even showed me the messages my Boyfriend sent to her.<br><br>“All those mushy stuffs they text each other. *pukes* I was all filled with anger; (Well I know I did the same mistake too, but who’s not angry right?)<br><br>“And the worst part is that, she invited my Boyfriend to her house, twice. (And I don’t wish to know what happened there)<br><br>“A few minutes later, my Boyfriend showed up, and of course he was freaking shocked! He got caught red-handed.  I just couldn’t take the blow, and broke up with him.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> “I was all miserable and lost after we broke up, I even tried to kill myself, (Well, eventually, I dare not.)<br><br>“And after that incident, my Boyfriend was searching high and low for me, to patch things up.<br><br>“And he told me, what he did was just a moment of folly.<br><br>“I can’t deny the fact that I still love him and we got back together again.<br><br>“My feelings towards him grew more and more each day since the incident. But not for long, my Boyfriend did another show. *round of applause for him please*</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> “This time round, he got away a few times before I found out.<br><br>“He was hooking up with a girl from his school.<br><br>“Actually, I have a feeling he was keeping something from me, when he started to ignore my calls and messages, cancelled our meet-ups at the very last minute and such.<br><br>“I still remember, we were at KFC, and he was ordering the food, and I was meddling with his mobile, and I randomly scroll through his contacts, only to found out that my contact was not there!<br><br>“But instead, it was replaced with another unknown name. It was saved as *_ _ _ _ Darling* Darling?<br> <br>“Who the hell is this girl, I was telling myself.<br><br>“But I kept it to myself, and return the phone to my Boyfriend.<br><br>“We packed the food and I told him I need to talk to him.<br><br>“So, we sat down at a void deck near his place.<br><br>“And I confronted him, asking who’s that Darling in his contacts is, and how come my contact is gone!<br><br>“He denied it at first, claiming it was just a friend and he accidentally delete off my contact. (Maybe he thinks I’m still a kid and that I would buy his story)<br><br>“I was really furious; I slammed all the food and drinks we bought earlier.<br><br>“Only then, he began to tell the truth. Damn, only God knows how hurt I am at that point of time. I left the place, and went home.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><br>“We didn’t contact each other for a few days, and I was wondering why he didn’t look up for me since.<br><br>“I tried to get hold of him, but I failed numerous times.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">“It was only after I pleaded with him, he agreed to meet me.<br><br>“And only to find out, he was still with that girl and because by then I knew he dumped me. (I was stupid to put hopes on him, that he would realize his mistakes).<br><br>“And again, I was suffering all by myself; I cried to my sleep almost every night, I was so lost and going crazy.<br><br>“I loved him too much, I still can’t accept the fact that he left me.<br><br>“One day, I was at school, I received a message from him, saying that he wants to meet me.<br><br>“I was all shocked, and wasted no time; I left the class halfway just to meet him.<br><br>“When I saw him, I cried, it’s been more than a week since I last saw him.<br><br>“We talked things out, he truly regretted what he did and wanted to be with me.<br><br>“My gut feeling told me to give him a second chance and I did.<br><br>“My girlfriends totally disagreed with my decision, saying that I was too gullible and that I shouldn’t have patched things up with him.<br><br>“But well, I said, ‘Everyone deserves a second chance, and I know he will change’.<br><br>“I loved him, I loved him more than anything else.<br><br>“It was a few months later, he was serving the nation, and slowly I can see him change to the better, and I couldn’t ask for more.</p>
              <p> “It has been until now that he has loved me like no other.<br><br>“And I know he’s going to be my last. I am happy whenever I’m with him, he makes my life complete.<br><br>“We have been together for 6years and 7months now, and are getting engaged next month, February *on Valentines Day*.<br><br>“At times, I still couldn’t believe that we have made it this far. But I’m glad, we did. *grinning form ear to ear*<br><br>“What I’m trying to say here is that, no matter how big someone made a mistake, we should give him/her a chance, you just have to believe in it. It happened to me.”</p>
