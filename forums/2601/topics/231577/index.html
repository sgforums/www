Over 1,093,089 people joined the Adventist church in the twelve month period ending June 2006 (inclusive), through baptisms and professions of faith. The church is one of the world's fastest-growing organizations, primarily due to increases in membership in the developing nations. Depending on how the data was measured, it is said that church membership reached 1 million between 1955 and 1961, and grew to 5 million in 1986. At the turn of the 21st century the church had 10,782,042 members which grew to 14,487,989 members at the end of 2004, and 2005 statistics showed 14,399,072 members. It is believed that over 25 million worship weekly in churches. The church operates in 204 out of 230 countries and areas recognised by the United Nations.<br><br>This is not written as a challenge to your post, but as a push towards factual accuracy.<br><br>Also, in my opinion, it is rather needless to state the wealth of your church - this is not a factor in the worship of God.<br><br>Most orthodox churches are also worldwide churches, many of such churches are extremely organised.</div>

There is a Bishop in each country, and the Methodist church are meticulous about how the individual church is run and the appointment of the local pastor is by the conference. I know this for a fact because I am a Methodist.<br>I think, the Anglican church operates similar to this.<br><br>.... and yes, I wiki, which resulted in the links I had pasted in my previous note.<br><br>.... and yes, I also checked your website. Did you check websites of the other denominations and understand how they are organised.<br><br>.... at the end of it all, my point is: it is not necessarily to state the size of your church or what wealth it has. Such statements are whimsical at best and callous at it's worst. It makes the writer extremely snooty which may not have been the intention at all.<br><br>.... I am not here to compare churches.<br></div>
