You are the one bringing it up.

I also believe that as a Christian, when we make a claim, we better be able to substantiate it, otherwise unbelievers will look at us incredulously.<br><br>If I claim that I belong to the largest congregation in Singapore, factually it has to be the largest congregation in Singapore. Being ONE of the largest doesn't even count. It is as simple as that.<br><br>Factually, when your cell leader states that SDA is the second largest denomination in the world, the statement is very simple. There was no qualifying point as to whether he meant one that is tightly organised nor does it mean that there is a strong structure.<br><br>Also, while defending your cell leader is commendable, we need to state black as black and white as white, otherwise where is our witness?<br><br>The alternative is: continue to state whatever you wish and mislead people who may be reading.<br><br>I may be splitting hairs here, but non-Christians always look at us with suspicious eyes. Any ridiculous claim can and will be used against us. Note that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lol... I didn't expect this to turn into a denominational debate! That wasn't my point at all... My apologies to Chin Eng for the misunderstanding in the facts. I really don't want this to be a denomination vs denomiation thread! it was originally meant as a welcome to Cell 2 Forum thread in the first place, and has turned into something totally different.<br><br>I was not trying to boast when I said that the seventh-day adventists were the number 2 organised church in the world. By organised I meant that much of our offerings do not stay in the church, but rather goes back up to the world conference where the money is re-distributed to divisions and missions all over the world that need it the most, with some comming back to our church. Doctrines and believes etc are the same no matter which adventist church you go to. Basically everyone knows what everyone is doing. That was what I meant by organised, I was not saying that the adventist church has the second most members in the world, nor was I saying that we have the second most number of churches in the world. I am not sure whether the methodist church does the same, and if they do I apologise for getting the facts wrong, for all along I have thought we were one of the few churches that are organised this way as a world church.<br><br>My intention was not to be arrogant about our status as a world church, but merely to explain why it may seem like we have 'alot' of money in that sense, because our money from all over the world is combined together before being sent for redistribution. Its not a competition, we're all trying to win souls for Jesus anyway, no matter which church you go to! =)</div>
