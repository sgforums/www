              <p>Dear Husband:<br> I'm writing you this letter to tell you that I'm
              leaving you for good. I've been a good woman to you for seven years and
              I have nothing to show for it. These last two weeks have been hell.
              Your boss called to tell me that you had quit your job today and that
              was the last straw. Last week, you came home and didn't notice that I
              had got my hair and nails done, cooked your favourite meal and even
              wore a brand new negligee. You came home and ate in two minutes, and
              went straight to sleep after watching the football. You don't tell me
              you love me anymore, you don't touch me or anything.<br> Either, you're cheating or  you don't love me anymore, whatever the case is, I'm gone. <br> <br> P. S. If you're trying to find me, don't. Your BROTHER and I are moving away to  West Yorkshire together! Have a great life!<br> Your EX-Wife<br> <br> <em>Dear Ex-Wife<br> Nothing has made my day more than receiving your letter. It's true that
              you and I have been married for seven years, although a good woman is a
              far cry from what you've been. I watch sports so much to try to drown
              out your constant nagging. Too bad that doesn't work. I did notice when
              you cut off all of your hair last week, the first thing that came to
              mind was "You look just like a man!" My mother raised me to not say
              anything if you can't say anything nice.<br> When you cooked my
              favourite meal, you must have got me confused with MY BROTHER, because
              I stopped eating pork seven years ago. I went to sleep on you when you
              had on that new negligee because the price tag was still on it. I
              prayed that it was a coincidence that my brother had just borrowed £50
              from me that morning and your negligee was £49.99.<br> After all of
              this, I still loved you and felt that we could work it out. So when I
              discovered that I had hit the lotto for £10 million I quit my job and
              bought us two tickets to Jamaica.<br> But when I got home you were
              gone. Everything happens for a reason I guess. I hope you have the
              fulfilling life you always wanted. My lawyer said with your letter that
              you wrote, you won't get a penny from me. So take care.</em> <br> <em><br> P. S. I don't know if I ever  told you this but Carl, my brother was born Carla. I hope that's not a problem.<br> Signed Rich As Hell and Free!</em></p>
