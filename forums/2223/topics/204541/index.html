            <div class='col-md body'>Here's another 1.<br><br>LKY was invited over to msia for a conference with mahatir. during the break time of the conference LKY went out to the office bif fish tank there and started staring at the fishes. At this time mahatir came out to take a breather, and saw LKY raise up a finger pointing at the fishes, then as he moves his fingers the fishes follow......Imagine the MAC commercial for fillet o fish<br><br>then mahatir asked LKY how he do that. LKY replied " The greater mind dominates the weaker minds"<br><br>so mahatir thought about this and started to try what LKY did to the fishes.<br><br>when the conference was about to start, mahatir wasnt in his seat yet so LKY being abit impatient went out to call him. To his surprised, mahatir was still looking atthe fishes.<br><br>When LKY went closer he saw mahatir's mouth opening and closing like the fishes.......</div>

All agreed on this idea.<br><br>1st in line was the chinese monk cos he came up with the idea..<br><br>He jumped out and at the same time chanting ahmitabba.... surprisingly he landed safely without any scratches.<br><br>Next was the indian, when he jumped out he started saying his prayers softly( a short chant only) and he also landed safely.<br><br>Now the 2 below the mountain was hugging each other praising each other's god. Then they turned their attention to the muslim guy asking him to jump down quick.<br><br>So the mulim guy now prepares himself to jump.<br><br>He took a leap out and started his prayers.....AHHHHHHHHLAHHHHHHHHHHH!~~~~~~~~~~~~~..............<br><br>sadly he died upon reaching the foot of the mountain.<br><br>do u know y he died???<br><br>Cos he have not even finished his prayers yet then he landed liao. =.=</strong><br></blockquote>Indian is a race not religion  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Hindu is it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
