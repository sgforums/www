              <p>lols cos it's online mah? Geddit?</p>
              <p>say all those rude things online, and in real life act only at appropriate times.</p>
              <p>And it's good too. Cos although I'm like the class clown of some sorts,( i insult some1 and everyone will laugh and girls' be like "omgosh sit with me!")</p>
              <p>but no one is ALWAYS funny. So it's actually good  to try out things on SG forums to find out which stuff is good to say and which isnt.</p>

              <p>I admit  Im cheap, i like to say Bitch for fun. Okay????</p>
              <p>Anyway, to be serious, who the fuck MEMORISEs jokes and tell them to frens? It's freaking loserish. Unless it's a joke telling session, like on this forum.  But alot of people on Sgforum take things too seriously. Why not just see me as a "fren". If a fren's joke fail, just say it isnt funny and move on?</p>
              <p>Oh maybe some of you guys have have no frens. :D</p>
              <p>I hate to preach cos it's annoying but guys,Learn frm HWZ and STOMP.</p>
              <p>Normally,... IN REAL LIFE. I dunno if some of you know what that is.</p>
              <p>Alright, in Real Life, you just need to make digs @/retort your frens with slightly mean but harmless insults and you will get laughs naturally.</p>
              <p>Or just talk shit about people, but not too maliciously.</p>
              <p>That's humour for my generation. I sense that there are alot off 30 year old dudes on here, so it's ok if you dun get me.</p>
              <p>Oh i got a new account babies!</p>
