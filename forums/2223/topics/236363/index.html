            <div class='col-md body'>Pretty CREEPY this one, I warn you.<br><br>Another one of those stories that we get over the net.<br><br>This is a TRUE story of a young college girl who passed away last month.<br><br>Her name is Priya.<br>She was hit by a lorry. She had a boy friend named Shankar.<br><br>Both of them were true lovers. They always used to hang on the phone. You could never ever see her without her handphone.<br><br>She spent 3/4 of the day talking to Shankar. Priya's family knew about their relationship. Shankar was very close with Priya's family too. Before she passed away she always told her frens "If I pass away, please cremate me with my handphone." She also said the same to her parents.<br><br>After her death, people couldn't carry her coffin. I was there too. A lot of them tried to do so but nobody could. They sought the help of their neigbour who was a Thai 'bomoh' (pak Darin) who after chanting for a while asserted that the girl misses something badly. Only then her frens remembered and told the bomoh that she wanted to have her mobile phone burnt along with her.<br><br>He then opened the coffin and placed her phone and SIM card inside the casket. After that, they could carry the coffin so easily and the whole lot of us who witnessed this were really shocked!<br><br>Priya's lifeless body was carried into the van and sent off to the Mandai crematorium.<br><br>Priya's parents didn't inform Shankar that Priya had passed away. (pity Shankar). After 2 weeks, Shankar, called Priya's mom. "Atte, I'm coming home today, cook something nice for me. Don't tell Priya that I'm visiting you today. I wanna surprise her." Her mother replied....." You come home first, I wanna tell you something very important." When he came over, they told him the truth about Priya.<br><br>Shankar thought that they had gone crazy and were playing the fool. He was laughing and said, "Don't try to fool me; tell Priya to come out. I have a gift for her and please stop this nonsense." Then they showed him the original death certificate. They gave him proof to make him believe.<br>(Shankar started to sweat)<br><br>He said... "it can't be true. We just spoke to each other yesterday.<br>She still calls me all the time.<br>Shankar was shaking and suddenly his phone rang. "See, he said, this is from Priya, see this..."<br>He showed the phone to Priya's family and they told him to speak to her using the loudspeaker mode as all of them could hear their conversation.<br><br>Loud and clear, no cross lines, no humming and they heard their darling Priya's voice and there was no way others could use her simcard since it was nailed inside the coffin.<br><br>They were all so shocked and asked for pak Darin's help again. Pak Darin brought his master (Tok<br>Chen)to solve this matter. They worked for 5 hours and finally they discovered one thing.....<br><br>.......<br>......<br>......<br><br>......<br><br>.....<br><br>....<br><br>....<br>....<br>.....<br>.....<br>....<br>.....<br>....<br>......<br>.....<br><br>....<br>....<br>.....<br>.....<br>....<br>.....<br>....<br>......<br>.....<br><br>M1 has the best coverage</div>
