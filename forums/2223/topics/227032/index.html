"That's women's work"<br><br>MEANS: it's difficult, dirty, and thankless.<br><br>4. "Will you marry me?"<br><br>MEANS: both of my roommates have moved out, I can't find the washer and there's no peanut butter left.<br><br>5. "It's a guy thing."<br><br>MEANS: there's no rational thought pattern connected with it, and you have no chance at all of making it logical.<br><br>6. "Can I help with dinner?"<br><br>MEANS: why isn't it already on the table?<br><br>7. "It would take too long to explain"<br><br>MEANS: I have no idea how it works.<br><br>8. "I'm getting more exercise lately"<br><br>MEANS: the batteries in the remote are dead.<br><br>9. "We're going to be late."<br><br>MEANS: I have a legitimate reason for driving like a maniac.<br><br>10. "Take a break, Doris, you're working too hard."<br><br>MEANS: I can't hear the football over the vacuum cleaner.<br><br>11. "That's interesting dear."<br><br>MEANS: are you still talking?<br><br>12. "Love, we don't need material things to prove our love."<br><br>MEANS: I forgot our anniversary again.<br><br>13. "You expect too much from me."<br><br>MEANS: You expect me to stay awake?<br><br>14. "It's really a good film."<br><br>MEANS: It's got guns, knives, fast cars, and women.<br><br>15. "You know how bad my memory is."<br><br>MEANS: I remember the words to the theme song of Only Fools and Horses, the address of the first girl I kissed, and the plate number of every car I've ever owned, but I forgot your birthday.<br><br>16. "I was just thinking about you, and got you these roses."<br><br>MEANS: the girl selling them on the corner was a real babe.<br><br>17. "Oh, don't fuss, I just cut myself, it's no big deal."<br><br>MEANS: I have actually severed a limb, but will bleed to death before I admit I'm hurt.<br><br>18. "Hey, I've got reasons for what I'm doing."<br><br>MEANS: what did you catch me at?<br><br>19. "She's one of those rabid feminists."<br><br>MEANS: she refused to make my coffee.<br><br>20. "I heard you."<br><br>MEANS: I haven't the foggiest clue what you just said, and hope I can fake it well enough, so that you don't spend the next three days yelling at me.<br><br>21. "You know I could never love anyone else."<br><br>MEANS: I am used to the way YOU yell at me, and realise it could be worse.<br><br>22. "You really look terrific in that outfit."<br><br>MEANS: Please don't try on one more outfit, I'm starving.<br><br>23. "I brought you a present."<br><br>MEANS: It was free ice scraper on the cover of Man and Motors.<br><br>24. "I missed you."<br><br>MEANS: I can't find my sock drawer, the kids are hungry, and we're out of toilet paper.<br><br>25. "I'm not lost, I know exactly where we are."<br><br>MEANS: No one will ever see us alive again.<br><br>26. "This relationship is getting too serious."<br><br>MEANS: I like you almost as much as I like my car.<br><br>27. "I don't need to read the instructions."<br><br>MEANS: I am perfectly capable of screwing it up without printed help.</div>
