            <div class='col-md body'>There was once a frog who went to a bank to take out a loan.<br><br>He was introduced to the loan officer, Mrs. Patricia Wak.<br><br>He hopped up on her desk and said, "M'am, I really need a loan for $10,000."<br><br>She looked at him incredulously and said, "Sir, I just don't know if I am authorized to give you any loan papers to fill out. I've never had a frog come in to borrow money before."<br><br>He said, "But I've just got to have this money, dear lady. My dad, Mr. Jagger, knows the bank president. I'll bet if you talked to the bank president, he would vouch for me!"<br><br>The loan officer went to see the bank president and told him of the frog on her desk who wanted a loan, and told him of the frog's claims of his father knowing the bank president.<br><br>"Whom did he say that his father was?", asked the bank president.<br><br>The loan officer said, "I think he said a Mr. Jagger."<br><br>The bank president stood up a huff and shook his fingers at the loan officer and said, "Well, knick-knack, Mrs. Patty Wak.....give the frog a loan!! His old man's a Rolling Stone!!"</div>

Lightening struck a sheep, and it fell to the ground with a THUD! The goose shook it's head. Lightening struck a bull and it just shook, but continued munching grass. Again, a sheep was struck, and fall dead. Another bull was hit, and shook and ate. This happened over and over again until the goose waddled over to the bull.<br><br>"What is this all about? How do you get struck and don't die?" asked the goose.<br><br>"You see," said the bull, "We bulls wobble, but they dont' fall down."<br>[/u]</div>
