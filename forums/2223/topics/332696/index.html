              <p>his daughter...</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.jmatson.com/photos/north-col.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="748"></p>
              <p><strong>Rule One:</strong><br> If you pull into my driveway and honk, you'd better be delivering a package, because you're sure not picking anything up.<br> <br> <strong>Rule Two:</strong><br> You do not touch my daughter. You may glance at her, so long as you do
              not peer at anything below her neck. If you cannot keep your eyes or
              hands off of my daughter's body, I will remove them.<br> <br> <strong>Rule Three:</strong><br> I am aware that it is considered fashionable for boys of your age to
              wear their trousers so loosely that they appear to be falling off their
              hips. Please don't take this as an insult, but you and all of your
              friends look like slovenly idiots. Still, I want to be fair and open
              minded about this issue, so I propose his compromise: You may come to
              the door with your underwear showing and your pants ten sizes too big,
              and I will not object. However, in order to ensure that your clothes do
              not, in fact, come off during the course of your date with my daughter,
              I will use my electric nail gun to fasten your trousers securely in
              place to your waist.<br> <br> <strong>Rule Four:</strong><br> I'm sure you've been told that in today's world, sex without utilizing
              a "barrier method" of some kind can kill you. Let me elaborate: when it
              comes to sex with my daughter, I am the barrier, and I will kill you.<br> <br> <strong>Rule Five:</strong><br> In order for us to get to know each other, we should talk about sports,
              politics, and other issues of the day. Please do not do this. The only
              information I require from you is an indication of when you expect to
              have my daughter safely back at my house, and the only word I need from
              you on this subject is "early."<br> <br> <strong>Rule Six:</strong><br> I have no doubt you are a popular fellow, with many opportunities to
              date other girls. This is fine with me as long as it is okay with my
              daughter. Otherwise, once you have gone out with my little girl, you
              will continue to date no one but her until she is finished with you. If
              you make her cry, I will make you cry.<br> <br> <strong>Rule Seven:</strong><br> As you stand in my front hallway, waiting for my daughter to appear,
              and more than an hour goes by, do not sigh and fidget. If you want to
              be on time for the movie, you should not be dating my daughter. She is
              putting on her makeup, a process that can take longer than painting the
              Golden Gate Bridge. Instead of just standing there, why don't you do
              something useful, like changing the oil in my car?<br> <br> <strong>Rule Eight:</strong><br> The following places are not appropriate for a date with my
              daughter:Places where there are beds, sofas, or anything softer than a
              wooden stool. Places where there are no parents, policemen, or nuns
              within eyesight.Places where there is darkness. Places where there is
              dancing, holding hands, or happiness.Places where the ambient
              temperature is warm enough to induce my daughter to wear shorts, tank
              tops, midriff T-shirts, or anything other than overalls, a sweater, and
              a goose down parka zipped up to her throat. Movies with a strong
              romantic or sexual theme are to be avoided. Movies which feature
              chainsaws are okay. Hockey games are okay. Old folks homes are better.<br> <br> <strong>Rule Nine:</strong><br> Do not lie to me. I may appear to be a pot-bellied, balding,
              middle-aged, dim-witted has-been. But on issues relating to my
              daughter, I am the all-knowing, merciless arbiter of your universe. If
              I ask you where you are going and with whom, you have one chance to
              tell me the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I have a
              shotgun, a shovel, and thirty acres behind the barn. Do not trifle with
              me.<br> <br> <strong>Rule Ten:</strong><br> Be afraid. Be very afraid. It takes very little for me to mistake the
              sound of your car in the driveway for a chopper coming in over a rice
              paddy in Vietnam. When my Agent Orange starts acting up, the voices in
              my head frequently tell me to clean my guns as I wait for you to bring
              my daughter home. As soon as you pull into the driveway you should exit
              your car with both hands in plain sight. Speak the perimeter password,
              announce in a clear voice that you have brought my daughter home safely
              and early, then return to your car - there is no need for you to come
              inside. The camouflaged face at the window is mine.<br> <br> Have a nice date with my daughter...</p>
