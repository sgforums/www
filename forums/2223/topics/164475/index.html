            <div class='col-md body'>One day, out in the fields, a farmer was taking a break under a tree as he was tired. As he drifted in and out of sleep, he suddenly felt his straw hat being pulled away from his head.<br><br>He then took a look up the tree and to his suprise, saw a monkey holding his hat.   Therefore, the farmer tried in vain to get the monkey to surrender his straw hat back to him. He tried many actions, swinging his arm to the left, swinging his arms to the right. However, none of this convienced the monkey to return him his hat. The farmer then offered the monkey a banana and the monkey happily took it. While the monkey was busy devouring the banana, the farmer quikly took his hat away from the monkey and laughed at it for being so stupid. He insulted the monkey before going back to doing his chores.<br><br>Years passed, and the old farmer passed down all his skills to his grandson.<br><br>One day, while farming, the grandson was tired, he took a rest at the very same spot where his grandfather lost his straw hat to a monkey. While resting, a monkey stole the young farmers hat. Hoping to use the skills his grandfather taught him, the young farmer tried all soughts of manouvers in vain. As a last resort, he offered a banana to the monkey. The monkey then took the banana with only one hand while its other was clutching on to the hat tightly. As the young farmer tried to grab the hat away from the monkey, the monkey held on to the hat while it threw the banana back at the young farmer. Shocked, the farmer asked himself why did he failed when his grandfather succeeded. Everything his grandfather thought him had work except for this. Why?<br><br>Just then, the monkey exclaimed: "Stupid farmer. You have a grandfather, So do I!"<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>It may not be funny to all. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
