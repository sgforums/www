            <div class='col-md body'>While walking down the street one day, an MP from the People's Action Party<br>(PAP) is tragically hit by a truck and killed. His soul arrives in Heaven<br>and is met by St. Peter at the entrance.<br><br>"Welcome to Heaven," says St. Peter. "Before you settle in, it seems there<br>is a problem. We seldom see a high official around these parts, you see, so<br>we're not sure what to do with you."<br><br>"No problem, just let me in," says the MP.<br><br>"Well, I'd like to, but I have orders from higher up. What we'll do is have<br>you spend one day in Hell and one in Heaven. Then you can choose where to<br>spend eternity."<br><br>"There's no need! I want to be in Heaven," says the MP.<br><br>"I'm sorry, but we have our rules." And with that, St. Peter escorts him to<br>the elevator, the doors open, and he rides the elevator down, down, down.<br>When the doors open again, the MP finds himself in the middle of a beautiful<br>green golf course. In the distance is a club, and standing in front of it<br>are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him. Everyone<br>is very happy and in formal dress. They run to greet him, and they reminisce<br>about the good times they had while getting rich at the expense of the<br>people. They play a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster and<br>caviar.<br><br>Also present is the Devil, who is a very friendly guy who has a good time<br>dancing and telling jokes. They are having such a good time that, before the<br>MP realizes it, it is time to go. Everyone gives him a big hug and waves<br>while the elevator rises. The elevator goes up, up, up, and the door reopens<br>in Heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him.<br><br>So 24 hours pass with the MP joining a group of contented souls moving from<br>cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good time and,<br>before he realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by, and St. Peter returns.<br><br>"Well, you've spent a day in Hell and another in Heaven. Now, you must<br>choose where you want to spend eternity."<br><br>He reflects for a minute and then answers, "Well, I would never would have<br>thought it, I mean Heaven has been delightful, but I think I would be better<br>satisfied in Hell."<br><br>So Saint Peter escorts him to the elevator, and down, down, down he goes<br>into Hell. Now, the doors of the elevator open, and he is in the middle of a<br>barren land covered with waste and garbage. He sees all his friends dressed<br>in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags. And it's hot,<br>hot, hot, and the odor is just horrible. Sweltering hot. Hot and miserable.<br>The Devil comes over to him and smoothly lays his arm around his shoulder.<br><br>"I don't understand," stammers the MP. "The day before I was here, and there<br>was a golf course and club, and we ate lobster and caviar and danced and had<br>a great time. Now all there is is a wasteland full of garbage, and my<br>friends look miserable."<br><br>The Devil looks at the MP, smiles, and says, "Yesterday we were campaigning.<br>Today you voted for us."<br></div>
