            <div class='col-md body'>1. What are you thinking about?<br>2. Do you love me?<br>3. Do I look fat in this?<br>4. Do you think she is prettier than me?<br>5. What would you do if I died?<br><br>What makes these questions so difficult is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument if the man answers incorrectly (i.e., tells the truth). Therefore, as a public service, each question is analyzed below, along with possible responses.<br><br>Question # 1: What are you thinking about? The proper answer to this, of course, is: Â” IÂ’m sorry if IÂ’ve been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, thoughtful, caring, intelligent woman you are, and how lucky I am to have met you.Â” This response obviously bears no resemblance to the true answer, which most likely is one of the following:<br><br>a. Football.<br>b. Golf.<br>c. How fat you are.<br>d. How much prettier she is than you<br>e. How I would spend the insurance money if you died.<br><br>Perhaps the best response to this question was offered by Al Bundy, who once told Peg, Â“If I wanted you to know what I was thinking, I would be talking to you!Â”<br><br>Question # 2: Do you love me? The proper response is: Â“YES!Â” or, if you feel a more detailed answer is in order, Â“Yes, dear.Â”<br><br>Inappropriate responses include:<br>a. Oh Yeah, sh@*-loads.<br>b. Would it make you feel better if I said yes?<br>c. That depends on what you mean by love.<br>d. Does it matter?<br>e. Who, me?<br><br>Question # 3: Do I look fat? The correct answer is an emphatic: Â“Of course not!Â” Among the incorrect answers are:<br><br>a. Compared to what?<br>b. I wouldnÂ’t call you fat, but youÂ’re not exactly thin.<br>c. A little extra weight looks good on you.<br>d. IÂ’ve seen fatter.<br>e. Sorry what did you say? I was just thinking about how I would spend the insurance money if you died.<br><br>Question # 4: Do you think sheÂ’s prettier than me? Once again, the proper response is an emphatic: Â“Of course not!Â” Incorrect responses include:<br><br>a. Yes, but you have a better personality<br>b. Not prettier, but definitely thinner<br>c. Not as pretty as you when you were her age<br>d. Define pretty<br>e. Sorry what did you say ? I was just thinking about how I<br>would spend the insurance money if you died.<br><br>Question # 5: What would you do if I died? A definite no-win question.(The real answer, of course, is Â“Buy a Lotus and a boatÂ”).<br><br>No matter how you answer this, be prepared for at least an hour of follow-up questions, usually along the these lines:<br><br>Woman: Would you get married again?<br>Man: Definitely not!<br><br>Woman: Why not - donÂ’t you like being married?<br>Man: Of course I do.<br><br>Woman: Then why wouldnÂ’t you remarry?<br>Man: Okay, IÂ’d get married again.<br><br>Woman: You would? (with a hurtful look on her face)<br>Man: (makes audible groan)<br><br>Woman: Would you sleep with her in our bed?<br>Man: Where else would we sleep?<br><br>Woman: Would you put away my pictures, and replace them with pictures of her?<br>Man: That would seem like the proper thing to do.<br><br>Woman: And would you let her use my golf clubs?<br>Man: She canÂ’t use them; sheÂ’s left-handed.<br>Woman: - - - silence - - -<br>Man: S H I TÂ…</div>
