              <p><br> Saddam Hussein and Bill Clinton meet up in Baghdad for the first round
              of talks in a new peace process. When Bill sits down, he notices three
              buttons on the side of Saddam's chair. They begin talking. <br> <br> After about five minutes Saddam presses the first button. A boxing
              glove springs out of a box on the desk and punches Clinton in the face.
              Confused, Clinton carries on talking as Saddam laughs. <br> <br> A few minutes later the second button is pressed. This time a big boot
              comes out and kicks Clinton in the shin. Again Saddam laughs, and again
              Clinton carries on talking, not wanting to put off the bigger issue of
              peace between the two countries. <br> <br> But when the third button is pressed and another boot comes out and
              kicks Clinton in the privates, he's finally had enough, knowing that he
              can't do much without them functioning well. <br> <br> "I'm going back home!" he tells the Iraqi. "We'll finish these talks in two weeks!"<br> A fortnight passes and Saddam flies to the United States for talks. As
              the two men sit down, Hussein notices three buttons on Clinton's chair
              and prepares himself for the Yank's revenge. <br> <br> They begin talking and Bill presses the first button. Saddam ducks, but nothing happens. Clinton snickers. <br> <br> A few seconds later he presses the second button. Saddam jumps up, but again nothing happens. Clinton roars with laughter. <br> <br> When the third button is pressed, Saddam jumps up again, and again
              nothing happens. Clinton falls on the floor in a fit of hysterics. <br> <br> "Forget this," says Saddam. "I'm going back to Baghdad!" <br> <br> Clinton says through tears of laughter, "What Baghdad?"</p>

              <p>President Clinton wakes up to a beautiful winter morning. The sun is
              shining, the air is crisp, and there is a light blanket of snow on the
              ground. He stretches and goes to look out the window at the
              snow-covered WhiteHouse lawn and sees the words "President Clinton
              sucks" written in pee in the snow. <br> <br> Clinton gets all upset and calls White House Security. He tells them he
              doesn't care what it takes but he wants to know who did this. The Chief
              of Security returns in a couple of days to the President and tells him
              that he has good news, bad news, and real bad news.<br> <br> "OK," says Clinton, "give me the good news first, then the bad news, and then the real bad news." <br> <br> The Chief says: "The good news is after taking analysis of the pee, we
              know who the culprit is." Clinton nods and the Chief continues: "The
              bad news is the culprit is Vice President Gore." This really upsets the
              President, but he controls his anger and asks the Chief to tell him the
              real bad news.<br> <br> The Chief of Security swallows and says, "It's in Hilary's hand writing".</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;">A man went on a business to China and wanted to buy some
              gifts for his kids. He went to a shop and found a nice looking CD
              player. Wary of buying inferior goods, he asked the shopkeeper, 'What
              would happen if this does not work?'<br> <br> The shopkeeper quietly points to the only sign in English that reads, 'GUARANTEE NO SPOILT'.<br> <br> Feeling assured, he paid for the CD player and returns to his hotel. He
              tried to use the CD player after returning to the hotel but it would
              not even switch on.<br> <br> He quickly return to the shop and asked for a refund or an exchange for
              another unit. When the shopkeeper refuse to give either, the man points
              to the sign assuring him of a guarantee.<br> <br> The shopkeeper then said, 'Brother, you are in China . We read from the right to the left.</span></p>

              <p><br> This useful tool is commonly found in the range of 8 inches long, the
              functioning of which is enjoyed by members of both sexes. It is usually
              found hung, dangling loosely, ready for instant action. It boasts of a
              clump of little hairy things at one end and a small hole at the other.<br> <br> In use, it is inserted, almost always willingly, sometimes slowly,
              sometimes quickly, into a warm, fleshy, moist opening where it is
              thrust in and drawn out again and again many times in succession, often
              quickly and accompanied by squirming bodily movements.<br> <br> Anyone found listening in will most surely recognize the rhythmic,
              pulsing sound, resulting from the well lubricated movements. When
              finally withdrawn, it leaves behind a juicy, frothy, sticky white
              substance, some of which will need cleaning from the outer surfaces of
              the opening and some of from its long glistening shaft.<br> <br> After everything is done and the flowing and cleansing liquids have
              ceased emanating, it is returned to its freely hanging state of rest,
              ready for yet another bit of action, hopefully reaching its bristling
              climax twice or three times a day, but often much less. Ah yes, such
              are the characteristics of one's toothbrush!</p>
