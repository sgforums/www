              <div class="section_blog_post_content">Timeline : Period of Increasing Fuel Hike<br>Scenario : Govt Cost-Cutting Measures<br>RPG Character : Minister<br><br>Ouch! 10% cut in my <strong>RM 12,320</strong> monthly entertainment allowance???? The PM can't be serious, is he? That means I'm going to lose RM 1,232 in monthly <strong>Entertainment Allowance</strong>. Oh well, there goes the tips for all those waiters and waitress. Sheesh ... what am I going to do with my remaining  <strong>RM 11,088 Entertainment Allowances</strong>???  Where got enough like that? <br><br>And the ungrateful public is still angry. What are they angry for? Paying 70cents extra for a litre of petrol is nothing la.  How much they pay extra? Assuming their travelling cost is about RM 350 per month, 37% means only an increase of about RM 130 in monthly fuel expenditure. I'm already suffering over RM 1k in Entertainment Allowance cut, you know.<br><br>Somemore, now cannot go overseas for holiday. So who says the Government Ministers not understanding towards the people suffering? The Government is very fair one la. If the people's quality of living drops as a result of the fuel hike, we ministers oso suffer drop in living quality also mah.<br><br>You seriously don't believe we are serious about cutting cost ah? Wait ah - [ Pick up the phone and call Personal Assistant ]<br><br>"Eh, Ah Kow - you go tell all the departmental heads in this ministry ah, from today onwards we need to cut at least 10% in department expenses ah. Have to start saving ah - show leadership by example. For starters ah, cut down the number of cleaners and tea-ladies. No need 10 people to clean one toilet. Also ah, cut down tea-servings from 5 times a day to 4 lah, ok. But kari-paps still necessary la - we still must keep the staff happy a bit.<br><br>Keep the status quo on aircond and lighting la. Too hot, how to work right? Also ah - tell all the departmental heads to restrict dept lunch to once a week ok. No need to celebrate everyone's birthday everyday one la. We must be efficient today onwards. Also from now onwards, instead of using departmental funding , collect donations from staff to buy gifts for staff birthday ok. As  for my birthday gift, no need so expensive wan la. Most of the things I got already - sommore mine is better quality than what you guys can get me - so something few hundred ringgit cukup la -  no need to go into thousands. But make sure this comes out in the dept newsletter ah - show people that I'm making an effort to save taxpayers money too. Ok .. start with this first la. See can save 10% or not. I think 10% really too much la, but what to do? Citizens suffer, we must also show them we are suffering too la." *End of Conversation*<br><br>There! See, don't say I don't save money ah. Wait another minute ah. [ Pick up the phone and call another Personal Assistant ] <br><br>"Eh Ah Bu, tell my driver get ready ah. Got lunch meeting with important people at the club la. Make sure he fill up the Mercz full tank ah and get the departmental car washer to make sure its really clean first ok."<br><br>Luckily that one Govt still pay. Can't imagine if  petrol oso come out from my pay. I only earn about RM 15000 monthly only la. Can't even buy big bungalow leh. You think we are really earning a lot ah? And my car is 2 years old already la. Now with the new policy, there goes my dream of getting a new car la. Suffer teruk teruk la. Even some of my businessman friends are laughing at me la. <br><br>So, to all you people who claim the Govt don't understand your sufferings, we do. We feel it from the bottom of our heart. You pay more for fuel, we enjoy less every month. Both oso suffer kao kao, ok . So please please, stop your calls for Minister salary to be cut ok. I also have big family to feed just like you. Piano and violin lessons also very expensive these days. So, lets all be patient and get through these tough times together ok. Don't forget to vote for me in your next election ah. I will continue to do my best for the interest of this country and the people of Malaysia!<br></div>
