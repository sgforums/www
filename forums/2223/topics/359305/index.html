              <p>A woman came up behind her husband while he was enjoying his morning
                  coffee and slapped him on the back of the head. "I found a piece of
                  paper in your pants pocket with the name 'Marylou' written on it," she
                  said, furious. "You had better have an explanation." "Calm down,
                  honey," the man replied. "Remember last week when I was at the dog
                  track? That was the name of the dog I bet on. "The next morning, his
                  wife snuck up on him and smacked him again." What was that for?" he
                  complained. "Your dog called last night."</p>

              <p>A man is so proud of his wife for having nine kids that he keeps calling her mother of nine.<br>But his wife hates it.  One day when they're at a party and getting ready to leave, the man says to his wife:<br>"Ready to go mother of nine?"<br>That was the last straw for his wife.  She replied:<br>"You bet father of three."</p>

              <p>Bribe and Groom <br><br>During the wedding rehearsal, the groom approached the pastor with an unusual offer:<br>"Look,
                  I''ll give you $100 if you''ll change the wedding vows. When you get to
                  the part where I''m supposed to promise to ''love, honor and obey'' and
                  ''be faithful to her forever,'' I''dappreciate it if you''d just leave
                  that out." <br><br>He passed the minister a $100 bill and walked away
                  satisfied. On the day of the wedding, when it came time for the
                  groom''s vows, the pastor looked the young man in the eye and said:<br><br>"Will
                  you promise to prostrate yourself before her, obey her every command
                  and wish, serve her breakfast in bed every morning of your life, and
                  swear eternally before God and your lovely wife that you will not ever
                  even look at another woman, as long as you both shall live?"<br><br>The
                  groom gulped and looked around, and said in a tiny voice, "Yes," then
                  leaned toward the pastor and hissed: "I thought we had a deal."<br><br>The pastor put a $100 bill into the groom''s hand and whispered: "She made me a better offer."</p>

              <p>A lawyer defending a man accused of burglary tried this creative defense: <br><br>"My
                  client merely inserted his arm into the window and removed a few
                  trifling articles. His arm is not himself, and I fail to see how you
                  can punish the whole individual for an offense committed by his limb." <br><br>"Well
                  put," the judge replied. "Using your logic, I sentence the defendant's
                  arm to one year's imprisonment. He can accompany it or not, as he
                  chooses." <br><br>The defendant smiled. With his lawyer's assistance he detached his artificial limb, laid it on the bench, and walked out.</p>
