              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Very Shocking!                                                             <br> This is a real story of a young college girl who passed away last month in <br> Pasir Ris .                                                                 <br> <br> Her name was Priya.. She was hit by a truck.                               <br> <br> She was working in a call center. She had a boy friend named Shankar .      <br> <br> Both of them were true lovers. They always talked on the phone.            <br> <br> You would never find her without handphone.. In fact she also changed her  <br> cell connection from M-One to Starhub, so that both of them can be on the  <br> same network, and save on the cost.                                        <br> She used to spend half of the day talking with shankar .                    <br> Priya's family knew about their relationship. . Shankar was very close to  <br> Priya's family as well. (Just imagine their love) .                        <br> Before she passed away she always told her friends 'If I pass away please  <br> burn me with my handphone' she also said the same thing to her parents.    <br> After her death, people cld'nt carry her body, A lot of them tried to do   <br> so,but still can't. Everybody had tried to carry the body, the results     <br> were the same.                                                             <br> Eventually, they called a person known to one of their neighbours, who can <br> speak with the soul of dead person and who was a friend of her father.     <br> He took a stick and started speaking to himself slowly.                    <br> After a few minutes, he said 'this girl misses something here.' Then her   <br> friends told that person about her intentions to burn her with her phone.  <br> <br> He then opened the grave box and place her phone and sim card inside the   <br> casket. After that they tried to carry the body. It was then moved easily  <br> and they then carried her into the van.                                    <br> All of us were shocked. Priya's parents did not inform Shankar that Priya  <br> had passed away..                                                          <br> <br> After 2 weeks Shankar called Priya's mom.                                  <br> <br> Shankar :.....'Aunty, I'm coming home today. Cook something nice for me.   <br> <br> Don't tell Priya that I'm coming home today, I wanna surprise her.'        <br> <br> Her mother replied, 'You come home first, I wanna tell you something very  <br> important.'                                                                <br> After he came, they told him the truth about Priya.                        <br> Shankar thinks that they were playing a fool. He was laughing and said     <br> 'don't try to fool me - tell Priya to come out, i have a gift for her.     <br> Please stop this nonsense.'                                                <br> Then they show him the original death certificate to him.                  <br> They gave him proof to make him believe. ( Shankar started to sweat) He     <br> said, 'Its not true. We spoke yesterday. She still calls me.'              <br> <br> Shankar was shaking.                                                       <br> Suddenly, Shankar 's phone rang. 'see this is from Priya, see this....' he  <br> showed the phone to priya's family. All of them told him to answer. He     <br> talked using the loudspeaker mode.                                         <br> All of them heard his conversation.                                        <br> Loud and clear, no cross lines, no humming.                                <br> It is the actual voice of Priya &amp; there is no way others could use her sim <br> card since it is nailed inside the grave box.                              <br> <br> They were so shocked and asked for the same person's                       <br> (who can speak with the soul of deal persons) help again. He brought his   <br> master to solve this matter.                                               <br> <br> He &amp; his master worked for 5 hours.                                        <br> <br> Then they discovered one thing which really shocked them.                  <br> <br> <br> Starhub has the best coverage                                              <br> "Wherever you go, our network follows." </span></p>
