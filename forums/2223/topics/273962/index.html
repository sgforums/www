            <div class='col-md body'>Once, the people of the city invited Mulla Nasruddin to deliver a speech. When he got on the minbar (pulpit), he found the audience was not very enthusiastic, so he asked "Do you know what I am going to say?" The audience replied "NO", so he announced "I have no desire to speak to people who don't even know what I will be talking about" and he left. The people felt embarrassed and called him back again the next day. This time when he asked the same question, the people replied "YES" So Mullah Nasruddin said, "Well, since you already know what I am going to say, I won't waste any more of your time" and he left. Now the people were really perplexed. They decided to try one more time and once again invited the Mullah to speak the following week. Once again he asked the same question - "Do you know what I am going to say?" Now the people were prepared and so half of them answered "YES" while the other half replied "NO". So Mullah Nasruddin said "The half who know what I am going to say, tell it to the other half" and he left!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A man is driving down a deserted stretch of highway when he notices a sign out of the corner of his eye which reads:<br><br>SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION 10 MILES<br><br>He thinks it was a figment of his imagination and he drives on without second thought, but soon he sees another sign, which says:<br><br>SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION 5 MILES<br><br>He begins to think that these signs are for real, when he drives past a third sign saying:<br><br>SISTERS OF ST.FRANCIS HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION NEXT RIGHT<br><br>His curiosity gets the best of him and he pulls into the drive. On the far side of the parking lot is a stone building with a small sign next to the door reading:<br><br>SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS.<br><br>He climbs the steps and rings the bell. The door is answered by a nun in a long black habit who asks, "What may we do for you, my son?"<br><br>He answers, "I saw your signs along the highway, and was interested in possibly doing business."<br><br>"Very well, my son. Please follow me."<br><br>The man is led through many winding passages and is soon quite disoriented. The nun stops at a closed door and tells the man, "Please knock on this door."<br><br>He does as he is told and another nun in a long habit, holding a tin cup answers the door. This nun instructs, "Please place $100 in the cup, then go through the large wooden door at the end of this hallway."<br><br>He gets $100 out of his wallet and places it in the second nuns cup.<br><br>He trots eagerly down the hall and slips through the door, pulling it shut behind him. As the door locks behind him, he finds himself back in the parking lot, facing another small sign:<br><br>GO IN PEACE.<br>YOU HAVE JUST BEEN SCREWED BY THE SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS.<br>SERVES YOU RIGHT, YOU SINNER</div>
