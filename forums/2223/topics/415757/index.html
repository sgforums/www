              <p>An 18 year old Italian girl tells her Mom that she has missed her period
               for 2 months. Very worried, the mother goes to the drug store and buys a
               pregnancy kit.<br>The test result shows that the girl is pregnant! 
              Shouting, cursing, crying, the mother says, "Who was the pig that did 
              this to you? I want to know!"<br>The girl picks up the phone and makes a
               call. Half an hour later, a Ferrari stops in front of their house. A 
              mature and distinguished man with gray hair and impeccably dressed in an
               Armani suit steps out of the of the Ferrari and enters the house.<br>He
               sits in the living room with the father, mother, and the girl and tells
               them: "Good morning; your daughter has informed me of the problem. I 
              can't marry her because of my personal family situation but I'll take 
              charge. I will pay all costs and provide for your daughter for the rest 
              of her life.<br>Additionally, if a girl is born, I will bequeath a 
              Ferrari, a beach house, 2 retail stores, a townhouse, a beachfront 
              villa, and a $2,000,000 bank account.<br>If a boy is born, my legacy 
              will be two factories and a $4,000,000 bank account. If twins, they each
               will receive a factory and $2,000,000.<br>However, if there is a 
              miscarriage, what do you suggest I do?" At this point, the father, who 
              had remained silent, places a hand firmly on the man's shoulder and 
              tells him, "You fark her again."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <div class="picTitle" style="text-align: center;"></div>
              <p>Two women were playing 
              golf. One teed off and watched in horror as her ball headed directly 
              toward a foursome of men playing the next hole. The ball hit one of the 
              men. He immediately clasped his hands together at his groin, fell to the
               ground and proceeded to roll around in agony.<br>The woman rushed down to the man, and immediately began to apologize.<br>'Please allow me to help. I'm a Physical Therapist and I know I could relieve your pain if you'd allow me', she told him.<br>'Oh,
               no, I'll be all right. I'll be fine in a few minutes,' the man replied.
               He was in obvious agony, lying in the fetal position, still clasping 
              his hands together at his groin. At her persistence, however, he finally
               allowed her to help.<br>She gently took his hands away and laid 
              them to the side, loosened his pants and put her hands inside. She 
              administered tender and artful massage for several long moments and 
              asked,'How does that feel'?<br>He replied: 'It feels great, but I still think my thumb's broken.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Three women die together in an accident and go to heaven.<br>When they get there, St. Peter says, 'We only have one rule here in heaven: don't step on the ducks!' <br>So they enter heaven, and sure enough, there are ducks all over the place.<br>It
               is almost impossible not to step on a duck, and although they try their
               best to avoid them, the first woman accidentally steps on one.<br>Along comes St. Peter with the ugliest man she ever saw.<br>St. Peter chains them together and says, 'Your punishment for stepping on a duck is to spend eternity chained to this ugly man!'<br>The
               next day, the second woman accidentally steps on a duck and along comes
               St. Peter, who doesn't miss a thing. With him is another extremely ugly
               man. He chains them together with the same admonishment as for the 
              first woman.<br>The third woman has observed all this and, not 
              wanting to be chained for all eternity to an ugly man, is very, VERY 
              careful where she steps.<br> She manages to go months without 
              stepping on any ducks, but one day St. Peter comes up to her with the 
              most handsome man she has ever laid eyes on ... very tall, long 
              eyelashes, muscular, and thin.<br>St. Peter chains them together without saying a word.<br>The happy woman says, 'I wonder what I did to deserve being chained to you for all of eternity?' <br>The guy says, 'I don't know about you, but I stepped on a duck!'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A woman takes a lover home during the day while her husband is at work.<br>Her 9-year old son comes home unexpectedly, sees them and hides in the bedroom closet to watch.<br>The woman's husband also comes home. She puts her lover in the closet, not realizing that the little boy is in there already.<br>The little boy says, 'Dark in here.'<br>The man says, 'Yes, it is.'<br>Boy: 'I have a baseball.'<br>Man: 'That's nice'<br>Boy: 'Want to buy it?'<br>Man: 'No, th! anks.'<br>Boy: 'My Dad's outside.'<br>Man: 'OK, how much?'<br>Boy: '$250'<br>In the next few weeks, it happens again that the boy and the lover are in the closet together.<br>Boy: 'Dark in here.'<br>Man: 'Yes, it is.'<br>Boy: 'I have a baseball glove.'<br>The lover, remembering the last time, asks the boy, 'How much?'<br>Boy: '$750'<br>Man: 'Sold.'<br>A few! days later, the Dad says to the boy, 'Grab your glove, let's go outside and have a game of catch.'<br>The boy says, 'I can't, I sold my baseball and my glove.'<br>The Dad asks, 'How much did you sell them for?'<br>Boy: '$1,000'<br>The
               Dad says, 'That's terrible to over charge your friends like that...that
               is way more than those two things cost. I'm taking you to church, to 
              confession.'<br>They go to the church and the Dad makes the little boy sit in the confessional booth and closes the door.<br>The boy says, 'Dark in here.'<br>The priest says, 'Don't start that shit again; you're in my closet now.'</p>
