              <p>Two men, one American and an Indian were sitting in a bar drinking shot 
              after shot.<br><br>The Indian man said to the American, 'You know my 
              parents are forcing me to get married to this so called homely girl from
               a village whom I haven't even met once.' We call this arranged 
              marriage. I don't want to marry a woman whom I don't love... I told them
               that openly and now have a hell lot of family problems.'<br><br>The 
              American said, talking about love marriages... I'll tell you my story. I
               married a widow whom I deeply loved and dated for 3 years. 'After a 
              couple of years, my father fell in love with my step-daughter and 
              married her, so my father became my son-in-law and I became my father's 
              father-in-law.<br><br>Legally now my daughter is my mother and my wife 
              my grandmother. More problems occurred when I had a son. My son is my 
              father's brother and so he is my uncle.<br><br>Situations turned worse 
              when my father had a son. Now my father's son, my brother is my 
              grandson. Ultimately, I have become my own grand father and I am my own 
              grandson.. And you say you have family problems...<br><br>The Indian 
              fainted….</p>
