              <p>All the women in this village likes to commit adultery behind their husbands' backs. And they like to gossip about it. But they can't mention adultery, so they thought up of another name for it. They call it "fall down".</p>
              <p>So they will talk among themselves and share their experience. "I fell down 3 times yesterday!", "Oh really? I fell down a total of 5 times in one night!", blah blah blah.</p>
              <p>But these ladies felt guilty, so they will go to their village's church to tell the priest of their sins. They will tell the priest how they "fell down" and so on. So after some time, even the priest also know the true meaning behind "falling down". But one day, the priest was transferred to another church and a new priest came.</p>
              <p>The new priest didn't understand anything about "falling down", so he was confused. So he went to check out the village and realised the pavements are indeed quite rough. He went to find the village leader. The priest told him: "All the ladies in your village are frequently falling down, I think it's time you repair your village's pavement."</p>
              <p>The leader knew what was "falling down", and so he chuckled and told the priest: "We are a little short on cash, once we have money, we will mend the roads."</p>
              <p>It has been a month and the new priest still has ladies telling him that they are "falling down" everyday. He went to find the village leader again. "Why haven't you repair the roads, ladies are still falling down everyday!" he said angrily.</p>
              <p>"Even if you don't care about your villagers, at least you should care about your wife! She told me she fell down thrice yesterday!"</p>

              <p>Another joke here, I think I just post here la. Quite lame to create another thread for it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>There's this couple, they have a son and a daughter. They were very happy about it and decided two kids is enough. But somehow, they got themselves another kid. It's a boy.</p>
              <p>It has been one year, but the third child just isn't opening his mouth to call his mom or dad. They thought this was very weird. He should at least have made some noise. So they decided to consult a doctor. The doctor told the couple he couldn't tell what's wrong with the kid. "His voice box is normal, probably he just doesn't want to talk." The doctor said.</p>
              <p>Since a doctor couldn't help them, they went to find a fortune-teller. After the fortune-teller inspected the kid, he looked scared. He shivered and said: "This child's mouth is very very poisonous. Whoever's name is called, he or she will die the next day."</p>
              <p>"You should thank god he isn't talking, otherwise your lives might be at risk." the fortune-teller continued.</p>
              <p>The couple didn't know what to do. They don't bear to abandon the kid, so they decided to keep him, but they pray day and night that the kid won't start talking.</p>
              <p>A few months passed. The kid was playing his elder brother and sister. "Brother!" the kid called. The very next day, his brother passed away indeed. The couple were so afraid, but there's nothing they can do about it.</p>
              <p>The next day, he called for his elder sister too, and she too died the next day. This seems like the end for the couple. Very soon, the kid even called: "Papa!"</p>
              <p>"I'm so sorry dear, I'll be gone tomorrow. Seems like this is the last day we will spend together." the husband told his wife.</p>
              <p>The next day, the husband woke up to find that he's still alive. "Hmm, that's weird. I should be dead by now." he thought to himself.</p>
              <p>Then he heard news from his neighbours, the uncle living next to them was found dead in the morning...</p>

              <p>Alright, another joke. Hijack my own thread. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>John is a useless guy. He always gets a scolding by his wife. His wife thinks he's useless, can't earn money and can't satisfy her sexual desire. So one day, John couldn't take it anymore. He decided to leave his family in search of a good job. He thought he might as well make it rich and go home to show his wife he's not useless</p>
              <p>Half a year has passed and he's still poor. He only has $3000 of savings. He felt dejected and decided to go home. On the way home he saw a doctor selling "viagra".</p>
              <p>"Come over to take a look! This is an amazing drug!" the doctor said.</p>
              <p>So John went over for a look. He thought: "If I can't be rich, at least let me satisfy my wife's sexual desires."</p>
              <p>He asked for the price of the pills and he got a shock. It's $1000 for one pill and must purchase three pills minimum. That's his $3000 savings gone. But he has decided to buy it. He then consulted the doctor on the usage of the pills.</p>
              <p>"After taking the pill, make the "WOOO~!" sound and your dick will stand. After you are done, make the "SHHH~!" sound and it will go down. Try it!" the doctor told John. So John excitedly took out one pill to try it, and it worked! But that's one pill wasted. Now he has to be careful with the remaining two pills.</p>
              <p>He took the train back to his hometown. Before boarding the train, he was simply too overexcited. So he took one pill first and anticipated going home to satisfy his wife. But alas! The train whistled and went "WOOO~! WOOO~!" when it was leaving the station. His dick started standing. Everyone was looking at him and he felt embarrassed. So he said "SHHH~!" to make it go down. That's two pills down, one last pill to go. He can't waste it now.</p>
              <p>He made it home and he was standing at the entrance of his house. He wanted to give his wife a big surprise and so he took the final pill and said "WOOO~!" himself to make his dick stand.</p>
              <p>His wife opened the door, saw him, and said: "So it's you! <span style="color: #ff0000;">SHHH!</span> The kids are asleep!" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
