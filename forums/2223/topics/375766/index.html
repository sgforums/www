            <div class='col-md body'><p><span style="font-family: Verdana; line-height: 18px; font-size: 12px;">Jesus had a little sit-down with his disciples. It was story time. <br><br><br>"When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left." <br><br>"Hah! Good place for the goats, on the left!" said Judas. The other disciples told him to shut up. <br><br>"Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me." <br><br>Judas nudged the disciple next to him. "Right, like a king would ever be hungry, sick or naked. They have PEOPLE to do that FOR them." The disciple ignored him as Jesus continued. <br><br>"Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?' The King will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.'" <br><br>Judas stood up and raised his hand. "Whoa there, Jesus. Hold on a second. Who's supposed to PAY for all this food and drink and clothing and medicine? US?" <br><br>The other disciples tugged at Judas' robe and told him to sit down. "OK, maybe he'll get to that later," Judas said. "I mean, this GUY and his STORIES!" <br><br>Jesus continued. <br><br>"Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.'" <br><br>"Swell, here it comes," Judas muttered. "The old liberal guilt trip..." <br><br>"They also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?' He will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.' Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life." <br><br>Judas jumped to his feet. "What a bunch of socialist CRAP! You want US to give OUR money, OUR food, OUR clothes to these SLACKERS? You want US to pay for HEALTH CARE for people who are obviously too LAZY to get a job like GROWNUPS and pay for their OWN health care?" <br><br>The other disciples tried to shush him, but Judas continued. <br><br>"I mean, JESUS! Do you realize how HARD we have to work for every shekel and drachma?" He pulled a 20-shekel note from his pocket and waved it at Jesus. "Here, Jesus! You wanna come steal my hard earned money? COME TAKE IT! If these "brothers" of yours -- wink, wink -- had an ounce of GUMPTION or WORK ethic, they'd HAVE their own food, their own drink, their own clothes, their own health care, and they for DAMN sure wouldn't be in PRISON in the FIRST place..." <br><br>Jesus held up his hand to silence the uproar and repeated. <br><br>"I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.'" <br><br>"Socialist, Communist, Fascist bullshit," Judas said. "You keep preaching that kind of stuff and watch what happens. Now if you don't mind, there are some folks I gotta see about a job that will pay 30 pieces of silver -- in ACTUAL MONEY that I will EARN! Later, 'Comrades.'" <br><br>Judas stalked away towards the high priest's residence. <br><br>Jesus wept. <br></span></p></div>

              <p>Cannot, because human are bound by belonging, aetheist by itself is a religion whereby one think he belongs to it. For centuries, religious had controlled peoples with velvet gloves covering those sinful hands. Many had lost their lives just because of their believing. As we are bound to belonging, some people took advantage of it and become great man and woman out of nothing. The Communist outcasted religions altogether because they understand the impact of it, and at the end, Communist become their religion, they worshipped their leaders and that prove that humans cannot be alone, they need belonging and someone to pull by their nose.</p>

              Just carry on your ways besides we only got a lifetime. Have fun, enjoy life don't waste time mocking figures that you know nothing of. Death catch us all and it never miss. Don't pretend you know everything when in fact you know nothing. Count your days and use them as best as you could. You that doesn't even know for sure what you're going to have on your plate tomorrow or know how many string of hair on your head at the moment can't possibly knows the truth on life.

              Nobody knows and seen everything. Reality is merely our perception of the immediate world which surround us. How can you be so sure of your conviction of the truth? Or do you claim to have seen beyond life? Or are you living your conviction simply by making assumptions?

              <p><br> Thomas Paine said it very well, except that the parody in the
                  thread is not religious in any form nor to mock the religious
                  figure. </p>
              <p>It was an attack on the conscience of the entrenched Right Wing
                  in the politics of the USA in the current heated and confused
                  debate on the changes proposed for their broken Health Care
                  system.</p>
              <p>This parody was made in reaction to the racist and
                  illogical outburst of the Right Wing to the Health Care changes
                  that were proposed by Obama, when the Right Wing had ignored all
                  the sensibilities of the proposed changes but prefer to indulge in
                  fear mongering and distortion that fired up the worst fears simply
                  to protect the status quo for some hidden interests and
                  agendas.</p>

              <p>Yeap, unfortunately, some people are just too fixated on the "religious" side of things to not see what the real context of the article was about.</p>
              <p>Still, its also an offensive on the conservative right Christians.  Using passages from the Bible contextualized in the political situation.  It's pretty slick yes.  </p>
