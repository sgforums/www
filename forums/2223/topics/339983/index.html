              possessed incredibly long, oversized penises. "How do you account for

"Your father's the reason for your elongated penises?"<br> <br> "No sir, our mother."<br> <br> "Your mother? You idiot, women don't have penises!"<br> <br> "I know, sir," replied the recruit, "But she only had one arm, and when

              <p>It was a warm, sunny Sunday, so a man and his wife decided to take in
              the zoo. They spent the day, and at closing time they walked past the
              gorilla cage, and the man noticed the gorilla looking at his wife. <br> <br> "That gorilla is getting excited just looking at your tits," he said.
              "Why don't you take your blouse off and we'll see what he does?" <br> <br> At first she declined. But finally persuaded by her husband, she took off her blouse and bra. <br> <br> The gorilla went nuts. He started grunting and jumping up and down. <br> <br> "Hey," the husband said, "let's really blow his mind. Take off all your clothes and we'll see what he does." <br> <br> Again she said no and again he persuaded her. <br> <br> This time the ape really went bananas! He climbed up and down the bars,
              did flips, ran around in circles and tossed his food all over the cage.
              <br> <br> The husband went over to the cage, opened the door and pushed his wife
              in. "Now," said the husband with an evil smile, "tell HIM you have a
              headache!"</p>

              dangerous and get down on their stomachs and crawl towards it, dodging

              finally comes out with his trousers round his ankles and sweat pouring
              off his forehead.<br> <br> His partner says to him -"Fuckin Hell! What took you so long? You were gone for an hour!!"<br> <br> The soldier replies -"You wouldn't believe it! I went in there to take
              a shit and I saw this girl so I walked over to her and started fucking
              her! My God she was brilliant, I fucked her in every room, in every

              appeared to be in good health, they were concerned about his rather

That should solve the problem.' <br> <br> The next morning when the boy arrived at breakfast, there was a large stack of warm pan cakes in the middle of the table. <br> <br> 'Gee, Mom,' he exclaimed. 'For me?' <br> <br> 'Just take two,' Brenda replied . 'The rest are for your father.</p>

              bravery of their own soldiers.<br> <br> The Pres. of USA said, "let me show u what is guts", where upon he
              called his Colonel and said "Jump into the sea and swim 3 rounds around
              this ship!". The Colonel replied "Anything for Uncle Sam, Sir", jumped
              into the shark infested sea and swam 3 rounds around the ship, with the
              sharks chasing him like mad! After the successful 3 rounds, the Colonel
              came up to the deck and said, "I did it for Uncle Sam Mr. President!".
              The proud US President replied "That's what I call guts!".<br> <br> The Prime Minister of UK was pissed. He had to show. He called his
              3-star General and said "General, jump into the sea and swim 10 rounds
              around This ship!". The General replied "Anything for the Queen, Sir",
              jumped into the shark infested sea and swam 10 rounds around the ship,
              with the sharks chasing him like gila!(lunatic). After the successful
              10 rounds the 3-star General came up to the deck and said, "Long Live
              the Queen!". The proud UK PM replied "That's what I call guts!"<br> <br> The Prime Minister of Singapore cannot tahan. He had to show that his<br> soldiers have it too. He called one of his Private, Ah Beng and said
              "Soldier, jump into the sea and swim 50 rounds around this ship!".<br> The Private replied "Oi, you siao(crazy) izzit? I juz bought my condo
              and I Am paying through my nose. Now, U want me to jump and die? If u
              want to Hao lian (show off), you jump into the sea yourself !
              @#*&amp;%F!........<br> The Singapore PM grinned and said "Now,that's what I call guts!"</p>

              man is sitting at the bar in his local tavern, furiously imbibing shots

              over fifteen years, and I've never seen you take a drink before. What's
              going on?"<br> <br> Without even taking his eyes off his newly filled shot glass, the man replies, "My wife just ran off with my best friend."<br> <br> He then throws back another shot of whisky in one gulp.<br> <br> "But," says the other man, "I'm your best friend!"<br> <br> The man turns to his friend, looks at him through bloodshot eyes, smiles, and then slurs, "Not anymore!...
