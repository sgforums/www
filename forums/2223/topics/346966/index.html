              <p>During his tour of duty in Iraq, a rookie soldier was given the day off to relax in the nearby town. Having not had a beer for quite sometime, he over-indulged himself at the bar longer than he had planned. He suddenly realised that he was about to miss the book-in time when he saw the sun setting. He jumped outta his stool and ran for his life back to his camp.</p>
              <p>Having forgotten his watch, he had no idea how close he was to the stipulated timing given by his officer until he ran into an old man puffing his pipe sitting by the rocking chair with his camel outside his house.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Soldier:</span> Excuse me sir can i know the time now?</p>
              <p>The old man got up lazily from his chair, moved towards his camel,  squatted down and roamed his hands around the belly.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Old man:</span> 6.47pm son.... and you had better hurry before the gates close at 7pm</p>
              <p>Thinking that the old man was crazy, he didn't think much about it and continued running as he is aware with the daily PT, the camp is just another 10mins away and judging by the sun set he may just make it.</p>
              <p>He finally made it back to camp at 6.57pm. After catching his breath, he thought about his experience and realised that the old man and the camel may be for real and decide to test the camel again the next day.</p>
              <p>He went to the old man the next morning with his watch this time and asked for the time again. The old man repeat the ritual of squatting by the camel and roamed his hands around the belly.... " 8.04am son.... haven't you got a watch?"</p>
              <p>Realised that he has strucked gold, the soldier ran back to camp gathered all the money he could and rushed straight back to the old man thinking of how he will market the <span style="font-weight: bold;">"time telling camel back home"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Soldier:</span> Hey old man, here's US$10,000 and i want your camel</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Oldman</span>: Wow thats alot for an old camel son, but if you insist.... its a deal....</p>
              <p>After the exchange...</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Soldier</span>: hey man you haven't taught me how to read the time with the camel...</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Old man:</span> What? he ain't tell no time...</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Soldier</span>: but.. but... whats with the carassing of the belly and telling the exact time?</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Old man</span>: carassing the belly? tell the time? Hell no.... i was just lifting its belly so i can see the clock tower across the street.....</p>
