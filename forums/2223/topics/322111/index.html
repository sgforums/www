              <p>The following exchanges occurred on the original United States
              "Hollywood Squares" TV game show, when the questions indisputably were
              designed to provoke comic responses, but the responses themselves were
              spontaneous, rather than scripted as they are in today's version of the
              show. The show featured various celebrities of the day.</p>
