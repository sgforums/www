If it comes out of the ground easily, it is a valuable plant.<br><br>* The easiest way to find something lost around the house is to buy a replacement.<br><br>* Never take life seriously. Nobody gets out alive anyway.<br><br>* There are two kinds of pedestrians: the quick and the dead.<br><br>* Life is sexually transmitted.<br><br>* Health is merely the slowest possible rate at which one can die.<br><br>* The only difference between a rut and a grave is the depth.<br><br>* Some people are like Slinkies. Not really good for anything, but you still can't help but smile when you see one tumble down the stairs.<br><br>* Health nuts are going to feel stupid someday, lying in hospitals dying of nothing.<br><br>* Have you noticed since everyone has a camcorder these days no one talks about seeing UFOs like they used to?<br><br>* Whenever I feel blue, I start breathing again.<br><br>* All of us could take a lesson from the weather. It pays no attention to criticism.<br><br>* In the 60's, people took acid to make the world weird. Now the world is weird and people take Prozac to make it normal.<br><br>* Politics is supposed to be the second oldest profession. I have come to realize that it bears a very close resemblance to the first.<br><br>* How is it one careless match can start a forest fire, but it takes a whole box to start a campfire?<br><br>* Who was the first person to look at a cow and say, "I think I'll squeeze these dangly things here, and drink whatever comes out?"<br><br>* Who was the first person to say, "See that chicken there? I'm gonna eat the next thing that comes outta its butt."<br><br>* Why is there a light in the fridge and not in the freezer?<br><br>* If Jimmy cracks corn and no one cares, why is there a song about him?<br><br>* Why does Goofy stand erect while Pluto remains on all fours? They're both dogs!<br><br>* If Wile E. Coyote had enough money to buy all that Acme crap, why didn't he just buy dinner?<br><br>* If corn oil is made from corn, and vegetable oil is made from vegetables, then what is baby oil made from?<br><br>* If electricity comes from electrons, does morality come from morons?<br><br>* Why do the Alphabet song and Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star have the same tune?<br><br>* Do illiterate people get the full effect of Alphabet Soup?<br><br>* Did you ever notice that when you blow in a dog's face, he gets mad at you, but when you take him on a car ride, he sticks his head out the window?<br><br>* Does pushing the elevator button more than once make it arrive faster?<br><br>* Why doesn't glue stick to the inside of the bottle?<br></div>
