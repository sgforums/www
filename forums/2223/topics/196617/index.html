Hospital: a German, a Jewish, a Filipino and a Singaporean.<br><br>However, someone mixed up the babies by mistake, and the nurses couldn't differentiate between them.<br><br>However, the head sister had a bright idea.

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>The MP was making his rounds through the Sembawang kampung area. In Ah Chye's kampung house, the MP noticed a pig with a wooden leg hobbling about.<br><br>"Excuse me," the MP said to ah Chye, "but why does that pig have a wooden leg?"<br><br>"Oh, it's like this, sir... one night a robber entered our household, tied all of us up, stole our jewelry and was about to escape when the pig came out of nowhere, attacked the robber and saved us all."<br><br>"Oh, I see," said the MP uncertainly, "but I still don't understand. Why does the pig have a wooden leg?"<br><br>"Oh, it's like this, sir... There was a fire when we were all out to the cinema at Chong Pang. The pig alerted our neighbors, ran around organizing a water bucket system and helped the firemen put out the fire."<br><br>The MP was getting quite frustrated. "Listen, Mr Chye, That is all very interesting, but I still don't understand why the pig has a wooden leg."<br><br>"Oh, it's like this, sir..." Ah Chye said. "We used to have an old well. One day, our little daughter fell down the well. The pig jumped in, saved our girl, covered the well with planks and we never had that trouble again."<br><br>The MP shouted, "I DON'T UNDERSTAND! Why does that damn pig have a wooden leg?"<br><br>Ah Chye appeared absolutely unfazed. "Well, you know," he said finally, "with a pig that good, how can you eat it all at once..."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How Singapore got its name<br><br>Version 1 : When Raffles stepped out of his boat on to Boat Quay, a man was running by announcing the birth of his son in hokkien. 'see ta poh, see ta poh'<br><br>Version 2 : I thought the story was like this : The malay/indian king, Parameswara, was sleeping under a tree and was dreaming. He was rudely awakened by an animal resembling a lion. So, out of shock, he screamed ' Singa porda ! Singa porda ' (which means, 'lion, get lost!')<br><br>Version 3 : When Raffles sailed up the Singapore river for the first time, a malay lady was bathing in the river, having left her clothes on the river bank. A singh came by and stole her clothes. The upset lady started shouting after him, 'Singh Kapoh, Singh Kapoh'...<br><br>Version 4 :'Singapore' was actually translated from the name 'Singapura' in Bahasa Malaysia. Story goes that there was a prince that came to our island many many years ago, on an exploration trip. Then he suddenly saw a lion and he named our island 'Singapura', which means lion.<br><br>Imagine if he had seen a pig instead of a lion. ('pig' in Malay is 'Babi')<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>During the Japanese Occupation, 3 Singaporeans, Ah Meng, Ah Seng and Ah Beng were caught for smuggling. They were sentenced to death by firing squad.<br><br>That night, Ah Meng came up with a plan. He told the others that the Japanese were afraid of natural disasters. So he would cause them to panic, and escape in the confusion.<br><br>The next morning, Ah Meng was led to the wall. The firing squad was lined up and the Captain commanded, "Ready.. Aim..", but before he could complete, Ah Meng shouted, " Earthquake!! Earthquake!" The Japanese soldiers panicked and Ah Meng made his escape.<br><br>Later, the soldiers took Ah Seng out and the firing squad were ready. The captain commanded, "Ready... Aim..." This time Ah Seng shouted. " Flood! Flood!!" Again, the Japanese soldiers panicked and this time, Ah Seng made his escape.<br><br>Observing all this, Ah Beng began to get the idea. "It's important to get the timing right."<br><br>Soon, it was Ah Beng's turn. "Timing, that's the key.." Ah Beng kept saying to himself. The soldiers lined up in front of him.

            <div class='col-md body'>Since 1-April-97, competition has been very keen in Singapore's cellular phone market due to the new entrant M1. Before that, there was only one operator, that's why no one covers more of Singapore than Singtel Mobile, absolutely no one.<br><br>AMPS was the first system that Singtel launched, an Ageing Mobile Phone System. After that they realized that the system is outdated and they put up another system ETACS which the subscribers were not very happy about because it was Extremely Tough to Access Call System. Then came the 2nd generation cellular technologies, which Singtel was working with Ericsson to implement - GSM. After some time, Singtel found that things are Getting Slightly Messy, so they decided it was time to go into 3rd generation technology, PCN. However it is a very Poor Coverage Network and every time subscriber wants to make a call, they Phui Chao Nua because they can't get thru.<br><br>So Singtel decides to rename PCN to the GSM1800 Network, or Get Some More Idiotic Bums Onto Our Network.<br><br>M1 initially also use GSM and they learned from Singtel's experience that GSM is not so good either, so M1 goes for CDMA, after several delays in the official launching, M1 knows that this so-called advanced system Can't Do Much Anyway.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PM Goh:<br><br>What does being a chicken mean?  Does it mean that if the chicken does not get to cross the road it will feel less than part of the coop?  No.  That must not be so.  We are all chickens here and we must work together as chickens.  We must want to stay in the coop, not because the coop provides us shelter, but because we are all chickens.  Understand our chicken history to know that we have come to far from those bad days when we were just running around like unruly kampung chickens and not being hot housed as well-disciplined and efficient battery hens.  We have to make sacrifices, but at the same time we support each other.  So that if we ask you to give up the idea of crossing the road, you will understand that it is for the good of the coop.  Only together as a coop can we stay cohesive.<br><br>Lim Boon Heng:<br><br>As a working chicken you must understand that crossing roads is not for you. It is meant for the professional chickens.  These chickens are far and few in between and will require even corn on the other side of the road to cross our roads because they can cross roads anywhere in the world they choose. So for the greater good of the coop, please understand that crossing roads is not meant for you.  And while you're at it can you please take a wage freeze?<br><br>BG Yeo:<br><br>This is because the chicken is sensitive to the multi-racial nature of its society and although it understands each culture is different, it also realizes that it must live within society.  So it compromises.  It finds some values -- a little from the Chinese, a little from the Indians, something from the Malays -- something uniquely Singaporean, and eventually it gathers the energy, the wider vision, the impetus to cross the road.<br><br>SM Lee:<br><br>(1996)<br><br>This is Asia.  As young chickens, chase the rainbow and cross the roads here. Opportunities abound. You might get run down by cars in the process of crossing these roads, especially those in Myanmar, but it doesn't matter. For ten thousand who get run down one might reach it across -- and at the end of that rainbow -- there will be your dream.  So it baffles me when they tell me that they want to cross other roads, elsewhere, because it is here that road crossing should be done.<br><br>BG Lee:<br><br>The chicken is a liar, a twister and a prevaricator and not only should he be run down, but he should also be defeathered, boiled and skinned-alive as an example for all other chickens to see and that will teach them a lesson in road crossing and typo errors.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A: Because it was a Singaporean chicken and the PAP told it to cross.<br><br>A: Because it wanted to get to MRT station on the PAP side of the road.<br><br>A: How did you know the chicken REALLY crossed the road - don't be naive and believe everything you read in the local press.<br><br>A: I don't know, I'm doing science, not arts.<br><br>A: Why are you asking him? Only MPs who graduate from Ivy League universities are qualified to comment on the real reason why the chicken crossed the street.<br><br>A: The chicken did not speak English or Mandarin and was therefore unable to get on the sedan chair and be carried across the street.<br><br>A: Free textbooks available across the street?<br><br>A: Will it be on the exam?<br><br>No chicken ever crossed the road. You think the chicken crossed the road because you see the chicken rice stall opposite the road. The statistics showed that an average of 93.408 people cross this road daily over the past year, of which 5.325% did not use the pedestrian crossing last month and were duly caught and fined. 70.874% stopped at the chicken rice stall to take their lunch of which 41.366% packaged it home.<br><br>But there are there are no data showing any chicken ever crossed the road. Let's get real.  How can a chicken ever cross the road?  It will be killed by the traffic before it made even half the way.  Don't let the SDP mislead you with false data.<br><br>Even though no chicken ever crossed the road, but through the sound policies of the PAP government over the years, the chicken rice stall continues to enjoy good growth. And people continue to enjoy good and high quality chicken rice daily. So if you give the government your full backing, you can be assured of eating more years of chicken rice even though no chicken ever crossed the road.</div>
