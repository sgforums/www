            <div class='col-md body'><div id="post_message_1044505"><span style="font-size: medium;">Dear Wife,<br>During the past year I have tried to make love to you 365 times. I have succeeded 36 times, which is an average of once every ten days. The following is a list of why I did not succeed more often:<br><br>54 times the sheets were just cleaned <br>17 times it was too late <br>49 times you were too tired <br>20 times it was too hot <br>15 times you pretended to be sleep <br>22 times you had a headache <br>17 times you were afraid of waking the baby <br>16 times you said you were too sore <br>12 times it was the wrong time of the month <br>19 times you had to get up early <br>9 times you said weren’t in the mood <br>7 times you were sunburned <br>6 times you were watching the late show <br>5 times you didn’t want to mess up your new hairdo <br>3 times you said the neighbors would hear us <br>9 times you said your mother would hear us <br><br><br>Of the 36 times I did succeed, the activity was not satisfactory because:<br><br>6 times you just laid there <br>8 times you reminded me there’s a crack in the ceiling <br>4 times you told me to hurry up and get it over with <br>7 times I had to wake you and tell you I finished <br>1 time I was afraid I had hurt you because I felt you move <br>================================<br><br>Dear Husband,<br>I think you have things a little confused. Here are the reasons you didn’t get more than you did:<br><br>5 times you came home drunk and tried to screw the cat <br>36 times you did not come home at all <br>21 times you didn’t come with energy <br>33 times you came too soon <br>19 times you went soft before you got in <br>38 times you worked too late <br>10 times you got cramps in your toes <br>29 times you had to get up early to play golf <br>2 times you were in a fight and someone kicked you in the balls <br>4 times you got it stuck in your zipper <br>3 times you had a cold and your nose was running <br>2 times you had a splinter in your finger <br>20 times you lost the motion after thinking about it all day <br>6 times you came in your pajamas while reading a dirty book <br>98 times you were too busy watching TV <br><br><br>Of the times we did get together:<br><br>The reason I laid still was because you missed and were screwing the sheets. <br>I wasn’t talking about the crack in the ceiling, what I said was, “Would you prefer me on my back or kneeling?” <br>The time you felt me move was because you farted and I was trying to breathe. </span></div></div>
