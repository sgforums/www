              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial; font-size: x-small;"><br></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">When I was 16, I 
                  			hoped that one day I would have a boyfriend.<br> <br> When I was 18, I got a boyfriend, but there was no passion. So I 
                  			decided I needed a passionate guy with a zest for life.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">In college I dated 
                  			a passionate guy, but he was too emotional. Everything was an 
                  			emergency, he was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened 
                  			suicide. So I decided I needed a guy with stability.<br> <br> When I was 25, I found a very stable guy but he was boring. He was 
                  			totally predictable and never got excited about anything. Life 
                  			became so dull that I decided I needed a guy with some excitement.<br> <br> When I was 28, I found an exciting guy, but I couldn't keep up with 
                  			him.<br> <br> He rushed from one thing to another, never settling on anything. He 
                  			did mad, impetuous things and flirted with everyone he met. He made 
                  			me miserable as often as happy. He was great fun initially and very 
                  			energetic, but directionless. So I decided to find a guy with some 
                  			ambition.<br> <br> When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious guy with his feet 
                  			planted firmly on the ground and married him. He was so ambitious 
                  			that he divorced me, took everything I owned, and ran off with my 
                  			best friend.<br> <br> I am now 47 and am looking for a guy with a big dick. </span></p>
