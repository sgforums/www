As he took out his wallet to pay the fare, his passport-size photograph accidentally fell from his pocket. He started searching for it frantically &amp; found it on the floor, below the ends of a woman's long sari. He asked her "Can you lift up your sari? I wanna take photograph"<br>He was beaten up so badly that he had to be admitted to hospital.<br><br>He was surprised to see his Singaporean friend, Ah Seng, on the bed next to him, in a worse condition.<br>Ah Seng explained what happened to him. He had gone to a remote village to work. He finished late and missed the last bus. He couldn't find any hotel. So he approached a nearby house and asked the owner whether he can stay there for the night.<br><br>The owner replied "I have 2 grown up daughters. Sorry, I can't allow you to stay".<br>He approached the next house and asked whether he can stay there for the night. The owner replied, "I have 3 grown up daughters. "Sorry, I can't allow you to stay".<br>He went to the next house and asked: "Do you have grown up daughters?"<br>The Owner asked, "WHY?Huh?Huh???"<br>Ah Seng replied, "I wanted to stay here for a night....."<br>The next thing he knew, he was in the hospital bed</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And so there was this cosmetic surgeon who was sitting in his consultation<br>room chatting to his friend.<br><br>In the middle of a conversation, a gorgeous female walked into the room and<br>kissed the surgeon and said:<br><br>"Thank you so much! You have done wonder to my body and look. I was an ugly<br>duckling before that and &gt;now I looked like a princess."<br><br>When the gorgeous lady left the room, the surgeon's friend asked: "Wow, who<br>was that? You have certainly done a good job."<br><br>The surgeon replied: "Oh, that was my mum." and they carried on &gt; &gt;with<br>their conversation.<br><br>A moment later, another lady walked into his room. This lady was even more<br>gorgeous than the first one and she too came round and kissed the surgeon:<br>"Thank you so much! You have really made me look 20 years younger. Those<br>face lift and liposuction have certainly worked wonder to my look. How can I<br>ever thank you!"<br><br>As the lady left the room, his friend asked again: "Bloody hell. who was<br>that? she sure looks like a supermodel. I am really impressed with your<br>surgery skills now." The surgeon replied: "Oh, that was just my wife."<br><br>They then carried on with their normal conversation. Then suddenly a third<br>lady walked into the room. This lady has a perfect body and the look was so<br>beautiful it was beyond this world. She was even more gorgeous than the<br>first two ladies. She stormed towards the surgeon and gave him a big slap,<br>yelling: "You bastard. Look at what you have done to my body! You have<br>ruined my life!! I hope you will die in hell."<br><br>As the lady stormed away, the surgeon's friend turned round to him with a<br>puzzled look. The surgeon shook his head and responded: "Let's not talk<br>about it.....that was my father."</div>

"No, I had to<br>stop drinking years ago," the homeless man replied.<br><br>"Will you use it to gamble instead of buying food?"<br>the man asked. "No, I don't gamble," the homeless man said.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hell or Heaven<br><br>One day while walking down the street a highly successful Human resources Manager was tragically hit by a bus and died. Her soul arrived up in Heaven where she was met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter himself.<br><br>"Welcome," said St. Peter. "Before you get settled in, though, it seems we have a problem. You see,  strangely enough, we've never once had a Human Resources Manager make it this far, and we're not really sure what to do with you."<br>"No worries, just let me in," said the woman.<br>"Well, I'd like to, but I have higher orders. What we're going to do is let you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven and then you can choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in."<br>"Actually, I think I've made up my mind, I prefer to stay in Heaven", said the woman.<br>"Sorry, we have rules..." And with that St. Peter put the executive in a lift and it went down-down-down to Hell.<br><br>The doors opened and she found herself stepping out onto the putting green of a beautiful golf course.<br>In the distance was a country club and in front of her were all her fellow executive friends that she had worked with, and they were well dressed in evening gowns and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks and they talked about old times. They played an excellent round of golf and at night went to the country club where she enjoyed a superb steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil who was actually a really nice guy (kind of cute) and she had a great time telling jokes and dancing. She was having such a good time that before she knew it, it was time to leave. Everybody shook her hand and waved good-bye as she got on the lift.<br><br>The lift went up-up-up and opened back up at the Pearly Gates and found St. Peter waiting for her.<br>"Now it's time to spend a day in heaven," he said. So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing the harp and singing. She had a great time and before she knew it her 24 hours were<br>up and St. Peter came and got her.<br><br>"So, you've spent a day in Hell and you've spent a day in Heaven. Now you must choose your eternity".<br>The woman paused for a second and then replied, "Well, I never thought I would say this. I mean, Heaven has been really great, but I had a better time in Hell."<br>So St. Peter escorted her to the lift and again she went down-down-down back to Hell.<br><br>When the doors of the lift opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw that her friends were dressed in rags and picking up garbage and putting it in sacks.<br>The Devil came up to her and put his arm around her.<br>"I don't understand," stammered the woman, "yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and we danced and had a great time. Now all there is a wasteland and<br>all my friends look miserable."<br>The Devil looked at her and smiled. "Yesterday we were recruiting you, today you're staff..."<br><br>The moral of this story:<br>Never believe what you see in the company or what they promised you.<br>It turns out to be sh*t always.</div>
