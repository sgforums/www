            <div class='col-md body'>An old man and woman were married for many years, even though they hated each other. When they had a confrontation, screaming and yelling could be heard deep into the night. The old man would shout, "When I die, I will dig my way up and out of the grave and come back and haunt you for the rest of your life!"<br><br>Neighbors feared him. They believed he practiced black magic, because of the many strange occurrences that took place in their neighborhood.<br><br>The old man liked the fact that he was feared. To everyone's relief, he died of a heart attack when he was 68.<br><br>His wife had a closed casket at the wake. After the burial, she went straight to the local bar and began to party, as if there was no tomorrow.<br><br>Her neighbors, concerned for her safety, asked, "Aren't you afraid that he may indeed be able to dig his way up and out of the grave and come back to haunt you for the rest of your life?"<br><br>The wife put down her drink and said, "Let him dig. I had the bastard buried upside down..."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Home Remedies<br>-------------------------<br><br>1. If you are choking on an ice cube, don't panic. Simply pour a cup of<br>boiling water down your throat and presto! The blockage will be almost<br>instantly removed.<br><br>2. Clumsy? Avoid cutting yourself while slicing vegetables by getting<br>someone else to hold them while you chop away.<br><br>3. Avoid arguments with the Mrs. about lifting the toilet seat by simply<br>using the sink.<br><br>4. High blood pressure sufferers: simply cut yourself and bleed for a while,<br>thus reducing the pressure in your veins.<br><br>5. A mouse trap, placed on top of your alarm clock, will prevent you from<br>rolling over and going back to sleep when you hit the snooze button.<br><br>6. If you have a bad cough, take a large dose of laxatives, then you will be<br>afraid to cough.<br><br>7. Have a bad toothache? Hit your thumb with a hammer, then you will forget about the toothache.<br><br>8. Everyone seems normal until you get to know them.<br><br>9. AND..... Sometimes we just need to remember what The Rules of Life really are: You need only two tools: WD-40 and duct tape. If it doesn't move and it should, use WD-40. If it moves and shouldn't, use the duct tape.<br><br>10. If you woke up breathing, congratulations! You have another chance!<br><br>11. And finally... Be really good to your family and friends. You never know<br>when you are going to need them to empty your bedpan.</div>

She offers him a handful of peanuts, which he gratefully munches up. After about 15 minutes, she taps him on his shoulder again and she hands him another handful of peanuts. She repeats this gesture about five more times. When she is about to hand him another batch again he asks the little old lady, " Why then don't you eat the peanuts yourself?".<br><br>"We can't chew them because we've no teeth," she replied.<br><br>The puzzled driver asks, "Why do you buy them then?"<br><br>The old lady replied, "We just love the chocolate around them."</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some high school coaches went to a coaches' retreat. To save money, they had to room together. No one wanted to room with Coach Daryl because he snored so badly. They decided it wasn't fair to make one of them stay with him the whole time, so they voted to take turns.<br><br>The first coach slept with Daryl and comes to breakfast the next morning with his hair a mess and his eyes all bloodshot.<br><br>They said, "Man, what happened to you?" He said, "Daryl snored so loudly, I just sat up and watched him all night."<br>The next night it was a different coach's turn. In the morning, same thing--hair all standing up, eyes all blood-shot.<br>They said, "Man, what happened to you? You look awful!" Hee said, "Man, that Daryl shakes the roof. I watched him all night."<br><br>The third night was Frank's turn. Frank was a big burly ex-football player; a man's man.<br><br>The next morning he came to breakfast bright eyed and bushy tailed. "Good morning."<br><br>They couldn't believe it! They said, "Man, what happened?"<br><br>He said, "Well, we got ready for bed. I went and tucked Daryl into bed and<br>kissed him good night. He sat up and watched me all night long."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A man and his wife walked into a dentist's office. The man said to the dentist, "Doc, I'm in one hell of a hurry! I have two buddies sitting out in my car waiting for us to go play golf. So forget about the anesthetic and just pull the tooth and be done with it. We have a 10:00 AM tee time at the best golf course in town and it's 9:30 already. I don't have time to wait for the anesthetic to work!"<br><br>The dentist thought to himself, "My goodness, this is surely a very brave man asking to have his tooth pulled without using anything to kill the pain." So the dentist ask him, "Which tooth is it sir?"<br><br>The man turned to his wife and said, "Open your mouth Honey, and show him."</div>

I thought that maybe if I acted "CRAZY" then he would<br>tell me to take a few days off. So I hung upside down on the ceiling and<br>made funny noises. My co-worker asked me what I was doing? I told her that<br>I was pretending to be a light bulb so that the Boss would think I was<br>"CRAZY" and give me a few days off. A few minutes later the Boss came into<br>the office and asked "What are you doing?" I told him I was a light bulb.<br><br>He said "You are clearly stressed out.
