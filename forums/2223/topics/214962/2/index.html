            <div class='col-md body'>Possible remedy for flu<br><br>Miss Beatrice, the church organist, was in her eighties and had never been married. She was admired for her sweetness and kindness to all.<br><br>One afternoon the pastor came to call on her and she showed him into her quaint sitting room. She invited him to have a seat while she prepared tea. As he sat facing her old Hammond organ, the young minister noticed a cut-glass bowl sitting on top of it. The bowl was filled with water, and in the water floated, of all things, a condom! When she returned with tea  and scones, they began to chat.  The pastor tried to stifle his curiosity about the bowl of water and its strange floater, but soon it got the better of him and He could no longer resist.<br><br>"Miss Beatrice", he said, "I wonder if you would tell me about this?" pointing to the bowl.  "Oh, yes," she replied, "Isn't it wonderful? I was walking through the Park few months  ago and I found this little package on the ground.   The directions said to place it on the organ, keep it wet and that it would prevent the spread of disease. Do you know I haven't had the flu all winter."</div>

It's too long."<br><br>The doctor replied, "I can't do anything for you, but if you see the witch doctor in the bayou, she can help you."<br><br>So, he went to the bayou and saw the witch doctor.<br><br>The witch doctor said, "Go into the swamp and you will find a female frog there. Ask her to marry you..she'll say "No".. and you'll lose 5 inches off your member!"<br><br>So, he went to the swamp and found the frog and asked her,"Will you marry me?"<br><br>"No!", she said.  He lost 5 inches off his member!<br><br>The guy liked the results, and thought, 20 inches is just too much. So he asked the frog again, "Will you marry me?"<br><br>The frog said, "No!"  And the guy lost another 5 inches.<br><br>He thought, God, 15 inches is great! But 10 inches would just be perfect.<br><br>So he asked again, "Will you marry me?"<br><br>And the frog said, "How many time do I have to tell you ... NO! NO! NO!" ...<br><br>Moral of the story??<br><br>Know When to Quit.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A young wife, who was becoming frustrated with her young husband  constant demands for sex, decides to make a schedule for him, to cut down on the amount of times that they will have to make love for the rest of their marriage.<br><br>While getting ready for work, she writes on a piece of paper,  "Honey,you know I love you, but your never ending requests for sex are leaving me drained and really tired. So I propose that we only have sex on days that start with the letter 'T', to minimise the frequency of our lovemaking sessions. Don't be mad at me honey, just understand where I am coming from, and let me know if my request is too demanding of you."<br><br>On her way out the door, she uses a refrigerator magnet and sticks the note to the fridge door,hoping that her sex craved husband will be understanding and accepting of her proposal when he reads it.<br><br>Upon returning home, she glances at the refrigerator and notices that her note has been replaced with a note from her husband that<br>reads,"Baby, I didn't' realise that I was putting you under so much pressure and I'm sorry.I  accept your proposal and have even taken the extra step of listing at the bottom of this letter, those days starting with the letter 'T' to make sure that we are on the same  page.<br><br>1. TUESDAY<br>2. THURSDAY<br>3. TODAY<br>4. TOMORROW<br><br>P.S. I love you too, and remember it's still TODAY, I am waiting for<br>you upstairs."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HEALTH QUESTION &amp; ANSWER SESSION<br><br>Q: I've heard that cardiovascular exercise can prolong life; is this<br>true?<br>A: Your heart is only good for so many beats, and that's it... don't<br>waste  them on exercise. Everything wears out eventually. Speeding up your heart will not make you live longer; that's like saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it faster. Want to live longer? Take a nap.<br><br>Q: Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables?<br>A: You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat? Hay and corn. And what are these? Vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. Need grain? Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy vegetable). And a pork chop can give you 100% of your recommended daily allowance of vegetable products.<br><br>Q: Should I reduce my alcohol intake?<br>A: No, not at all. Wine is made from fruit. Brandy is distilled wine,<br>that means they take the water out of the fruity bit so you get even more of the goodness that way. Beer is also made out of grain. Bottoms up!<br><br>Q: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio?<br>A: Well, if you have a body and you have fat, your ratio is one to one. If you have two bodies, your ratio is two to one, etc.<br><br>Q: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular<br>exercise program?<br>A: Can't think of a single one, sorry. My philosophy is: No Pain...Good<br>!<br><br>Q: Aren't fried foods bad for you?<br>A: YOU'RE NOT LISTENING!!! ... Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In fact, they're permeated in it. How could getting more vegetables be bad for you?<br><br>Q: Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around<br>the middle?<br>A: Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger. You<br>should only be doing sit-ups if you want a bigger stomach.<br><br>Q: Is chocolate bad for me?<br>A: Are you crazy? HELLO Cocoa beans! Another vegetable!!! It's the best feel-good food around!<br><br>Q: Is swimming good for your figure?<br>A: If swimming is good for your figure, explain whales to me.<br><br>Q: Is getting in-shape important for my lifestyle?<br>A: Hey! 'Round' is a shape!<br><br>Well, I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had about food and diets. And remember: "Life should NOT be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in an attractive and well preserved body, but rather to skid in<br>sideways - Chardonnay in one hand - chocolate in the other - body<br>thoroughly used up, totally worn out and screaming "WOO HOO, What a Ride"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A man was blissfully driving along the highway, when he saw the Easter Bunny hopping across the middle of the road. He swerved to avoid hitting the Bunny, but unfortunately the rabbit jumped in front of his car and was hit. The basket of eggs went flying all over the place.<br><br>The driver, being a sensitive man as well as an animal lover, pulled over to the side of the road, and got out to see what had become of the Bunny carrying the basket. Much to his dismay, the colorful Bunny was dead. The driver felt guilty and began to cry.<br><br>A blonde driving down the same highway saw the man crying on the side of the road and pulled over. She stepped out of her car and asked the man what was wrong.<br><br>"I feel terrible," he explained, "I accidentally hit the Easter Bunny and killed it. There may not be an Easter because of me. What should I do?"<br><br>The blonde told the man not to worry. She knew exactly what to do. She went to her car trunk, and pulled out a spray can. She walked over to the limp, dead Bunny, and sprayed the entire contents of the can onto the little furry animal.<br><br>Miraculously the Easter Bunny came to back life, jumped up, picked up the spilled eggs and candy, waved its paw at the two humans and hopped on down the road. 50 yards away the Easter Bunny stopped, turned around, waved and hopped on down the road another 50 yards, turned, waved, hopped another 50 yards and waved again!<br><br>The man was astonished. He said to the woman, "What in heaven's name is in your spray can? What was it that you sprayed on the Easter Bunny?" The blonde turned the can around so that the man could read the label. It said: "Hair spray. Restores life to dead hair. Adds permanent wave."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A tour bus driver is driving with a bus load of seniors down a highway when he is tapped on his shoulder by a little old lady. She offers him a handful of peanuts, which he gratefully munches up. After about 15 minutes, she taps him on his shoulder again and she hands him another handful of peanuts. She repeats this gesture about five more times. When she is about to hand him another batch again he asks the little old lady, " Why then don't you eat the peanuts yourself?".<br><br>"We can't chew them because we've no teeth," she replied.<br><br>The puzzled driver asks, "Why do you buy them then?"<br><br>The old lady replied, "We just love the chocolate around them."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FIRST:<br>I walked into a hair salon with my husband and three kids in tow and asked<br>loudly, "How much do you charge for a shampoo and a blow job?" Hearing<br>myself, I turned right around and walked back out and never went back. My<br>husband didn't say a word .... he knew better.<br><br>SECOND:<br>I was at the golf store comparing different kinds of golf balls. I was<br>unhappy with the women's type that I had been using. After browsing for<br>several minutes, I was approached by one of the good-looking gentlemen who<br>work at the store. He asked if he could help me. Without thinking, I looked<br>at him and said, "I think I like playing with men's balls."<br><br>THIRD:<br>My sister and I were at the mall and passed by a store that sold a variety<br>of candy and nuts. As we were looking at the display case, the boy behind<br>the counter asked if we needed any help. I replied, "No, I'm just looking at<br>your nuts." My sister started to laugh hysterically. The boy grinned, and<br>turned beet-red and walked away. To this day, my sister has never let me<br>forget.<br><br>FOURTH:<br>While in line at the bank one afternoon, my toddler decided to release some<br>pent-up energy and run amok. I was finally able to grab hold of her after<br>receiving looks of disgust and annoyance from other patrons. I told her that<br>if she did not start behaving "right now" she would be punished.<br>To my horror, she looked me in the eye and said loudly in a voice just as<br>threatening, "If you don't let me go right now, I will tell Grandma that I<br>saw you kissing Daddy's pee-pee last night!" The silence was deafening after<br>this enlightening exchange.<br>Even the tellers stopped what they were doing. I mustered up the last of my<br>dignity and walked out of the bank with my daughter in tow. The last thing I<br>heard when the door closed behind me, were screams of laughter.<br><br>FIFTH:<br>Have you ever asked your child a question too many times? My three year old<br>son had a lot of problems with potty training and I was on him constantly.<br>One day we stopped at Taco Bell for a quick lunch in between errands. It was<br>very busy, with a full dining room. While enjoying my taco, I smelled<br>something funny, so of course I checked my seven month old daughter, and she was clean.<br>Then I realized that Danny had not asked to go potty in a while, so I asked<br>him if he needed to go, and he said "No". I kept thinking "Oh Lord, that<br>child has had an accident, and I don't have any clothes with me". Then I<br>said, "Danny, are you SURE you didn't have an accident?" "No," he replied.<br>I just KNEW that he must have had an accident, because the smell was getting<br>worse. So, I asked one more time, "Danny, did you have an accident?" This<br>time he jumped up, yanked down his pants, bent over and spread his cheeks<br>and yelled "SEE MOM, IT'S JUST FARTS!!"<br>While 30 people nearly choked to death on their tacos laughing, he calmly<br>pulled up his pants and sat down. An old couple made me feel better by<br>thanking me for the best laugh they'd ever had!<br><br>LAST:<br>This had most of the state of Michigan laughing for 2 days and a very<br>embarrassed female news anchor who will, in the future, likely think before<br>she speaks. What happens when you predict snow but don't get any...?<br>Here's a true story:<br>We had a female news anchor that, the day after it was supposed to have<br>snowed and didn't, turned to the weatherman and asked "So Bob, where's that<br>8 inches you promised me last night?"<br>Not only did he have to leave the set, but half the crew did, too - they<br>were laughing so hard!</div>
