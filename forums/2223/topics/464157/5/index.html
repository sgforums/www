              <p>I DL now. back in 1992, when Guangyang Sec won the C Divison National Baskerball championship, everyone was happen becuase that was the time when a neighbour school won the national basketball title. The next year RGS poach our girls team coach, Me Quek and Hwa Chong poach our C and B Divison Coach, Me Lee- WTF</p>
              <p>I play for the C Division then and train the F whole year in 1991 with my team mates. We have such a powerful team that can beat anyone. But WTF, two F good school came and poach our two coaches and we were left with confusion and despair- WTF. From that day onwards, 21 years from now. I told myself- I dont need to go to good school. I just need to be humble and be filfial to my parents and my elders. Show respect to the seniors in the world place and do whatever things my supervisor and managers ask me to do. I am 34 years this year. I being to countless countries and work for MNC and government sectors. Best thing my O levels grades were English C6, Mandarin B3, History B3, POA C6 Maths and Science F9. I dont believe my O levels determine my future. I went out to do Pre-University as a Private Candiate in 1999. I got E8 for GP, C5 for Ao Chinese, Ungraded for Economics, Divinity, Management of Business, History because I was too lazy to wake up for the exams as I was staying in Toa Payoh and the exams was at SAJC- WTF.</p>
              <p>Elistism to me is rubbish because more than half of the patients in IMH are either teachers or civil servants WTF. So please Summerhill..Put on your thinking cap...Think with your heart and not with your brain or ass...The world is evolving and Singaporean supposed to be first world countries, still got beggers, desitituents all over the place. Our houses has been take over by foreigners, our jobs have been taken over by the foreigners and our children have to fight for their school place with the foreigners WTF. we have to squeeze in the MRT and buses with the foreigners, we have to quence up for food with the foreigners, our food supplies in the supermarket are being purchases by the foreigners, our land is been bought over by singaporeans who married foreigners WTF. Our shopping mails are been populated with foreigers and the banking officer in our national banks are also ex-foreigner- WTF. Our Police force and Army are also flooded with scholars who trade in their nationalities for our nationality and our young people cannot find jobs because their grades are not good enough and their background are not so diversified WTF. So please whoever is reading the post, I beesch you to sit down and think about your future. Continue to vote for your PAP government and one day you will see yourself in a foreign land. Our land is no longer ours. Foreigners are more than us in Singapore. Where is our national pride? we are like China back in the 1910s when the 8 countries went into Yuan Ming Yuan and plunder our possessions and kill our people and abuse our younger generation. Enough saying. I am going for a stroll now.</p>

              <p>I DL now. back in 1992, when Guangyang Sec won the C Divison
              National Baskerball championship, everyone was happen becuase that
              was the time when a neighbour school won the national basketball
              title. The next year RGS poach our girls team coach, Me Quek and
              Hwa Chong poach our C and B Divison Coach, Me Lee- WTF</p>
              <p>I play for the C Division then and train the F whole year in
              1991 with my team mates. We have such a powerful team that can beat
              anyone. But WTF, two F good school came and poach our two coaches
              and we were left with confusion and despair- WTF. From that day
              onwards, 21 years from now. I told myself- I dont need to go to
              good school. I just need to be humble and be filfial to my parents
              and my elders. Show respect to the seniors in the world place and
              do whatever things my supervisor and managers ask me to do. I am 34
              years this year. I being to countless countries and work for MNC
              and government sectors. <strong>Best thing my O levels grades were English
              C6, Mandarin B3, History B3, POA C6 Maths and Science F9. </strong>I dont
              believe my O levels determine my future. <strong>I went out to do
              Pre-University as a Private Candiate in 1999. I got E8 for GP, C5
              for Ao Chinese, Ungraded for Economics, Divinity, Management of
              Business, History because I was too lazy to wake up for the exams
              as I was staying in Toa Payoh and the exams was at SAJC- WTF.</strong></p>
              <p>Elistism to me is rubbish because more than half of the patients
              in IMH are either teachers or civil servants WTF. So please
              Summerhill..Put on your thinking cap...Think with your heart and
              not with your brain or ass...The world is evolving and Singaporean
              supposed to be first world countries, still got beggers,
              desitituents all over the place. Our houses has been take over by
              foreigners, our jobs have been taken over by the foreigners and our
              children have to fight for their school place with the foreigners
              WTF. we have to squeeze in the MRT and buses with the foreigners,
              we have to quence up for food with the foreigners, our food
              supplies in the supermarket are being purchases by the foreigners,
              our land is been bought over by singaporeans who married foreigners
              WTF. Our shopping mails are been populated with foreigers and the
              banking officer in our national banks are also ex-foreigner- WTF.
              Our Police force and Army are also flooded with scholars who trade
              in their nationalities for our nationality and our young people
              cannot find jobs because their grades are not good enough and their
              background are not so diversified WTF. So please whoever is reading
              the post, I beesch you to sit down and think about your future.
              Continue to vote for your PAP government and one day you will see
              yourself in a foreign land. Our land is no longer ours. Foreigners
              are more than us in Singapore. Where is our national pride? we are
              like China back in the 1910s when the 8 countries went into Yuan
              Ming Yuan and plunder our possessions and kill our people and abuse
              our younger generation. Enough saying. I am going for a stroll
              now.</p>
