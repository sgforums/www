              <p>Here are 3 interesting incidents which some of you may have read about. Those who are interested are free to help me dig out the original articles.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There was once a guy who attempted to comit suicide, and so as to ensure that he will die, he drank some poison, hang himself by the neck above a river ( He can't swim ), and attempt to shoot himself in the head with a handgun.</p>
              <p>Alas, the bullet hit the rope instead, hence he fell into the river. A passer-by went in and got him out of the waters, and he vomitted out the poison.</p>
              <p>Paramedics brought him to the hospital, and later he died of hypothermia in the hospital.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A robber attempting to rob a hair-salon near its closing hours got beaten up and tied up by its yellow-belt shopowner. The shopowner told her employees and customers she would hand the 'fiend' to the police, but she ended up locking him up and raping him for 3 days, during which she would feed him viagra whenever he says he is hungry.</p>
              <p>After 3 days, she threw out the robber, who promptly went to the hospital, as his private-parts are in very bad condition, and after a police report from the hospital staffs, the man was arrested for robbery and the hair-salon owner for rape.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A prosecutor shared with other fellow prosecutors one of the many interesting cases which he has handled.</p>
              <p>A man was shot dead while jumping off a building to commit suicide, and the gunshot was from a neighbour who live just one floor below him in the same building. It was found out that the neighbour was arguing with his wife and was pointing his rifle at her.</p>
              <p>But after investigations, it was found out that this neighbour of his has always done this to his wife while arguing, but had never ever put in any bullets into the gun. So who put in the bullets?</p>
              <p>After even more investigation, it was found out that their son was in heavy gambling debt, and knew what his father do all the time, and hence hope that his father will kill his mother by accident, and he will inherit all their wealth and possession.</p>
              <p>To make things even weirder, this son, was found out to be their neighbour living upstairs in the building, and since he couldn't take the torments of the loansharks anymore, he decided to jump off the building and commit suicide, only to be shot by accident by his father.</p>
              <p>All in all, the prosecutor closed the case with a ruling of accidental suicide.</p>
              <p> </p>

              the actual one : Bizarre Death 
              1994 Urban Legend  
              At the 1994 annual awards dinner given for Forensic Science, AAFS, President Dr. Don Harper Mills astounded his audience with the legal complications of a bizarre death. Here is the story:
              
              On March 23,1994 the medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald Opus and concluded that he died from a shotgun wound to the head. Mr. Opus had jumped from the top of a ten story building intending to commit suicide. He left a note to that effect, indicating his despondency. As he fell past the ninth floor his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast passing through a window which killed him instantly.
              
              Neither the shooter nor the descender was aware that a safety net had been installed just below at the eighth floor level to protect some building workers and that Ronald Opus would not have been able to complete his suicide the way he had planned.
              
              "Ordinarily," Dr. Mills continued, "a person who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds, even though the mechanism might not be what he intended, is still defined as committing suicide."
              
              That Mr. Opus was shot on the way to certain death, but probably would not have been successful because of the safety net, caused the medical examiner to feel that he had a homicide on his hands. The room on the ninth floor, whence the shotgun blast emanated, was occupied by an elderly man and his wife. They were arguing vigorously and he was threatening her with a shotgun. The man was so upset that when he pulled the trigger he completely missed his wife and the pellets went through the window, striking Mr. Opus.
              
              When one intends to kill subject A but kills subject B in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of subject B. When confronted with the murder charge the old man and his wife were both adamant. They both said they thought the shotgun was unloaded. Thed old man said it was his long-standing habit to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun. He had no intention to murder her. Therefore the killing of Mr. Opus appeared to be an accident; that is, the gun had been accidentally loaded.
              
              The continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couple's son loading the shotgun about six weeks prior to the fatal accident. It transpired that the old lady had cut off her son's financial support and the son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his mother. The case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of Ronald Opus.
              
              Now comes the exquisite twist. Further investigation revealed that the son was, in fact, Ronald Opus. He had become increasingly despondent over the failure of his attempt to engineer his mother's murder. This led him to jump off the ten story building on March 23rd, only to be killed by a shotgun blast passing through the ninth story window. The son had actually murdered himself so the medical examiner closed the case as a suicide.
