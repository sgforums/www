              <p> I have a dog. Its name is Sex.</p>

              <p>One day Sex ran away.</p>
              <p>As I live in Gelyang, I went around the area looking for my dog.</p>
              <p>One of the prostitutes there asked me what I was looking for.</p>
              <p>I said I was looking for Sex.</p>
              <p>She said she is good for sex.</p>
              <p>I tried to explain that I am looking for Sex, my dog</p>
              <p>She said I must be sick in the mind for wanting sex with a dog.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Next I met a policeman. I felt a bit relieve thinking that he might help he look for my dog.</p>
              <p>He asked me what I was doing there.</p>
              <p>I told him I was looking for Sex.</p>
              <p>He tried to arrest me saying that the prostitutes on the streets were illegal.</p>
              <p>I tried to explain to him that I was not looking for prostitutes, I was looking for Sex.</p>
              <p>He told me that is what most of the Ah Peks say when they were arrested too.</p>
              <p>I had to spend a night in jail.</p>
              <p>Eventually, Sex came back on its own.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The next time Sex got me in trouble is when I was about to get married.</p>
              <p>My and my fiancée have always wanted to be married in a church.</p>
              <p>Since my dog is very important to us, we also wanted it to be in the church with us but our church usually do not allow dogs inside.</p>
              <p>So we had a talk with our pastor. I said “Pastor, please allow us to have Sex in the church on our wedding day.”</p>
              <p>The pastor refused.</p>
              <p>As all my friends and family are also very close with my dog, I tried to convince the pastor again by saying “Please pastor, all my friends and family would like to have Sex in the church during our wedding ceremony too.”</p>
              <p>In the end, I had to have the wedding reception in ROM and I am not allowed back into the church.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After a few years, me and my wife decide to get divorce. One thing we cannot bear to part with is my dog. In the end, we went to court to gain custody of the dog. The judge gave my dog to my wife. I tried to tell the judge that I had Sex since before I was married. The judge said a lot of people practice premarital sex now a days. I told the judge “You do not understand, Sex is mine not my wife’s.” The judge said he cannot legally stop my wife from having sex even if we are still married. I said “No, you still do not understand. I had had Sex since I was a very small little boy.” The judge said I am not at fault as I am the victim and he warned me that under age sex is illegal. He also praise me for the courage to reveal the unjust done to me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After all these years, being thrown in jail, get married, divorced, I lost my dog. Just recently, I made a passing comment to my waitress that I missed having Sex. She told me to get a dog.</p>

              <p>He asked me what I was doing there.</p>
              <p>I told him I was looking for Sex.</p>
              <p>He tried to arrest me saying that the prostitutes on the streets
              were illegal.</p>
              <p>I tried to explain to him that I was not looking for
              prostitutes, I was looking for Sex.</p>
              <p>He told me that is what most of the Ah Peks say when they were
              arrested too.</p>
              <p>I had to spend a night in jail.</p>
              <p>Eventually, Sex came back on its own.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The next time Sex got me in trouble is when I was about to get
              married.</p>
              <p>My and my fiancée have always wanted to be married in a
              church.</p>
              <p>Since my dog is very important to us, we also wanted it to be in
              the church with us but our church usually do not allow dogs
              inside.</p>
              <p>So we had a talk with our pastor. I said “Pastor, please allow
              us to have Sex in the church on our wedding day.”</p>
              <p>The pastor refused.</p>
              <p>As all my friends and family are also very close with my dog, I
              tried to convince the pastor again by saying “Please pastor, all my
              friends and family would like to have Sex in the church during our
              wedding ceremony too.”</p>
              <p>In the end, I had to have the wedding reception in ROM and I am
              not allowed back into the church.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After a few years, me and my wife decide to get divorce. One
              thing we cannot bear to part with is my dog. In the end, we went to
              court to gain custody of the dog. The judge gave my dog to my wife.
              I tried to tell the judge that I had Sex since before I was
              married. The judge said a lot of people practice premarital sex now
              a days. I told the judge “You do not understand, Sex is mine not my
              wife’s.” The judge said he cannot legally stop my wife from having
              sex even if we are still married. I said “No, you still do not
              understand. I had had Sex since I was a very small little boy.” The
              judge said I am not at fault as I am the victim and he warned me
              that under age sex is illegal. He also praise me for the courage to
              reveal the unjust done to me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After all these years, being thrown in jail, get married,
              divorced, I lost my dog. Just recently, I made a passing comment to
              my waitress that I missed having Sex. She told me to get a dog.</p>

              <p> I have a dog. Its name is Sex.</p>

              <p>As I live in Gelyang, I went around the area looking for my

              <p>I said I was looking for Sex.</p>
              <p>She said she is good for sex.</p>

              <p>She said I must be sick in the mind for wanting sex with a
              dog.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Next I met a policeman. I felt a bit relieve thinking that he
              might help he look for my dog.</p>
