            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Bank Robbery</strong><br><br>Two blondes, Trisha and Robin decided to rob a bank together.<br><br>The first blonde, Trisha plans the robbery and goes over the plan with the second blonde, Robin, in great detail.<br><br>The robbery begins. Trisha drives up in front of the bank, stops the car and says to Robin, "I want to make absolutely sure you understand the plan.<br><br>You are supposed to be in and out of the bank in no more than three minutes with the cash. Do you understand the plan?"<br><br>"Perfectly," said Robin.<br><br>Robin goes in the bank while Trisha waits in the getaway car.<br><br>One minute passes . . .<br><br>Two minutes pass . . .<br><br>Seven minutes pass . . . and Trisha is really stressing out.<br><br>Finally, the bank doors burst open! And here comes Robin. She's got a safe wrapped up in rope and is dragging it to the car. About the time she gets the safe in the trunk of the car, the bank doors burst open again with the security guard coming out. The guard's pants and underwear are down around his ankles while he is firing his weapon. As the gals are getting away, Trisha says "You are such a blonde! I thought you understood the plan!"<br><br>Robin said, "I did . . . I did exactly what you said!"<br><br>"No, you idiot," said Trish. "You got it all mixed up. I said tie up the GUARD and blow the SAFE!"<br>_________________<br><strong>The Wild West </strong><br><br>Back in the old Wild West, there were two blonde cowpokes, Jeff and Dave. One day, the two were enjoying a strong drink in the local saloon, when a man walked into the bar with an Indian's head under his arm.<br><br>The barman shakes his hand and says, "I hate Indians, last week they burnt my barn to the ground, assaulted my wife and killed my children."<br><br>He then says, "If any man brings me the head of an Indian, I'll give him one thousand dollars." The two blondes looked at each other and walked out of the bar to go hunting for an Indian. They were walking around for a while when suddenly they saw one; Jeff threw a rock which hit the Indian right on the head. The Indian fell off his horse, but landed seventy feet down a ravine.<br><br>The two blondes made their way down the ravine where Dave pulled out a knife to claim their trophy.<br><br>Suddenly, Jeff said, "Dave, take a look at this."<br>Dave replied, "Not now, I'm busy."<br>Jeff tugged him on the shoulder and says, "I really think you should look at this."<br>Dave said, "Look, you can see I'm busy. There's a thousand dollars in my hand."<br>But Jeff was adamant. "Please, Dave, take a look at this."<br><br>So Dave looked up and saw that standing at the top of the ravine were five thousand red Indians. Dave just shook his head and said, "Oh my God, we're going to be millionaires!"<br>_____________________<br><strong>Blondes On Everest </strong><br><br>Eleven people were clinging precariously to a wildly swinging rope suspended from a crumbling outcropping on Mount Everest. Ten were blonde, one was a brunette.<br><br>As a group they decided that one of the party should let go. If that didn't happen, the rope would break and everyone would perish. For an agonizing few moments no one volunteered.<br><br>Finally the brunette gave a truly touching speech saying she would sacrifice herself to save the lives of the others.<br><br>The blondes applauded.<br>________________________<br><strong>The Young Ventriloquist </strong><br><br>A young ventriloquist is touring the clubs and stops to entertain at a bar in a small town.<br><br>He's going through his usual run of silly blonde jokes when a big blonde woman in the fourth row stands on her chair and says, "OK jerk, I've heard just about enough of your denigrating blonde jokes. What makes you think you can stereotype women that way? What do a person's physical attributes have to do with their worth as a human being? It's guys like you who keep women like me from being respected at work and in my community, of reaching my full potential as a person...because you and your kind continue to perpetuate discrimination against not only blondes but women at large... all in the name of humor."<br><br>Flustered, the ventriloquist begins to apologize, when the blonde pipes up, "You stay out of this mister, I'm talking to that little f*cker on your knee!"<br>___________________<br><strong>Interview For Job</strong><br><br>A young blonde woman goes to an office for a job interview . The interviewer decides to start with the basics. "So, miss, can you tell us your age, please?" The blonde counts carefully on her fingers for about 3 seconds before replying "Ehh... 23!".<br><br>The interviewer tries another straight forward one to break the ice. "And can you tell us your height, please?" The young lady stands up and produces a measuring tape from her handbag. She then traps one end under her foot and extends the tape to the top of her head. She checks the measurement and announces, "Five foot three!"<br><br>This isn't looking good so the interviewer goes for the real basics. "And ehh, just to confirm for our records, your name please?" The blonde bobs her head from side to side for about twenty seconds, mouthing something silently to herself, before replying "Stephanie".<br><br>The interviewer is completely baffled at this stage, so he asks "Just out of curiosity, miss. We can understand your counting on your fingers to work out your age, and the measuring tape for your height is obvious, but what were you doing when we asked you your name?"<br><br>"Ohh that!" replies the blonde, "That's just me running through 'Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you...'"<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
