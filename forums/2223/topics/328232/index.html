              <p>All hair removal methods have tricked women with their  promises of easy, <br> painless removal - The Epilady, scissors, razors, Nair and now...the wax. <br> <br>Read on.........</p>
              <p>My night began as any other normal weeknight. Come  home, fix dinner, play <br> with the kids. I then had the thought that would ring painfully in my  mind <br> for the next few hours:</p>
              <p>'Maybe I should pull the waxing kit out of the  medicine cabinet.' So I <br> headed to the site of my demise: the bathroom.</p>
              <p>It was one of those 'cold wax' kits. No melting a  clump of hot wax, you <br> just rub the strips together in your hand, they get warm and you peel  them <br> apart and press them to your leg (or wherever else) and you pull the hair <br> right off.</p>
              <p>No muss, no fuss. How hard can it be? I mean, I'm not  a genius, but I am <br> mechanically inclined enough to figure this out. (YA THINK!?!)</p>
              <p>So I pull one of the thin strips out. Its two strips  facing each other <br> stuck together. Instead of rubbing them together, my genius kicks in so I <br> get out the hair dryer and heat it to 1000 degrees.</p>
              <p>('Cold wax,' yeah...right!) I lay the strip across my  thigh. Hold the skin <br> around it tight and pull. It works!</p>
              <p>OK, so it wasn't the best feeling, but it wasn't too  bad. I can do this! <br> Hair removal no longer eludes me! I am She-rah, fighter of all wayward <br> body hair and maker of smooth skin extraordinaire.</p>
              <p>With my next wax strip I move north. After checking on the  kids, I sneak <br> back into the bathroom, for the ultimate hair fighting championship. I <br> drop my panties and place one foot on the toilet. Using the same <br> procedure, I apply the wax strip across the right side of my bikini line, <br> covering the right half of my hoo-ha and stretching down to the inside of <br> my butt cheek (it *was* a long strip) I inhale deeply and brace <br> myself....RRRRIIIPPP!!!!</p>
              <p>I'm blind!!! Blinded from pain!!!!....OH MY  GAWD!!!!!!!!!</p>
              <p>Vision returning, I notice that I've only managed to pull  off half the <br> strip. CRAP! Another deep breath and RIPP! Everything is spinning and <br> spotted. I think I may pass out...must stay conscious...must stay <br> conscious.</p>
              <p>Do I hear crashing drums??? Breathe, breathe...OK, back to  normal.</p>
              <p>I want to see my trophy - a wax covered strip, the one that  has caused me <br> so much pain, with my hairy pelt sticking to it. I want to revel in the <br> glory that is my triumph over body hair. I hold up the strip. There's no <br> hair on it. Where is the hair??? WHERE IS THE WAX???</p>
              <p>Slowly I ease my head down, foot still perched on the  toilet. I see the <br> hair. The hair that should be on the strip...it's not! I touch. I am <br> touching wax.</p>
              <p>I run my fingers over the most sensitive part of my body,  which is now <br> covered in cold wax and matted hair. Then I make the next BIG <br> mistake...remember my foot is still propped upon the toilet? I know I  need <br> to do something. So I put my foot down.</p>
              <p>Sealed shut! My butt is sealed shut. Sealed shut!</p>
              <p>I penguin walk around the bathroom trying to figure out what  to do and <br> think to myself 'Please don't let me get the urge to poop. My head may  pop <br> off!' What can I do to melt the wax?</p>
              <p>Hot water!! Hot water melts wax!! I'll run the hottest  water I can stand <br> into the bathtub, get in, immerse the wax-covered bits and the wax should <br> melt and I can gently wipe it off, right??? *WRONG!!!!!!!*</p>
              <p>I get in the tub - the water is slightly hotter than  that used to torture <br> prisoners of war or sterilize surgical equipment - I sit.</p>
              <p>Now, the only thing worse than having your nether  regions glued together, <br> is having them glued together and then glued to the bottom of the  tub...in <br> scalding hot water. Which, by the way, doesn't melt cold wax.</p>
              <p>So, now I'm stuck to the bottom of the tub as though I  had cemented myself <br> to the porcelain!! God bless the man who had convinced me a few months  ago <br> to have a phone put in the bathroom!!!!!</p>
              <p> I call my friend, thinking surely she has waxed before  and has some secret <br> of how to get me undone. It's a very good conversation starter 'So, my <br> butt and hoo-ha are glued together to the bottom of the tub!'</p>
              <p>There is a slight pause. She doesn't know any secret  tricks for removal <br> but she does try to hide her laughter from me. She wants to know exactly <br> where the wax is located, 'Are we talking cheeks or hole or hoo-ha?'</p>
              <p>She's laughing out loud by now...I can hear her. I  give her the rundown <br> and she suggests I call the number on the side of the box.</p>
              <p>YEAH!!!!! Right!! I should be the joke of someone else's  night.</p>
              <p>While we go through various solutions. I resort to  trying to scrape the <br> wax off with a razor . Nothing feels better than to have your girlie <br> goodies covered in hot wax, glued shut, stuck to the tub in super hot <br> water and then dry-shaving the sticky wax off!!</p>
              <p>By now the brain is not working, dignity has taken a  major hike and I'm <br> pretty sure I'm going to need Post-Traumatic Stress counseling for this <br> event.</p>
              <p>My friend is still talking with me when I finally see my  saving <br> grace....the lotion they give you to remove the excess wax. What do I <br> really have to lose at this point? I rub some on and OH MY GOD!!!!!!!</p>
              <p>The scream probably woke the kids and scared the dickens out  of my friend. <br> It's sooo painful, but I really don't care. 'IT WORKS!! It works !!'</p>
              <p>I get a hearty congratulation from my friend and she hangs  up. I <br> successfully remove the remainder of the wax and then notice to my grief <br> and despair....THE HAIR IS STILL THERE.......ALL OF IT!</p>
              <p>So I recklessly shave it off. Heck, I'm numb by now.  Nothing hurts. I <br> could have amputated my own leg at this point.</p>
              <p>Next week I'm going to  try hair colour!!!!!</p>
