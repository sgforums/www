              <p>There were three gals who were getting married and all met at the
              marriage counsellor's office to discuss the options of having or not
              having a baby right away. <br><br> There were two city gals and one farm gal.<br><br> The counsellor asked them if they planned on having a baby right away or were  going to wait awhile. <br><br> They all agreed that they had discussed this with their potential husbands and  all agreed to wait awhile.  <br><br> Well, the counsellor asked the first gal what type of birth  control she planned to use. <br> Her answer was, 'The rhythm method.' <br><br> 'That will work,' said the counsellor, 'if you keep a good record.' <br><br> He asked the second gal what system she planned on using. 'I  plan on using birth control pills,' she said. <br><br> Again he said, 'Yes that will work as long as you don't forget to take them.'  <br><br> He then asked the farm girl what system she was planning on  using. <br><br> Her answer was, 'The pail and saucer method.'  <br><br> After a short delay...........he told her that should also work.  <br><br> He asked them all to come back in one year on a specific date  for a follow up on how things were going.  <br> <br> They all met again one year later and the two city gals were pregnant. <br><br> Only the farm gal was slim and trim yet. Well, the counsellor asked the
              first gal what method she used and what went wrong. <br><br> She replied, 'I used the rhythm method but somehow got my notes mixed up and,  well here I am, going to have a baby.' <br><br> He asked the second city gal what method she used and she replied, 'The
              birth control pill. But we were camping one weekend and I didn't have
              my pills with me and as you can see, I too am going to have a baby.' <br><br> He turns to the farm gal. 'I vaguely remember you were going to use the
              pail and saucer method. Now I must admit that I don't have a clue what
              the pail and saucer method is. Will you explain it to me as I see it
              has worked well for you?' <br><br> She replied, 'Well we make love
              standing up, and since I am quite a bit taller than my husband, he
              stands on a pail turned upside down. Now as we are making love, I watch
              his eyes, and when his eyes get as big as saucers..... I kick the pail
              out from under him</p>
