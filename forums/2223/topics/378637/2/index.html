"I see." nodded the psychiatrist.<br><br>"And you want me to strengthen your will power and resolve in this matter?"

              <p><span style="color: #800080;">A couple of women were playing golf one sunny Saturday morning. The first of the twosome teed off and watched in horror as her ball headed directly toward a foursome of men playing the next hole.<br><br>Indeed, the ball hit one of the men, and he immediately clasped his hands together at his crotch, fell to the ground and proceeded to roll around in evident agony.<br><br>The woman rushed down to the man and immediately began to apologize. She said, "Please allow me to help. I'm a physical therapist and I know I could relieve your pain if you'd allow."<br><br>"Ummph, oooh, nnooo, I'll be all right...I'll be fine in a few minutes," he replied breathlessly as he remained in the fetal position still clasping his hands together at his crotch.<br><br>But she persisted, and he finally allowed her to help him. She gently took his hands away and laid them to the side, she loosened his pants, and she put her hands inside. She began to massage him. She then asked him, "How does that feel?" To which he replied, "It feels great, but my thumb still hurts like hell."</span></p>

              <p>The Rude Customer:<br><br>An award should go to the Virgin Airlines gate attendant in Sydney some months ago for being smart and funny, while making her point, when confronted with a passenger who probably deserved to fly as cargo.<br><br>A crowded Virgin flight was canceled after Virgin's 767s had been withdrawn from service. A single attendant was re-booking a long line of inconvenienced travelers. Suddenly an angry passenger pushed his way to the desk.<br><br>He slapped his ticket down on the counter and said, "I HAVE to be on this flight and it HAS to be FIRST CLASS".<br><br>The attendant replied, "I'm sorry, sir. I'll be happy to try to help you, but I've got to help these people first, and I'm sure we'll be able to work something out."<br><br>The passenger was unimpressed. He asked loudly, so that the passengers behind him could hear, "DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO I AM?"<br><br>Without hesitating, the attendant smiled and grabbed her public address micro-phone: "May I have your attention please, may I have your attention please," she began - her voice heard clearly throughout the terminal.<br><br>"We have a passenger here at Gate 14 WHO DOES NOT KNOW WHO HE IS. If anyone can help him find his identity, please come to Gate 14."<br><br>With the folks behind him in line laughing hysterically, the man glared at the Virgin attendant, gritted his teeth and said, "Fuck You!"<br><br>Without flinching, she smiled and said, "I'm sorry, sir, but you'll have to get in line for that too."</p>

              <p>Little Tony was 9 years old and was staying with his grandmother for a few days.<br><br>He'd been playing outside with the other kids for a while when he came into the house and asked her, 'Grandma, what's that called when two people sleep in the same room and one is on top of the other?'<br><br>She was a little taken aback, but she decided to tell him the truth. 'It's called sexual intercourse, darling.'<br><br>Little Tony said, 'Oh, OK,' and went back outside to play with the other kids.<br><br>A few minutes later he came back in and said angrily, 'Grandma, it isn't called sexual intercourse.
