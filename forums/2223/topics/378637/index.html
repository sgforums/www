              <p>In Little Johnny's classroom, the teacher gave the class a homework
              assignment. She wanted them to tell the class one talent that they had
              and that they were especially good at.<br> <br> The next day the Teacher calls on Mary. Mary got up and said "I've been
              taking piano lessons for 2 years. The teacher told Mary that was very
              good.<br> <br> After all of the other students told about their talent, the teacher
              doesn't have a choice but to let Little Johnny have his turn. She
              doesn't want to call on him because she is scared of what he is going
              to say.<br> <br> She asked Little Johnny to tell the class about his special talent.<br> <br> He stood up and said, " This is my special talent". Then he stuck his tongue out.<br> <br> The teacher said, "Little Johnny, I don't understand." "How is your tongue a special talent"?<br> <br> Little Johnny said, "See this ball where my tongue is pierced? My
              babysitter said that was a special talent because not every boy that
              she baby sits for has a pussy grinder!"</p>

              <p><span style="color: #800080;">A couple of women were playing golf one sunny Saturday morning. The
              first of the twosome teed off and watched in horror as her ball headed
              directly toward a foursome of men playing the next hole. <br><br> Indeed, the ball hit one of the men, and he immediately clasped his
              hands together at his crotch, fell to the ground and proceeded to roll
              around in evident agony.<br><br> The woman rushed down to the man and immediately began to apologize.
              She said, "Please allow me to help. I'm a physical therapist and I know
              I could relieve your pain if you'd allow."<br><br> "Ummph, oooh, nnooo, I'll be all right...I'll be fine in a few
              minutes," he replied breathlessly as he remained in the fetal position
              still clasping his hands together at his crotch.<br><br> But she persisted, and he finally allowed her to help him. She gently
              took his hands away and laid them to the side, she loosened his pants,
              and she put her hands inside. She began to massage him. She then asked
              him, "How does that feel?" To which he replied, "It feels great, but my
              thumb still hurts like hell."</span></p>

              <p>The Rude Customer:<br> <br> An award should go to the Virgin Airlines gate attendant in Sydney some
                  months ago for being smart and funny, while making her point, when
                  confronted with a passenger who probably deserved to fly as cargo. <br> <br> A crowded Virgin flight was canceled after Virgin's 767s had been
                  withdrawn from service. A single attendant was re-booking a long line
                  of inconvenienced travelers. Suddenly an angry passenger pushed his way
                  to the desk. <br> <br> He slapped his ticket down on the counter and said, "I HAVE to be on this flight and it HAS to be FIRST CLASS". <br> <br> The attendant replied, "I'm sorry, sir. I'll be happy to try to help
                  you, but I've got to help these people first, and I'm sure we'll be
                  able to work something out." <br> <br> The passenger was unimpressed. He asked loudly, so that the passengers behind him could hear, "DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO I AM?" <br> <br> Without hesitating, the attendant smiled and grabbed her public address
                  micro-phone: "May I have your attention please, may I have your
                  attention please," she began - her voice heard clearly throughout the
                  terminal. <br> <br> "We have a passenger here at Gate 14 WHO DOES NOT KNOW WHO HE IS. If
                  anyone can help him find his identity, please come to Gate 14." <br> <br> With the folks behind him in line laughing hysterically, the man glared
                  at the Virgin attendant, gritted his teeth and said, "Fuck You!" <br> <br> Without flinching, she smiled and said, "I'm sorry, sir, but you'll have to get in line for that too."</p>

              <div id="post_message_4203848"><span style="color: #993366;">Jill and John got married. John thought this would be a "marriage of the 90's" ....equal roles for equal partners.<br><br> So, the first morning back from their honeymoon, he brought Jill
                  breakfast in bed. Jill wasn't impressed with his culinary skills,
                  however. <br><br> She looked disdainfully at the tray, and snorted, "Poached? I wanted
                  scrambled!" Undaunted, the next morning, John brought his true love a
                  scrambled egg. Jill wasn't having any of it. "Do you think I don't like
                  variety? I wanted poached this morning!"<br><br> Determined to please Jill, the next morning he thought, "third time's a
                  charm" and brought her two eggs....one scrambled and one poached.<br><br> "Here, my love, enjoy!" Jill looks at the plate and says, "You scrambled the wrong egg."<br><br> One of my daughter's wedding presents was a toaster oven. Soon after
                  the honeymoon, she and her husband tried it out. Almost immediately,
                  smoke billowed out of the toaster. <br><br> "Get the owner's manual!" her husband shouted. "I can't find it
                  anywhere!" she cried, searching through the box. "Oops!" came a voice
                  from the kitchen.<br><br> "Well, the toast is fine, but the owner's manual is burnt to a crisp."   </span></div>

              <p>An Irishman walks into a bar and asks for two beers. He then pulls a
              small green-skinned man out of his pocket and puts him on the counter.
              As he's drinking one drink and the green man is drinking the other, an
              Englishman down the bar who has had a few too many drinks says "Hey,
              what's that little green thing down there?"<br> <br> The green man runs down the bar gives the Englishman a raspberry, SPLBLBLBLT! right in the face and runs back to the Irishman.<br> <br> The Englishman mops himself off and says to the Irishman, "Hey, what is that thing, anyway?"<br> <br> The Irishman replies, "Have some respect. He's a leprechaun."<br> <br> "Oh, all right," the Englishman says sullenly. They all go back to drinking beer.<br> <br> An hour or so later, the Englishman is really plastered. "Boy, that
              leprechaun sure is an ugly little b*stard!" he says. The leprechaun
              runs down the bar and gives the Englishman a raspberry again-
              SPLBLBLBLBT!<br> <br> This time the Englishman is really mad! "Tell that leprechaun that if he does that again I'll cut his dick off!" he shouts.<br> <br> "You can't do that" says the Irishman. "Leprechauns don't have those."<br> <br> "How do they pee, then?" asks the bewildered Englishman.<br> <br> "They don't," says the Irishman. "They go SPLBLBLBLBT."</p>
