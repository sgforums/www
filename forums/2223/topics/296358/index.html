            <div class='col-md body'>Devilplot was walking through the woods.<br><br>"What majestic trees!"<br>"What powerful rivers!"<br>"What beautiful animals!"<br>He said to himself.<br><br>As he was walking alongside the river, he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him. He turned to look. He saw a 7-foot grizzly bear charge towards him.<br><br>He ran as fast as he could up the path. He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing in on him.<br><br>He looked over his shoulder again, and the bear was even closer. He tripped and fell on the ground.
