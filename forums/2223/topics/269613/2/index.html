            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by JerzZzzZ:</div><div class="quote_body">You see, in Algebra, they give you a problem.  From the problem, you can assume a + b = c, for a reason.<br><br>I.e. They say, James gave an unknown amount of apple to Jeremy, so did Jane.<br><br>By letting amt of apples James and Jane gave be 'a' and 'b' respectively, and amt of apples Jeremy received be 'c', we can assume a + b = c. But in this case, the assumption is baseless, and you cannot proceed to solve an equation you just made up from nowhere. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div></blockquote>Jerzz, the eqn a + b - c = 0  does not need a base/question/story per say in order to "mean something". By itself, in its raw form if you may, its just simply 3 variables (a, b and c) amounting to a value of 0. Perhaps due to the systematic mathematical education of our Singaporean education, it has lead most of us to attribute Algebra solely to its APPLICATION without appreciating its fundamental qualities. To quote an article in Wikipedia regarding Algebra:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"... While in arithmetic only numbers and their arithmetical operations (such as +, - , Ã—, Ã·) occur, in algebra one also uses symbols (such as x and y, or a and b) to denote numbers. These are called variables. This is useful because:<br><br>* It allows the generalization of arithmetical equations (and inequalities) to be stated as laws (such as a + b = b + a for all a and b), and thus is the first step to the systematic study of the properties of the real number system.<br>* It allows reference to numbers which are not known. In the context of a problem, a variable may represent a certain value of which is uncertain, but may be solved through the formulation and manipulation of equations.<br>* It allows the exploration of mathematical relationships between quantities (such as "if you sell x tickets, then your profit will be 3x - 10 dollars" )..."</span><br><br>The very basic a + b = c, by itself, may seem "baseless", but in reality, its simply a representation of fixed numbers of figures, governed by Algebraic Laws of equality, that through formulation and manipulation of equations, the solver is able to derive the deterministic value of a, b and c concerning the mathematical study of structure, relation and quantity.<br><br>For the sake of the argument and the "jist of the joke", since there isn't any situation/question/problem/story associated with the eqn, simply manipulation of the figures, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as long as its fulfills the Algebraic Laws of equality</span>, is just fine.<br><br>What do I mean by that?<br><br>I.e.<br>Suppose a = b and b = c, then a = c (transitivity of equality).<br><br>Suppose a = a (reflexivity of equality).<br><br>Suppose a = b then b = a (symmetry of equality).<br><br>Suppose a = b then a + c = b + c for any c (addition property of equality).<br><br>Suppose a = b then ac = bc for any c (multiplication property of equality).<br><br>Suppose two symbols are equal, then one can be substituted for the other at will (substitution principle).<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>I can go on and on, but thats besides the point. The fact is that any Algebraic eqn is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">forever</span> hold true, as long as it is constructed and manipulated under the Algebraic Laws of equality, even though the end result of the manipulation does not necessarily solve the deterministic values of the eqn.<br><br>No doubt it might initially appear "baseless" and IS indeed formed from nowhere, it does not necessarily make it unsolvable just because of the word "Suppose".<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by eagle:</div><div class="quote_body">Theorem: 3=4<br>Proof:<br><br>Suppose:<br>a + b = c<br><br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>Take the constants out of the brackets:<br>4 * (a+b-c) = 3 * (a+b-c)<br><br>Remove the same term left and right:<br>4 = 3</div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by JerzZzzZ:</div><div class="quote_body">Actually, I believe it can. The error should be in the 'Suppose a+b=c' part. You might as well 'Suppose 3=4', saves you the trouble of doing the maths part.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>And that is why I said the error was in a+b-c=0, because you can 'suppose' anything. Okay, maybe error is the wrong word.<br><br></div></blockquote>Now, the fallacy and ultimately the "jist" of the joke is NOT caused by the word SUPPOSE but rather, the operation of dividing both sides by (a+b-c) goes directly against the basic Algebraic Laws of equality! With the "bastardized" end result of 5=4, the joke proceeds to conclude that 5 does indeed equal to 4, even after going through a series of meaningful Algebraic manipulation which ultimately went wrong at the illegal division operation.<br><br>And that, my friend, is what makes this all "funny".<br><br>Edit: Typos.<br><br></div>
