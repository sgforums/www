            <div class='col-md body'>Things I Learned From Movies<br><br>1. If being chased through town, you can usually take cover in a passing St Patrick's Day parade - at any time of the year.<br>2. All beds have special L-shaped top sheets that reach up to armpit level on a woman but only waist level on the man lying beside her.<br><br>3. All grocery shopping bags contain at least one stick of French bread.<br><br>4. Once applied, lipstick will never rub off - even while scuba diving.<br><br>5. The ventilation system of any building is a perfect hiding place. No one will ever think of looking for you in there and you can travel to any other part of the building without difficulty.<br><br>6. Should you wish to pass yourself off as a German officer, it will not be necessary to speak the language. A German accent will do.<br><br>7. The Eiffel Tower can be seen from any window of any building in Paris.<br><br>8. A man will show no pain while taking the most ferocious beating but will wince when a woman tries to clean his wounds.<br><br>9. When paying for a taxi, never look at your wallet as you take out a note - just grab one at random and hand it over. It will always be the exact fare.<br><br>10. If you lose a hand, it will cause the stump of your arm to grow by 15cm.<br><br>11. Mothers routinely cook eggs, bacon and waffles for their family every morning, even though the husband and children never have time to eat them.<br><br>12. Cars and trucks that crash will almost always burst into flames.<br><br>13. A single match will be sufficient to light up a room the size of a football stadium.<br><br>14. Medieval peasants had perfect teeth.<br><br>15. All single women have a cat.<br><br>16. Any person waking from a nightmare will sit bolt upright and pant.<br><br>17. One man shooting at 20 men has a better chance of killing them all than 20 men firing at one.<br><br>18. Creepy music coming from a graveyard should always be closely investigated.<br><br>19. Most people keep a scrapbook of newspaper cuttings - especially if any of their family or friends has died in a strange boating accident.<br><br>20. It does not matter if you are heavily outnumbered in a fight involved martial arts - your enemies will wait patiently to attack you one by one by dancing around in a threatening manner until you have knocked out their predecessor.<br><br>21. During a very emotional confrontation, instead of facing the person you are speaking to, it is customary to stand behind them and talk to their back.<br><br>22. When you turn out the light to go to bed, everything in your room will still be clearly visible, just slightly bluish.<br><br>23. Dogs always know who's bad and will naturally bark at them.<br><br>24. When they are alone, all foreigners prefer to speak English to each other.<br><br>25. Rather than wasting bullets, megalomaniacs prefer to kill their arch-enemies using complicated machinery involving fuses, pulley systems, deadly gases, lasers and man eating sharks that will allow their captives at least 20 minutes to escape.<br><br>26. Having a job of any kind will make all fathers forget their son's eighth birthday.<br><br>27. Many musical instruments - especially wind instruments and accordions - can be played without moving the fingers.<br><br>28. All bombs are fitted with electronic timing devices with large red readouts so you know exactly when they're going to go off.<br><br>29. It is always possible to park directly outside the building you are visiting.<br><br>30. A detective can only solve a case once he has been suspended from duty.<br><br>31. If you decide to start dancing in the street, everyone you bump into will know all the steps.<br><br></div>
