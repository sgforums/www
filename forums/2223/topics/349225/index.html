            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><p>I went grocery shopping recently while not being altogether sure that course of action was a wise one. You see, the previous evening I had  prepared  and consumed a massive quantity of my patented 'you're definitely  going to shit yourself' chili. Tasty stuff, albeit hot to the point of  being painful,  which comes with a written guarantee from me that if you eat it, the next day both of your butt cheeks WILL fall off.<br> <br> Here's the thing. I had awakened that morning, and even after two cups  of coffee (and all of you know what I mean) nothing happened. No  'Watson's Movement 2'. Despite habanera peppers swimming their way through my  intestinal tract, I was unable to create the usual morning symphony referred to by my next door neighbors as 'thunder and lightning'.<br> <br>Knowing that a time of reckoning HAD to come, yet not sure of just  when, I bravely set off for the market, a local Wal-Mart grocery  store that I often haunt in search of tasty tidbits. Upon entering the store at  first all seemed normal. I selected a cart and began pushing it about dropping items in for purchase. It wasn't until I was at the opposite end of  the store from the restrooms that the pain hit me.<br> <br>Oh, don't look at me like you don't know what I'm talking about. I'm referring to that 'Uh, Oh, gotta go' pain that always seems to hit us at the wrong time. The thing is, this pain was different.<br> <br>The habaneras in the chili from the night before were staging a revolt. In a mad rush for freedom they bullied their way through the small intestines, forcing their way into the large intestines, and before  I could take one step in the direction of the restrooms which would bring sweet  relief, it happened. The peppers fired a warning shot.<br> <br>There I stood, alone in the spice and baking aisle, suddenly enveloped in a noxious cloud the likes of which has never before been  recorded. I was afraid to move for fear that more of this vile odor might escape me. Slowly, oh so slowly, the pressure seemed to leave the lower part of  my body, and I began to move up the aisle and out of it, just as an elderly  woman turned into it.<br> <br>I don't know what made me do it, but I stopped to see what her reaction would be to the malodorous effluvium that refused to dissipate. Have you ever been torn in two different directions emotionally? Here's  what I mean, and I'm sure some of you at least will be able to relate. I  could've warned that poor woman but didn't. I simply watched as she walked  into an invisible, and apparently indestructible, wall of odor so terrible that<br>  all she could do before gathering her senses and running, was to  stand there blinking and waving her arms about her head as though trying  to ward off angry bees. This, of course, made me feel terrible, but then made me laugh.<br><br>.......BIG mistake!!!!!<br> <br> Here's the thing. When you laugh, it's hard to keep things 'clamped down', if you know what I mean. With each new guffaw an explosive  issue burst forth  from my nether region. Some were so loud and echoing  that I was later told a few folks in other aisles had ducked, fearing that someone  was robbing the store and firing off a shotgun.<br> <br>Suddenly things were no longer funny. 'It' was coming, and I raced off through the store towards the restrooms, laying down a cloud the whole way, praying that I'd make it before the grand mal assplosion took  place.<br><br>  Luck was on my side. Just in the nick of time I got to the john, began the inevitable 'Oh my God', floating above the toilet seat because  my ass is burning SO BAD, purging. One poor fellow walked in while I was in the middle of what is the true meaning of 'Shock and Awe' . He made a gagging sound, and disgustedly said, 'Son of a bitch!', then quickly left.<br> <br>Once finished I left the restroom, reacquired my partially filled cart intending to carry on with my shopping when a store employee approached me and said, 'Sir, you might want to step outside for a few minutes.  It appears some prankster set off a stink bomb in the store. The  manager is going to run the vent fans on high for a minute or two which ought to take care of the problem.'<br> <br>That of course set me off again, causing residual gases to escape me. The employee took one sniff, jumped back pulling his shirt up to cover  his nose and, pointing at me in an accusing manner shouted, 'IT'S YOU!', then ran off returning moments later with the manager. I was  unceremoniously escorted from the premises and asked none too kindly not to return.<br> <br>Home again without having shopped, I realized that there was nothing to eat but leftover chili, so I consumed two more bowls. The next day I went to shop at Albertson's. I can't say anymore about that because we are in court over the whole matter. Bastards claim they're going to have to  repaint the store..</p></div>
