            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Why We Love Children</strong><br><br>&gt;   1.  A kindergarten pupil told his teacher he'd found a cat, but it was<br>&gt;dead.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    "How do you know that the cat was dead?" she asked her pupil.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   "Because I pissed in its ear and it didn't move," answered the child<br>&gt;innocently.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   You did   WHAT ? ! ?"    the teacher  exclaimed in surprise.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   "You know,"explained the boy,<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    "I leaned over  and went 'Pssst!' and<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    it didn't move."<br><br>&gt;   2. A  small boy is sent to bed by his father.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   Five minutes  later....."Da-ad...."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   "What?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   "I'm thirsty. Can you bring  drink of water?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   "No, You had your chance. Lights out."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   Five  minutes later: "Da-aaaad....."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   "WHAT?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   "I'm THIRSTY. Can I  have a drink of water??"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   I told you NO! If you ask again, I'll have to  spank you!!"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   Five minutes later......"Daaaa-aaaad....."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   "WHAT!"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   "When you come in to spank me, can you bring a drink  of water?"<br><br>&gt;   3.  An exasperated mother, whose son was always getting into mischief,<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   finally asked him "How do you expect to get into Heaven?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   The  boy thought it over and said,<br>&gt;   "Well, I'll run in and out and in and out and  keep slamming the door<br>&gt;   until St. Peter says, 'For Heaven's sake, Dylan,  come in or stay out!'"<br><br>&gt;   4. One summer evening during a violent thunderstorm<br>&gt;   a  mother was tucking her son into bed.<br>&gt;   She was about to turn off the light  when he asked with a tremor in his<br>&gt;voice, "Mommy, will you sleep with me  tonight?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   The mother smiled and gave him a reassuring hug.<br>&gt;   "I can't  dear," she said. "I have to sleep in Daddy's room."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   A long silence was  broken at last by his shaky little voice:<br>&gt;        "The  big sissy."<br><br>&gt;   5.  It was that time, during the Sunday morning service, for the<br>&gt;children's<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   sermon. All the children were invited to come forward.<br>&gt;   One little  girl was wearing a particularly pretty dress and,<br>&gt;   as she sat down, the  pastor leaned over and said,<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   "That is a very pretty dress. Is it your  Easter Dress?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   The little girl replied, directly into the pastor's  clip-on microphone,<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   "Yes, and my Mom says it's a bitch to iron."<br><br>&gt;   6.  When I was six months pregnant with my third child, my three year old<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   came into the room when I was just getting ready to get into<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   the shower. She said, "Mommy, you are getting fat!"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   I replied,  "Yes, honey, remember Mommy has a baby growing in her<br>&gt;tummy."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   "I  know," she replied, but what's growing in your butt?"<br><br>&gt;   7. A  little boy was doing his math homework. He said to himself,<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   "Two plus  five, that son of a bitch is seven.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   Three plus six, that son of a  bitch is nine...."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   His mother heard what he was saying and gasped,  "What are you doing?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   The little boy answered, "I'm doing my math  homework, Mom."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   "And this is how your teacher taught you to do it?"  the mother asked.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   "Yes," he answered.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   Infuriated, the mother  asked the teacher the next day, "What are you<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   teaching my son in  math?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   The teacher replied, "Right now, we are learning addition."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   The mother asked, "And are you teaching them to say two plus two, that<br>&gt;son<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   of a bitch is four?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   After the teacher stopped laughing,  she answered, "What I taught them<br>&gt;was,<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   two plus two, THE SUM OF WHICH ,  is four."<br><br>&gt;   8. One  day the first grade teacher was reading the story of Chicken<br>&gt;Little<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   to  her class. She came to the part of the story where Chicken Little<br>&gt;tried<br>&gt;   to  warn the farmer. She read, ".... and so Chicken<br>&gt;   Little went up to the  farmer and said, "The sky is falling, the sky is<br>&gt;falling!"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   The teacher  paused then asked the class,<br>&gt;   "And what do you think that farmer  said?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   One little girl raised her hand and said,<br>&gt;   "I think he  said: 'Holy Shit! A talking chicken!'"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   The teacher was unable to teach  for the next 10 minutes.<br><br>&gt;   9. A  certain little girl, when asked her name, would reply,<br>&gt;        "I'm Mr. Sugarbrown's daughter."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   Her mother told her this was wrong,  she must say, "I'm Jane<br>&gt;Sugarbrown."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   The Vicar spoke to her in Sunday  School, and said,<br>&gt;   "Aren't you Mr. Sugarbrown's daughter?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   She  replied, "I thought I was, but mother says I'm not."<br><br>&gt;   10. A  little girl asked her mother, "Can I go outside and play with the<br>&gt;boys?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   Her mother replied, "No, you can't play with the boys, they're too<br>&gt;rough."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   The little girl thought about it for a few moments and asked,<br>&gt;   "If I can find a smooth one, can I play with him?"<br><br>&gt;   11. A little girl goes to the barber shop with her  father.<br>&gt;   She stands next to the barber chair, while her dad gets his hair  cut,<br>&gt;   eating a snack cake<br>&gt;   The barber says to her, "Sweetheart, you're  gonna get hair on your<br>&gt;Twinkie."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   She says, "Yes, I know, and I'm gonna  get boobs too."</div>
