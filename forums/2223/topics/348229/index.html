              <p>Disclaimer: Some might find it a teeny weeny racist...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A priest, a Pentecostal preacher, and a rabbi all served as chaplains
              to the students of Northern Michigan University in Marquette. They
              would get together two or three times a week for coffee and to talk
              shop.<br><br>One day, someone made the comment that preaching to people
              isn't really all that hard. A real challenge would be to preach to a
              bear. One thing led to another, and they decided to do an experiment.
              They would all go out into the woods, find a bear, preach to it, and
              attempt to convert it.<br><br>Seven days later, they all came together to discuss their experience.<br><br>Father
              Flannery, who had his arm in a sling, was on crutches, and had various
              bandages on his body and limbs, went first. "Well," he said, "I went
              into the woods to find me a bear. And when I found him, I began to read
              to him from the Catechism. Well, that bear wanted nothing to do with me
              and began to slap me around. So I quickly grabbed my holy water,
              sprinkled him and, Holy Mary Mother of God, he became as gentle as a
              lamb. The bishop is coming out next week to give him first communion
              and confirmation."<br><br>Reverend Billy Bob spoke next. He was in a
              wheelchair, had one arm and both legs in casts, and had an IV drip. In
              his best fire-and-brimstone oratory, he claimed, "WELL, brothers, you
              KNOW that we don't sprinkle! I went out and I FOUND me a bear. And then
              I began to read to my bear from God's HOLY WORD! But that bear wanted
              nothing to do with me.<br>So I took HOLD of him and we began to
              wrestle. We wrestled down one hill, UP another and DOWN another until
              we came to a creek. So I quickly DUNKED him and BAPTIZED his hairy
              soul. And just like you said, he became as gentle as a lamb.<br>We spent the rest of the day praising Jesus."<br><br>The
              priest and the reverend both looked down at the rabbi, who was lying in
              a hospital bed. He was in a body cast and traction with IVs and
              monitors running in and out of him. He was in really bad shape. The
              Rabbi looked up and said, "Looking back on it, circumcision may not
              have been the best way to start."</p>
