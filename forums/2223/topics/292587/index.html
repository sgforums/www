            <div class='col-md body'>1. You were on a horse the minute you could walk.<br><br>2. You actually like the smell of horse crap.<br><br>3. You start to tear up when you hear of horse being served at a resturant or as dog food.<br><br>4. You gasp every time a horse dies in a war movie.<br><br>5. You love riding an animal that is skittish and could possibly kill you.<br><br>6. You keep finding pieces of straw in your hair.<br><br>7. You go to the saddlery just to buy boots but end up buying the whole store.<br><br>8. You have your own saddle blanket, grooming kit, riding clothes and books on how to look after ponies but no horse.<br><br>9. You've fallen off a horse at least once.<br><br>10. You have arguments with people over how horses are far superior to cows and dogs.<br><br>11. You try to move..say your dog..or cat..mabye a goldfish.. or perhaps trying to tell your friend to move..by clucking...<br><br>12. If your driving/ in the passengers seat of the car and you know your about to move into the next lane...so you TRY to use your inside leg to move over....then you realize..wow...how obsessed am i.<br><br>13. you've considered killing someone when they said it wasn't a real sport<br><br>14. you find yourself trying to use your back and seat to make the car go faster<br><br>15. you have given up on having fingernails<br><br>16. you actually enjoying being hurled to the ground after time and you actually get back on<br><br>17. you find it fun to scare beginners by pretending to be out of control<br><br>18. you STILL haven't grown out of the horse phase<br><br>19. You are totally grossed out by human hair in the sink or tub, but donÂ’t mind horse hair in your washer, on your clothes, in your foodÂ…<br><br>20. Someone says, Â“Does anyone have a screwdriver?Â” and you hand them a hoof pick.<br><br>21. The real estate agent asks what kind of house you are looking for and you say, Â“more than six acresÂ”.<br><br>22. You find yourself analyzing leg and foot conformation o your friends, and think how corrective shoeing could improve their way of going.<br><br>23. You run your tongue over your back molars and idly wonder if they need to be floated.<br><br>24. You can find your boots in the dark by the manure aroma.<br><br>25. You drive in the yard, get out of the car and inhale the perfume of the manure pile.<br><br>26.You donÂ’t notice the barn smells on your clothing and wonder why Â“regularÂ” folks are sniffing the air.<br><br>27. Your first sign of spring is not seeing a robin, but a fly.<br><br>28. You go to the gas station and ask the attendant to check the Â“off hindÂ” (and -you know youÂ’re in horse country when they walk to the right rear tire!)<br><br>29. Your car is the only one in the company parking lot that has an inch of dust INSIDE and when you open the door, a swarm of flies emerges.<br><br>30. Your mother has a run in the bottom of her hose and you tell her she has a split hoof.<br><br>31. you teach your little brother to skip by getting him to Â“canterÂ” and then Â“switch leadsÂ” until heÂ’s doing a one-tempi flyin changes(skipping!)<br><br>32. Your truck looks like a bomb exploded in a tack shop.<br><br>33. When your husband walks into the bedroom and sees you wearing your underwear and tall black boots and his only comment is Â“oh, did your new boots finally arrive?Â”<br><br>34. You father gets worried when he overhears you talking go a friend: Â“And he had the cutest butt! I happened to be behind him for a while, and practically couldnÂ’t take my eyes off his butt. And he had really nice legs, and a real strong back, and nice shoulders, and *such* a pretty face! He came over to say hello once. What a handsome guy!Â” when you tell him that you were talking about a horse, heÂ’s not sure whether to be reassured or get even more worried.<br><br>35. Your motto is Â“baling twine will fix anythingÂ”.<br><br>36. You cluck to your car when you go up a hill.<br><br>37. Your horseÂ’s hair is in better condition than your own.<br><br>38. you refer to your car as Â“my portable tack roomÂ”<br><br>39.You are excited when your friend tells you that there is a huge sale at the bridle shop, then you are disappointed when you realize she meant the bridal -shop.<br><br>40. You have the vetÂ’s number but not your kidÂ’s pediatrician on speed dial.<br><br>41. Your spouse can track dirt into the house all they want, but God help them if they muddy up the tack room.<br><br>42. Your house is a mess, but the barn is as neat as a pin.<br><br>43. Your nice clothes are the ones without horse hair all over them.<br><br>44. You have to go to your friendÂ’s wedding in riding clothes because you took too long at the barn.<br><br>45. Only horse people would spend hundreds of dollars on a show for a 95 cent ribbon.</div>
