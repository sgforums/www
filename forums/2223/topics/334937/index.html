              <p>Q: How many Man United fans does it take to change a light bulb?<br> A: 560,001. That is 1 to change it, 60,000 to say they've been changing it for
              years and 500,000 to buy the replica kit.</p>

              <p>A Spurs fan and an Ars*nal fan get into a car accident, and it's a bad one. <br> Both cars (with football stickers on windows) are totally demolished, but amazingly neither of them is hurt. <br> After they crawl out of their cars, the Spurs fan says, "So you're an
              Ars*nal fan, that's interesting. I'm a Spurs fan... Wow! Just look at
              our cars, there's nothing left, but fortunately we are unhurt. This
              must be a sign from God that we should meet and be friends and live
              together in peace the rest of our days." <br> The Ars*nal fan replied," I agree with you completely; this must be a sign from God! <br> The Spurs fan continued, "And look at this - here's another miracle. My
              car is completely demolished but this bottle of whisky didn't break.
              Surely God wants us to drink this and celebrate our good fortune." <br> Then he hands the bottle to the Ars*nal fan. <br> The Ars*nal fan nods his head in agreement, opens it and takes a few
              big swigs from the bottle, then handing it back to the Spurs fan. <br> The Spurs fan takes the bottle, immediately puts the cap back on, and hands it back to the Ars*nal fan. <br> The Ars*nal fan asks, "Aren't you having any?" <br> The Spurs fan replies, "No. I think I will just wait for the police..."</p>

              <p>38. Graham Taylor was wheeling his shopping trolley across the supermarket
              car park when he noticed an old lady struggling with her shopping.</p>
              <p>He stopped and asked, "Can you manage dear?"
              to which the old lady replied, "no way you got yourself into this mess, don't ask me to sort it out!"</p>

              A bloke goes into Stanstead Airport and manages to eventually
              get into the departure lounge where his flight home is being called.
              All around him there are overturned tables, smashed windows, computer terminals broken, upturned chairs
              and crowd control barriers lying on the floor.</p>
              <p>"Christ, what's happened here?" he asks one of the ground crew.</p>
              <p>"Oh yeah...", he replies "Absolutely hopeless .... we had the Chelsea players in here this morning filming the new Nike ad".</p>

              A Bloke walks into a bric-a-brac shop and sees an ornamental brass rat,
              the sort of thing women of a certain age love to put on the mantlepiece.
              He thinks "that'll be perfect for his Mother's birthday",
              so he asks the shopkeeper how much it is.</p>
              <p>"£25 for the rat, £100 for the story", replies the man.</p>
              <p>"Forget the story" says the bloke, and so buys the rat for 25 quid.
              He walks off down the road, but has not gone 30 yards when a rat comes
              up from the gutter and starts to follow him. Soon more arrive, and in
              a few minutes the whole street is a sea of rats, all following the
              bloke, who keeps walking until he comes to a cliff.
              He throws the brass rat over, and millions of rats follow, one
              after each other, plunging to certain death. The bloke them runs back to shop.....</p>
              <p>"Aaaah", says the shop keeper, "you'll be back for the story"</p>
              <p>"Screw the story - do you have a brass man utd fan?"</p>

              A nurse at Birmingham General Infirmary told an industrial tribunal how
              she tried to stop the fight between two top doctors which resulted in one
              of them being sacked by the hospital.</p>
              <p>"I pulled them apart" said Alice Magee, 32, "and could see Dr Cage was
              in tears. I asked him what it was about and he sobbed 'It's that man on
              E-ward, you know, that one with the Man United pyjamas. Doctor Harper has
              just told him that he's only got two weeks left to live'. I told him
              there was nothing more we could do for him and he had to be told.</p>
              <p>Dr Cage said 'I know that, but I wanted to tell the bastard'"
              The incident follows a complaint from a patient in August of last year
              when Dr Cage told a cancer victim he had some good news and some bad news</p>
              <p>"The bad news is you're going to die" "and the good news ?" asked the downcast patient "we beat the scum 2-1!"</p>

              A Rangers and Celtic fan get into a nasty car accident.
              Both vehicles are really wrecked, but amazingly
              neither of them are hurt.</p>
              <p>After they crawl out of their cars,
              the Celtic fan says, "So you're a Rangers fan,
              that's interesting. I'm a Celtic fan... Wow! Just look at our cars.
              There's nothing left, but fortunately we are unhurt.
              This must be a sign from God that we should meet and be friends
              and live together in peace the rest of our days."</p>
              <p>The Rangers fan replied,"Totally agree - this must be
              a sign from God!" The Rangers fan went on, "And look at this
              - here's another miracle. My car is completely demolished but
              this bottle of whisky didn't break. Surely God wants us
              to drink it, to celebrate the fact we are alive and kicking?"</p>
              <p>He hands the bottle to the Celtic fan who nods his head in agreement,
              opens it and takes few big swigs from the bottle, then hands
              it back to the Rangers fan. The Rangers fan takes the bottle,
              immediately puts the cap back on, and hands back to the Celtic
              fan. The Celtic fan asks, "Aren't you having any?" The Rangers
              fan replies, "Nah...I think I'll just wait for the police......"</p>

              An Aberdeen fan is trapped on a remote desert island with a sheep and a dog.
              Soon, the sheep starts looking really attractive to the Aberdeen fan.
              However, whenever he approaches a sheep the dog growls in a threatening manner.</p>
              <p>The Aberdeen fan takes the dog to the opposite side of the island
              giving it some food as a distraction. He runs back to the sheep only
              to find the dog growling at him.
              The Aberdeen fan ties the dog to a tree with a large leash.
              He goes back to the sheep only to find the dog growling with
              a gnawed off leash around its neck.</p>
              <p>By now, Aberdeen fan is getting depressed and frustrated. As he
              sits under a palm tree staring out to sea, a beautiful woman in a
              tight-fitting wet suit emerges from the surf.</p>
              <p>She asks him who he is and, taking pity upon his lonely state,
              asks if there's ANYTHING she could do for him.
              The Aberdeen fan thinks for a moment and then responds, "Could you take the dog for a walk?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>45. A white van driver used to keep himself amused by scaring witless every
              Glasgow Rangers fan he saw sauntering down High common road in his blue and white
              uniform. He would swerve as if to hit them, and at the last minute, swerve back
              onto the road.</p>
              <p>One day as he was driving along the road, he saw a priest hitch-hiking.
              He thought he would do his good deed for the day and offer the priest a lift.</p>
              <p>"Where are you off tae, Father?" he asked.</p>
              <p>"I'm going to give Mass at St Michaels's church - it's aboot 2 miles down the road,".</p>
              <p>"Nae worries," said the driver, "Hop in and I'll gee ya a lift."</p>
              <p>The happy priest climbed into the van and they set off down the road.
              Suddenly the driver caught site of a Hun on the pavement, and
              instinctively swerved as if to hit him, but just in time, remembering
              the priest in his van, swerved back to the road again, narrowly missing
              the idiot.  Although he was certain that he didn't hit him, however,
              he still heard a loud "Thud".  Not understanding where the noise came
              from, he glanced in his mirrors, and, seeing nothing, said to the
              priest, "Oh sorry Father, I nearly hit that Rangers Fan walking down the road there."</p>
              <p>"No need to apologise Sonny," replied Father, "I got the ba$tard with the door!"</p>
