              <p>By continuously being the anti-social, he successfully made his threads here in sgForums one of the highly read threads (<em>all thanks to us going into his threads to scold him and bicker with him</em>).</p>
              <p>And in doing so, he knows that we will be expecting him to write up a post in his blog to flame us all.. And again suceeded in making his blog visit activity go up..</p>
              <p>It's like I said, he's been so attention seeking that he knows damn well how to get people's attention.. He'll do well in the advertising industry man, provided he doesnt offend anymore colleagues, and also provided he manage to finish secondary school and go on to tertiary and university education..</p>
