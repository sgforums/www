              <p>well.. gd and bad for such 'anti-PAP' publicity... although i myself don't support such comments, but what to do, I'm not the only Singaporean here. Everyone should have their say, voice out their grievances or anger or emotions in one way or another. If not, living in such a hectic city can make one die out of air..</p>
              <p>but as one of our people, i wish that such emotions only stays in such informal areas like casual blogs etc.. pls don't bring it up to the streets, the parliament esp..</p>
              <p>I just hate to see how leaders of countries like taiwan fight (literally fight, punches and kicks flying) in their parliament meeting...</p>
              <p>Governing parties in countries like thailand or even some angmoh developed countries brought down by opposition parties before they can finish their term until the next election.. urgent policies have to go through so many parties arguing for their own benefits and still cnt settle for a decision.. &amp; violent riots on the streets where shops are destroyed, people die..</p>
              <p>I trust that my fellow Singaporean are smart. We won't do all these because we know that while we have our rights, we hold the responsibility for the precious peace we enjoy now. We can argue how our leaders react to certain situations, we can reflect to the government on how policies are affecting our daily lives, we can even let our emotions run freely in a casual blog like these, even though its something against the governing party, but pls be cool, my fellow Singaporeans..</p>
              <p>Don't act hooligan, of course don't really be one also... </p>
              <p>I'm just voicing out as a singaporean here, not against anyone, not with anyone..</p>
