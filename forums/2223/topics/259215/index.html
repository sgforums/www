            <div class='col-md body'>A little boy runs across this farmer who has a truckload of cow manure. The boy asks him what he is going to do with all that cow poop. The farmer tells the little boy, ''I'm taking it home to put on my strawberries.''<br><br>The little boy looks up at the farmer and says, ''I don't know where you come from, but where I come from we put cream and sugar on our strawberries.'''<br><br>***<br><br>A Frenchman, an Englishman and a New Yorker were exploring the jungle and were captured by a fierce tribe. As they sit in a hut, awaiting their fate, the chief comes to them and says, "The bad news is that now that we've caught you, we're going to kill you, and then use your skins to build a canoe. The good news is that you get to choose how you die."<br><br>The Frenchman says, "I take ze poison." The chief gives him some poison, the Frenchman says, "Vive la France!" and drinks it down.<br><br>The Englishman says, "A pistol for me, please." The chief gives him a pistol, he points it at his head, says, "God save the queen!" and blows his brains out.<br><br>The New Yorker says, "Gimme a fork." The chief is puzzled, but he shrugs and gives him a fork. The New Yorker takes the fork and starts jabbing himself all over -- the stomach, the sides, the chest, everywhere.<br><br>There's blood gushing out all over, it's horrible. The chief is appalled, and screams, "What are you doing???"<br><br>The New Yorker looks at the chief and says, "So much for your canoe,  arsshole!"<br><br>***<br><br>A first-grade teacher, Ms. Brooks, was having trouble with one of her students.<br><br>The teacher asked, "Harry, what's your problem?"<br><br>Harry answered, "I'm too smart for the 1st grade. My sister is in the 3rd grade and I'm smarter than she is! I think I should be in the 3rd grade too!"<br><br>Ms. Brooks had had enough. She took Harry to the principal's office. While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was. The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test. If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave. She agreed.<br><br>Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test.<br><br>Principal: "What is 3 x 3?"<br><br>Harry: "9".<br><br>Principal: "What is 6 x 6?"<br><br>Harry: "36".<br><br>And so it went with every question the principal thought a 3rd grader should know.<br><br>The principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, "I think Harry can go to the 3rd grade."<br><br>Ms. Brooks says to the principal, "Let me ask him some questions." The principal and Harry both agreed.<br><br>Ms. Brooks asks, "What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?" Harry, after a moment: "Legs."<br><br>Ms. Brooks: "What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?" The principal wondered, why would she ask such a question! Harry replied: "Pockets."<br><br>Ms. Brooks: "What does a dog do that a man steps into?" Harry: "Pants"<br><br>Ms. Brooks: What's starts with a C, ends with a T, is hairy, oval, delicious and contains thin, whitish liquid?<br><br>Harry: "Coconut."<br><br>The principal sat forward with his mouth hanging open.<br><br>Ms. Brooks: "What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?" The principal's eyes opened really wide and before he could stop the answer.<br><br>Harry: "Bubble gum"<br><br>Ms. Brooks: "What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?"<br><br>Harry: "Shake hands."<br><br>The principal was trembling.<br><br>Ms. Brooks: "What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' that means a lot of heat and excitement?"<br><br>Harry: "Firetruck"<br><br>The principal breathed a sigh of relief and told the teacher, "Put Harry in the fifth-grade, I got the last seven questions wrong!"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>During the Japanese Occupation, 3 Singaporeans, Ah Meng, Ah Seng and Ah Beng were caught for smuggling. They were sentenced to death by firing squad.<br><br>That night, Ah Meng came up with a plan. He told the others that the Japanese were most afraid of natural disasters. So he would cause them to panic, and escape in the confusion.<br><br>The next morning, Ah Meng was led to the wall. The firing squad was lined up and the Captain commanded, "Ready.. Aim..", but before he could complete, Ah Meng shouted, " EARTHQUAKE!! EARTHQUAKE!!" The Japanese soldiers panicked and Ah Meng made his escape.<br><br>Later, the soldiers took Ah Seng out and the firing squad were ready. The captain commanded, "Ready... Aim..." This time Ah Seng shouted. " FLOOD!! FLOOD!!" Again, the Japanese soldiers panicked and Ah Seng made his escape.<br><br>Observing all this, Ah Beng began to get the idea. "It's important to get the timing right."<br><br>Soon, it was Ah Beng's turn. "Timing, that's the key.." Ah Beng kept saying to himself. The soldiers lined up in front of him. The captain started, "Ready..."<br><br>"Timing," Ah Beng thought to himself.<br><br>"Aim..."<br><br>"Okay," thought Ah Beng, and shouted, " FIRE!! FIRE!! "<br></div>
