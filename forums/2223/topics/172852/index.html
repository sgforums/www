            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Three Wishes</span><br><br>A junior manager, a senior manager and their boss are on their way to a<br>meeting. On their way through a park, they come across a wonder lamp.<br><br>They rub the lamp and a ghost appears. The ghost says, "Normally, one is<br>granted three wishes but as you are three, I will allow one wish each"<br><br>So the eager senior manager shouted, I want the first wish. I want to be in<br>the Bahamas, on a fast boat and have no worries. "Pfufffff, and he was gone.<br><br>Now the junior manager could not keep quiet and shouted "I want to be in<br>Florida with beautiful girls, plenty of food and cocktails. "Pfufffff, and<br>he was also gone.<br><br>The boss calmly said," I want these two idiots back in the office after<br>lunch at 12.35pm"<br><br><strong>Lesson No 1</strong>: "Always allow the bosses to speak first"<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Understanding Boss's Instruction </span><br><br>Standing in front of a shredder with a piece of paper in his hand. "Listen,"<br>said the CEO, "this is a very sensitive and important document, and my<br>secretary has left. Can you make this thing work?" "Certainly," said the<br>young executive. He turned the machine on, inserted the paper, and pressed<br>the start button. "Excellent, excellent!" said the CEO as his paper<br>disappeared inside the shredder machine. "I just need one copy."<br><br><strong>Lesson 2</strong>: Never, never assume that your BOSS knows everything.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Converstion Between An American &amp; A Japanese</span><br><br>An American and a Japanese were sitting on the plane on the way to LA when<br>the American turned to the Japanese and asked, "What kind of -ese are you?"<br><br>The Japanese confused, replied, "Sorry but I don't understand what you<br>mean."<br><br>The American repeated, "What kind of -ese are you?"<br><br>Again, the Japanese was confused over the question. The American, now<br>irritated, then yelled, "What kind of -ese are you ... Are you a Chinese,<br>Japanese, Vietnamese!,etc......???"<br><br>The Japanese then replied, "Oh, I am a Japanese."<br><br>A while later the Japanese turned to the American and asked What kind of<br>'key' was he.<br><br>The American, frustrated, yelled, "What do you mean what kind of '-kee' am<br>I?!"<br><br>The Japanese said, "Are you a Yankee, donkee, or monkee?"<br><br><strong>Lesson 3</strong>: Mind your language.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pool of Wishes</span><br><br>There were these 4 guys, a Russian, a German, an American and a French, who<br>found this small genie bottle. When they rubbed the bottle, a genie<br>appeared. Thankful that the 4 guys had released him out of the bottle, He<br>said, "Next to you all are 4 swimming pools, I will give each of You a wish.<br>When you run towards the pool and jump, you shout what you<br>Want the pool of water to become, then your wish will come true."<br><br>The French wanted to start. He ran towards the pool, jumped and shouted<br>"WINE". The pool immediately changed into a pool of wine. The Frenchman was<br>so happy swimming and drinking from the pool.<br><br>Next is the Russian's turn, he did the same and shouted, "VODKA" and<br>immersed himself into a pool of vodka.<br><br>The German was next and he jumped and shouted, "BEER". He was so contented<br>with his beer pool.<br><br>The last is the American. He was running towards the pool when Suddenly he<br>steps on a banana peel. He slipped towards the pool and shouted,<br>SH*T!!!!!!!........."<br><br><strong>Lesson 4</strong>: Think twice before you say something, because sometimes accidents do happen</div>
