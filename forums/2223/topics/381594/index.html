              <p>(Written to a woman who  accidentally walked into a men's restroom...) <br> <br> Please don't feel bad, Lady. <br> <br> It wasn't you entering the men's washroom that caused that guy to pee
              on the guy next to him. Heck, we do that all the time. It's rare for us
              guys to ever hit what were aiming for. Sometimes I go into the
              washroom, start to pee, and then just start spinning around; just so
              I'll make sure I hit something. You see, something you ladies should
              understand by now is that men's penises have a mind of their own. <br> <br> A guy can go into a bathroom stall because all the urinals are being
              used, take perfect aim at the toilet, and his penis will still manage
              to piss all over the roll of toilet paper, down his left pant leg, and
              onto his shoe. I'm telling 'ya those little buggers can't be trusted. <br> <br> After being married 28 years my wife has me trained. I'm no longer
              allowed to pee like a man -standing up. I am required to sit down and
              pee. She has convinced me that this is a small price to pay. Otherwise
              if she had gone to the toilet one more time at night and either sat on
              a pee soaked toilet seat, or fell right into the <br> toilet because I forgot to put the seat down, she was going to kill me in my  sleep. <br> <br> Now another thing us guys don't usually like to talk about, but because
              you and I have become such good friends and you think I'm a classy guy,
              I might as well be candid with you because it's a rea problem,and you
              ladies need to be understanding. It's the dreaded "morning wood". <br> <br> Most mornings us guys wake up with two things. A tremendous desire to
              pee, and a penis so hard you could cut diamonds with it. Well, no
              matter how hard you try, you can't get that thing to bend, and if it
              don't bend you can't aim, well hell, if you can't aim you have no
              choice but to piss all over the wallpaper and that damn fuzzy toilet
              seat cover you women insist on putting on the toilet. <br> <br> And
              by the way, when you use those damn fuzzy toilet seat covers,the
              friggin' toilet seat won't stay up by itself. So that means we have to
              use one hand to hold up the toilet seat and the other hand to try to
              control ourselves for that perfect aim. <br> <br> Now sometimes,
              when you're newly married, (and I know the guys in here will back me up
              on this) you think you can get the toilet seat with that damn fuzzy
              thing to stay up. You jam it back and compress that fuzzy thing until
              the seat stays there. OK, so you start to pee, but then that compressed
              fuzzy starts to decompress and without warning that damn toilet seat
              comes flying down and tries to whack off your weenie. <br> <br> So
              us guys will not lift a toilet seat with a fuzzy, it's just not safe. I
              tried to delicately explain this morning situation to my wife. I told
              her... look, it won't bend. She said, "sit down like I told you to do
              all the rest of the time." OK. I tried sitting down on the toilet with
              "morning wood". Well it's is very hard to get it bent under the toilet
              seat, and before I could manage it, I had pissed all over the bath
              towels hanging on the wall across the room. <br> <br> Now, even if you are sitting down and you can get it forced down under the  toilet seat, when you <br> start to pee the pee shoots out from the crack between the bottom of
              the toilet seat and the top of the bowl. You piss all over the back of
              your knees and it runs down the back of our legs on to that damn
              matching fuzzy horseshoe rug you keep putting on the floor in front of
              the toilet. <br> <br> I have found the only effective maneuver to
              deal with this morning urinary dilemma is to assume the flying superman
              position laying over the toilet seat.This takes a great deal of
              practice, perfect balance, and split time precision but it's the only
              sure way to get all the pee in the bowl during the first morning pee.</p>
