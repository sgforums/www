Insists on speaking Hokkien even though no one understands what heÂ’s saying.<br><br>2. The smell from his uniform, created from the latest nano-technology, is to mask his natural, manly, body-odour from enemies.<br><br>3. His pocket is a reservoir of army stuff; mostly melted sweets, grass and bits of paper.<br><br>4. Always  ready with a Hollywood-inspired army story<br><br>5. Scrap that; ALL men have a Hollywood-inspired army story.<br><br>6. Trudges mud everywhere even though heÂ’s not reported for duty yet.<br><br>7.    His uniform is a time capsule Â– ketchup stain from cookhouse circa 1990, red paint from extra duty in Â’89, tear in uniform (crotch area) from sitting down, 2006.<br><br>8. His ability to sleep anywhere, in any position Â– even standing up Â– amazes you.<br><br>9. His actual duty is to generate income for canteen operators.<br><br>10. Wears a T-shirt under his uniform to stop rash cos itÂ’s not washed since the last call-up.<br><br><img src="http://img132.imageshack.us/img132/1952/thearmyreservist15613hj0.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>The MRT Hog</strong></span><br><span class="small">Nothing wakes him except the sound of the train stopping at his station</span><br><br>1. He sleeps within two seconds of his butt touching the seat.<br><br>2. Once in a while, he genuinely falls asleep and wakes himself with his own snore.<br><br>3. Has a long line of drool that hangs down his chin and follows his head movements Â– until it drips on you.<br><br>4. Takes occasional peeks to check if anyoneÂ’s on to him.<br><br>5. If someoneÂ’s taken the seat beside him, heÂ’ll put his head on their shoulders until they get irritated and move.<br><br>6. Sits with his legs wide open, as if heÂ’s smuggling jackfruits in his pants.<br><br>7. Reads over your shoulder while pretending to be asleep.<br><br>8. If he canÂ’t sleep, he will be engrossed in either his newspaper, iPod or a bit of string heÂ’s found on the floor.<br><br>9. If youÂ’ve, somehow, managed to squeeze onto his spare seat, heÂ’ll sit, crossing his legs, with his shoe on your knee.<br><br>10. If he brings his kid, the kid will stretch out over two seats.<br><br><img src="http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/7128/themrthog15713xl1.jpg"></div>

Never played a 90-minute game in his lifeÂ…<br><br>2. But smells like heÂ’s just walked off the pitch.<br><br>3. Has no girlfriend because his weekends are all about football.<br><br>4. Â‘InsiderÂ’ info regurgitated from what heÂ’s read in the papers.<br><br>5. Spends the entire Monday morning analysing the weekendÂ’s match statistics on the InternetÂ…<br><br>6. Â…but cannot remember scores from last week.<br><br>7. Refers to Liverpool in the first person but is born and bred in Bedok.<br><br>8. Disgusted with girls who like football.<br><br>9. Claims to be a lifelong fan but canÂ’t even name the squad from last season.<br><br>10. Beer gut so big, he looks like heÂ’s hiding a ball under his shirt.<br>Has no loyalty; supports whichever team thatÂ’s winning at the moment.<br><br><img src="http://img165.imageshack.us/img165/2614/thefootballjerseyfan25013mi9.jpg"></div>

DoesnÂ’t own a single album by the band.<br><br>4. CanÂ’t name a single album by the band.<br><br>5. Or name the members of the band (not even the lead singer).<br><br>6. Thinks Def Leppard is a charity animal shelter for big cats.<br><br>7. Uses three fingers for the Horned Hand sign.<br><br>8. Moshes with the metalheads at rock concerts Â– with earplugs.<br><br>9. Plays air guitar but doesn't know what guitar pick is used for.<br><br>10.
