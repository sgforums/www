They promptly hang up on me.<br> Now, I did this for about a month before it got boring, so I got an<br>added idea! I added exactly 33 cents worth of pennies to the envelope<br>so they paid EXTRA due to the weight. I got a call informing me about<br>the money, I said it was a mistake and I demanded my change back.
