            <div class='col-md body'>It obviously depends on who you ask.<br><br>DR. PHIL:<br><br>The problem we have here is that this chicken won't realize that he<br>must first deal with the problem on "THIS" side of the road before it<br>goes after the problem on the "OTHER SIDE" of the road. What we need to<br>do is help him realize how stupid he's acting by not taking on his<br>"CURRENT" problems before adding "NEW" problems.<br><br>OPRAH:<br><br>Well I understand that the chicken is having problems, which is why he<br>wants to cross this road so bad. So instead of having the chicken learn<br>from his mistakes and take falls, which is a part of life, I'm going to<br>give this chicken a car so that he can just drive across the road and<br>not live his life like the rest of the chickens.<br><br>GEORGE W BUSH:<br><br>We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to<br>know if the chicken is on our side of the road, or not. The chicken is<br>either against us, or for us. There is no middle ground here.<br><br>COLIN POWELL:<br><br>Now, to the left of the screen, you can clearly see the satellite image<br>of the chicken crossing the road.<br><br>HANS BLIX:<br><br>We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not yet been<br>allowed to have access to the other side of the road.<br><br>JOHN KERRY:<br><br>Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road, I am now against<br>it! It was the wrong road to cross, and I was misled about the<br>chicken's intentions. I am for it now, and will remain against it.<br><br>PAT BUCHANAN:<br><br>To steal the job of a decent, hardworking American.<br><br>MARTHA STEWART:<br><br>No one called me to warn me which way that chicken was going. I had a<br>standing order at the Farmer's Market to sell my eggs when the price<br>dropped to a certain level. No little bird gave me any insider<br>information.<br><br>DR SEUSS:<br><br>Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes, the<br>chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed I've not been told.<br><br>ERNEST HEMINGWAY:<br><br>To die in the rain. Alone.<br><br>MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR:<br><br>I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads<br>without having their motives called into question.<br><br>GRANDPA:<br><br>In my day we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Somebody told<br>us the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough.<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS:<br><br>Isn't that interesting? In a few moments, we will be listening to the<br>chicken tell, for the first time, the heart warming story of how it<br>experienced a serious case of molting, and went on to accomplish its<br>life long dream of crossing the road.<br><br>JOHN LENNON:<br>Imagine all the chickens in the world crossing roads together - in peace.<br><br>ARISTOTLE:<br><br>It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.<br><br>SIGMUND FREUD:<br>The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the<br>road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.<br><br>BILL GATES:<br><br>I have just released eChicken2007 ahead of its scheduled release date<br>of April 1st, 2006, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs,<br>file your important documents, and balance your check book.<br>Internet explorer is an integral part of eChicken.<br>reboot it AGAIN! C \ reboot.<br><br>ALBERT EINSTEIN:<br><br>Did the chicken really cross the road, or did the road move beneath the<br>chicken?<br><br>BILL CLINTON:<br><br>I did not cross the road with THAT chicken. What is your definition of<br>chicken?<br><br>AL GORE:<br><br>I invented the chicken!<br><br>COLONEL SANDERS:<br><br>Did I miss one?</div>
