              <p>The following are all replies that Manchester women have written on
                  Child Support Agency Forms in the section for listing 'father's
                  details;' or putting it another way...... Who's the Daddy?</p>
              <p> These are genuine excerpts from the  forms</p>
              <p>1.
                  Regarding the identity of the father of my twins, Makeeshia was
                  fathered by Maclearndon McKinley I am unsure as to the identity of the
                  father of Marlinda, but I believe that she was conceived on the same
                  night.</p>
              <p> 2. I am unsure, as to the identity of the
                  father of my child as I was being sick out of a window when taken
                  unexpectedly from behind. I can provide you with a list of names of men
                  that I think were at the party if this helps.</p>
              <p> 3. I do not know
                  the name of the father of my little girl. She was conceived at a party
                  at 360 East Bolton Avenue where I had sex with a man I met that night.
                  I do remember that the sex was so good that I fainted. If you do manage
                  to track down the father, can you please send me his phone number?
                  Thanks.</p>
              <p> 4. I don't know the identity of the father of my
                  daughter... He drives a BMW that now has a hole made by my stiletto in
                  one of the door panels. Perhaps you can contact BMW service stations in
                  this area and see if he's had it replaced...</p>
              <p> 5. I have never
                  had sex with a man. I am still a Virginian. I am awaiting a letter from
                  the Pope confirming that my son's conception was ejaculate and that he
                  is the Saver risen again.</p>
              <p>6. I cannot tell you the name
                  of Alleshia dad as he informs me that to do so would blow his cover and
                  that would have cataclysmic implications for the economy. I am torn
                  between doing right by you and right by the country. Please  advise.</p>
              <p>7. I am Chinese and do not know who  the father of my child was as all English look the same to me.</p>
              <p>8. From the dates it seems that my daughter  was conceived at Euro-Disney World; maybe it really is the Magic Kingdom.</p>
              <p>9.
                  So much about that night is a blur. The only thing that I remember for
                  sure is Gordon Ramsey did a programme about eggs earlier in the
                  evening. If I had stayed in and watched more TV rather than going to
                  the party at 56 Miller St , mine might have remained unfertilized.</p>
              <p>10. I am unsure as to the identity of the father of my baby, after all,
                  like when you eat a can of beans you can't be sure which one made you
                  fart.</p>
