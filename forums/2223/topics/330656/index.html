              <p>12. Type on the computer for a while. Suddenly start cursing for 3 minutes at everything bad about your life. Then stop and continue typing.</p>

              <p>41. Stare at the person's next to your's screen, look really puzzled, burst out laughing, and say "You did that?" loudly. Keep laughing, grab your stuff and leave, howling as you go.</p>
              <p>42. Point at the screen. Chant in a made up language while making elaborate hand gestures for a minute or two. Press return or the mouse, then leap back and yell "COVEEEEERRRRRR!"

              <p>44. See who's online. Send a total stranger a talk request. Talk to them like you've known them all your lives. Hangup before they get a chance to figure out you're a total stranger.</p>
              <p>45. Bring an small tape player with a tape of really absurd sound effects. Pretend it's the computer and look really lost.</p>

              <p>47. Come into the computer lab wearing several endangered species of flowers in your hair. Smile incessantly. Type a sentence, then laugh happily, exclaim "You're such a marvel!!", and kiss the screen. Repeat this after every sentence. As your ecstasy mounts, also hug the keyboard. Finally, hug your neighbor, then the computer assistant, and walk out.</p>
              <p>48. Run into the computer lab, shout "Armageddon is here!!!!!", then calmly sit down and begin to type.</p>
