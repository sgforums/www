            <div class='col-md body'>A young family moved into a house next door to a vacant building plot.<br><br>One day Willie Brunsden and a gang of building workers turned up to start building a house on the empty plot. The young family's 5-year-old daughter naturally took an interest in all the activity going on next door and started talking with the workers. She hung around and eventually the builders, all with hearts of gold, more or less adopted the little girl as a sort of project mascot.<br><br>They chatted with her, let her sit with them while they had tea and lunch breaks, and gave her little jobs to do here and there to make her feel important. At the end of the first week they even presented her with a pay envelope containing two pounds in 10p coins.<br><br>The little girl took her 'pay' home to her mother who suggested that they take the money she had received to the bank the next day to start a savings account.<br><br>When they got to the bank the cashier was tickled pink listening to the little girl telling her about her 'work' on the building site and the fact she had a 'pay packet'.<br><br>"You must have worked very hard to earn all this" said the bank cashier. The little girl proudly replied, "I worked all last week with the men building a big house."<br><br>"My goodness gracious," said the cashier, "Will you be working on the house again this week, as well?" The little girl thought for a moment and said..................<br><br>"I think so. Provided those wankers at Jewson deliver the fucking bricks."<br><br>Oops!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
