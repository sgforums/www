I think I should be in the <span class="IL_SPAN">3rd grade</span> too!'</span><br><br><span><span> Ms. <span class="IL_SPAN">Brooks</span> had had enough. She took </span><span class="IL_SPAN">Harry</span><span> to the principal's <span class="IL_SPAN">office</span>. </span></span><br><br><span> While Harry<span> waited in the outer office<span>, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was.. The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test. If he failed to answer any of his
                      questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave.. She agreed. </span></span></span><br><br><span> <span class="IL_SPAN">Harry</span> was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and </span><br> he agreed to take the test. <br><br><br> Principal: 'What is 3 x 3?' <br><br><span> <span class="IL_SPAN">Harry</span>: </span><br> '9.' <br><br> Principal: 'What is 6 x 6?' <br><br><span> <span class="IL_SPAN">Harry</span>: </span><br> '36.' <br><br> And so it went with every question the principal thought a 3rd grader should know. <br><br><span> The principal looks at Ms. <span class="IL_SPAN">Brooks</span> and tells her, </span><br><span> 'I think <span class="IL_SPAN">Harry</span><span> can go to the <span class="IL_SPAN">3rd grade</span>.' </span></span><br><br><br><span> Ms. <span class="IL_SPAN">Brooks</span> says to the principal, 'Let me ask him some questions.' </span><br><br><span> The principal and <span class="IL_SPAN">Harry</span> both agreed. </span><br><br><br><span> Ms. <span class="IL_SPAN">Brooks</span> asks, 'What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?' </span><br><br><span> <span class="IL_SPAN">Harry</span>, after a moment: 'Legs.' </span><br><br><br><span> Ms <span class="IL_SPAN">Brooks</span>: 'What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?' </span><br><br><br> The principal wondered why would she ask such a question! <br><br><span> <span class="IL_SPAN">Harry</span> replied: 'Pockets.' </span><br><br><br><span><span> Ms. <span class="IL_SPAN">Brooks</span>: 'What does </span>a dog do that a man steps into?' </span><br><br><br><span> <span class="IL_SPAN">Harry</span>: </span><br> 'Pants.' <br><br><br><span> Ms. <span class="IL_SPAN">Brooks</span>: What starts with a C, ends with a T, is hairy, oval, delicious and contains thin, whitish liquid?' </span><br><br><span> <span class="IL_SPAN">Harry</span>: </span><br> 'Coconut.' <br><br><br> The principal sat forward with his mouth hanging open.<br><br><span> Ms. <span class="IL_SPAN">Brooks</span>: </span><br> 'What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?' <br><br> The principal's eyes opened really wide and before he could stop the answer, <br><span> <span class="IL_SPAN">Harry</span> replied, 'Bubble gum.' </span><br><br><span><span> Ms. <span class="IL_SPAN">Brooks</span>: 'What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and </span><span class="IL_SPAN">a dog</span> does on three legs?' </span><br><br><br><span> <span class="IL_SPAN">Harry</span>: 'Shake hands.' </span><br><br> The principal was trembling. <br><br><span> Ms. <span class="IL_SPAN">Brooks</span>: 'What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' that means a lot of heat and excitement?' </span><br><br><span> <span class="IL_SPAN">Harry</span>: </span><br> 'Firetruck.' <br><br><br> The principal breathed a sigh of relief and told the teacher,                                          <br><span> 'Put <span class="IL_SPAN">Harry</span> in the fifth-grade, I got the last seven questions wrong.....' </span></p>
