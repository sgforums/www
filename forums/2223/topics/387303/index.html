              <p>One evening last week, my wife and I were getting into bed. well,
              the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says “I don’t feel
              like it, I just want you to hold me.”<br> I said “WHAT???!!! What was that?!”<br> So she says the words that every husband on the planet dreads to hear…<br> “You’re just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for
              me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.” She responded to my
              puzzled look by saying, “Can’t you just love me for who I am and not
              what I do for you in the bedroom?”<br> Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night I went to sleep.</p>
              <p>The very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time
              with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big,
              big unnamed department store. I walked around with her while she tried
              on several different very expensive outfits. She couldn’t decide which
              one to take so I told her we’ll just buy them all.<br> She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get
              a pair for each outfit. We went to the jewellery department where she
              picked out a pair of diamond earrings.<br> Let me tell you, she was so excited, she must have thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck.</p>
              <p>She was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement.<br> Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, “I think this is all dear, lets go to the cashier.”<br> I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, “No honey, I don’t feel like it.”<br> Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled
              “WHAT??!!!” I then said “Really honey! I just want you to HOLD this
              stuff for a while. You’re just not in touch with my financial needs as
              a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.”<br> And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me I added,
              “Why can’t you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy
              you?”</p>
              <p>Apparently I won’t be having sex again until sometime after pigs fly over a frozen hell.</p>

              <p>There was once a competition involving three gruelling tests. The participants had to do the following in immediate succession:</p>
              <p>1.) Drink five bottles of hard whiskey in one go</p>
              <p>2) Enter a room where there was a starving lion and pluck out its eyes with bare hands.</p>
              <p>3) And then screw a very horny babe to her full satisfaction.</p>
              <p>Many people bravely tried their hand at it. Few could get beyond the
              first stage. And the inebriated few who managed it, got promptly eaten
              up by the starving lion. There was none who could read the third stage.</p>
              <p>And then, one fine day, a nonchalant man walked into the contest.
              Five bottles of whiskey were nothing for him. He emptied five bottles
              in five gulps. Then he said, “Show me the lion!” When shown the room,
              he coolly walked in. There was no hint of fear on his face, but rather
              the cool confidence of a person who knew he could do it.</p>
              <p>Sounds of a mammoth fight came from the room. Screams of the man and
              growls of the lion were intermingled. Thumps and thuds which shook the
              very earth ensued. All of a sudden there was a piercing, heart-rending
              roar from the Lion. The audience waited with bated breath, their hair
              stood on end. And then, as suddenly as it had begun, the titanic roar
              stopped. An eerie silence prevailed.</p>
              <p>As the audience watched, with eyes popping out, the door of the room
              opened, and out came the man. Badly bruised, with blood streaming from
              his face, hands and legs, he stumbled out – victorious, nevertheless.
              His face had the glow of satisfaction of an emperor who had just won a
              battle.</p>
              <p>And then he asked, “Where is the woman whose eyes I have to pluck out?”</p>

              <p>Two little boys, ages 8 and 10, are excessively mischievous. They are
              always getting into trouble and their parents know all about it. If any
              mischief occurs in their town, the two boys are probably involved. The
              boys’ mother heard that a preacher in town had been successful in
              disciplining children, so she asked if he would speak with her boys.
              The preacher agreed, but he asked to see them individually. So the
              mother sent the 8 year old first, in the morning, with the older boy to
              see the preacher in the afternoon. The preacher, a huge man with a
              booming voice, sat the younger boy down and asked him sternly,<br> “Do you knowwhere God is, son?” The boy’s mouth dropped open, but he
              made no response, sitting there wide-eyed with his mouth hanging open.
              So the preacher repeated the question in an even sterner tone, “Where
              is God?!” Again, the boy made no attempt to answer. The preacher raised
              his voice even more and shook his finger in the boy’s face and
              bellowed, “Where is God?!”<br> The boy screamed &amp; bolted from the room,<br> ran directly home &amp; dove into his closet, slamming the door behind
              him. When his older brother found him in the closet, he asked, “what
              happened?” The younger brother, gasping for breath, replied, “We are in
              BIG trouble this time. “GOD is missing, and they think we did it!”</p>

              <p>There was once  little Sicilian boy called Luigi who’s father was alleged to have been a notorious member of the Mafia.</p>
              <p>One day, Luigi asks his Mother, ‘Hey Mamma, I want a bike” Hi mother
              tells him, if you are a good boy and pray to Jesus then maybe you get a
              bike Ok.</p>
              <p>So Luigi goes, to his local church and kneels in front of the statue
              of Jesus and says, ” Hey Jesus, I wanna new bike ok. I’ll be good and
              come back in week to get my bike”</p>
              <p>For the whole week Luigi behaves well. He doesn’t swear, helps is mother by doing all his chores and homework etc.</p>
              <p>At the end of the week he goes back to the church and kneels in
              front of the statue of Jesus again. Hey Jesus, I been good all week.
              Where is my bike?” “Maybe you want me to try harder so I come back
              again in one week ok”</p>
              <p>After another week of exemplary behavior, doing even better deeds
              than before, he returns to the church and still he sees no bike.
              Figuring this is God’s way of testing his loyalty he continues to pray
              each week and behave like a perfect boy.</p>
              <p>Finally, months have passed and Luigi, feeling frustrated returns to
              the church again. This time however, instead of praying to the Statue
              of Jesus he steals a statue of the Virgin Mary and runs away to hide it.</p>
              <p>A couple of days later he comes back to the church and kneels in
              front of the statue of Jesus and says “Hey Jesus, I got your Mamma!</p>

              <p>A guy walks into a bar, sits down, and orders a drink. He sees a big
              jar of money sitting on the counter. He asks the bartender, “<em>What’s with the jar of money?</em>”  The bartender replies, “Oh,
              well I have a horse in the back and anybody who can make him laugh gets
              the jar of money. If you can’t make him laugh, you have to put $10 into
              the jar and be on your way.” The guy thinks this is a simple enough
              task, and asks to see the horse. Back at the bar, the bartender is
              cleaning some mugs when he hears the horse cracking up in the back.
              Seconds later, he sees the guy walking in from the backroom. “H-how’d you do it? How did you make my horse laugh?,” the bartender asked.  The man grabbed the jar of money and headed to the door. He turned around and said, “<em>I don’t reveal my secrets</em>.”</p>
              <p>About two weeks later, that same guy went back into the bar for
              another drink. He noticed another jar of money in the same place. “<em>What do I have to do to get this jar, now</em>?”  The bartender, comfortable with the fact that the man can’t possibly win this one, says “Oh, see, now you have to make my horse CRY.”
              The guy shrugs and proceeds to the back room. Moments later, the
              bartender hears terrible sobbing from the back. The guy walks back into
              the bar area, calmly takes his jar of money, and walks to the front
              door. The bartender runs to catch him before he walks out. He has to
              know, “You have to tell me, how did you do it!?”</p>
              <p>The guy looks at the bartender, “<em>Well, to make your horse laugh, I told him I had a bigger dick than he does</em>.” “And to make him cry?”</p>
              <p>“<em>I showed him</em>.”</p>

              <p>A man who owns Thompson Nails, a reputable nail company decides to
              market his product on television so he enlists the help of a marketing
              firm.</p>
              <p>He sits with the marketing director and asks…Could you please create
              a commercial to help sell my nails? The marketing director tells him to
              come back in one week.</p>
              <p>A week passes and the man shows up for the first viewing of his
              commercial. It starts off with a distant view of Jesus nailed to the
              cross. The camera slowly focuses in on Jesus’ hand and on the head of
              the nail you can read…Thompson Nails.</p>
              <p>The man is furious, you can`t expect me to run this insensitive
              commercial, what`s wrong with you people? The marketing director
              apologizes and requests the man comeback in another week to review what
              he promises to be a more tasteful commercial.</p>
              <p>A week passes and the man returns, sits in the viewing room as the
              commercial starts. This time, you see Jesus running down the street
              with two Roman legionnaires chasing after him. After a few seconds, one
              of the Romans turns to the other and says…I told you we should have
              used Thompson Nails!</p>

              <p>A little old lady went into the Natwest Bank one day carrying a bag
              of money. She insists that she must speak with the manager of the bank
              to open a savings account because it’s a lot of money.</p>
              <p>They finally get her into the managers office and he asks her how
              much she would like to deposit. She says she has £100,000 and then
              dumps it out of the bag onto his desk. The manager was surprised and of
              course curious as to how she came by all this cash, so he asks her. The
              old lady says, “I make bets”.</p>
              <p>The manager replies, “Bets? What kind of bets?” and she says, “for
              example, I’ll bet you £5,000 that your balls are square”. “Ha!” says
              the manager, “That’s a stupid bet, you can never win that kind of bet”.</p>
              <p>The old lady says,”So, would you like to take my bet?” “Sure,” says
              the manager, “I’ll bet £5,000 that my balls are not square!” The little
              old lady says “OK, but since there is a lot of money involved is it OK
              with you if I bring my lawyer with me tomorrow at 10:00 AM to witness?”
              “Sure” says the manager.</p>
              <p>That night the manager got very nervous about the bet and spent a
              long time in front of a mirror checking his balls, turning from side to
              side, again and again, thoroughly checking them out until he was sure
              that there is no way his balls are square and that he will win the bet.</p>
              <p>The next morning at 10 AM the little old lady appears with her
              lawyer at the manager’s office. She introduces the lawyer to the
              manager and repeats the bet, that £5,000 says the manager’s balls are
              square. The manager agrees with the bet again and the old lady asks him
              to drop his trousers and underwear so they can see. The manager does
              this. The little old lady looks closely at his balls and then asks if
              she can feel them. “Well, OK” says the manager, £5,000 is a lot of
              money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure”.</p>
              <p>Then he notices that the lawyer is quietly banging his head against
              the wall and he asks the old lady, “What is wrong with your lawyer?”</p>
              <p>She replies, “Nothing, except I bet him £15,000 that by 10 AM today I’d have Natwest banks manager’s balls in my hands!”</p>

              <p>A man who owns Thompson Nails, a reputable nail company decides

              <p>He sits with the marketing director and asks…Could you please
              create a commercial to help sell my nails? The marketing director
              tells him to come back in one week.</p>
              <p>A week passes and the man shows up for the first viewing of his
              commercial. It starts off with a distant view of Jesus nailed to
              the cross. The camera slowly focuses in on Jesus’ hand and on the
              head of the nail you can read…Thompson Nails.</p>
              <p>The man is furious, you can`t expect me to run this insensitive

              apologizes and requests the man comeback in another week to review
              what he promises to be a more tasteful commercial.</p>
              <p>A week passes and the man returns, sits in the viewing room as
              the commercial starts. This time, you see Jesus running down the
              street with two Roman legionnaires chasing after him. After a few
              seconds, one of the Romans turns to the other and says…I told you

              <p>Steven Spielberg was filming his latest movie deep in the heart of the
              Amazon rain forest. The costs involved in transporting the multitude of
              movie making equipment to the site were immense. On top of that, he had
              a cast of thousands to feed and clothe. It was his most expensive
              production yet and he sank his entire personal fortune into the project.</p>
              <p>The biggest expense was building an exact replica of an Ancient city in
              the middle of the jungle. No expense was spared to make the city
              authentic.</p>
              <p>The climax of the movie was to be the complete destruction of the city
              in a dramatic fire. Since Spielberg planned to actually burn the city
              to the ground, there was only one chance to film it. He set up four
              cameras:</p>
              <p>"Camera one, I want you up in the helicopter to get an overhead shot of the whole scene."</p>
              <p>"Yes, boss."</p>
              <p>"Camera two, I want you at the edge of the clearing for a medium range shot."</p>
              <p>"Yes, boss."</p>
              <p>"Camera three, we've built a special fireproof hut in the center of the
              city. You can poke the camera through a hole in the side and get a
              close up view from the heart of the fire."</p>
              <p>"OK, boss."</p>
              <p>"Camera four, I need you at the top of that hill over there to get a long range shot."</p>
              <p>"Gotcha, boss."</p>
              <p>Once the cameras and actors were all in place, Spielberg himself lit
              the match to start the fire. It was an amazing sight. The fire raged
              and roared for over an hour as the entire multi-million dollar set was
              completely destroyed and reduced to a smoking pile of ash.</p>
              <p>Spielberg radioed the helicopter, "Camera one, how did it go?"</p>
              <p>"Sorry, boss, but the smoke was so thick I couldn't see a thing. Then
              the smoke got into the engine of the chopper and we were forced to
              land. I wasn't able to get anything."</p>
              <p>"Darn it! Well, I guess I can just use the footage from the other three cameras," Spielberg thought to himself.</p>
              <p>"Camera two, how did it go?"</p>
              <p>"Sorry, boss, but the downdraft from the chopper blades fanned the
              flames and started the bush all around us on fire. We had to run to
              safety and the camera was burned to a crisp."</p>
              <p>"Arghh! I guess I'll have to make do with two cameras."</p>
              <p>"Camera three, please tell me you got the shot."</p>
              <p>"Sorry, boss. The fireproof hut worked fine, but the lens of the camera
              couldn't take the heat and it melted. I didn't manage to get anything."</p>
              <p>"I can't believe this!" cried Spielberg. "Thank God I sent that last
              camera up on the hill. The smoke didn't blow that way, nor was their
              any brush fire or heat to worry about."</p>
              <p>He walks towards the hill, cups his hands to his mouth and hollers ...</p>
              <p>"CAMERA FOUR!!!"</p>
              <p>A moment later, the cameraman yells back ...</p>
              <p>"READY WHEN YOU ARE, BOSS!"</p>

              <p>A man died and went to The Judgment. St. Peter met him at the Gates of
              Heaven and said, "Before you meet with God, I thought I should tell you
              -- we've looked at your life, and your really didn't do anything
              particularly good or bad. We're not at all sure what to do with you.
              Can you tell us anything you did that can help us make a decision?"<br> <br> The newly arrived soul thought for a moment and replied, "Yeah, once I
              was driving along and came upon a woman who was being harassed by a
              group of bikers. So I pulled over, got out my tire iron, and went up to
              the leader of the bikers. He was a big, muscular, hairy guy with
              tattoos all over his body and a ring pierced through his nose. Well, I
              tore the nose ring out of his nose, and told him he and his gang had
              better stop bothering the woman or they would have to deal with me!"<br> <br> "I'm impressed," St. Peter responded, "When did this happen?"<br> <br> "About two minutes ago," came the reply.</p>

              <p>A popular motivational speaker was entertaining his
              audience.<br> <br> He said: "The best years of my life were spent in the<br> arms of a woman who wasn’t my wife!"<br> <br> The audience was in silence and shock.<br> <br> The speaker added: "And that woman was my mother!"<br> <br> Laughter and applause............<br> <br> A week later, a top manager trained by the motivational speaker
              tried to crack this very effective joke at home.<br> <br> He was a bit foggy after a couple of drinks.<br> <br> He said loudly to his wife who was preparing dinner, "The greatest
              years of my life were spent in the arms of a woman who was not my
              wife!"<br> <br> The wife went, "ah!" with shock and rage.<br> <br> Standing there for 20 seconds trying to recall the second half of
              the joke, the manager finally blurted out "....and I can't remember
              who she was!"<br> <br> By the time the manager regained his consciousness, he was on a
              hospital bed nursing burns from boiling water.</p>

              copy, if you can't paste !</span></p>
