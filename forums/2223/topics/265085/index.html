            <div class='col-md body'>This story happened a short while ago in Brisbane, and even though it sounds a little Alfred Hitchcock, it's true.<br><br>John, a Sydney University student was hitch hiking about 100 Km north of Brisbane on an unlit<br>country road and on a very dark night with a severe storm raging thunder, lightning, torrential rain. The night was rolling on and no car went by. The storm was so strong he could hardly see any more than a few feet ahead of him. Suddenly, in a flash of lightning, he saw a car slowly coming towards him and it suddenly stopped just a few feet from where he stood.<br><br>John, in the dark and driving rain, desperate for shelter and without thinking about it, got in the car and closed the door. There was nobody behind the wheel and the engine wasn't on! The car then began moving slowly. A little terrified by the sudden movement, without obvious human interaction, John was thinking about jumping from the moving vehicle, but the storm was getting worse. 'here was a safe haven' form the tempest of sorts he looked ahead at the road and saw a curve approaching.<br><br>Scared, he started to pray, begging for his life. 'Do I jump', he thought, when suddenly, just before he hit the curve, a hand appeared through the window and turned the wheel.<br><br>John, in the dark, with only the flash of the lightning and paralysed with terror, watched how the hand appeared every time they came to a curve. John saw the lights of a pub down the road so, gathering strength, he jumped out of the slowly moving car and ran to it. Wet and out of breath, he rushed inside and asked for two shots of tequila. He then started telling everybody around him the horrible experience he had just been through. A silence had enveloped everybody and then they realized he was crying and wasn't drunk. About 5 minutes later, two blokes walked<br>into the same pub. They were also wet and out of breath.<br><br>Looking around and seeing John sobbing at the bar, one said to the other, 'Look, Bruce, there's the idiot that got in the car while we were pushing it.</div>
