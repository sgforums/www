He was promptly<br>spotted by a farmer, who shot him out of the tree.<br><br>Management Lesson - Bull shit might get you to<br>the top, but it won't keep you there.<br><br>Lesson Three<br>A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was<br>so cold, the bird froze and fell to the ground into a<br>large field. While he was lying there, a cow came by<br>and dropped some dung on him.<br>As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung,<br>he began to realize how warm he was. The dung was<br>actually thawing him out! He lay there all warm<br>and<br>happy, and soon began to sing for joy.<br><br>A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to<br>investigate. Following the sound, the cat discovered<br>the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug<br>him out and ate him.<br><br>Management Lesson -<br>(1) Not everyone who shyts on you is your enemy.<br>(2) Not everyone who gets you out of shyt is your<br>friend.<br>(3) And when you're in deep shyt, it's best to keep<br>your mouth shut!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>
