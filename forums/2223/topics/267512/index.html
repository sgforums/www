By Seah Chiang Nee.<br>Apr 23, 2006<br><br>SINGAPOREANS are affluent, educated, but are they really survival smart?<br>In a world of harsher living, this question that never dies has again grabbed the public focus here with a general election less than two weeks away.<br><br>At the core of the debate: Without natural resources, the Singaporean increasingly has to depend on his own guile, not only a good education, to survive; has he got it?<br><br>ItÂ’s not a new debate. In the past decade, the Education Ministry has changed the education system to teach independent thinking and entrepreneurship to correct some fundamental defects in the average worker.<br><br>The average Singaporean is good at academic studies and works hard, but falls short on individual initiative and streetwise qualities, relying too much on the government for help.<br><br>Revisiting the debate is controversial Taiwan lawmaker Li Ao, who recently ranked Singaporeans rather lower in natural intelligence to the people in Taiwan and Hong Kong.<br><br>Â“Taiwanese are scoundrels, but lovable, Hong Kong people are craftier, (Chinese mainlanders are unfathomable) and Singaporeans are stupider,Â” he said, adding that it is partially due to genetics.<br><br>The original migrants who came here from China were of Â“poor stockÂ”.<br><br>Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew once told Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping that the ethnic Chinese in Singapore were descendants of illiterate coolies and farmers from southern Fujian.<br><br>This had made them less able than the people of Hong Kong or Taiwan, whose ancestors were mainly businessman or technocrats.<br><br>Singaporeans could function well only as a group, not as individuals, Li told a Chinese newspaper. They would never be non-conformist or stand out above the crowd.<br><br>Â“If you ask me, other than Lee Kuan Yew, his son Hsien Loong, politicians aside, I can only think of a cute girl, (pop star) Stephanie Sun, there arenÂ’t many other outstanding people. The impression that I get (of normal Singaporeans) is stupidÂ”.<br><br>SingaporeÂ’s system, Li said, stemmed from the ancient Chinese political philosophy of legalism, which emphasised on the rule of law.<br><br>Â“Singaporeans do not break rules, but they also do not stand out,Â” he said in Mandarin.<br><br>He said Lee Kuan Yew had wanted to build a British-style democracy but because the people were not up to scratch, they only knew how to toe the line.<br><br>His report card on Singapore has shaken up the people at a time when election fever is rising, indirectly touching on a campaign issue Â– government control on society.<br><br>Predictably, Singaporeans have reacted angrily to the terms Â“stupidÂ” and Â“poor genesÂ”, dismissing them as a popularity stunt that takes no account of their successful, modern achievements.<br><br>This Â“genetic weaknessÂ” doesnÂ’t aptly describe todayÂ’s diverse, more mature and worldly-wise generation.<br><br>But some critics say there is some truth in what Li said, but insist that the fault lies not in genes, but in years of political and social conditioning by a top-down government.<br><br>One writer however, said: Â“A better word to describe the Singaporean is naÃ¯ve, which comes about because of a paternalistic and rather efficient government.<br><br>"Everything is so structured and laid-out that the people do not need to fight for a living, blunting their ability to compete. TheyÂ’re lulled into thinking the outside world also behave like Singapore.Â”<br><br>Businessmen from Taiwan and Hong Kong are more alert to opportunities, as well as cheats, compared to even the capable Singaporeans, whose preoccupation is getting a high salary.<br><br>They know where to take the short cuts when faced with a problem; Singaporeans will just sit and wait for better days.<br><br>Under the Lee Kuan Yew leadership, the collective good comes before the individual, so the republicÂ’s success is a Â“collective creationÂ”, Li added.<br><br>The individual is often lost on his own. It has led some critics to ask whether the Singaporean has an original viewpoint of his own beyond what the government says.<br><br>Â“I wonÂ’t say we are stupid. We are just not daring and street-smart,Â” commented a Singaporean studying abroad.<br><br>In his university, other Asian students would walk up to the microphone and talk about some cause, not the Singaporeans, he said.<br><br>Li Ao is not alone in his views. Singaporean columnist Wong Lung Hsiang said it reflected what he heard in China that Â“Taiwanese are shameless, Hong Kongers are heartless, Singaporeans are ignorantÂ”.<br><br>In Greater China, law-abiding Singaporeans have long been seen as gullible.<br><br>In a commentary in November last year, Wong advised Singaporeans to treasure their own system at home, Â“but when you are away, you should know how to adapt to othersÂ”.<br><br>What Chinese Singaporeans have inherited from their grandparents is peasant culture, explained Â“peasant judgeÂ” online.<br><br>Â“Peasants donÂ’t care for much else except a bowl of rice on the table, a roof over their heads, and the chance to go out to the rice fields to do the daily back-breaking chores day in day out.Â”<br><br>Politics, too, is affected. Almost everyone goes to the polls with his rice-bowl in mind.<br><br>It occupies the citizenÂ’s mind a lot more than his counterparts in other countries, who are more passionate about issues like justice and equality.<br><br>Â“Just imagine, well-informed Singaporeans advocating a one-party rule, saying it is good for the future. If this is not stupidity, what is?Â’ asked redbean.<br><br>This could be a recipe for future trouble should a foreign predator one day use this character weakness to take over the country.<br><br>All he needs to do to retain the peopleÂ’s compliance is by keeping their stomach full and their mind empty.<br></div>
