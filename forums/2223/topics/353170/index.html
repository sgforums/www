              <p><strong>A Big Bad Day</strong></p>
              <p>It was getting a little crowded in Heaven, so God decided to change<br>the admittance policy. The new law was that, in order to get into<br>Heaven, you had to have a really bad day the day you died. The policy<br>would go into effect at noon the following day. So the next day at<br>12:01 the first person came to the gates of Heaven.<br>The angel at the gate, remembering about the new law, promptly told<br>the man, "Before I can let you in, I need you to tell me about the day<br>you died."<br>"No problem." said the man. "Well, for some time now, I've thought my<br>wife was having an affair. I believed that each day on her lunch hour,<br>she'd bring her lover home to our 25th floor apartment and have sex<br>with him. So today I was going to come home too and catch them. Well,<br>I got there and busted in and immediately began searching for this<br>guy. My wife was half-naked and yelling at me as I searched the entire<br>apartment. But, damn it, I couldn't find him! Just as I was going to<br>give up, I happened to glance out onto the balcony and noticed that<br>there was a man hanging off the edge by his fingertips! The nerve of<br>that guy to think he could hide from me! Well, I ran out there and<br>promptly stomped on his fingers until he fell to the ground.<br>But wouldn't you know it, he landed in some bushes that broke his fall<br>and he didn't die. This pissed me off even more, so in a rage I went<br>back inside to get the first thing I could get my hands on to throw at<br>him. And oddly enough, the first thing I could grab was the<br>refrigerator. I unplugged it, pushed it out onto the balcony and<br>heaved it over the side. It plummeted 25 stories and crushed him!<br>The excitement of the moment was so great that right after that I had<br>a heart attack and died almost instantly."<br>The angel sat back and though for a moment. Technically, the guy DID<br>have a bad day, and it was a crime of passion, so he announced, "OK,<br>Sir. Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven," and let him in.<br>A few seconds later the next guy came up. "OK, here's the rule. Before<br>I can let you in, I need to hear about the day you died."<br>"Sure thing" the man replied. "But you're not gonna believe this. I<br>was out on the balcony of my 26th floor apartment doing my daily<br>exercises when I got a little carried away and accidentally fell over<br>the side! Luckily however, I was able to catch myself by my fingertips<br>on the balcony directly beneath mine. When all of a sudden this crazy<br>man comes running out of his apartment and starts cussing and stomping<br>on my fingers! Well, of course I fell. I hit some trees and bushes on<br>the way down which broke my fall so I didn't die right away. As I'm<br>laying there face up on the ground, unable to move and in excruciating<br>pain, I see the man push his refrigerator, of all things, over the<br>ledge and it falls directly on top of me and kills me!"<br>The angel is quietly laughing to himself as the man finishes his<br>story. "I could get used to this new policy," he thinks to himself.<br>"Very well," the angel announces. "Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven,"<br>and he lets the man enter.<br>A few seconds later the third man in line comes up to the gate. "Tell<br>me about the day you died," said the angel.<br>"OK, picture this, " says the man. "I'm naked inside a<br>Refrigerator......."</p>

              <p><strong>The Closet</strong></p>
              <p>A woman takes a lover home during the day while her husband is at work.<br>Her 9 year old son comes home unexpectedly, sees them and hides in the<br>bedroom closet to watch. The woman's husband also comes home. She puts<br>her Lover in the closet, not realizing that the little boy is in there<br>already. The little boy says, "Dark in here." The man says, "Yes, it<br>is." Boy - "I have a baseball." Man - "That's nice." Boy - "Want to buy<br>it?" Man - "No, thanks." Boy - "My dad's outside." Man - "OK, how much?"<br>Boy - "$250"<br><br>In the next few weeks, it happens again that the boy and the lover are in<br>the closet together. Boy - "Dark in here." Man - "Yes, it is." Boy - "I<br>have a baseball glove." The lover, remembering the last time, asks the boy,<br>"How much?" Boy - "$750" Man - "Sold."<br><br>A few days later, the father says to the boy, "Grab your glove, let's go<br>outside and have a game of catch. The boy says, "I can't, I sold my<br>baseball and my glove." The father asks, "How much did you sell them for?"<br>Boy -"$1,000" The father says, "That's terrible to overcharge your friends<br>like that. That is way more than those two things cost. I'm going to take<br>you to church and make you confess." They go to the church and the father<br>makes the little boy sit in the confession booth and he closes the door.<br>The boy says, "Dark in here." The priest says, "Don't start that shit<br>again, you're in my closet now."</p>
              <p><strong>Titanic</strong></p>
              <p>Recently a teacher, a garbage collector, and a lawyer wound up together at the Pearly Gates. <br>St. Peter informed them that in order to get into Heaven, they would each have to answer one <br>question. <br><br>St. Peter addressed the teacher and asked, "What was the name of the ship that crashed into the<br>iceberg? They just made a movie about it." The teacher answered quickly, "That would be the <br>Titanic." St. Peter let him through the gate. <br><br>St. Peter turned to the garbage man and, figuring Heaven didn't REALLY need all the odors that <br>this guy would bring with him, decided to make the question a little harder: "How many people <br>died on the ship?" Fortunately for him, the trash man had just seen the movie and answered, <br>"about 1,500." "That's right! You may enter." <br><br>St. Peter then turned to the lawyer. "Name them."</p>

              <p><strong>Consequences of Smoking Dope</strong></p>
              <p>Two So-Cal guys were picked up by the cops for smoking dope and appeared in <br>court before the judge. The judge said, "You seem like nice young men, and <br>I'd like to give you a second chance rather than jail time. I want you to<br>go out this weekend and try to show others the evils of drug use and get them <br>to give up drugs forever. I'll see you back in court Monday.<br><br>Monday, the two guys were in court, and the judge said to the first one, <br>"How did you do over the weekend?"<br>"Well, your honor, I persuaded 17 people to give up drugs forever." <br>"17 people? That's wonderful. What did you tell them?"<br>"I used a diagram, your honor. I drew two circles like this: <br>                      _<br>                    /    \<br>                   |       |        O <br>                    \ _ /<br><br>and told them this (the big circle) is your brain before drugs and this <br>(small circle) is your brain after drugs."<br><br>"That's admirable," said the judge. "And you, how did you do?" (to the 2nd <br>boy)<br><br>"Well, your honor, I persuaded 156 people to give up drugs forever." <br><br>"156 people! That's amazing! How did you manage to do that!" <br><br>"Well, I used the same two circles.  I pointed to the<br>small circle and told them, "this is your asshole before prison......"</p>
