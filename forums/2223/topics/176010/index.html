Yes! Sure I will bring my new husband into this bed.Â’<br><br>Ole gulped.

Â“HowÂ’s your course at the memory clinic going?Â”<br><br>Â“Outstanding,Â” replies Arthur. Â“They teach us all the latest psychological techniques: visualisation, association and so on. ItÂ’s made a huge difference for me.Â”<br><br>Â“ThatÂ’s great,Â” says his mate. Â“What was the name of the clinic again?Â”<br><br>Arthur goes blank, then wrinkles his brow. Â“Wait there, I can do this.Â” He closes his eyes, frowns deeply and his lips move as he thinks to himself.<br><br>Â“What do you call that flower with the red petals and thorns?Â” he says, finally.<br><br>Â“You mean a rose,Â” says his friend.<br><br>Â“Yes, thatÂ’s it!Â” say Arthur, and turns to his wife, asking, Â“Rose, what was the name of that clinic again?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A man having trouble achieving an erection decides to consult a witch doctor. The witch doctor throws some herbs on a fire, shakes his rattle, and says,<br><br>Â“I have placed a powerful spell on you, but it will only work once a year. Just say Â‘one, two, threeÂ’ and youÂ’ll get the largest erection youÂ’ve ever had. After your wifeÂ’s been satisfied, simply say Â‘one, two, three, fourÂ’ and it will disappear for 12 months.Â”<br><br>Later that night as the man is lying in bed watching television, he says to his wife, Â“Watch this! One, two, three!Â” His schlong becomes larger and stiffer than ever before.<br><br>His wife is amazed. She smiles and says, Â“ThatÂ’s great! But what did you say Â‘one, two, threeÂ’ for?Â”<br></div>
