              <p><br> On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong was the first person to set foot on
              the moon. His first words, upon stepping on the moon, "That`s one small
              step for man, one giant leap for mankind!" were televised to Earth and
              heard by millions.<br> <br> Just before he re-entered the lander, he made the enigmatic remark,
              "Good luck, Mr Gorsky!" Many people thought it was a casual remark
              concerning some rival Soviet cosmonaut. However, NASA confirmed there
              was no Mr Gorsky in either the Soviet or American space programs.<br> <br> Over the years, people questioned Armstrong about the statement, but he
              only smiled. Finally, on July 5, 1995, at Tampa Bay, Florida, while
              answering questions following a speech, a reporter once again brought
              up the 26-year old question to Armstrong.<br> <br> This time, he responded. Mr Gorsky had died, and so Neil Armstrong felt he could now answer the question.<br> Apparently, in 1938, as a kid in a small mid-west town, he was playing
              baseball with a friend in his backyard. As his friend hit the ball, it
              landed in his neighbour`s yard, by their bedroom window. The neighbours
              were Mr and Mrs Gorsky.<br> <br> As young Neil bent to pick up the ball, he heard Mrs Gorsky yelling at
              her husband, "Sex? You want sex? You`ll get sex when the kid next door
              walks on the moon!"</p>

              <p><br> A man and his wife were having problems in their relationship, so they went to a psychologist. <br> <br> The psychologist, who was a man, saw the couple several times, but to no avail. <br> <br> The woman complained her husband wasn't affectionate. <br> <br> The man said he didn't understand what she was talking about. <br> <br> Finally, after many sessions of explaining to the man his wife's need
              for affection, the psychologist lost his patience. He told the man's
              wife to take off her clothes, then he had sex with her, and told the
              man, "This is what your wife needs every day". <br> <br> The man frowned, thought for a moment, then said, "OK, what time do you want me to bring her back tomorrow?"</p>

              <p>A teenage boy and his steady girlfriend were making out in his parked
              car, when the boy got really turned on, and said, "Please darlin', I
              can't take it anymore, I have to get some relief."<br> <br> His girl replies, "You know I am saving myself until we get married!"<br> <br> He continues to plead and begs her, "What if I just put the head in for a while, just let me marinate it a little?"<br> <br> Finally getting a bit steamed up herself, she reluctantly agrees, but says, only if it's the head.<br> <br> So he anxiously unzips and fumbling, puts the head of his manhood into
              the softness of her secret treasure and that's all he does,<br> well for about 30 seconds anyway, but in the heat of passion, he gets
              carried away and before you know it he's put it in entirely and is
              pumping away with deep thrusts for all he's worth.<br> <br> After a few minutes his lady love moans and thrilling to the mounting
              pleasure and a new awareness, haltingly gasps "I know we have this
              deal, that you are only putting the head in, but... this feels so damn
              good, go ahead and give it all to me!"<br> <br> Jolted to his senses, stopping in mid thrust, but thinking quickly our hero responds, "Nope, a deals a deal."</p>

              <p>Dictionary of Obscure Sexual Terms.<br> <br> Angry Dragon - Immediately after you blow your load in a girl's mouth,
              smack the back of her head and make it come out her nose. When she gets
              up she'll look like an angry dragon.<br> <br> Arabian Goggles - A "seldom-seen" maneuver when you put your testicles
              over her eye sockets while getting head. (Picture it: ass on forehead)
              It may be anatomically impossible, but what the fuck else is new.<br> <br> The Bait N' Tackle - The sailors used this one in the old Navy days.
              Before you go off for a long, lonely voyage, get yourself a tall jar
              and fill it completely with earthworms. When you get lonely, open the
              jar and fuck away. The earthworms will provide some slithery
              stimulation, and your protein load will keep them nicely fed. Gone
              fishing!<br> <br> Ballsacking - Takes some luck of the gene pool, but if you're able to
              do it, always great fun. While you are straddling her, take your
              nutsack and spread it out over her face like pizza dough.<br> <br> Bear Claw - A synonym for extremely large pussy lips.<br> <br> Beef Curtain - The shanked out remains of the labia after being stretched like Play-Doh from an hour or so of jimmy-jam.<br> <br> Beer Dick - This is what most guys get after a good night of drinking.
              They tend to fuck anything with a pussy while experiencing beer dick.<br> <br> Blumpy - You need to find a real tramp to do this right. It involves having her sucking you off while you are on the shitter.<br> <br> The Bronco - You start by going doggy style and then just when she is
              really enjoying it, you grab her tits as tight as possible and yell
              another girls name. This gives you the feeling of riding a wild bronco
              as she desperately tries to buck you off.<br> <br> Brown Bagging It - Sometimes you meet a girl with a body like there's
              no tomorrow but a face like a mangy dog. Don't let that body go to
              waste and let her hideousness stop you from fucking her though. Just
              draw the smiley face on a brown paper bag, place it over her head, and
              fuck away while keeping your composure and piece of mind.<br> <br> Brown Necktie - You're about halfway through ass-wrecking a chick, and
              instead of filling up her keister with your demonseed, you pull out and
              proceed to tittie fuck her, leaving a brown streak between the funbags.<br> <br> Brunski - When a man puts his face between a woman's breasts and
              quickly moves his head back and forth while saying "Brunski" in a very
              drawn out and exaggerated manner. (There are many other variant names.)<br> <br> The Bullwinkle - The sign given to a friend in hiding while doggie
              styling' some chick. It is performed by placing both hands over the
              head, with palms facing out and waving wildly. Can be supplemented by
              shouting "Hey Rocky." (Make sure to use appropriate Bullwinkle voice
              tone.)<br> <br> Butter Face - When you see a chick with an awesome body, "but her face", is nasty.<br> <br> The Canine Special - Liberally apply peanut butter to your dick and call over the family dog. Lick Ubu lick. Good Dog. Arf!<br> <br> The Carpet Cleaner - While banging a girl doggy style, tie her arms
              behind her back, lift up her hips, and run around the room pushing her
              face first across the carpet. Not recommended with large women.<br> <br> The Chili Dog - When you take a hot dump on a girl's tits and then proceed to titty fuck her.<br> <br> Chocolate Pizza - Happily discovering hemorrhoids while eating a shitty brown eye.<br> <br> Cleveland Steamer - The act of leaving a shit stain on the rib cage of
              a woman while receiving penile pleasure from friction between the
              mammaries.<br> <br> Cock-Stuffing - Apparently somewhat on the fringe in gay circles, but
              involves using thin, cylindrical items (thermometers, wire, rubber
              worms, etc.), and inserting them into the dick hole. Over many months,
              continue to gradually ream out the hole-at-the-head with larger items,
              thus ultimately allowing your "buddy" to obtain the goal of fucking
              your urethra. Wow!<br> <br> Cold Lunch - The act of vomiting directly onto some chick's head while she's performing fellatio.<br> <br> The Concoction - First, ejaculate all over the floor. Next, have your
              psycho bitch girlfriend menstruate on your semen. Stir it with your
              finger until you get a nice thick pink mixture. Proceed to paint
              yourselves up silly, just as if you were in kindergarten again.<br> <br> Cop's Delight - The act of taking a girl in the ass, pulling out, and
              spewing all over her "pastry buns", thus transforming her rump into the
              allusion of an over sized, quivering glazed donut.<br> <br> The Corkscrew - Cross your fingers, middle over index. Twist your wrist
              back and forth and go to work on your desired orifice. With practice,
              you'll have the effectiveness of a dill press and within weeks you'll
              be able to bore through wood.</p>

              <p>A small group of dominant ladies were getting together for their usual
              Friday evening munch. One of the ladies, who preferred a military style
              of dominance, decided to bring her new, freshly trained boy toy and
              show him off to her friends.<br> <br> The other ladies gathered around as the dominatrix boasted of her
              latest achievement: A Precision Penis. With that, she directed her
              slave to remove his pants and demonstrate for the audience.<br> <br> The slave obediently stripped off his trousers to the immediate giggles
              of the small crowd. "Yes, yes, girls," the dominatrix proclaimed, "It's
              ALMOST a penis, I know. But you're missing the point. Watch this."<br> <br> She stepped back, standing rigidly straight, and barked out the
              military command, "Attennnnn-Shun!" To everyone's amazement, the
              flaccid member immediately popped straight outward, becoming perfectly
              erect in a split second.<br> <br> Seeing that she had certainly gained the admiration of her peers, the
              dominatrix then wowed them further as she commanded, "At ease." The
              slave's rock hard pole immediately returned to it's resting state
              without so much as a disobedient throb.<br> <br> "AMAZING!" the ladies shouted. "Do it again, do it again!"<br> <br> The dominatrix, happy to oblige, repeated the commands nine more times
              in succession, all with precisely the same results and each time to the
              increasingly impressed applause of the group.<br> <br> When she barked out the command for the tenth time, though, nothing
              happened. A sudden hush fell over the room. An extremely worried look
              appeared on the slave's face as the dominatrix once again issued the
              command, louder this time. Still nothing. Once more, she barked out the
              directive, only now there was clearly a disturbed tone to her voice.
              Again, nothing.<br> <br> The slave, sensing immediate punishment, bolted quickly into the
              nearest room, slamming the door behind him in real fear. With fire in
              her eyes, the dominatrix took off in hot pursuit, followed by her
              feminist posse. The door never stood a chance as the sole of her right
              boot connected with it.<br> <br> As the door flew open, the group suddenly stopped dead in their tracks.
              Inside the room before them stood the slave, feverishly masturbating as
              though his life depended on it.<br> <br> "What the hell are you doing????" the dominatrix demanded.<br> <br> The slave, hoping to divert blame, looked up without so much as missing
              a stroke and meekly proclaimed, "It disobeyed a direct order, Ma'am.
              I'm therefore giving it a dishonorable discharge."</p>

              <p><br> The Equal Opportunities Commission, Amnesty International, Human Rights
              activists, black community leaders and the British Islamic Council were
              all furious at the apparent racial inequality of the situation. Why
              were just the British white couple saved? It was monstrous they
              claimed, and showed that systemic 'racism' still existed in all areas
              of public service - questions were raised in the House of Commons, the
              popular media picked up the story and within hours it was national and
              indeed international news.<br> <br> Boris Johnson - Mayor of London, when questioned stated calmly that it
              would be unwise to jump to conclusions until the Police and Fire
              Service had completed their report. He closed by stating that he
              expected their initial assessment would be available within the next 36
              hours - so perhaps it would be best to let the experts gather the
              evidence and report back before he commented any further. <br> <br> The baying Press pack subsequently reported the interview in such way
              as to intimate that the Mayor was indifferent to suffering and was out
              of touch with the feelings of the whole East London community!<br> <br> A large motorcade of representatives from all five groups, together
              with Jacquie Smith - the Home Secretary drove to the area and demanded
              a meeting with the local chief fire officer. They made sure that a
              large pack of popular Press and TV had been briefed on the visit and so
              the motorcade was met by a huge gaggle of journalists, TV interviewers
              and cameras.<br> <br> On camera, they loudly demanded to know why the Africans, Black Muslims
              and Albanians all died in the fire and only the white couple lived.<br> <br> The chief fire officer quietly replied:- <br> <br> "They were at work."</p>
