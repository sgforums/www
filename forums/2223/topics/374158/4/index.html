              <p>A man decides to have a face-lift for his birthday. He spends $5,000
              and feels really good about the results. On his way home, he stops at a
              newsstand and buys a paper.<br> Before leaving, he says to the sales clerk, "I hope you don't mind me asking, but how old do you think I am?"<br> "About 35," was the reply.<br> "I'm actually 47," the man says, feeling really happy.<br> After that, he goes into McDonalds for lunch and asks the clerk the same question.<br> The reply is, "Oh, you look about 29".<br> "I am actually 47."<br> Later, while standing at a bus stop, he asks an old woman the same question.<br> She replies, "I am 85 years old, and my eyesight is going. But when I
              was young, there was a sure way of telling a man's age. If I put my
              hand down your pants and play with your balls for 10 minutes, I will be
              able to tell you your exact age."<br> As there was no one around, the man thinks, What the hell and lets her slip her hand down his pants.<br> Ten minutes later, the old lady says, "Okay, it's done. You are 47."<br> Stunned, the man says, "That was brilliant. How did you do that?"<br> The old lady replies, "I was behind you at McDonalds."</p>

              <p>gunner77 wanted to learn how to sky dive. He got an instructor and
              started lessons. The instructor told gunner77  to jump out of the
              plane and pull his rip cord. The instructor then explained that he
              himself would jump out right behind him so that they would go down
              together. gunner77  understood and was ready. <br> <br> The time came to have gunner77  jump from the air plane. The
              instructor reminded him that he would be right behind him. gunner77 
              proceeded to jump from the plane and after being in the air for a few
              seconds pulled the rip cord. The instructor followed by jumping from
              the plane. The instructor pulled his rip cord but the parachute did not
              open. The instructor, frantically trying to get his parachute open,
              darted past gunner77 . <br> <br> gunner77  seeing this yelled, as he undid the straps to his parachute, "So you wanna race, eh?"</p>

              <p>A blonde and her husband were waiting by the first tee for her lesson
              from the golf pro. They watched a foursome tee off. The first man hit
              it 230 yards, straight down the middle of the fairway. <br> <br> "Nice shot," said the blonde. <br> <br> "Not bad, considering my impediment," replied the golfer. <br> <br> "What do you mean?" "I have a glass eye." <br> <br> "I don't believe you," said the blonde. <br> <br> "Show me." He popped out his glass eye and showed it to her. <br> <br> The second golfer hit it 240 yards, straight down the middle of the fairway. <br> <br> "Good shot," said the blonde. <br> <br> "Not bad, considering my impediment," replied the second golfer. <br> <br> "You, too?" said the blonde. <br> <br> "What's wrong with you?" "I have a prosthetic arm," said the golfer. <br> <br> "I don't believe you," said the blonde. "Show me." <br> <br> So he screwed out his arm and showed it to her. <br> <br> The third golfer hit a 250-yard drive down the middle. "Great shot," said the blonde. <br> <br> "Not bad, considering my impediment." <br> <br> "Another? What's your impediment?" <br> <br> "Prosthetic leg," said the golfer. <br> <br> "No way," said the blonde. "Show me." <br> <br> So the golfer screwed off his leg and showed it to her. <br> <br> The fourth golfer hit a beauty, 320 yards, straight as a string. <br> <br> "Now that's a shot," said the blonde. "I suppose you have an impediment, too?" <br> <br> "Yep," said the golfer. "Artificial heart." <br> <br> "What? I don't believe you! Show me." <br> <br> "I can't show you here in the open," he said. "Let's go over there,
              behind the Pro Shop." They did, but when they hadn't returned after
              fifteen minutes, her husband peered around behind the Pro Shop to see
              what was keeping them. And there they were, his wife's was bent over,
              her shorts and panties were around her ankles and he was -- screwing
              his heart out!</p>

              one for cold milk?'<br><br> MELANIE (age 5) asked her Granny how old she was. Granny replied she
              was so old she didn't remember any more. Melanie said, 'If you don't
              remember you must look in the back of your panties. Mine say five to
              six..'<br><br> STEVEN (age 3) hugged and kissed his Mom good night. 'I love you so
              much that when you die I'm going to bury you outside my bedroom window.'<br><br> BRITTANY (age 4) had an ear ache and wanted a pain killer.. She tried
              in vain to take the lid off the bottle. Seeing her frustration, her Mom
              explained it was a child-proof cap and she'd have to open it for her.
              Eyes wide with wonder, the little girl asked: 'How does it know it's
              me?'<br><br> SUSAN (age 4) was drinking juice when she got the hiccups. 'Please
              don't give me this juice again,' she said, 'It makes my teeth cough.'<br><br> DJ (age 4) stepped onto the bathroom scale and asked: 'How much do I cost?'<br><br> MARC (age 4) was engrossed in a young couple that were hugging and
              kissing in a restaurant. Without taking his eyes off them, he asked his
              dad: 'Why is he whispering in her mouth?'<br><br> CLINTON (age 5) was in his bedroom looking worried. When his Mom asked
              what was troubling him, he replied, 'I don't know what'll happen with
              this bed when I get married. How will my wife fit in it?'<br><br> JAMES (age 4) was listening to a Bible story. His dad read : 'The man
              named Lot was warned to take his wife and flee out of the city but his
              wife looked back and was turned to salt.' Concerned, James asked: 'What
              happened to the flea?'<br><br> TAMMY (age 4) was with her mother when they met an elderly, rather
              wrinkled woman her Mom knew. Tammy looked at her for a while and then
              asked, 'Why doesn't your skin fit your face?'<br><br> The Sermon I think this Mom will never forget...this particular Sunday
              sermon.....'Dear Lord,' the minister began, with arms extended toward
              heaven and a rapturous look on his upturned face. 'Without you, we are
              but dust...' He would have continued but at that moment my very
              obedient daughter who was listening leaned over to me and asked quite
              audibly in her shrill little four year old girl voice, 'Mom, what is
              butt dust?'</strong></span></p>

The man walks home, deeply depressed. His wife is waiting for him at the front door and asks him what the doctor said concerning his problem. He tells her what the doc told him. She says, "Oh no, only 30 times! We shouldn't waste that, we should make a list!" He replies, "Yes, I already made a list on the way home. Sorry, your name isn't on it."</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">A little boy opened the big family bible. He was fascinated as he fingered<br><br>through the old pages. Suddenly, something fell out of the Bible. He picked up<br><br>the object and looked at it. What he saw was an old leaf that had been pressed<br><br>in between the pages.<br><br>"Mama, look what I found", the boy called out."<br><br>"What have you got there, dear?"<br><br>With astonishment in the young boy's voice, he answered, "I think it's Adam's underwear!"</span></p>
