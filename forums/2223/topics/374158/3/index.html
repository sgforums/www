              <p>A police officer pulls over a speeding car. The officer says, "I clocked you at 80 miles per hour, sir." <br> The driver says, "Gee, officer I had it on cruise control at 60 perhaps your radar gun needs calibrating. <br> Not looking up from her knitting the wife says: "Now don't be silly dear, you know that this car doesn't have cruise control." <br> As the officer writes out the ticket, the driver looks over at his wife
              and growls, "Can't you please keep your mouth shut for once?" <br> The wife smiles demurely and says, "You should be thankful your radar detector went off when it did." <br> As the officer makes out the second ticket for the illegal radar
              detector unit, the man glowers at his wife and says through clenched
              teeth, "Darn it, woman, can't you keep your mouth shut?" <br> The officer frowns and says, "And I notice that you're not wearing your seat belt, sir. That's an automatic $75 fine." <br> The driver says, "Yeah, well, you see officer, I had it on, but took it
              off when you pulled me over so that I could get my license out of my
              back pocket." <br> The wife says, "Now, dear, you know very well that you didn't have your
              seat belt on. You never wear your seat belt when you're driving." <br> And as the police officer is writing out the third ticket the driver
              turns to his wife and barks, "WHY DON'T YOU PLEASE SHUT UP??" <br> The officer looks over at the woman and asks, "Does your husband always talk to you this way, Ma'am?" <br> "Only when he's been drinking."</p>

              <p>A beautiful, well endowed, young blonde, goes to her local pet store in
              search of an exotic pet. As she looks about the store, she notices a
              box full of frogs. The sign says: Sex Frogs! Only $20 each! Money Back
              Guarantee! (Comes with complete instructions).<br> <br> The girl excitedly looks around to see if anybody's watching her and
              whispers softly to the man behind the counter, "I'll take one." The man
              packaged the frog and said, "Just follow the instructions carefully."<br> <br> The girl nods, grabs the box, and is quickly on her way home. As soon
              as she closes the door to her apartment, the girl takes out the
              instructions and reads them thoroughly, doing exactly what it says to
              do:<br> <br> 1. Take a shower.<br> 2. Splash on some nice smelling perfume.<br> 3. Slip into a very sexy teddy.<br> 4. Crawl into bed and position the frog in place.<br> <br> She then quickly gets into bed with the frog and, to her surprise,
              nothing happens! The girl is totally frustrated and quite upset at this
              point. She re-reads the instructions and notices at the bottom of the
              paper it says, "If you have any problems or questions, please call the
              pet store." So, the girl calls the pet store.<br> <br> The man says, "I had some complaints earlier today. I'll be right
              over." Within five minutes, the man is ringing her doorbell. The girl
              welcomes him in and says, "See, I've done everything according to the
              instructions and the damn thing just sits there."<br> <br> The man, looking very concerned, picks up the frog, stares directly
              into its eyes and sternly says: "Listen to me! I'm only going to show
              you how to do this one more time!"</p>

              <p>A man goes to the famous Lucas Carton restaurant in Paris with his
              girlfriend and orders the 1928 Mouton. The waiter returns with a bottle
              full of wine, pours a small amount in the glass for tasting. The
              customer picks up the glass, smells the wine, and puts it down on the
              table with a thud.<br> <br> "This is not the 1928 Mouton."<br> <br> The waiter assures him it is, and soon there are another twenty people
              surrounding the table, including the chef and the manager trying to
              convince the man that the wine is the 1928 Mouton.<br> <br> Finally someone asks him how he knows that it is not the 1928 Mouton.<br> <br> "My name is Phillipe de Rothschild, and I make the wine."<br> <br> Finally, the original waiter steps forward and admits that he poured the Clerc Milon 1928.<br> <br> "I could not bear to part with our last bottle of 1928 Mouton. You know
              Clerc Milon, it is in the same village as Mouton, you pick the grapes
              at the same time, the same cepage, you crush in the same way, you put
              them into similar barrels. You bottle at the same time, you even use
              eggs from the same chickens to fine them. The wines are the same,
              except for a small matter of geographic location."<br> <br> Rothschild beckons the waiter forward, and whispers to him, "When you
              return home tonight, ask your girlfriend to remove her underwear. Put
              one finger in one opening, another finger in the other, then smell both
              the fingers. You will understand what difference a small distance in
              geographic location makes."</p>

              <p>Sam and John were out cutting wood when John cut his arm off. Sam
              remained calm, wrapped the arm in a plastic bag, and took the arm and
              John to a surgeon. <br> <br> "You are in luck," said the surgeon. "I am an expert in re-attaching
              limbs. Come back in four hours when I have completed the operation." <br> <br> So Sam returned in four hours and the surgeon said, "I did it faster than I expected. Jon is down at the pub." <br> <br> Sam rushed down to the pub and was amazed to see John playing darts. <br> <br> A few weeks later, Sam and John were cutting wood again when John accidentally cut off his leg. <br> <br> Sam put the leg in a plastic bag and took it and John back to the same surgeon. <br> <br> "Legs are harder," said the surgeon, "but I'll see what I can do - come back in six hours." <br> <br> Sam returned in six hours and the surgeon said, "I finished early - John's playing football." <br> <br> Sam went to the field and to his surprise found John kicking 50 meter torpedoes. <br> <br> A few weeks later, Sam and John were cutting wood again, when John accidentally cut off his own head. <br> <br> Sam put the head in a plastic bag and took it and the rest of John to
              the surgeon, confident that the skillful surgeon would do the job. <br> <br> "Gee, heads are really difficult to re-attach," the surgeon muttered, "but I'll see what I can do - come back in 12 hours." <br> <br> Sam returned in 12 hours. <br> <br> "How did it go, Doc?" he asked. <br> <br> "I'm sorry. John died," the surgeon replied. <br> <br> He suffocated in the plastic bag, you idiot!!"</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>A man visits his doctor.<br> <br> "I think I have a problem, doc," said the patient. "One of<br> my balls has turned blue."<br> <br> The doctor examined the man briefly and concluded the<br> patient would die if they didn't have his testicle removed.<br> <br> "Are you crazy?!" exclaimed the patient, "How could I let<br> you do such a thing to me?"<br> <br> "Do you want to die?", asked the doctor rhetorically, and<br> the patient had to agree to have his testicle removed. But<br> two weeks after the operation, he came back.<br> <br> "Doc, I don't know how to say this, but the other ball has<br> turned blue too."<br> <br> Again, the doctor told him that if he wants to live, his<br> other testicle must be cut off too. And again, the man was<br> very reluctant. "Hey, do you want to die?", asked the doc,<br> and the patient had to agree to the operation.<br> <br> But, about two weeks after he is testicleless, he returned<br> to the doctor. "I think something is very wrong with me. My<br> penis is now completely blue."<br> <br> After briefly examining the patient once again, the doc<br> gives him the bad news. If he wants to live, his penis has<br> to go.<br> <br> Of course, he did not want to hear about it. "You really<br> want to die?", asked the doctor.<br> <br> "But... how do I pee?"<br> <br> "We'll install an plastic pipe, and there will be no<br> problem."<br> <br> So, the penis is removed and a while after the operation,<br> the unfortunate man again returns the doctor's office. He is<br> very angry.<br> <br> "Doctor, the plastic pipe turned blue."<br> <br> "What?"<br> <br> "Can you tell me what a hell is happening?"<br> <br> So, the doctor examined the patient more carefully this time, and says, "Hmmmm, I think its the jeans......"</p></div>

              night before they give each other anal one of the guys has to go to the
              toilet. So the other guy says "okay but don't wank in there, save it
              for later." and the first guy agrees. This guy was in the toilet for a
              while so the other gay guy decides to check on him. Once he opens the
              toilet door he sees lots of seamen everywhere. He gets angry and yells
              "I thought I told you not to wank and to save it for later!" to the

              <p>One day this man was driving for hours through the country side and
              needed to go to the bathroom urgently. He sees an old store off the
              side of the road, pulls up and proceeds to the bathroom. When he was
              done dumping his captains log, he looked around and noticed to his
              shock there was no toilet paper and a sign on the wall - "Sorry, there
              is no toilet paper, but if you wipe your arse with your index and
              middle fingers and stick them in this hole they will be licked clean."
              The man thought to himself that that was nasty and that he was not
              going to do that. So he sits for a further hour trying to figure out
              what to do, and eventually realizes that although its nasty, that he
              would do it. So he wipes his arse with his fingers and sticks them in
              the hole. Then a man on the other side slams two bricks onto the mans
              fingers so hard the unbelievable pain causes him to shove his fingers
              in his mouth.</p>

              sale clerks a `pep talk'. "Jane, your figures are well below any of our

              soon, I'm afraid you'll have to let you go."<br><br> "I'm sorry, Ma'am," said a humbled Jane. "Can you give me any advice on how to do better?"<br><br> "Well, there is an old trick I can tell you about. It sounds silly, but
              it's worked for me in the past. Get hold of a dictionary and go through
              it until you come to a word that had particular power for you. Memorize
              it, work it into your sales pitch whenever it seems appropriate, and
              you'll be amazed at the results."<br><br> Sure enough, Jane's sales figures went way up, and at the end of the
              month, the manager called her in again and congratulated her. "Did you
              try my little trick?" she asked.<br><br> Jane nodded. "It took me a whole weekend to find the right word, but I did ... `Fantastic.'"<br><br> "`Fantastic.' What a good word," said the manager encouragingly. "How have you been using it?"<br><br> "Well, my first customer on Monday was a woman who told me her little
              girl had just been accepted at the most exclusive prep school in the
              city. I said, `Fantastic.' She went on to tell me how her daughter
              always got straight A's and was the most popular girl in her class, I
              said `Fantastic' and she bought $300 worth of clothing. My next
              customer said she needed a formal dress for the spring ball at the
              country club, which she was in charge of. I said `Fantastic.' She went
              on to tell she had the best figure of anyone on the committee and her
              husband makes the most money. I said `Fantastic' and she not only
              bought the designer gown, but hundreds of dollars of other merchandise.
              It's been like that all week. The customers keep boasting, I keep
              saying `Fantastic', and they keep buying."<br><br> "Excellent work, Jane," complimented her boss. "Just as a point of
              interest, what did you used to say to customers before you discovered
              your power word?"<br><br> Jane shrugged. "I used to say, `Who gives a shit?'" </strong></span></p>

              <p>Three bulls heard via the grapevine that the rancher was going to bring
              another bull onto the ranch, and the prospect raised a discussion among

              Once we settled our differences, we agreed on which 100 of the cows
              would be mine. Now, I don't know where this newcomer is going to get
              HIS cows, but I ain't' givin' him any of mine."<br> <br> The second bull says, "That pretty much says it for me, too. I've been
              here 3 years and have earned my right to the 50 cows we've agreed are
              mine. I'll fight 'im till I run him off or kill 'im, but I'M KEEPIN'
              ALL MY COWS."<br> <br> The third bull says, "I've only been here a year, and so far you guys
              have only let me have 10 cows to "take care of". I may not be as big as
              you fellows yet, but I am young and virile, so I simply MUST keep all
              MY cows."<br> <br> They had just finished their big talk when an eighteen-wheeler pulls up
              in the middle of the pasture with only ONE ANIMAL IN IT: the biggest
              Son-of-Another-Bull these guys had ever seen! At 4700 pounds, each step
              he took toward the ground strained the steel ramp to the breaking point.<br> <br> The first bull says, "Ahem..You know, it's actually been some time
              since I really felt I was doing all my cows justice, anyway. I think I
              can spare a few for our new friend."<br> <br> The second bull says, "I'll have plenty of cows to take care of if I
              just stay on the opposite end of the pasture from HIM. I'm certainly
              not looking for an argument."<br> <br> They look over at their young friend, the third bull, and find him pawing the dirt, shaking his horns, and snorting up a storm.<br> <br> The first bull says, "Son, let me give you some advice real quick. Let him have some of your cows and live to tell about it."<br> <br> The third bull says, "Heck, he can have ALL my cows. I'm just making sure he knows I'M a bull!"</p>

              <p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>A woman marched into the doctors office with a tiny miserable baby that
              was howling at the top of its lungs and demanded," Do something about
              this baby".<br><br> After a quick examination, the doctor realized the baby was
              malnourished. He's obviously not getting enough milk," he said sternly.
              "is he being breast fed?"<br><br> "Yes," replied the woman.<br><br> "Then the milk supply isn't adequate.   Please take your blouse off."<br><br> The woman obliged, and the doctor proceeded to give her a very thorough
              breast exam, kneading, rubbing, massaging, and sucking each breast at
              some length.<br><br> Finally, perplexed, he announced that he could see why there was a problem.  "You aren't producing any milk at all."<br><br> "Of course not," she responded."  It's my sister's kid,"<br><br> "Why on earth did you come?"  asked the doctor in amazement.<br><br> "I didn't," she replied, “until you started sucking on the other tit." </strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>NAME: Expecteria Trouserius (Trouser Snake)<br><br> LOCATION: Throughout the world<br><br> DESCRIPTION: Varying from pink to black. Fang-less with a highly
              venomous spit. Size varies from 3 to 12 inches, depending on its mood
              and sub-species.<br><br> SYMPTOMS: This snake attacks mainly women in the lower front abdomen,<br> resulting in an inconspicuous bump. Then a severe swelling followed by
              excruciating pain after nine months. The attack is not usually fatal.
              It has been known to attack men in the rear lower abdomen, resulting in
              an incurable disease and consequent death.<br><br> HABITAT: Usually found in bedrooms, but has been known to appear in unusual places.<br><br> ANTIDOTE: Various types of vaccine available for women. However, once
              the venom is injected into the body only drastic measures will ensure
              complete recovery. There is no known antidote for men.<br><br> WHAT TO DO WHEN ATTACKED<br><br> TOURNIQUET: Do not apply a tourniquet as the venom is too deep in the body to be affected.<br><br> CUTTING THE WOUND: This would be completely unnecessary and ineffective as the bleeding will stop after a few weeks anyhow.<br><br> SUCKING THE WOUND: This method is the most popular with the victim but<br> so far has not been reported to have led to any success.<br><br> MILKING THE SNAKE:<br><br> 1. Place four fingers of the right hand around the neck of the reptile, with the thumb in the front.<br> 2. Grip firmly and move the hand in an upwards and downwards motion.<br> 3. This will result in the snake becoming highly aggressive and start spitting.<br> 4. The time taken for this milking process depends entirely on the skill of the milker and the last time the snake attacked.<br> 5. Once milked the snake should be harmless for about 20 minutes.<br><br> CONCLUSION: This snake, although it is very aggressive and active, is
              not necessarily a vermin and treated with the right respect will make a
              wonderful pet. </strong></span></p>
