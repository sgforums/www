              <p>Mr. Jones gets a call from the hospital. They tell him his wife's been
              in a terrible car accident. He rushes to the hospital, runs into the ER
              and says his wife's been in an accident. They tell him Dr. Smith is
              handling the case. They page the doctor. He comes out to the waiting
              room to see a terribly upset Mr. Jones.<br> <br> "Mr. Jones?" the doctor asks. "Yes sir, what's happened? How is my
              wife?" The doctor sits next to him and says, "Not good news. Your
              wife's accident resulted in two fractures of her spine."<br> <br> "Oh my God" says Mr. Jones, "what will be her prognosis?" Dr. Smith
              says "Well, Mr. Jones, her vital signs are stable. However, her spine
              is inoperable. She'll have no motor skills or capability. This means
              you will have to feed her." Mr. Jones begins to sob. "And you'll have
              to turn her in her bed every two hours to prevent pneumonia."<br> <br> Mr. Jones begins to wail and cry loudly. "Then, of course," the doctor
              continued, "you'll have to diaper her as she'll have no control over
              her bladder and of course these diapers must be changed at least five
              times a day." Mr. Jones begins to shake as he cries, sobs, wails.<br> <br> The doctor continues: "And you'll have to clean up her feces on a
              regular basis as she'll have no control over her sphincters. Her bowel
              will engorge whenever and quite often I'm afraid. Of course you must
              clean her immediately to avoid accumulation of the putrid effluent
              she'll be emitting regularly."<br> <br> Now Mr. Jones is convulsing sobbing uncontrollably and beginning to
              wither off the bench into a sobbing pitiful mass. Just then Dr. Smith
              reaches out his hand and pats Mr. Jones on the shoulder. "Hey, I'm just
              fucking with you, she's dead."</p>

                      Testarosa, a BMW 850iL and a Mercedes 600SL in my garage, and I have
                      over twenty-five million dollars in the bank. But, not even for a woman

              <p>Three guys are sitting at the bar, when a stranger walked in and took a
              stool at the far end of the bar. The three guys were tranfixed on the
              stranger, who bear a striking resemblance to Jesus.<br> <br> For quite a while they were speculating if in fact it was the Son of
              God himself. Finally Joe stands up and said he would find out for sure
              and walked down to the end of the bar, but before he could even open
              his mouth, the stranger said, " you have had constant pain in your
              lower back for many years, and so I say unto you "Be healed". Instantly
              the pain left his body. He ran back to tell the others. Tom said that
              it was bullshit and went down to the end of the bar, but again before
              he could say anything, the stranger said, "since you were a child you
              have had an inferior left eye, Be heal and see the world the way God
              intended. Tom's bad eye was seeing as well as the other. Both 20/20. He
              came back to inform the others. Mack just set there, "well I'm not
              going down there - come hell or high water. Just then the stranger
              started walking toward Mack. Finally he was less than ten feet away
              from him Mack yells out, "Stay away from me you son of a bitch...I'm on

              <p>Mr. Jones gets a call from the hospital. They tell him his wife's been in a terrible car accident. He rushes to the hospital, runs into the ER and says his wife's been in an accident. They tell him Dr. Smith is handling the case. They page the doctor. He comes out to the waiting room to see a terribly upset Mr. Jones.<br><br>"Mr. Jones?" the doctor asks. "Yes sir, what's happened? How is my wife?" The doctor sits next to him and says, "Not good news. Your wife's accident resulted in two fractures of her spine."<br><br>"Oh my God" says Mr. Jones, "what will be her prognosis?" Dr. Smith says "Well, Mr. Jones, her vital signs are stable. However, her spine is inoperable. She'll have no motor skills or capability. This means you will have to feed her." Mr. Jones begins to sob. "And you'll have to turn her in her bed every two hours to prevent pneumonia."<br><br>Mr. Jones begins to wail and cry loudly. "Then, of course," the doctor continued, "you'll have to diaper her as she'll have no control over her bladder and of course these diapers must be changed at least five times a day." Mr. Jones begins to shake as he cries, sobs, wails.<br><br>The doctor continues: "And you'll have to clean up her feces on a regular basis as she'll have no control over her sphincters. Her bowel will engorge whenever and quite often I'm afraid. Of course you must clean her immediately to avoid accumulation of the putrid effluent she'll be emitting regularly."<br><br>Now Mr. Jones is convulsing sobbing uncontrollably and beginning to wither off the bench into a sobbing pitiful mass. Just then Dr. Smith reaches out his hand and pats Mr. Jones on the shoulder. "Hey, I'm just fucking with you, she's dead."</p>

He calls the waiter over and asks for their most expensive bottle of Merlot to be sent over to her knowing that, if she accepts it, she is his. The waiter gets the bottle and quickly sends it over to the woman, saying this is from the gentleman over there. She looks at the wine and sends a note over to the man.<br><br>The note reads:<br>"For me to accept this bottle, you need to have a Mercedes in your garage, a million dollars in the bank, and seven inches in your pants."<br><br>The man, after reading her note, chuckles, and sends a note of his own back to her, and it read: "Just so you know, I happen to have a Ferrari Testarosa, a BMW 850iL and a Mercedes 600SL in my garage, and I have over twenty-five million dollars in the bank. But, not even for a woman as beautiful as you, would I cut three inches off. JUST SEND THE BOTTLE BACK." </span></p>
