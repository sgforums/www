              <p>Male Instructional Guide For Relationships<br> <br> The following information was gained through much arduous research
              involving men and women from all backgrounds and walks of life. It
              consists of the most frequently asked questions of women ( i.e.,
              relationships, sex and life in general). All women who read this are
              encouraged to use the wisdom contained therein to change their behavior
              in accordance with the truths established below.<br> <br> Q: How do I know if I'm ready for sex?<br> A: Ask your boyfriend. He'll know when the time is right. When it comes
              to love and sex, men are much more responsible, since they're not as
              emotionally confused as women. It's a proven fact.<br> <br> Q: Should I have sex on the first date?<br> A: YES. Before if possible.<br> <br> Q: What exactly happens during the act of sex?<br> A: Again, this is entirely up to the man. The important thing to
              remember is that you must do whatever he tells you without question.
              Sometimes, however, he may ask you to do certain things that may at
              first seem strange to you. Do them anyway.<br> <br> Q: How long should the sex act last?<br> A: This is a natural &amp; normal part of nature, so don't feel ashamed
              or embarrassed. After you've finished making love, he'll have a natural
              desire to leave you suddenly, &amp; go out with his friends to play
              golf. Or perhaps another activity, such as going out with his friends
              to the bar for the purpose of consuming large amounts of alcohol &amp;
              sharing a few personal thoughts with his buddies. Don't feel left out
              -- while he's gone you can busy yourself by doing laundry, cleaning the
              apartment, or perhaps even going out to buy him an expensive gift.
              He'll come back when he's ready.<br> <br> Q: What is "afterplay"?<br> A: After a man has finished making love, he needs to replenish his
              manly energy. "Afterplay" is simply a list of important activities for
              you to do after lovemaking. This includes lighting his cigarette,
              making him a sandwich or pizza, bringing him a few beers, or leaving
              him alone to sleep while you go out and buy him an expensive gift.<br> <br> Q: Does the size of the penis matter?<br> A: Yes. Although many women believe that quality, not quantity, is
              important, studies show this is simply not true. The average erect male
              penis measures about three inches. Anything longer than that is
              extremely rare and if by some chance your lover's sexual organ is 4
              inches or over, you should go down on your knees and thank your lucky
              stars and do everything possible to please him, such as doing his
              laundry, cleaning his apartment and/or buying him an expensive gift.<br> <br> Q: What about the female orgasm?<br> A: What about it? There's no such thing. It's a myth.</p>

              <p>A middle-aged man returns home from a business trip a day early,
              concerned that his wife may be having an affair. He’s riding in a taxi
              at about 2:00 in the morning back towards his house, when he explains
              his situation to the taxi driver.<br> <br> It’s after midnight. While en route home he asks the cabby if he would be a witness. <br> <br> He explains to the cabbie that he suspects his wife is sleeping around
              on him, and offers the him $50 if he would be a witness to the affair,
              if he could catch her in bed with him. By the time they reach his
              house, the cabbie agrees.<br> <br> They park a few doors down and, quietly, sneak into the front door and
              up the stairs. Then, with a burst of speed, the husband flicks on the
              bedroom lights and rips the blanket off the bed – and there his wife
              lays in bed with another man!<br> <br> Out of his coat pocket, the visibly distraught husband pulls out a gun
              and puts it to the naked man’s head. Just then, his wife yells “Don’t
              do it! I lied when I told you I inherited all that money!…”<br> <br> HE paid for the Mercedes I gave you. <br> HE paid for our new cabin in the mountains. <br> HE paid for your Atlanta Braves season tickets. <br> HE paid for our our lakehouse and boat. <br> HE paid for your country club membership, and and HE even pays the monthly dues!’ <br> Shaking his head, unsure of whether to pull the trigger, he looks over at the taxi driver and asks “What should I do?”<br> <br> The taxi driver replies, “I’d cover him with that blanket before he catches a cold.”</p>

              Sunday... she is a wonderful cook... she loves children and wants a

              <p>Superman was kinda bored so he just started flying around looking for
              something to do. He's flying over Wonder Woman's house and sees her
              bedroom window is open. He stops for a glimpse and sees her lying on
              her bed naked. She's lying there and squirming around looking real hot.<br> <br> Superman was getting turned on looking at her so he decides what the
              hell, I can just fly in real quick, give her the ole' in-out and be out
              of there before she even knows what hit her. After all he is Superman.
              So, in he goes, wham-bam and he's out of there.<br> <br> Wonder Woman knew something happened and says, "What was that?"<br> <br> The invisible man says, "I don't know but, damn, is my ass sore."</p>

              <p>A guy from Tyson Foods arranges to visit the Pope. After receiving the
              papal blessing, he whispers, “Your Eminence, do we have a deal for you.
              If you change The Lord's Prayer from ‘give us this day our daily
              bread....’ to ‘give us this day our daily chicken....’ we will donate
              $500 million dollars to the Church.” <br> <br> The Pope responds saying, “That is impossible. The Prayer is the Word of the Lord and it must not be changed.” <br> <br> “Well,” says the Tyson man, “we are prepared to donate $1 billion to
              the Church if you change the Lord's Prayer from ‘give us this day our
              daily bread....’ to ‘give us this day our daily chicken....’”<br> <br> Again, the Pope replies, “That is impossible. The Prayer is the Word of the Lord and it must not be changed.” <br> <br> Finally, the Tyson guy says, “This is our last offer. We will donate $5 billion to the church if you change the Lord's Prayer<br> from ‘give us this day our daily bread...’ to ‘give us this day our daily chicken....’” and he leaves. <br> <br> The next day, the Pope meets with the College of Cardinals to say that
              he has good news and bad news. “The good news is that the Church has
              come into $5 billion.”<br> <br> “The bad news is that we are losing the Wonder Bread Account.</p>

              <p>Mother Teresa died and went to heaven. God greeted her at the Pearly Gates. "Be thou hungry, Mother Teresa?" asked God.<br> <br> "I could eat," Mother Teresa replied.<br> <br> So God opened a can of tuna and reached for a chunk of rye bread and
              they began to share it. While eating this humble meal, Mother Teresa
              looked down into Hell and saw the inhabitants devouring huge steaks,
              lobsters, pheasants, and pastries. Curious, but deeply trusting, she
              remained quiet.<br> <br> The next day God again invited her to join him for a meal. Again, it
              was tuna and rye bread. Once again, Mother Teresa could see the
              denizens of Hell enjoying lamb, turkey, venison, and delicious
              desserts. Still she said nothing.<br> <br> The following day, mealtime arrived and another can of tuna was opened.
              She couldn't contain herself any longer. Meekly, she asked, "God, I am
              grateful to be in heaven with you as a reward for the pious, obedient
              life I led. But here in heaven all I get to eat is tuna and a piece of
              rye bread and in the Other Place they eat like emperors and kings! I
              just don't understand it..." <br> <br> God sighed. "Let's be honest Teresa," <br> He said, ". . . for just two people, it doesn't pay to cook.</p>

              <p>Once upon a time there was a young redneck by the name of Jack. Jack
              lived and worked on a farm with the farmer, the farmer's wife and their
              daughter Mabel.<br> <br> One fine day as Jack was attending to his daily chores he saw Mabel
              bending over to milk the cow. He felt himself become aroused for the
              first time and, shocked, ran to find the farmer to explain this strange
              phenomena. Upon finding the farmer he proceeded to drop his trousers
              and whip out his stiff trouser snake much to the horror of the farmer.<br> <br> "Farmer, farmer," Jack cried, "what is happening to my penis?"<br> <br> "Now settle down and put that thing away." said the farmer.<br> <br> "Don't worry about it. It happens to all men."<br> <br> "But I don't like it!" cried Jack.<br> <br> "Well then," said the farmer, "next time it happens just go into the
              milk shed, get some cow shit and rub it on your dick. It'll go down
              quick smart, trust me."<br> <br> The next day Jack was passing by the house when he looked in and saw
              the farmers' wife having a shower Feeling his member getting hard he
              rushed into the cow shed, dropped his pants and picked up two handfuls
              of shit. Just then Mabel walked into the shed.<br> <br> "What are you doing Jack?" asked Mabel. <br> <br> "Well," Jack replied, "I'm gonna rub this shit on my dick to make it go down."<br> <br> "That would be a waste." Mabel said as she laid down on the ground and lifted her skirt. "Why don't you stick it up here?"<br> <br> So he did.<br> <br> Both handfuls!!!!!</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;">There was once an old man and a parrot living all alone together for like 40 years. <br> One day, the parrot came to the old man and said, "you know, I've never had a woman in my life." <br> So the old man, as a favour to his best friend, went to the pet store
              and talked the owner into letting him use a female parrot for one night
              for the fee of 40 dollars. <br> He took the female home, put it into the cage with his parrot, covered
              the cage and went to bed. He was awoken in the middle of the night to
              the female parrot screaming she was being killed. <br> He ran out and pulled the cover off the cage. There he saw his male
              parrot ripping all the feathers off of the female. "What are you
              doing?" the old man screamed. <br> The parrot replied, "Are you kidding, for 40 dollars, I at least want the bitch naked!"</span></p>

              <p>“Hey, Mom,” asked Little Johnny, “can you give me twenty dollars?”
              “Certainly not!” answered his mother. “If you do,” Little Johnny went
              on, “I’ll tell you what dad said to the maid when you were at the
              beauty shop.”<br> <br> His mother’s ears perked up and, grabbing her purse, she handed over
              the money. “Well? what did he say?” “He said, ‘Hey, Juanita, make sure
              you wash my socks tomorrow.’”</p>

              <p>In a trial, a Southern small-town prosecuting attorney called his first
              witness, a grandmotherly, elderly woman to the stand. He approached her
              and asked, "Mrs. Jones, do you know me?" She responded, "Why yes, I do
              know you, Mr. Williams. I've known you since you were a boy, and
              frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on
              your wife, and you manipulate people and talk about them behind their
              backs. You think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to
              realize you'll never amount to anything more than a two-bit paper
              pusher. Yes, I know you."<br> <br> The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across
              the room and asked, "Mrs. Jones, do you know the defense attorney?"<br> <br> She again replied, "Why yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was
              a youngster too. He's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem. He
              can't build a normal relationship with anyone, and his law practice is
              one of the worst in the entire state. Not to mention he cheated on his
              wife with three different women. One of them was your wife. Yes, I know
              him."<br> <br> The defense attorney nearly died.<br> <br> The judge asked both counselors to approach the bench and, in a very quiet voice, said,<br> "If either of you idiots asks her if she knows me, I'll send you both to the electric chair."</p>
