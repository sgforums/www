            <div class='col-md body'><div id="post_message_661527">There was this guy,Tom, who really loved his girlfriend. He loved her so much that he wanted to tattoo her name,"Wendy" on his dick. So he went to his friend who specializes in tattooing. <br><br>His friend then suggested doing the tattoo while his dick is erected so that the name can be tattooed bigger and clearer. Tom agreed and went to erect his dick and had "Wendy" tattooed on it. He was very satisfied, there was a "Wy" on his dick when not erected and he dreamt of surprising his girlfriend by showing her the change from "Wy" to "Wendy" when he gets hard. <br><br>So he called her quickly and arranged a meeting that evening. Before their date, he went to the toilet to piss and there he met this American with a "Wy" on his dick too, when he was pissing at the urinal. <br><br>Thinking that this American might have tattooed his girlfriend's name too, Tom confronted him. The American denied, saying that it is not Tom's girlfriend's name.<br><br>Tom wouldn't accept verbal denial and suggested erecting both their dicks to compare. The American agreed and they both started arousing themselves. Tom was first to erect and was proud to show the American, saying," Look, this is my girlfriend's name, Wendy." <br><br>The American soon erected his dick and showed to Tom and said," Look, it is not your girlfriend's name." It said," Welcome to America and have a nice day".</div></div>

              <p>Right, go ahead and post a joke. Let me write under your joke  a "Posted Before" note. Afterall i'm entitled right?</p>
              <p>No one is saying you are flaming or anything, but I feel writing something like POSTED BEFORE is rude and really really not thoughtful.And its not like you do it occasionally.</p>
              <p>But that might be just you, relaxing, taking the time to post something irrelevant, having your way with life.</p>
              <p>I dont know in what way was i NOT grown up, you must have a great way of dealing with logic in your head.</p>
              <p>I'm in no way starting a flame war, and in no way prejudiced against your general character. But hey, wouldn't kill if you stop or at least rephrase your Posted Before note.</p>

              <p>Yes you are entitled if you can find <strong>proof </strong>that it has been posted before.</p>
              <p>Go ahead from page 3 and page 4 of this forum. There are definitely some which others have said I posted before, and I take it as that. But I did take effort to search through using google to do a quick check on those.</p>

              <p>Your idiotic way of generalisation already shows you not grown up (and dumb). Want me to proof further?</p>

              <p>let me show you:</p>

                                                      for jokes. Even if you came upon it accidentally or through any
                                                      other methods already, doesn't mean others have.</p>
              <p>==&gt; Tell me why this explains "posted before" is not allowed here.</p>
