              <div>There was this guy,Tom, who really loved his girlfriend. He loved her so much that he wanted to tattoo her name,"Wendy" on his dick. So he went to his friend who specializes in tattooing.<br><br>His friend then suggested doing the tattoo while his dick is erected so that the name can be tattooed bigger and clearer. Tom agreed and went to erect his dick and had "Wendy" tattooed on it. He was very satisfied, there was a "Wy" on his dick when not erected and he dreamt of surprising his girlfriend by showing her the change from "Wy" to "Wendy" when he gets hard.<br><br>So he called her quickly and arranged a meeting that evening. Before their date, he went to the toilet to piss and there he met this American with a "Wy" on his dick too, when he was pissing at the urinal.<br><br>Thinking that this American might have tattooed his girlfriend's name too, Tom confronted him. The American denied, saying that it is not Tom's girlfriend's name.<br><br>Tom wouldn't accept verbal denial and suggested erecting both their dicks to compare. The American agreed and they both started arousing themselves. Tom was first to erect and was proud to show the American, saying," Look, this is my girlfriend's name, Wendy."<br><br>The American soon erected his dick and showed to Tom and said," Look, it is not your girlfriend's name." It said," Welcome to America and have a nice day".</div>

              <p>yes, you are telling or rather, just informing someone. But that doesn't mean it has no meaning/emotions attached to it, regardless of whether u meant it intentionally or not. Analogy wise, you can go figure one out yourself.</p>

Nor can I expect you to really keep to context. In addition, I still see <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>no link</strong></span> between saying eagle is not the first nick to be used in forums, and posting "posted before" in this joke thread.

              <p>Personally, there's nothing wrong with "Posted before".</p>
              <p>But too much of "Posted before" is a bit demoralising to the person posting it. A thank you or something after that may make it better though. More encouraging.</p>
              <p>My 2 cents :)</p>

              <p>Let's see it the other way</p>
              <p>You clicked on the thread expecting a nice new joke, and out pops one that you have read before. You exit the thread, click on the next joke thread, and out pops one again that you have read before. Let this happen a few more times.</p>
              <p>How would you feel? In fact, most of TS's jokes have been posted before right here at jokes forums.</p>
              <p>It's not possible to say: "You read it before, then don't need to read". Because until you finish reading it, you won't know you read it before.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I would say "Posted before" is merely another form of expressing your opinions about the joke that is posted, just like smileys. Be it encouraging or not, it's still feedback to the joke poster.</p>
