              The Bush Administration outlines its major commitment to broker a peace treaty between Israel and Palestine before Bush Jr presidential term comes to a close.
              
              It is of my opinion that Bush Jr will never succeed as the last time the Jews listen to a talking Bush, they wandered the desert for nearly 500 years.

              <p>Several men are in the locker room of a golf club. A cell phone on a bench rings and a man engages the hands-free speaker- function and begins to talk. Everyone else in the room stops to listen.</p>
              <p>MAN: "Hello"<br>WOMAN: "Honey, it's me. Are you at the club?"<br>MAN: "Yes."<br>WOMAN: "I'm at the mall now and found this beautiful leather coat. It's only $1,000. Is it OK if I buy it?"<br>MAN: "Sure, go ahead if you like it that much."<br>WOMAN: "I also stopped by the Mercedes dealership and saw the new 2007 models. I saw one I really liked."<br>MAN: "How much?"<br>WOMAN: "$65,000."<br>MAN: "OK, but for that price I want it with all the options."<br>WOMAN: "Great! Oh, and one more thing. The house we wanted last year is back on the market. They're asking $950,000."<br>MAN: "Well, then go ahead and give them an offer, but just offer $900,000."<br>WOMAN: "OK. I'll see you later! I love you!"<br>MAN: "Bye, I love you, too."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>It's wise to remember how easily e-mail can be misused, sometimes unintentionally, with serious consequences. <br>Consider the case of the Illinois man who left the snow-filled streets of Chicago for a vacation in Florida. His wife was on a business trip and was planning to meet him there the next day. When he reached his hotel, he decided to send his wife a quick e-mail.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, when typing her address, he missed one letter, and his note was directed instead to an elderly woman whose husband had passed away only the day before. When the grieving widow checked her e-mail, she took one look at the monitor, let out a piercing scream, and fell to the floor in a dead faint.</p>
              <p>At the sound, her family rushed into the room and saw this note on the screen:</p>
              <p>Dearest Wife, Just got checked in. Everything prepared for your arrival tomorrow.</p>
              <p>P.S. Sure is hot down here.</p>
