You want it, you take it." For three days, the fridge sat there without even one person looking twice at it.He eventually decided that people were too untrusting of this deal. It looked too good to be true, so he changed the sign to read, "Fridge for sale $50." The next day someone stole it.<br><br>______________________________<br><br>I couldn't find my luggage at the airport baggage area, so I went to the lost luggage office and told the woman there that my bags never showed up.
