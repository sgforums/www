                                      by hand. The ground around is made of very hard clay, so it is also

                                      the four different strokes (backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly,
                                      and freestyle). The top three finishers in each event will qualify

                                      in the freestyle.<br> 14) The contestant who finished fifth in the backstroke did not
                                      finish third in the butterfly.<br> 15) No contestant finished in the same position in both the

              <p>9) Someone broke your window. There are four children playing near it, so
                  only one of them could have broken it. You know that the kid who broke
                  it is lying, but you do not know how many of the others are lying too.<br>A: "Not me! I didn't break a thing!"<br>B: "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke it."<br>C: "Don't be mad at A! He didn't do anything!"<br>D: "B didn't break the glass, I swear."</p>

              <p>10)A boy rolls a die. Each time it stops rolling, he writes something

                  six, he writes down "20". He just rolled three. <br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is he going to write down?</span></strong></p>

              <p>9) Someone broke your window. There are four children playing

              it. You know that
                                      the kid who broke it is lying, but you do not 
              know how many of the
                                      others are lying too.<br> A: "Not me! I didn't break a thing!"<br> B: "OK, I'll tell the truth. It was me. I broke 
              it."<br> C: "Don't be mad at A! He didn't do anything!"<br> D: "B didn't break the glass, I swear."<br><br>B: If He broke it and he says he broke it then B is telling the truth. So B is out.<br>D: If B didn't Break the glass and D says B didn't break the glass. Then D is also telling the truth. So D is out.<br><br>Now we left A and C:<br><br>Assuming C was the one who broke it.<br><br>C: C says A didn't break it. (And we know the person who broke it is lying - Contradiction)<br> <br>Therefore. A is the one who broke it.<br><br>Now for fun<br>Assuming A was the one who broke it.<br>A said he didnt break it.

              <p>10)A boy rolls a die. Each time it stops rolling, he writes
              something down. Each time he rolls one, he writes down "15". Each
              time he rolls six, he writes down "20". He just rolled three.<br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is he going

              <p>9: Since we know that the person who broke it was lying, so B must be lying as if he broke the glass, then he is telling the truth. Now, For A and C, I believe both of them are lying as well since both A &amp; C claims A did not broke the glass. Therefore I guess it is either both A &amp; C broke the glass, if not then it is D, becoz D's statement contradicates everything.</p>
