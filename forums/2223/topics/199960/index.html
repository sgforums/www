            <div class='col-md body'>Once upon a time, 3 guys were hiking up in the woods when they got lost. They've been lost for 6 hours and night is begining to fall. They were tired, hungry and can't see anything through the darkness of the forest. Then suddenly, they saw a glimmer of light at a distance. The ran towards it and saw a beat-up old inn.<br><br>1st guy (a believer in the super natural): "There shouldn't be an inn here."<br>2nd guy (a businessman): "Man, this place is beat-up, I wouldn't stay here even if the company pays me."<br>3rd guy (a rude guy): "Who gives a sh*t of what you think!!! I'm tired and I don't care if this shi*ty old inn is haunted, I going in."<br><br>Following the 3rd guys lead, they went in and shared a room. Before they went to sleep, they asked the old lady who runs the inn if the inn had a bathroom.<br><br>The old lady: "I'm sorry, this inn is old and doesn't have one. But there is a magical pool at the back. You just yell out what you want while jumping in and the pool will be filled with what you yelled. So I suggest you ask for warm water. Good night gentlemen." The old lady walked off.<br><br>3rd guy: "That old bit*h went and lost her mind."<br>2nd guy: "Hey, give the old lady a break, at least we got the bath for free... Some places we have to pay."<br>1st guy: "Haha, wonder if what the old lady says is true."<br><br>They went to the back and saw a small pool but all empty.<br><br>3rd guy: "What the fcuk!!! This shi*ty old hotel doesn't even have a water in the pool"<br>1st guy: "Hmmm... I wonder."<br>2nd guy: "Wait wait wait, What you think you're doing!!!?"<br><br>The 1st guy jumped jumped into the empty pool and yelled "banana", and he landed in a pool full of banana.<br><br>1st guy: "HAHAHAHA!!!! The old lady was right!!!"<br><br>He grabed some of the bananas out of the pool as much as he can carry and once again the pool was empty.<br><br>The second guy did the most obvious thing and yelled "MONEY!!!" and he landed in a pool full of money.<br><br>2nd guy: "I'm RICH!!!!"<br><br>He grabed as much money as he could out of the pool and the pool became empty once again.<br><br>Following the 2nd guy's lead, the 3rd guy intened to do the same thing. He backed up to get a running start and ran into the pool. But suddenly, he slipped on a banana peal at the edge of the pool and instinctively yelled "SH*TTTTTTT!!!"<br><br>The End.<br><br>Moral of the story?</div>
