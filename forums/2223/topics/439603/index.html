              A blind man walks into a restaurant and sits down. 
              
              The waiter, who is also the owner, walks up to the blind man and hands him a menu. 
              
              "I'm sorry sir, but I am blind, and can't read the menu. 
              
              Just bring me a dirty fork from a previous customer, I'll smell it and order from there." 
              
              A little confused, the owner walks over to the dirty dish pile and picks up a greasy fork. He returns to the blind man's table and hands it to him. The blind man puts the fork to his nose and takes in a deep breath. 
              
              "Ah, yes that's what I'll have, meatloaf and mashed potatoes." 
              
              Unbelievable, the owner says to himself as he walks towards the kitchen. 
              
              The cook happens to be the owner's wife and he tells her what had just happened. 
              
              The blind man eats his meal and leaves. 
              
              Several days later the blind man returns and the owner mistakingly brings him a menu again. 
              
              "Sir, remember me? I'm the blind man." "I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you. I'll go get you a dirty fork." 
              
              The owner again retrieves a dirty fork and brings it to the blind man. 
              
              After another deep breath, the blind man says, "That smells great, I'll take the Macarroni and chesse dbroccoli."
              
              Once again walkding away in disbelief, the owner thinks the blind man is screwing around with him and tells his wife that the next time the blind man comes in he's going to test him. 
              
              The blind man eats and leaves. He returns the following week, but this time the owner see's him coming and runs to the kitchen. 
              
              He tells his wife, "Mary rub this fork on your panties before I take it to the blind man." Mary complies and hands her husband the fork back. 
              
              As the blind man walks in and sits down, the owner is ready and waiting. "Good afternoon sir, this time I remembered you and I already have the fork ready for you." 
              
              The blind man puts the fork to his nose, takes a deep whiff and says, 
              
              "Hey I didn't know that Mary worked here?"

              A man and his wife go to their honeymoon hotel for their 25th anniversary. As the couple reflected on that magical evening 25 years ago, the wife asked the husband, "When you first saw my naked body in front of you, what was going through your mind?"
              
              The husband replied, "All I wanted to do was to fxxx your brains out, and sxxx your tits dry."
              
              Then, as the wife undressed, she asked, "What are you thinking now?"
              
              He replied, "It looks as if I did a pretty good job."

              A blind man interviews for a job as a quality controller at the local wood mill. The manager calls the blind man into his office and asks him how he expected to do this job since he was blind. The blind man replied he would do it by smell. The manager decides to test him and places a piece of wood in front of him. The manager asks, "What is it without touching it?" The blind man replies, "That's a good piece of fir." "Correct," says the manager, "now try this one." "That's a bad piece of willow," says the blind man. "Correct," answers the manager.
              
              With that, the manager decides to play a trick on the blind man. He get his secretary to lift up her dress and put her crotch in the blind mans face. "I'm confused," says the blind man, "Can you turn it around?" The secretary turns around and puts her ass in his face. The blind man says, "Oh, you're trying to fool me! But I know exactly what kind of wood that is. It's the shit house door off a tuna boat!"

              A little boy and his grandfather are raking leaves in the yard. The little boy sees an earthworm trying to get back into its hole. He says, "Grandpa, I bet I can put that worm back in that hole." The grandfather replies, "I'll bet you five dollars you can't. It's too wiggly and limp to put back in that little hole."
              
              The little boy runs into the house and comes back out with a can of hair spray. He sprays the worm until it is straight and stiff as a board. The boy then proceeds to put the worm back into the hole. The grandfather hands the little boy five dollars, grabs the hair spray and runs into the house.
              
              Thirty minutes later the grandfather comes back out and hands the boy another five dollars. The little boy says, "Grandpa, you already gave me five dollars." The grandfather replies, "I know. That's from your Grandma."
