              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000;">He goes back to the
              pimp and tells him: “I think you made a mistake. I want a white
              tiger, with no hair below. The girl in room 13 is not a white
              tiger”</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000;">The pimp says he is
              very sure the girl in room 13 is one and brings the guy back to the

              the door, they see the same girl, naked on the bed and sure enough,
              there’s a dark patch on her crotch.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000;">The pimp led the

Each player shall furnish his own equipment for play - normally one club and two balls. <br>2. Play on a course must be approved by the owner of the hole. <br>3. Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and keep the balls out. <br>4. For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft. Course owners are permitted to check shaft stiffness before play begins. <br>5. Course owners reserve the right to restrict club length to avoid damage to the hole. <br>6. The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until the course owner is satisfied that play is complete. Failure to do so may result in being denied permission to play the course again. <br>7. It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately upon arrival at the course. The experienced player will normally take time to admire the entire course with special attention to well formed bunkers. <br>8. Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have played, or are currently playing, to the owner of the course being played. Upset course owners have been known to damage players equipment for this reason. <br>9. Players are encouraged to bring proper rain gear for their own protection. <br>10. Players should ensure themselves that their match has been properly scheduled, particularly when a new course is being played for the first time. Previous players have been known to become irate if they discover someone else playing on what they considered to be a private course. <br>11. Players should not assume a course is in shape for play at all times. Some players may be embarrassed if they find the course to be temporarily under repair. Players are advised to be extremely tactful in this situation. More advanced players will find alternative means of play when this is the case. <br>12. The course owner is responsible for manicuring and pruning any bush around the hole to allow for improved viewing of, alignment with, and approach to the hole. <br>13. Players are advised to obtain the course owners permission before attempting to play the back nine. <br>14. Slow play is encouraged. However, players should be prepared to proceed at a quicker pace, at least temporarily, at the course owners request. <br>15. It is considered outstanding performance, time permitting, to play the same hole several times in one match </span></p>
