              three phases. In a man's twenties, his Willy is like an oak tree,
              mighty and hard. In his thirties and forties, it is like a birch,
              flexible but reliable. After his fifties, it is like a Christmas Tree. <br> <br> " A Christmas tree?"<br> <br> "Yes, of course, dead from the root up and the balls are for decoration only."<br> "Ooo... what's a pity.... Only decoration, Dad?"</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>The other day I went to the local religious book store and I saw
              a "Honk if you love Jesus" bumper sticker. I bought it and put it
              on the back bumper of my car, and I'm really glad I did. What an
              uplifting experience followed!<br> <br> I was stopped at the light at a busy intersection, just lost in
              thought about the Lord, and didn't notice that the light had
              changed. That bumper sticker really worked! I found lots of people
              who love Jesus. Why, the guy behind me started to honk like crazy.
              He must really love the Lord because pretty soon, he leaned out his
              window and yelled, "Jesus Christ!" as loud as he could. It was like
              a football game with him shouting, "Go Jesus Christ, Go!"<br> <br> Everyone else started honking, too, so I leaned out my window and
              waved and smiled to all of those loving people. There must have
              been a guy from Florida back there because I could hear him yelling
              something about a sunny beach, and saw him waving in a funny way
              with only his middle finger stuck up in the air. I asked my two
              kids what that meant. They kind of squirmed, looked at each other,
              giggled and told me that it was the Hawaiian good luck sign. So, I
              leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back.<br> <br> Several cars behind, a very nice man stepped out of his car and
              yelled something. I couldn't hear him very well, but it sounded
              like, "Mother trucker," or "Mother's from there." Maybe he was from
              Florida, too. He must really love the Lord.<br> <br> A couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment
              that they got out of their cars and were walking toward me. I bet
              they wanted to pray, but just then I noticed that the light had
              changed to yellow, and stepped on the gas. And it's a good thing I
              did because I was the only driver to get across the intersection. I
              looked back at them standing there. I leaned way out the window,
              gave them a big smile and held up the Hawaiian good luck sign as I
              drove away.</p>

              <p>she ride on him. lols</p>
              <p><br><br><br><br>so next one.<br>40 ways Men Fail in BED<br> <br> 1) NOT KISSING FIRST. Avoiding her lips and diving straight for the
              erogenous zones makes her feel like you're paying by the hour &amp;
              trying to get your money's worth by cutting out non-essentials. A proper<br> passionate kiss is the ultimate form of foreplay.<br> <br> 2) BLOWING TOO HARD IN HER EAR. Well, there's a difference between
              being erotic and blowing as if you're trying to extinguish the candles
              on your birthday cake!<br> <br> 3) NOT SHAVING. Guys often forget they have a porcupine strapped to
              their chins, which they rake repeatedly across their partner's face and
              thighs. So when she turns her head from side to side, it's not passion
              it's avoidance!<br> <br> 4) SQUEEZING HER BREAST. Most men act like a housewife testing melons
              for ripeness when they get their hands on a pair.Stroke, caress, and
              smooth them.<br> <br> 5) BITING HER NIPPLES. Why do men fasten onto a woman's nipples, then
              clamp down like they're trying to deflate her body via her breasts?
              Nipples are highly sensitive &amp; they can't stand up to chewing. Lick
              and suck them gently. Flicking your tongue across them is good.
              Pretending<br> they're a doggie toy isn't.<br> <br> 6) TWIDDLING HER NIPPLES. Stop doing that thing where you twiddle the
              nipples between finger and thumb like you're trying to find a radio
              station in a hilly area. Focus on the whole breasts, not just the
              exclamation points.<br> <br> 7) IGNORING THE OTHER PARTS OF HER BODY. A woman is not a highway with
              just three turnoffs: Breastville East and West, and the Midtown Tunnel.
              There are vast areas of her body, which you've ignored far too often as
              you go bombing straight into downtown Vagina. So start paying them some
              attention!<br> <br> <img class="inlineimg" title="Cool" src="http://www.laksa.org/forums/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" border="0" alt=""> GETTING THE HAND TRAPPED. Poor manual dexterity in the underskirt
              region can result in tangled fingers and underpants. If you're going to
              be that aggressive, just ask her to take the damn things off.<br> <br> 9)    LEAVING HER A LITTLE PRESENT.  Condom disposal is the man's responsibility.  You wore it, you store it.<br> <br> 10)   ATTACKING THE CLITORIS.  Direct pressure is very unpleasant, so gently rotate your fingers along side of the clitoris.<br> <br> 11) STOPPING FOR A BREAK. Women, unlike men, don't pick up where they
              left off. If you stop, they plummet back to square one very fast. If
              you can tell she's not there, keep going at all costs, numb jaw or not.<br> <br> 12) UNDRESSING HER AWKWARDLY. Women hate looking stupid, but stupid she
              will look when naked at the waist with a sweater stuck over her head.
              Unwrap her like an elegant present, not a kid's toy.<br> <br> 13) GIVING HER A WEDGIE DURING FOREPLAY. Stroking her gently through
              her panties can be very sexy. Pulling the material up between her
              thighs and yanking it back and forth is not.<br> <br> 14) BEING OBSESSED WITH THE VAGINA. Although most men can find the
              clitoris without maps, they still believe that the vagina is where it's
              all at. No sooner is your hand down there than you're trying to stuff
              stolen banknotes up a chimney, which is OK in principle, but if you're
              not careful, it can hurt - so don't get carried away. Better to pay
              more attention to her clitoris and the exterior of her vagina at first,
              then gently slip a finger inside her and see if she likes it.<br> <br> 15) MASSAGING TOO ROUGHLY. You're attempting to give her a sensual,
              relaxing massage to get her in the mood. Hands and fingertips are okay;
              elbows and knees are not.<br> <br> 16) UNDRESSING PREMATURELY. Don't force the issue by stripping before
              she's at least made some move toward getting your stuff off, even if
              it's just undoing a couple of buttons.<br> <br> 17)   TAKING YOUR PANTS OFF FIRST.  A man in socks looks stupid.<br> <br> 1<img class="inlineimg" title="Cool" src="http://www.laksa.org/forums/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" border="0" alt=""> GOING TOO FAST. When you get to the penis-in-vagina situation, the
              worst thing you can do is pump away like an industrial power tool
              she'll soon feel lie an assembly-line worker made obsolete by your<br> technology. Build up slowly, with clean, straight, regular thrusts.<br> <br> 19) GOING TOO HARD. If you bash your great triangular hip bones into
              her thigh or stomach, the pain is equal to two weeks of horseback riding<br> concentrated into a few seconds.<br> <br> 20) COMING TOO SOON. Every man's fear (with reason). If you shoot
              before you see the whites of her eyes, make sure you have a backup plan
              to ensure her pleasure too.<br> <br> 21) NOT COMING SOON ENOUGH. You may think that humping for an hour
              without climaxing is the mark of a sex god, but to her it's more likely
              the mark of a numb vagina. At least buy some intriguing wall hangings
              so she has something to hold her interest while you're playing Marathon
              Man.<br> <br> 22) ASKING IF SHE HAS COME. You really ought to be able to tell. Most
              women make noise. But if you really don't know, don't ask.<br> <br> 23) PERFORMING ORAL SEX TOO GENTLY. Don't act like a giant cat at
              saucer of milk. Get your whole mouth down there, and concentrate on
              gently rotating or flicking your tongue on her clitoris.<br> <br> 24) NUDGING HER HEAD DOWN. Men persist in doing this until she's
              eyeball-to-penis, hoping that it will lead very swiftly to
              mouth-to-penis. All women hate this. It's about three steps from being
              dragged to a cave by their hair. If you want her to use her mouth, use
              yours; try talking seductively to her.<br> <br> 25) NOT WARNING HER BEFORE YOU CLIMAX. Sperm tastes like seawater mixed
              with egg white. Not everybody likes it. When she's performing oral sex,
              warn her before you come so she can do what's necessary.<br> <br> 26) MOVING AROUND DURING FELLATIO. Don't thrust. She'll do all the
              moving during fellatio. You just lie there and don't grab her head.<br> <br> 27) TAKING ETIQUETTE ADVICE FROM PORN MOVIES. In X-rated movies, women
              seem to love it when men ejaculate over them. In real life, it just
              means more laundry to do. <br> <br> 2<img class="inlineimg" title="Cool" src="http://www.laksa.org/forums/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" border="0" alt=""> MAKING HER RIDE ON TOP FOR AGES. Asking her to be on top is fine. Lying
              there grunting while she does all the hard work is not. Caress her
              gently, so that she doesn't feel quite so much like the captain of a
              schooner. And let her have a rest.<br> <br> 29) ATTEMPTING ANAL SEX AND PRETENDING IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. This is how
              men earn a reputation for not being able to follow directions. If you
              want to put it there, ask her first. And don't think that being drunk
              is an excuse.<br> <br> 30) TAKING PICTURES. When a man says, "Can I take a photo of you?"
              she'll hear the words "__to show my buddies." At least let her have
              custody of them.<br> <br> 31) NOT BEING IMAGINATIVE ENOUGH. Imagination is anything from drawing
              patterns on her back to pouring honey on her and licking it off. Fruit,
              vegetables, ice and feathers are all handy props; hot candle wax<br> and permanent dye are a no no.<br> <br> 32)   SLAPPING YOUR STOMACH AGAINST HERS.  There is no less erotic noise. It's as sexy as a belching contest.<br> <br> 33) ARRANGING HER IN STUPID POSES. If she wants to do advanced yoga in
              bed, fine, but unless she's a Romanian gymnast, don't get too
              ambitious. Ask yourself if you want a sexual partner with snapped<br> hamstrings.<br> <br> 34) LOOKING FOR HER PROSTATE. Read this carefully: Anal stimulation
              feels good for men because they have a prostate. Women don't.<br> <br> 35) GIVING LOVE BITES. It is highly erotic to exert some gentle suction
              on the sides of the neck, if you do it carefully. No woman wants to
              have to wear turtlenecks and jaunty scarves for weeks on end.<br> <br> <br> 36)   BARKING INSTRUCTIONS.  Don't shout encouragement like a coach with a megaphone.  It's not a big turn-on.<br> <br> 37) TALKING DIRTY. It makes you sound like a lonely magazine editor
              calling a 1-900 line. If she likes nasty talk, she'll let you know.<br> <br> 3<img class="inlineimg" title="Cool" src="http://www.laksa.org/forums/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" border="0" alt=""> NOT CARING WHETHER SHE COMES. You have to finish the job. Keep on
              trying until you get it right, and she might even do the same for you.<br> <br> 39)   SQUASHING HER.  Men generally weigh more than women, so if you lie on her a bit too heavily, she will turn blue.<br> <br> 40)   THANKING HER.  Never thank a woman for having sex with you. Your bedroom is not a soup kitchen.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">A married man keeps telling his wife
                          "Honey, you have such a beautiful butt". Every person in
                          the town agrees that she does have a very beautiful butt. The man's
                          birthday is coming up so she decides to take a trip to the tattoo
                          parlor and get the words "Beautiful butt" tattooed on her
                          ass.<br> <br> She walks in and tells the tattoo artist he husband thinks she has a
                          beautiful butt. He looks and says, "You do have a beautiful
                          butt". She then tells the man she wants Beautiful butt tattooed
                          on her ass. The man tells her "I can't fit that on your ass, it
                          takes up too much space. But I tell you what, I will tattoo the
                          letters BB on each cheek and that can stand for beautiful butt. She
                          agrees and gets it done.<br> <br> On the man's birthday she hears him come home and is only wearing a
                          robe. She then stands at the top of the stairs. He opens the door
                          and she says "look honey." She then takes off the robe she
                          is wearing, bends over, and the man yells "WHO THE FUCK IS
                          BOB?"!</span></p>
