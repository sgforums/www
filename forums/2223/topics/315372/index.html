              <p>1. No matter what my problem is, it's the fault of someone other than
              myself, and the appropriate response is to find that person and kill
              him with my bare hands.<br><br>2. To be truly attractive, a woman must
              wear high heels and an outfit so tight you can tell whether she's cold
              or not from across the room.<br><br>3. There are two kinds of women in
              the world: The type that want to go to bed with you, and the type want
              to kill you. Both types are physically attractive and under 25 years
              old.<br><br>4. If I rudely argue with my boss in front of my
              co-workers, not only won't he fire me, but he will gain a profound
              respect for me.<br><br>5. If I can find an important enough mission, it
              will supercede my obligations to perform household chores, bathe, and
              call the next day.<br><br>6. If I go without bathing, swear a lot, and treat women badly, they will adore me.<br><br>7. If a woman tries to clean a bullet wound and I curse in pain, she will fall in love with me.<br><br>8. Anyone who isn't a cop, mercenary soldier, and/or private investigator is a homosexual. Or at least a sissy.<br><br>9. If I have a prolonged fist-fight with another guy and neither of us dies, we will become best friends.<br><br>10.
              My arch-enemy will bear an uncanny resemblance in age and bearing to my
              father, and he will make it clear that he has gained a deep respect for
              me before I kill him with my bare hands.<br><br>11. When I shoot
              people, they will die quickly and cleanly, and I will never be arrested
              or troubled by their widowed wife and children. When people shoot me,
              however, I will at most receive a 'flesh wound,' which will be tended
              to by a beautiful woman.<br><br>12. Nuclear weapons will never go off
              because something will always happen about three seconds before one
              does to stop it from exploding.<br><br>13. If an aged scientist is involved in any way, he will have a beautiful daughter who will gaze at me adoringly.<br><br>14. If royalty is involved, it will include a beautiful princess who will gaze at me adoringly.<br><br>15. If I have a kid partner, he will be tightly-muscled, clean-cut, and gaze at me adoringly.<br><br>16.
              If I am asked to compete against a world champion at any sport or game
              of any type, I will win. This will infuriate my opponent, who will then
              try to kill me.<br><br>17. If my opponent has a side-kick or henchman, he will never have a sensible name like 'Rick,' or 'Steve.'<br><br>18.
              Beautiful women will frequently furrow their brows with concern and
              ask, "When's the last time you got any sleep?" They will never ask when
              I last bathed or used the toilet, although I apparently never do those
              things either.<br><br>19. The aliens will always be overpowered by the
              humans in the end though their fighting may result in a lot of
              casualties and destruction.<br><br>20. If everyone in a team dies, it's the last man's job to win the fight against his enemy.</p>
