              <p>Three old friends named Jack, David, and Kevin met at a restaurant for
              a get-together. After finishing their meal, Kevin went to the bathroom
              to urinate. Jack and David then started talking about their respective
              sons' accomplishments.<br> <br> "My son is now a successful lawyer. He's so good that everyone wants to
              hire him and money keeps flowing in. He's so rich that he even bought
              his friend a very expensive Mercedes. I'm so proud of him," Jack said
              with a smile on his face.<br> <br> "Well, my son owns a successful business. He would buy me everything I
              ever wanted. And he even bought a huge mansion for his friend. I'm so
              happy that I raised such a good man," David said with a tear in his eye.<br> <br> Kevin then joined the two and asked what they were talking about. They
              both explained they were talking about their sons and asked about
              Kevin's.<br> <br> "Well, my son is nothing to be proud of. He has no job and he's gay.
              But I'm happy for him because his two boyfriends gave him a Mercedes
              and a big mansion," Kevin replied.</p>

              <p>There were three men who were kidnapped. They were captured by hostage
              takers. One of the kidnappers told the prisoners that they could live
              if they pass the trial. The first step of the trial was to go into the
              forest and get ten pieces of the same kind of fruit. So all three men
              went separate ways to gather fruits.<br> <br> The first one came back and said to the king, "I brought ten apples."<br> <br> The kidnappers then explains the trial to him-you have to shove the
              fruits up your ass without any expression on your face or you'll be
              eaten.<br> <br> The first apple went in...but on the second one he winced in pain, so he was killed and went to heaven.<br> <br> The second guy arrives with ten berries. When the kidnappers explained
              the trial to him, he thought to himself that this should be easy.
              1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...but on the ninth berry he burst out in
              laughter, therefore also was killed.<br> <br> The first guy and the second guy met in heaven. The first one asked, "Why did you laugh, you almost got away with it?"<br> <br> The second one replied, "I couldn't help it. I saw the third guy coming with pineapples."</p>

              <p>Little Billy came home from school to see the family's pet rooster dead

              with its legs in the air. When his Dad came home Billy said, "Dad our
              rooster is dead and his legs are sticking in the air. Why are his legs
              sticking in the air?"<br> <br> His father thinking quickly said, "Son, that's so God can reach down
              from the clouds and lift the rooster straight up to heaven."<br> <br> "Gee Dad that's great," said little Billy. A few days later, when Dad
              came home from work, Billy rushed out to meet him yelling, "Dad, Dad we
              almost lost Mom today!"<br> <br> "What do you mean?" said Dad.<br> <br> "Well Dad, I got home from school early today and went up to your
              bedroom and there was Mom flat on her back with her legs in the air
              screaming, "Jesus I'm coming, I'm coming" If it hadn't of been for
              Uncle George holding her down we'd have lost her for sure!"</p>

              <p>A young husband and wife were sunning on a nude beach when a wasp
              buzzed into the woman's vagina. The husband covered her with a coat,
              pulled on his shorts, carried her to the car and made a dash to the
              hospital.<br> <br> After examining her, the doctor explained that the wasp was too far in
              to be reached with forceps. He suggested the husband try to entice it
              out by putting honey on his penis, penetrating her and withdrawing as
              soon as he felt the wasp.<br> <br> The man agreed to try, but because he was so nervous, he couldn't rise
              to the occasion. "if neither of you objects," the medic said, "I could
              give it a try."<br> <br> Under the circumstances, both agreed. The doctor quickly undressed,
              slathered on some honey and mounted the woman. The husband watched with
              increasing alarm as the doctor's thrust continued for several long
              minutes. "Hey, What the hell is happening?"<br> <br> "Change of plans," The physician panted. " I'm going to drown the little bastard!."<span style="color: silver;"> </span><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              into a house to look for money and guns and finds a young couple in
              bed.<br> <br> He orders the guy out of bed and ties him to a chair, while tying
              the girl to the bed he gets on top of her, kisses her neck, then
              gets up and goes into the bathroom. While he's in there, the
              husband tells his wife:<br> <br> "Listen, this guy's an escaped convict, look at his clothes! He
              probably spent lots of time in jail and hasn't seen a woman in
              years. I saw how he kissed your neck." If he wants sex, don't
              resist, don't complain, do whatever he tells you. Satisfy him no
              matter how much he nauseates you. This guy is probably very
              dangerous. If he gets angry, he'll kill us. Be strong, honey. I
              love you."<br> <br> To which his wife responds: "He wasn't kissing my neck. He wwas
              whispering in my ear. He told me he was gay, thought you were cute,
