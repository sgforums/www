              Arthur is 95 years old. He's played golf every day since his retirement 30 years ago.
              
              One day he arrives home looking downcast. "That's it," he tells his wife. "I'm giving up golf. My eyesight has gotten so bad...once I've hit the ball, I can't see where it went."
              
              His wife sympathizes, and as they sit down, she says, "Why don't you take my brother with you, and give it one more try."
              
              "That's no good," sighs Arthur. "Your brother is a hundred and three. He can't help."
              
              "He may be a hundred and three", says the wife, "but his eyesight is perfect."
              
              So the next day, Arthur heads off to the golf course with his brother-in-law. He tees up, takes a mighty swing, and squints down the fairway. He turns to the brother-in-law."Did you see the ball?"
              
              "Of course I did!" says the brother-in-law. "I have perfect eyesight."
              
              "Where did it go?" asks Arthur.
              
              "I can't remember."

            <div class='col-md body'><p>A Texas business man, while in Japan for some business meetings and a few rounds of golf, arrived in Tokyo a day earlier than expected. Feeling lonely that evening, he employed the services of a beautiful young Japanese girl to be his companion for the evening. Although the Japanese girl spoke very little English and the businessman spoke no Japanese, their passion roared and in the heat of the moment she began yelling "Gama Su!, Gama Su!". Hearing this, the Texan knew he had pleased his female Japanese friend and soon afterwards went to sleep. <br>The next day while playing golf with his Japanese business colleagues, one of his Japanese partners holed his shot from 170 yards away! Everyone went crazy and began yelling excitedly in Japanese. Wanting to impress his friends, the Texan joined in and began yelling, "Gama Su! Gama Su!" <br><br>Suddenly everyone became quiet. After a moment of silence, one of the Japanese turned to him and asked "Wrong hole? What do you mean wrong hole?"</p></div>

              <p>Lawyers in an Edson law firm lived and died for their Saturday morning round of golf. It was their favorite moment of the week. Then one of the lawyers was transferred to an office in another city. It wasn't quite the same without him.<br><br>A new woman lawyer joined their law firm. One day she overheard the remaining three talking about their golf round at the coffee table.</p>
              <p>Curious, she spoke up, 'You know, I used to play on my golf team in college and I was pretty good. Would you mind if I joined you next week?'<br><br>The three lawyers looked at each other. They were hesitant. Not one of them wanted to say 'yes', but she had them on the spot. Finally, one man said it would be okay, but they would be starting pretty early, at 6:30 am.<br><br>He figured the early Tee-Time would discourage her immediately. The woman said this might be a problem, and asked if she could possibly be up to 15 minutes late. They rolled their eyes, but said this would be okay.<br><br>She smiled, and said, 'Good, then I'll be there either at 6:30 or 6:45.'</p>
              <p>She showed up right at 6:30, and wound up beating all three of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round. She was a fun and pleasant person the entire round. The guys were impressed! Back in the clubhouse they congratulated her and happily invited her back the next week. She smiled, and said, 'Sure, I'll be here at 6:30 or 6:45.'<br><br>The next week she again showed up at 6:30 Saturday morning. Only this time, she played left-handed. The three lawyers were incredulous as she still managed to beat them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand. By now the guys were totally amazed, but wondered if she was just trying to make them look bad by beating them left-handed.</p>
              <p>They couldn't figure her out. She was again very pleasant and didn't seem to be showing them up, but each man began to harbor a burning desire to beat her!</p>
              <p>In the third week they all had their game faces on. But this week she was 15 minutes late! This had the guys irritable because each was determined to play the best round of golf of his life, to beat her. As they waited for her, they figured her late arrival was some petty gamesmanship on her part. Finally, she showed up. This week the lady lawyer played right-handed, which was a good thing since she narrowly beat all three of them.<br><br>However, she was so gracious and so complimentary of their strong play, it was hard to hold a grudge against her. This woman was a riddle no one could figure out!</p>
              <p>Back in the clubhouse she had all three guys shaking their heads at her ability. They had a couple of beers after their round which helped the conversation loosen up. Finally, one of the men could contain his curiosity no longer. He asked her point blank, 'How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?'<br><br>The lady blushed, and grinned. She said, 'That's easy. When my Dad taught me to play golf, I learned I was ambidextrous. I have always had fun switching back and forth. Then when I met my husband in college and got married, I discovered he always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Right before I left in the morning for golf practice, I would pull the covers off him. If his you-know-what was pointing to the right, I golfed right-handed; if it was pointed to the left, I golfed left-handed.<br><br>All the guys on the team thought this was hysterical.' Astonished at this bizarre information, one of the guys shot back, 'But what if it's pointed straight up in the air?'</p>
              <p>She said, 'Then, that's why I'm fifteen minutes late.'</p>

              <p>A Texas business man, while in Japan for some business meetings
              and a few rounds of golf, arrived in Tokyo a day earlier than
              expected. Feeling lonely that evening, he employed the services of
              a beautiful young Japanese girl to be his companion for the
              evening. Although the Japanese girl spoke very little English and
              the businessman spoke no Japanese, their passion roared and in the
              heat of the moment she began yelling "Gama Su!, Gama Su!". Hearing
              this, the Texan knew he had pleased his female Japanese friend and
              soon afterwards went to sleep.<br> The next day while playing golf with his Japanese business
              colleagues, one of his Japanese partners holed his shot from 170
              yards away! Everyone went crazy and began yelling excitedly in
              Japanese. Wanting to impress his friends, the Texan joined in and
              began yelling, "Gama Su! Gama Su!"<br> <br> Suddenly everyone became quiet. After a moment of silence, one of
              the Japanese turned to him and asked "Wrong hole? What do you mean
              wrong hole?"</p>
