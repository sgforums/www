            <div class='col-md body'><p>The Smiths were unable to conceive children and decided to use a surrogate <br>father to start their family. On the day the surrogate father was to <br>arrive, Mr. Smith kissed his wife and said, "I'm off. The man should be <br>here soon" Half an hour later, just by chance a door-to-door baby <br>photographer rang the doorbell, hoping to make a sale.<br><br>"Good morning, madam. I've come to...."<br>"Oh, no need to explain. I've been expecting you," Mrs. Smith cut in.<br>"Really?" the photographer asked. "Well, good. I've made a speciality of <br>babies"<br>"That's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat"<br><br>After a moment, she asked, blushing, "Well, where do we start?"<br>"Leave everything to me. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the <br>couch and perhaps a couple on the bed. Sometimes the living room floor is <br>fun too; you can really spread out!"<br>"Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work for Harry and me"<br>"Well, madam, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. But, if we <br>try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven different <br>angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results"<br>"My, that's a lot of....." gasped Mrs. Smith.<br>"Madam, in my line of work, a man must take his time. I'd love to be in <br>and out in five minutes, but you'd be disappointed with that, I'm sure"  <br>"Don't I know it," Mrs. Smith said quietly.<br><br>The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his <br>baby pictures.<br>"This was done on the top of a bus in downtown London"<br>"Oh my God!" Mrs. Smith exclaimed, tugging at her handkerchief.<br>"And these twins turned out exceptionally well, when you consider their <br>mother was so difficult to work with"<br>"She was difficult?" asked Mrs. Smith.<br>"Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to Hyde Park to get the job <br>done right. People were crowding around four and five deep, pushing to get <br>a good look"<br>"Four and five deep?" asked Mrs. Smith, eyes widened in amazement.<br>"Yes," the photographer said, "And for more than three hours too. The <br>mother was constantly squealing and yelling. I could hardly concentrate. <br>Then darkness approached and I began to rush my shots. Finally, when the <br>squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just packed it all in."<br>Mrs. Smith leaned forward. "You mean squirrels actually chewed on your, <br>um......equipment?"<br>"That's right. Well, madam, if you're ready, I'll set up my tripod so we  <br>can get to work."<br>"Tripod?????"<br>"Oh yes, I have to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's much too big for <br>me to hold for very long. Madam? Madam? ....... Good Lord, she's <br>fainted!!"<br></p></div>
