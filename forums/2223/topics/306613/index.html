              <p>1. In Shakespeare's time, mattresses were secured on bed frames  <br>by ropes when 
                          you pulled on the ropes the mattress tightened,   <br>making the bed firmer to 
                          sleep on. Hence the phrase "goodnight   <br>&amp; sleep tight."   <br><br>2. It 
                          was the accepted practice in Babylon 4,000 years ago that   <br>for a month 
                          after the wedding, the bride's father would supply   <br>his son-in-law with  
                          all the mead he could drink. Mead is a   <br>honey beer and because their 
                          calendar was lunar based; this   <br>period was called the honey month or what 
                          was known today as   <br>the honeymoon.   <br><br>3. In English pubs, ale is 
                          ordered by pints and quarts. So in   <br>old England, when customers got unruly, 
                          the bartender would   <br>yell at them mind their own pints and quarts and 
                          settle down.   <br>It's where we get the phrase "mind your P's and Q's."   
                          <br><br>4. Many years ago in England, pub frequenters had a whistle   <br>baked 
                          into the rim or handle of their ceramic cups. When they   <br>needed a refill, 
                          they used the whistle to get some service.   <br>"Wet your whistle" is the 
                          phrase inspired by this practice.   <br><br>5. In ancient England a person could 
                          not have sex unless you   <br>had consent of the King (unless you were in the 
                          Royal Family).   <br>When anyone wanted to have a baby, they got consent of 
                          the   <br>King; the King gave them a placard that they hung on their   <br>door 
                          while they were having sex. The placard had F.U.C.K.   <br>(Fornication Under 
                          Consent of the King) on it. Now you know   <br>where that came from.   
                          <br><br>6. In Scotland, a new game was invented. It was entitled   <br>Gentlemen 
                          Only Ladies Forbidden.... and thus the word GOLF   <br>entered into the English 
                          language.</p>
              <p>------------------------</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like a lot of husbands throughout history, Webster would
                                      sit  <br> down and try to talk to his wife. But as soon as he would
                                      start  <br> to say something, his wife would say, "... And what's
                                      that  <br> supposed to mean?"  <br> <br> Thus, Webster's Dictionary was born.</p>
              <p>----------------------------</p>
              <p>The lifeguard told the mother to make her young son
                                      stop  <br> urinating in the pool.  <br> <br> "Everyone knows," the mother lectured him, "that from
                                      time  <br> to time, young children will urinate in a pool."  <br> <br> "Oh really?" said the lifeguard, "from the diving board!?!?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>---------------------------</p>
              <p>Did you know that many non-living things have a
                                      gender?  <br> <br> 1) Ziploc Bags -- They are Male, because they hold
                                      everything  <br> in, but you can see right through them.  <br> <br> 2) Copiers -- They are Female, because once turned off,
                                      it  <br> takes a while to warm them up again. It's an
                                      effective  <br> reproductive device if the right buttons are pushed, but
                                      can  <br> wreak havoc if the wrong buttons are pushed.  <br> <br> 3) Tire -- Male, because it goes bald and it's often
                                      over-  <br> inflated.  <br> <br> 4) Hot Air Balloon -- Male, because, to get it to go
                                      anywhere,  <br> you have to light a fire under it  and, of course, there's
                                      the  <br> hot air component.  <br> <br> 5) Sponges -- Female, because they're soft, squeezable
                                      and  <br> retain water.  <br> <br> 6) Web Page -- Female, because it's always getting hit
                                      on.  <br> <br> 7) Subway -- Male, because it uses the same old lines to
                                      pick  <br> people up.  <br> <br> 8) Hourglass -- Female, because over time, the weight can
                                      shift  <br> to the bottom.  <br> <br> 9) Hammer -- Male, because it hasn't changed much over the
                                      last  <br> 5,000 years, but it's handy to have around.  <br> <br> 10) Remote Control --  Female. Ha! You thought it'd be
                                      male.  <br> But consider this -- it gives a man pleasure, he'd be
                                      lost  <br> without it, and while he doesn't always know the right
                                      buttons  <br> to push, he keeps trying.</p>

                                      After chatting them up awhile, the conversation turned to what we
                                      did in the service. When we told them we were in the infantry, the
                                      girls seemed very impressed, giving us big smiles as they told us
                                      how sweet that was.  <br> <br> Since infantry and sweet are seldom used in the same sentence, I
                                      was a little confused. Until, that is, one of the girls said, "We
