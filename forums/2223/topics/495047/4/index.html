              Here is a little story...that teaches a lot:
              
              A giant ship engine failed. The ship's owners tried one expert after another, but none of them could figure how to fix the engine.
              
              Then they brought in an old man who had been fixing ships since he was young. He carried a large bag of tools with him, and when he arrived, he immediately went to work. He inspected the engine very carefully, top to bottom.
              
              Two of the ship's owners were there, watching this man, hoping he would know what to do. After looking things over, the old man reached into his bag and pulled out a small hammer. He gently tapped something.  Instantly, the engine lurched into life. He carefully put his hammer away.
              
              The engine was fixed! A week later, the owners received a bill from the old man for ten thousand dollars.
              
              "What?!" the owners exclaimed. "He hardly did anything!" So they wrote the old man a note saying, "Please send us an itemized bill." CAN YOU
              GUESS WHAT WAS THE BREAK DOWN?
               
               
              The man sent a bill that read:
              Tapping with a hammer...........$ 2.00
              Knowing where to tap..........  $ 9,998.00
              
              Effort is important, but knowing where to make an effort in your life makes all the difference.

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">A lady manager of a big reputed office noticed a new man one day and told him to come into her office.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">“What is your name?” was the first thing she asked the new guy.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">“John,” the new guy replied.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">She scowled, “Look… I don’t know what kind of a namby-pamby place you worked before, but I don’t call anyone by their first name. It breeds familiarity and that leads to a breakdown in authority.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">I refer to my employees by their last name only … Smith, Jones, Baker …that’s all.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">I am to be referred to only as Mrs. Robertson. Now that we got that straight, what is your last name?”</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">The new guy sighed, “Darling…......... My name is John Darling.”</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">“Okay John, the next thing I want to tell you is . . . “</p>

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">A man and his wife were having some problems at home and were giving each other the silent treatment.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">Suddenly, the man realized that the next day, he would need his wife to wake him at 5:00 AM for an early morning business flight.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">Not wanting to be the first to break the silence (and <span>LOSE</span>), he wrote on a piece of paper, “Please wake me at 5:00 AM.” He left it where he knew she would find it. The next morning, the man woke up, only to discover it was 9:00 AM and he had missed his flight.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">Furious, he was about to go and see why his wife hadn’t wakened him, when he noticed a piece of paper by the bed.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">The paper said, “It is 5:00 AM. Wake up.”</p>
