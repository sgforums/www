            <div class='col-md body'>Q: Johnny has an AK47 with a 40 round clip. If he misses 6 out of 10 shots and shoots 15 times each drive by,<br>how many drive by shootings must he conduct before he shoots 50 people?<br><br>A: Johnny hits 15*(4/10) people per drive by, which means that he will have to participate in 9 drive bys to<br>shoot 50 people. However, he will have completed two drive-by shootings and be just starting the third when<br>he has to reload. Since he only stole a single clip, he'll only have shot 16 people when the homeboys with the UZIs' make<br>Swiss cheese out of him.<br><br>Q: Pony has 2 ounces of cocaine and he sells an 8 ball to Jackson for $320 and 2 grams to Billy for $85 per gram.<br>What is the street value of the balance of the cocaine if he doesn't cut it?<br><br>A: At 454 grams per pound, 2oz of the rock = 56.75 grams. An "8 ball" is 8 grams, so pony has sold 10 grams total and<br>has 46.75 grams left. If he keeps selling 8-balls, he can sell 5 more (for a total of 5*$320=$1,600) and have 6.75<br>grams for his own nose. If he sells 2 gram packs, he can sell (46/2-23) packs at $85 apiece = (23*$85)=$1,955.<br>However, he could divide it into small parts, bake it up into crack and sell the rocks for an even larger profit.<br>This problem is really more suited for the Gang Multi-Variable Economics Test.<br><br>Q: Willie gets $200 for stealing a BMW, $50 for a Chevy and $100 for a 4x4. If he has stolen two BMWs and three 4x4s,<br>how many Chevys will he have to steal to make $800?<br><br>A: Willie has made 2*$200 + 3*$100=$700 dollars from his theft so far.<br>He needs $100 more, so he needs to steal $100/$50=2 more<br>Chevy's. However, he will probably want to steal 4 Chevy's so he can take the extra two and make a really def<br>low-rider.<br><br>Q: If the average can of spray paint covers 22 square feet, and the average letter is 4 square feet, how many letters<br>can a tagger spray with 3 cans of paint?<br><br>A: 3 cans of paint will cover 3*22=66 square feet. 66/4=16 letters with a little paint left over to spray in the eyes of the cop<br>who's comin' after you. Or the tagger could do 15 letters and a bitchin' skull.<br><br>Q: Hector got six girls in his gang pregnant. There are 27 girls in the gang. What percentage of girls in the gang has<br>Hector knocked up?<br><br>A: 6/27=22% of the girls. However, 2 of them are lying because they've been sleeping with Pedro, Hector's lieutenant.<br>So, in actuality, Hector only knocked up 4/27 or 14.8%.<br><br>Q: Ron is pimping for 3 girls. If the price is $65 for each trick, how many tricks will each have to turn so<br>Ron can pay for his $800 per day crack habit?<br><br>A: 800/$64=12 tricks plus a dance. Also, Ron should consider making a deal with Pony from Question #2.<br><br>Q: Susan wants to cut her 1/2 pound of heroin to make 20% more profit. How many ounces of cut will she need?<br><br>A: If she sells the cut heroin at the same price per unit volume, she will need 20% more volume.<br>20% of 1/2 pound (=8oz) is 1.6oz. So, Susan will need 1.6oz of cut to add to the 8 oz of heroin to get 20%<br>more volume. She will want a cut which looks similar to raw heroin and has approximately the same melting point.<br>Plain sugar or laundry detergent are suggested. Laundry detergent has the added benefit of removing the possibility of<br>customer complaints, but will sharply limit repeat business.<br><br>Q: Little Willy is in prison for 6 years for murder. He got $25,000 for the hit. If his common law wife is spending $250 per<br>month, how much money will be left when he gets out of prison and how many years will he get for killing the bitch that<br>spent his money?<br><br>A: 6 years*12 months/year*$250/month=$18,000. Little Willy will have $25,000 - $18,000 = $7,000 left when he gets<br>out of prison. If Little Willy kills her in the USA, he should expect to get 6 years. However, if he takes her down to<br>Mexico and buries her scrawny, track-marked butt in the desert, he can get off scott free.<br><br>Q: Rosie's sole source of income is shoplifting. If she gets 10 cents on the dollar from her fence,<br>how much merchandise must she shoplift each week to make $250.<br><br>A: Solve X/10=250 for X, X=$2,500.<br><br>Q: Mike carjacked a Chevy Camaro for his date Saturday night with his young 14 year old girlfriend.<br>He was arrested that night while making his girlfriend in the backseat.<br>How much prison time is he looking for for the carjacking and for statutory rape, even though the girl looked legal?<br>Assume no prior convictions in arriving at your answer.<br><br>A: Mike is only 12 so he will serve no time and will be making put with his girlfriend in the lot in someone else's car next Saturday.<br></div>
