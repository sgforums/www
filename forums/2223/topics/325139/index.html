            <div class='col-md body'><p>Lesson 1 <br><br>A man is getting into the shower just as his wife is <br>finishing up her shower, when the doorbell rings. The <br>wife quickly wraps herself in a towel and runs <br>downstairs. When she opens the door, there stands Bob, <br>the next-door neighbor. Before she says a word, Bob <br>says, "I'll give you £800 to drop that towel." After <br>thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel and <br>stands naked in front of Bob. After a few seconds, Bob <br>hands her £800 and leaves. The woman wraps back up in <br>the towel and goes back upstairs. When she gets to <br>the bathroom, her husband asks, "Who was that?" "It <br>was Bob the next door neighbor," she replies. <br>"Great!" the husband says, "did he say anything about <br>the £800 he owes me?" <br><br>Moral of the story: <br><br>If you share critical information pertaining to credit <br>and risk with your shareholders in time, you may be in <br>a position to prevent avoidable exposure. <br><br><br>Lesson 2 <br><br>A priest offered a Nun a lift. She got in and crossed <br>her legs, forcing her gown to reveal a leg. The priest <br>nearly had an accident. After controlling the car, he <br>stealthily slid his hand up her leg. The nun said, <br>"Father, remember Psalm 129?" The priest removed his <br>hand. But, changing gears, he let his hand slide up <br>her leg again. The nun once again said, "Father, <br>remember Psalm 129?" The priest apologized "Sorry <br>sister but the flesh is weak." Arriving at the <br>convent, the nun went on her way. On his arrival at <br>the church, the priest rushed to look up Psalm 129. <br>It said, "Go forth and seek, further up, you will find <br>glory." <br><br>Moral of the story: <br><br>If you are not well informed in your job, you might <br>miss a great opportunity. <br><br><br>Lesson 3 <br><br>A sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager <br>are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil <br>lamp. They rub it and a Genie comes out. The Genie <br>says, "I'll give each of you just one wish." Me first! <br>Me first!" says the admin clerk. "I want to be in the <br>Bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the <br>world." Puff! She's gone. Me next! Me next!" says <br>the sales rep. "I want to be in Hawaii, relaxing on <br>the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply <br>of Pina Coladas and the love of my life." Puff! He's <br>gone. "OK, you're up," the Genie says to the manager. <br>The manager says, "I want those two back in the office <br>after lunch." <br><br>Moral of the story: <br><br>Always let your boss have the first say <br><br><br>Lesson 4 <br><br>An eagle was sitting on a tree resting, doing nothing. <br>A small rabbit saw the eagle and asked him, "Can I <br>also sit like you and do nothing?" The eagle answered: <br>"Sure, why not." So, the rabbit sat on the ground <br>below the eagle and rested. All of a sudden, a fox <br>appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it. <br><br>Moral of the story: <br><br>To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting <br>very, very high up. <br><br><br>Lesson 5 <br><br>A turkey was chatting with a bull. "I would love to be <br>able to get to the top of that tree," sighed the <br>turkey, "but I haven't got the energy." "Well, why <br>don't you nibble on some of my droppings?" replied the <br>bull. They're packed with nutrients." The turkey <br>pecked at a lump of dung, and found it actually gave <br>him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the <br>tree. The next day, after eating some more dung, he <br>reached the second branch. Finally after a fourth <br>night, the turkey was proudly perched at the top of <br>the tree. He was promptly spotted by a farmer, who <br>shot him out of the tree. <br><br>Moral of the story: <br><br>BullSh!t might get you to the top, but it won't keep <br>you there. <br><br><br>Lesson 6 <br><br>A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was <br>so cold the bird froze and fell to the ground into a <br>large field. While he was lying there, a cow came by <br>and dropped some dung on him. As the frozen bird lay <br>there in the pile of cow dung, he began to realize how <br>warm he was. The dung was actually thawing him out! <br>He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to <br>sing for joy. A passing cat heard the bird d singing <br>and came to investigate. Following the sound, the cat <br>discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and <br>promptly dug him out and ate him. <br><br>Morals of the story: <br><br>(1) Not everyone who sh!ts on you is your enemy <br>(2) Not everyone who gets you out of sh!t is your <br>friend <br>(3) And when you're in deep sh!t, it's best to keep <br>your mouth shut! <br><br><br><br>This ends the 3-minute management course.</p></div>
