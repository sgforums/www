              <p>Please check the list to see how Chinese you or your friends really are:<br> There are 29 ways to know if you're Chinese. You will laugh at yourself when you read all of them.<br> <br> 1. You unwrap gifts very carefully, so you can save and reuse the wrapping<br> (and especially those ribbons).<br> <br> 2. When there is a sale on toilet paper, you buy 100 rolls and store
              them in your closet or in the bedroom of an adult child who has moved
              out.<br> <br> 3. You keep a Thermos of hot water available at all times.<br> <br> 4. You save grocery bags, tin foil, and tin containers. You use the grocery bags to hold garbage.<br> <br> 5. You hate to waste food:<br> (a) Even if you're totally full, if someone says they're going to throw
              away the leftovers on the table, you'll finish them. (Your mom will
              give a lecture about starving kids in Africa ).<br> (b) You have Tupperware in your fridge with three bites of rice or one leftover chicken wing.<br> <br> 6. You don't own any real Tupperware- only a cupboard full of used but<br> carefully rinsed margarine tubs, take out containers, and jam jars.<br> <br> 7. You have a collection of miniature shampoo bottles that you take every<br> time you stay in a hotel.<br> <br> 8. You wipe your plate and utensils or wash them in a small basin of hot<br> water before you eat every time you go to a restaurant.<br> <br> 9 . You own a rice cooker and a slow cooker<br> <br> 10. You wash your rice at least 2-3 times before cooking it.<br> <br> 11. You fight (literally) over who pays the dinner bill.<br> <br> 12. You have a teacup with a cover on it.<br> <br> 13. If you're under age 20, you own a really expensive walkman if you're<br> over 20, you own a really expensive  camera.<br> <br> 14. You're a wok user.<br> <br> 15. You only make long distance calls after 7pm.<br> <br> 16. You prefer your shrimp with the heads and legs still attached-it,<br> means they're fresh.<br> <br> 17. You never call your parents just to say, ' Hi. '<br> <br> 18. If you don't live at home, when your parents call, they'll ask if you've eaten, even if it's midnight.<br> <br> 19. Your parents tell you to boil herbs and stay indoors when you get<br> sick. They also tell you not to eat fried foods or baked foods because<br> such food are ' heaty' (yeet hey in Cantonese).<br> <br> 20. You e-mail your Chinese friends at work, even though you only sit 10 feet apart.<br> <br> 21. You always cook too much.<br> <br> 22. You eat every last grain of rice in your bowl, but don't eat the last<br> piece of food on the table.<br> <br> 23. You starve yourself before going to ' All You Can Eat ' buffet.<br> <br> 24. You know someone who can get you a good deal on jewelry or<br> electronics, computers.<br> <br> 25 . You own your own meat cleaver and sharpen it.<br> <br> 26. Your toothpaste tubes are all squeezed paper-thin.<br> <br> 27. You call a sausage a hotdog.<br> <br> 28. You wrap with napkins all the knives, spoons and forks of the
              airline that you fly on and put in your travel-bag as souvenirs<br> <br> 29. You never forget to take with you all the unused bath and facial
              tissues when you check out from the hotel because you believe that you
              have paid its all.<br> <br> <br> Now that you have read the lot, are they mostly true? Will you take this<br> message and forward it to all your Chinese friends, because you will<br> always be proud that you're indeed a great Chinese...</p>
