            <div class='col-md body'><p>1. If I like it, it's mine.<br>2. If it's in my mouth, it's mine.<br>3. If I can take it from you, it's mine.<br>4. If I had it a little while ago, it's mine.<br>5. If it's mine, it must never appear to be yours in any way.<br>6. If I'm chewing something up, all the pieces are mine.<br>7. If it just looks like mine, it's mine.<br>8. If I saw it first, it's mine.<br>9. If you are playing with something and you put it down, it<br>automatically becomes mine.<br>10. If it's broken, it's yours.<br><br>HOW DOGS AND MEN ARE THE SAME:<br><br>1. Both take up too much space on the bed.<br>2. Both have irrational fears about vacuum cleaning.<br>3. Both mark their territory.<br>4. Neither tells you what's bothering them.<br>5. The smaller ones tend to be more nervous.<br>6. Both have an inordinate fascination with women's crotches.<br>7. Neither does any dishes.<br>8. Both fart shamelessly.<br>9. Neither of them notice when you get your hair cut.<br>10. Both like dominance games.<br>11. Both are suspicious of the postman.<br>12. Neither understands what you see in cats.<br><br>HOW DOGS ARE BETTER THAN MEN:<br><br>1. Dogs do not have problems expressing affection in public.<br>2. Dogs miss you when you're gone.<br>3. Dogs feel guilty when they've done something wrong.<br>4. Dogs admit when they're jealous.<br>5. Dogs are very direct about wanting to go out.<br>6. Dogs do not play games with you-except fetch (and they never<br>laugh at how you throw.)<br>7. You can train a dog.<br>8. Dogs are easy to buy for.<br>9. The worst social disease you can get from dogs is fleas.<br>10. Dogs understand what "no" means.<br>11. Dogs mean it when they kiss you.<br><br>TOP TEN REASONS WHY A DOG IS BETTER THAN A WOMAN:<br><br>10. A dog's parents will never visit you.<br>9. A dog loves you when you leave your clothes on the floor.<br>8. A dog limits its time in the bathroom to a quick drink.<br>7. A dog never expects you to telephone.<br>6. A dog will not get mad at you if you forget its birthday.<br>5. A dog does not care about the previous dogs in your life.<br>4. A dog does not get mad at you if you pet another dog<br>3. A dog never expects flowers on Valentine's Day.<br>2. The later you are, the happier a dog is to see you.<br>1. A dog does not shop.<br><br>LIFE LESSONS LEARNED FROM A DOG:<br><br>1. If you stare at someone long enough, eventually you'll get what<br>you want.<br>2. Don't go out without ID.<br>3. Be direct with people; let them know exactly how you feel by<br>piddling on their shoes.<br>4. Be aware of when to hold your tongue, and when to use it.<br>5. Leave room in your schedule for a good nap.<br>6. Always give people a friendly greeting. A cold nose in the<br>crotch is most effective.<br>7. When you do something wrong, always take responsibility (as<br>soon as you're dragged shamefully out from under the bed).<br>8. If it's not wet and sloppy, it's not a real kiss.<br><br>Dog Commandments<br><br>Thou shalt not act half starved whenever thou watches me eat.<br>Thou shalt not lift thy leg to water the Christmas tree.<br>Thou shalt not roll in any smelly stuff thy finds in the yard.<br>Thou shalt not lie down next to me and commence making licking and<br>popping noises. (I know what thou art doing!)<br>Thou shalt not dig up my favorite rose bush.<br>Thou shalt not treat my shoes as if they were thy chew toy.<br>Thou shalt not drink out of the toilet.<br>Thou shalt keep thy nose out of the cat's litter box.<br>Thou shalt not WATCH the cat while she is in her litterbox. (she<br>likes her privacy)<br>Thou shalt not pass gas in my presence, and then walk away as if thou<br>has been offended by me.<br>Thou shalt not run away from home in pursuit of a good time. (thou<br>has been neutered)<br>Thou shalt refrain from coughing and gagging while we have company.<br>Thou shall not hide thy bones under my pillow.<br>Thou shalt not sniff the crotch of everyone thy encounters.<br>Thou shalt not harmonize with the cat at 2a.m.<br>Thou shalt not sneak up on me and lick me in the mouth while I am<br>sleeping.<br>Thou shalt refrain from becoming overly affectionate with my<br>mother-in-law's leg.</p></div>
