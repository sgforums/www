            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Maid,<br>Please do not leave any more of those little bars of soap in my bathroom since I have brought my own bath-sized Dial. Please remove the six unopened little bars from the shelf under the medicine chest and another three in the shower soap dish. They are in my way.<br><br>Thank you,<br>S. Berman<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Dear Room 635,<br>I am not your regular maid. She will be back tomorrow, Thursday, from her day off. I took the three hotel soaps out of the shower soap dish as you requested. The six bars on your shelf I took out of your way and put on top of your Kleenex dispenser in case you should change your mind.<br><br>This leaves only the three bars I left today, as my instructions from the management are to leave three soaps daily.<br><br>I hope this is satisfactory.<br><br>Kathy<br>Relief Maid<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Dear Maid -- I hope you are my regular maid.<br>Apparently Kathy did not tell you about my note to her concerning the little bars of soap. When I got back to my room this evening I found you had added three little Camays to the shelf under my medicine cabinet.<br><br>I am going to be here in the hotel for two weeks and have brought my own bath-size Dial so I won't need those 6 little Camays which are on the shelf. They are in my way when shaving, brushing teeth, etc.<br><br>Please remove them.<br>S. Berman<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Dear Mr. Berman,<br>My day off was last Wednesday so the relief maid left three hotel soaps which we are instructed to do by the management. I took the six soaps which were in your way on the shelf and put them in the soap dish where your Dial was. I put the Dial in the medicine cabinet for your convenience. I didn't remove the three complimentary soaps which are always placed inside the medicine cabinet for all new check-ins and which you did not object to when you checked in last Monday.<br><br>Please let me know if I can of further assistance.<br><br>Your regular maid,<br>Dotty<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Dear Mr. Berman,<br>The assistant manager, Mr. Kensedder, informed me this A.M. that you called him last evening and said you were unhappy with your maid service. I have assigned a new girl to your room. I hope you will accept my apologies for any past inconvenience.<br><br>If you have any future complaints please contact me so I can give it my personal<br>attention. Call extension 1108 between 8AM and 5PM.<br><br>Thank you,<br>Elaine Carmen<br>Housekeeper<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Dear Miss Carmen,<br>It is impossible to contact you by phone since I leave the hotel for business at 7:45 AM and don't get back before 5:30 or 6PM. That's the reason I called Mr. Kensedder last night. You were already off duty.<br><br>I only asked Mr. Kensedder if he could do anything about those little bars of soap. The new maid you assigned me must have thought I was a new check-in today, since she left another three bars of hotel soap in my medicine cabinet along with her regular delivery of three bars on the bath-room shelf.<br><br>In just five days here I have accumulated 24 little bars of soap.<br><br>Why are you doing this to me?<br><br>S. Berman<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Dear Mr. Berman,<br>Your maid, Kathy, has been instructed to stop delivering soap to your room and remove the extra soaps.<br><br>If I can be of further assistance, please call extension 1108 between 8AM and 5PM.<br><br>Thank you,<br>Elaine Carmen<br>Housekeeper<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Dear Mr. Kensedder,<br>My bath-size Dial is missing. Every bar of soap was taken from my room including my own bath-size Dial. I came in late last night and had to call the bellhop to bring me 4 little Cashmere Bouquets.<br><br>S. Berman<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Dear Mr. Berman,<br>I have informed our housekeeper, Elaine Carmen, of your soap problem.<br><br>I cannot understand why there was no soap in your room since our maids are instructed to leave three bars of soap each time they service a room. The situation will be rectified immediately.<br><br>Please accept my apologies for the inconvenience.<br><br>Martin L. Kensedder<br>Assistant Manager<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Dear Mrs. Carmen,<br>Who the hell left 54 little bars of Camay in my room? I came in last night and found 54 little bars of soap. I don't want 54 little bars of Camay. I want my one damn bar of bath-size Dial. Do you realize I have 54 bars of soap in here?!<br><br>All I want is my bath size Dial.<br><br>Please give me back my bath-size Dial.<br><br>S. Berman<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Dear Mr. Berman,<br>You complained of too much soap in your room so I had them removed. Then you complained to Mr. Kensedder that all your soap was missing so I personally returned them.<br><br>The 24 Camays which had been taken and the three Camays you are supposed to receive daily (sic). I don't know anything about the 4 Cashmere Bouquets.<br><br>Obviously your maid, Kathy, did not know I had returned your soaps so she also brought 24 Camays plus the three daily Camays. I don't know where you got the idea this hotel issues bath-size Dial. I was able to locate some bath-size Ivory which I left in your room.<br><br>Elaine Carmen<br>Housekeeper<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Dear Mrs. Carmen,<br>Just a short note to bring you up-to-date on my latest soap inventory. As of today I possess:<br><br>- On shelf under medicine cabinet - 18 Camay in 4 stacks of 4 and 1 stack of 2.<br>- On Kleenex dispenser - 11 Camay in 2 stacks of 4 and 1 stack of 3.<br>- On bedroom dresser - 1 stack of 3 Cashmere Bouquet, 1 stack of 4 hotel-size Ivory, and 8 Camay in 2 stacks of 4.<br>- Inside medicine cabinet - 14 Camay in 3 stacks of 4 and 1 stack of 2.<br>- In shower soap dish - 6 Camay, very moist.<br>- On northeast corner of tub - 1 Cashmere Bouquet, slightly used.<br>- On northwest corner of tub - 6 Camays in 2 stacks of 3.<br><br>Please ask Kathy when she services my room to make sure the stacks are neatly piled and dusted. Also, please advise her that stacks of more than 4 have a tendency to tip. May I suggest that my bedroom window sill is not in use and will make an excellent spot for future soap deliveries.<br><br>One more item: I have purchased another bar of bath-sized Dial which I am keeping in the hotel vault in order to avoid further misunderstandings.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
