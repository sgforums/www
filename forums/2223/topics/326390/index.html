              <p>Announcement in a church bulletin for a national PRAYER &amp; FASTING Conference: "The cost for attending the Fasting and Prayer conference includes meals."</p>

              <p>"Ladies, don't forget the rummage sale. It's a chance to get rid of those things not worth keeping around the house. Don't forget your husbands."</p>
              <p>The peacemaking meeting scheduled for today has been cancelled due to a conflict.</p>
              <p>Remember in prayer the many that are sick of our community. Smile at someone who is hard to love. Say "hell" to someone who doesn't care much about you.</p>
              <p>Don't let worry kill you off - let the Church help.</p>
              <p>Miss Charlene Mason sang "I will not pass this way again", giving obvious pleasure to the congregation.</p>
              <p>For those of you who have children and don't know it, we have a nursery downstairs.</p>
              <p>Next Thursday there will be tryouts for the choir. They need all the help they can get.</p>
              <p>Barbara remains in the hospital and needs blood donors for more transfusions. She is also having trouble sleeping and requests tapes of Pastor Jack's sermons.</p>

              <p>At the evening service tonight, the sermon topic will be "What is Hell?" Come early and listen to our choir practice.</p>
              <p>Eight new choir robes are currently needed, due to the addition of several new members and to the deterioration of some older ones.</p>
              <p>Scouts are saving aluminum cans, bottles, and other items to be recycled. Proceeds will be used to cripple children.</p>
              <p>The Lutheran men's group will meet at 6 pm. Steak, mashed potatoes, green beans, bread and dessert will be served for a nominal feel.</p>
              <p>Please place your donation in the envelope along with the deceased person you want remembered.</p>
