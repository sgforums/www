              <p><span style="color: #003300;">Unearthing the great debate: To be or not to be (organic, that is). By <strong>Belinda Wan </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003300;"><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/366/winner-Feature1.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="250"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003300;">   Mention the word “organic” and images of pesticide-free fruits and vegetables, healthier processed food and even skincare come to mind. <br>   With organic food becoming increasingly readily available (just check out your nearest supermarket), and organic establishments mushrooming up everywhere, it seems like a foregone conclusion that everyone should jump on the organic bandwagon already, as the trend shows no sign of weakening. Nevertheless, there is still much debate between the two camps of organic food versus conventionally produced food—with both sides having their fair share of detractors. Some say the health benefits of organic food have been greatly exaggerated—while others claim that going organic is the best way to better health. So what is the reality for us, the confused consumer? <br>   Organic produce refers to food that is harvested and packaged according to certain production standards. This means crops that are grown with the minimal involvement (if any) of artificial fertilizers, conventional pesticides, chemicals (including chemical engineering), human waste, as well as sludge from the sewage. <br>   It also means that in the rearing of animals, no antibiotics, growth hormones and genetic modification can be used. There is also a heavy emphasis on using natural methods of pest and disease control, such as animal grazing, crop rotation programs and effective placement of repellant plants—in short, produce in its most natural, untampered state. In most countries (including Singapore), organic food must obtain organic certification in order to be labeled “organic.” <br>   There are two main types of organic food—fresh and processed. “Fresh” refers to perishable items like fruits and vegetables, organic eggs and dairy products, while processed food can be found in a supermarket alongside conventionally processed food and includes organic beer, pasta, baby food, pet food, and loads more. <br>   <br><strong>THE PROs</strong><br>While there are many perspectives and interpretations about the whole organic movement, these are the most widely cited reasons that proponents of the organic movement use to defend their stance.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>No Residue From Synthetic Pesticides </strong><br>   One of the biggest reasons behind why many consumers have ditched conventionally produced foods and rushed to get organic produce is because non-organic, conventionally-grown food, especially fruits and vegetables, contain pesticides and herbicide residue. Mindy Chua, the manager of Four Seasons Market says, “Organic produce is pesticide-free. It is also free from antibiotics, food additives, any form of added hormones, genetically engineered organisms, irradiation, mycotoxins and pathogens. Best of all, organic methods produce nutritionally superior produce.” It’s a statement that pretty much puts everything into perspective. <br>     The alarming thing is that not only is it difficult to quantify exactly how much pesticides and chemicals farmers are using during crop growth, but remnants of less-than-healthy pesticides can remain on fruits and vegetables even after washing. The harmful effects of these synthetic pesticides are not imagined—the herbicide atrazine, at concentrations as low as 0.1 part per billion, can cause male frogs to produce eggs in their gonads, turning them into hermaphrodites, cites the 2003 study, Environmental Health Perspectives. In humans, it’s thought that allergies, cancer and illnesses can develop as a result of these types of substances. <br>   Organic produce does not use synthetic pesticides, but plant-based, natural pesticides instead. While it’s not conclusive that this is healthier than using synthetics, another Environmental Health Perspectives study conducted in 2006 showed that the level of organophosphorus pesticide exposure dropped significantly in 23 children after they had switched to an organic diet. So while it is difficult to determine the exact degree to which pesticides really cause diseases, why take chances?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Good For You, Great For The Environment</strong><br>Organic systems of farming are also environmentally friendly. Synthetic pesticides and fertilizers have enough chemicals in them to devastate wildlife and the natural environment. A large, uncontrolled amount of these substances released into the environment can seriously kill plants and animals and throw food chains out of balance. <br>   Organic methods of farming will maintain delicate ecosystems far more effectively than conventional farming can. Statistics and calculations have also shown that organic farms use less energy, are more energy-efficient, and produce less waste. For instance, a conventional farm generates a lot more waste in the form of the packaging material used for chemicals.<br>   Just think about it—farming methods that are comparatively more beneficial for the environment can only be a good thing—as all our food comes from the environment anyway. You don’t want mutated fish and deformed tomatoes now, do you?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Less Health Hazards For Farmers And Producers</strong><br>Farmers working in organic farms run far less risk of suffering adverse health effects that come from prolonged exposure to pesticides and chemicals. When used, pesticides stay in the air, and the skin and bodies of producers for a long time. Studies indicate that organophosphorus pesticides are associated with ailments like dizziness, abdominal pains, nausea, headaches, vomiting, and skin and eye problems. Other more severe side effects of prolonged pesticide exposure include memory malfunction, respiratory difficulties, skin problems, depression, cancer, neurological disorders, and more. <br>   Of this, Chua says, “For the last three decades, the study of contaminants in food focused on cancer-causing chemicals and additives...Ailments like breast cancer, prostate cancer, immune system dysfunctions, low sperm counts and brain irregularities may result.” Enough said. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Better Taste And Higher Nutritional Value</strong><br>As the old adage says, you get what you pay for. Organic produce is definitely more expensive than produce grown in the conventional way. <br>   Many advocates swear, however, that it’s worth every extra cent you pay, because of the better flavor. A 2001 study undertaken by Washington State University researchers concluded that organic apples taste sweeter. In fact, Iris Teo, marketing communications executive of Aramsa Spas and The Green Room Cafe says, “Without the presence and use of synthetic herbicides, pesticides and chemicals used on the fruits and vegetables, consumers do not ingest any of these and thus run no risk of pesticide toxicity. Some studies have also shown that organic produce has a higher content of vitamins and important trace minerals.” <br>   <br><strong>THE CONs</strong><br>The pros of going organic cannot be refuted easily—but to get a more holistic picture, you should know the other side of the story too. <br>   <br><strong>The Question Of Safety </strong><br>Organic agriculture does use pesticides—plant-based ones and not synthetic and chemical-based ones. Also, pesticides used in conventional farming undergo loads of tests before they are finally approved, but the pesticides used in organic agriculture do not need to be tested. It has been proven that organically grown food contain about one third as much residue as conventionally grown food—which is a big consolation. But some say that it is also difficult to determine if less pesticide residue necessarily has a positive effect on health. In fact, many scientists argue that even natural chemicals have the potential to be “toxic”—a line of argument that casts much ambiguity over the debate.<br>   Some even maintain that the focus should be ensuring that one eats at least five servings of fruits and vegetables per day—regardless of whether there are pesticide residue on these fruits and vegetables or not—because, even if they exist, it’s probably only in minimal and non-life-threatening quantities anyway.  <br>   <br><strong>Sustainability </strong><br>Organic farming has widely been lauded to improve soil quality, which is presumed to be just one example of how the organic movement is good for the environment. Yet studies have shown that improved soil quality is due primarily to crop rotation—not a strictly organic strategy. <br>   Organic food producers also lose a large portion of their crops to natural causes like pests and mould—so they need to use significantly more land in order to produce the same amount of products. A study done in February this year by UK’s <em>The Independent </em>shows that a crop of organic tomatoes used a staggering 642 percent more land than conventional crop-growing methods. <br>   <br><strong>Too Pricey </strong><br>The biggest stumbling block that the organic movement faces is price. Although organic produce is a lot more readily available these days, prices for organic produce are typically (though not strictly) 10 to 40 percent higher than conventionally grown and produced food. <br>   This is because most organic establishments are small—and don’t have economies of scale to help lower prices. The probability of crop failure is also higher on an organic farm, so, depending on the season, prices can skyrocket. Unethical organic farms or producers can also capitalize on consumer ignorance and jack up their prices. <br>   But there is more to organic food than just price griping. Teo adds, “It’s all about educating people. Organic products may be costlier, but prices are higher because organic produce is produced on a smaller scale. Without the use of pesticides or other chemicals, it is also more labor intensive and the yield is generally smaller. Singapore’s standard of living has risen greatly over the past years and this slight difference in price for the long term benefit of health is a small price to pay.”<br>   <br>There is much that is probably not known about the specifics of the organic movement, and some studies and tests are far from conclusive. Nevertheless, the benefits of going organic are still solid enough to show that switching to an organic diet may be the answer to a more wholesome lifestyle.</span></p>

I started getting things ready in my spare time, working early mornings, and on weekends and holidays, with support from my wife and others. But it is only recently, from February 2008, after I left my previous company, that I was able to commit myself fully.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">Finding suppliers was the first challenge, and convincing them that they should work with us, an unknown company. Then we had to convince retailers to sell our products, explaining the tremendous opportunity for them in quality organic products. We knew that if we could win over the opinion leaders that others would follow. And that’s where we are at now.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">How is the organic food market in Japan?</span></strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">Despite Japan being the world’s third largest food market, after the U.S. and China, it seriously lags the rest of the developed world in organic food, ranking only 9th in the world in market size (about 70 billion yen), and about 17th in per capita consumption (only 550 yen per person per year) and in organic food’s penetration of the total food market (about 0.2%). These numbers are all amazingly low if we consider how much attention is paid to food, health and food safety in Japan.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">The Japanese organic market is perhaps 10-20 years behind Europe and the U.S. One reason is that there is so little grown organic locally. Organic agriculture in Japan accounts for only 0.6% of the total, whereas in Europe it is close to 5%, reaching as high as about 15% in Austria for example.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">What is your niche?</span></strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">Our domain, or niche, is exceptional, great tasting food products. Our main sub niche is organic. We also seek natural, healthy and fair trade products. Many of our products are a combination of these traits. But first and foremost, our products are appreciated for their taste and quality.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">Are there any problems with importing certain ingredients?</span></strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">So far we have encountered no problems regarding importing certain ingredients, but the process for securing organic certification is rather cumbersome and costly. Also, there are some products certified organic in their home country which cannot be certified or declared as organic in Japan due to minor differences in the definition of organic. And it may not always be immediately clear how certain products should be labeled. We liaise closely with the appropriate authorities but they also need time to understand and decide what is correct in some cases. This is all part of the organic adventure.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">How do you find your suppliers?</span></strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">I travel to various parts of the world where exceptional organic products can be found. I visit exhibitions, stores, producers and farms. Currently, we have 17 suppliers. This list will continue to grow as we want to provide consumers with the best possible choices.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">What are the main concerns you hear from customers?</span></strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">Regarding organic products, the main concerns tend to be about price and pack size. But many customers comment that our products are reasonably priced. Regarding pack size, we try to adapt to customer needs. For example, we recently launched Delouis mustards in 100-gram jars, in addition to the existing 200-gram jars. Customers also have growing concerns about pesticides, additives, and so forth. This is increasingly driving them to look for organic alternatives.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">What are some of your best-selling products?</span></strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">Most of the products sell well, but the best selling items include Mount Hagen coffee, Clipper tea, Jardin Bio’ herbal tea, Natur Compagnie bouillons and Delouis mustards. Also, Provamel and Alpro soya milk and desserts are growing fast, and Le Moulin du Pivert cookies and Vitamont pure-pressed juices sales are starting to take off. Our most recent launches, Michel Montignac non-sugar confitures, Daniel’s Fire Roast salsas which have won over 20 awards in recent years, and Organic Healthy Nut macadamia nuts have had a good start. But customers may be interested in some of the more unique items in our range, such as Alter Eco fair trade coffee and chocolate, Tartex vegetarian pate, Emile Noel oils (including argan, macadamia nut and more) and Lou Prunel prune puree from Agen in France. We even have organic gummies (BioBon from Austria) and Babybio baby food from Bordeaux.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">Who do you sell to?</span></strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">Mainly to high-end supermarkets such as Kinokuniya, National Azabu, Nissin World Delicatessen, Seijo Ishii, Queen’s Isetan, Daimaru Peacock, Aoki and many more. We do very well in Isetan and Mitsukoshi department stores as well as in gourmet and specialty stores such as Dean &amp; Deluca and Plaza Style. We sell the Delouis mustards and vinegars, and Emile Noel oils to top restaurants, including one, two and three star Michelin restaurants. The chefs decide on taste, but are very much tuned into organics.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">What about the health food sector?</span></strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">Not yet. Part of the reason is because most people in Japan still do not have a good image of organic food. They think it doesn’t taste good. We want to change that perception by making our products available in places that are focused primarily on taste. But now we are also planning to start with selected health food stores.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">How often do you meet customers?</span></strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">I try to meet retailers, chefs and consumers as often as I can. I enjoy seeing their reactions when they see and taste our products, often commenting that they didn’t realize that such delicious organic products existed. They also appreciate the health benefits, for example, the low glycemic index (GI) non-sugar confitures, soya milk, decaffeinated coffee and tea, etc. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">Are your products available nationwide?</span></strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">Apart from the Tokyo region, we have products in Osaka, Kobe and Nagoya as well as a few regional areas. Consumers can also order online. We have a bilingual (Japanese &amp; English) website, www.choosee.com. The products are normally delivered within two to three days. CHOOSEE stands for choose exceptional &amp; organic, as well as choose ecological.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">Tell us about your team.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">Right now, there are five of us. It’s a small team but it works well as everyone is highly motivated and is prepared and able to do what needs to be done. We do expect to add more people this year.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">What is a typical day for you?</span></strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">I try to make each day a bit different. But usually I get to the office by 5 or 6 a.m. During the day, I get out into the market and visit customers. Then I return to the office and stay quite late, perhaps until midnight, communicating with our many suppliers. I do return home, which is just a few minutes walk from the office, to bring the kids to school some mornings, and to spend some time with them in the evenings and on weekends.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">How do you relax?</span></strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">I am not really the relaxing type. Five or 10 minutes break is enough for me. I go jogging in the park a few times a week which is great for revitalization.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">Do you eat a lot of organic food yourself?</span></strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #008000;">We have eaten organic food for a long time since my wife has always appreciated its benefits. For obvious reasons, this has now increased. But I am not a health nut. I believe that things should be done in moderation, be well-balanced, and come naturally.</span></p>
