              <p>III. WHY ARE MEAT-EATERS MORE PRONE TO CHRONICAL DISEASES AND EARLIER DEATH THAN VEGETARIANS?</p>
              <p>        The human body is built up of tiny units of cells, and the functions of these cells are:-</p>
              <ol>
              <li>absorption of nourishment</li>
              <li>secretion of waste</li>
              <li>breathing in oxygen to burn food</li>
              </ol>
              <p>        But when the above series of activity is impeached, malfunction ensues and this causes the cells to deteriorate. Naturally, the organs which they make up, become affected too.</p>
              <p>        Comparative studies carried out by scientists prove that the EFFECT of Chronical Diseases are CAUSED by Excess Meat Eating. Animals such as the cows, sheep, goats, pigs and fowls inhabit well-developed nervous systems similar to human being. It is therefore not surprising too, that these animal and fowls encounter pain to the same degree as man does. In cases where they are abused or injured, every effort to avoid pain through signs of intensified terror, wincing, wailing and howling are uncontrollably released.</p>
              <p>        The following description on the execution of domesticated pigs (or hogs) is extracted from a true-life experienced book written many years ago by Upton Sinclair who grew up on a farm and was familiar with the killing of animals since childhood.</p>
              <p>"At the same instant the ear was assailed by a most terrifying shriek ... followed by another, louder and yet more agonizing - for once started upon that journey, the hog never came back. Meantime, heedless of all these things, the men upon the floor were going about their work. Neither squeals of hogs nor tears of visitors made any difference to them; and one by one they hooked up the hogs, and one by one with a swift stroke they slit their throats. There was a line of hogs, with squeals and life-blood ebbing away together; until at last each started again, and vanished with a splash a huge vat of boiling water."</p>
              <p>        The account of the above process is about the stockyards of Chicago described in the book "The Jungle"</p>
              <p>        In 1975, seventeen years after the Federal Humane Slaughter Act of 1958, which was aimed to abolish unnecessarily methods of cruel slaughtering, a minister who witnessed a flock of sheep being led up a runway into a slaughterhouse wrote:</p>
              <p>"The smell, the cries of agony, and the noise of the killing going on inside were revolting ... Calves were butchered in full sight of their mothers. I watched the driving of animals to the killing floor, where they sense their fate and go mad with fear."</p>
              <p>        Thence, during the agony of being slaughtered, the terrified animals undergo profound changes. First of all, secretion of toxins generated by rage and fear at the time of slaughter, are forced into the blood stream. Through circulation of blood, this poisonous substances are pervaded to various muscles of their bodies. Slaughter not only terminates the normal cleansing functions of the body but also leaves the animals saturated with their own waste substances.</p>
              <p>        A further-brief information to meat-eaters is obtainable from the Encyclopaedia Britannica:</p>
              <p>"Toxin wastes, including uric acid are present in the blood and tissue, as also are dead and virulent bacteria, not only from the putrefactory process, but from animal diseases, such as hoof and mouth disease, contagious abortion, swine fever, malignant tumours, etc ..."</p>
              <p>        Slaughter also sparks off the rapid process of decomposition, whereby intense cooking does not necessarily change the chemistry of meat products because meat is the most putrescible of all foods, pork being the worst of all. Even with the condition of the best digestive system, an estimation of 7 per cent of meat still decay while going through the human bowel tract. The sole reason is, whether meat or its juice, both equally favours growth of disease - causing bacteria that afflicts animals and humans.</p>
