              <p><span style="color: #006666;">In today’s socially and environmentally conscious world, we remind ourselves of the case for vegetarianism. By <strong>Belinda Wan </strong>and <strong>Sarah Fung</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #006666;">Environmental awareness has never been more prevalent. People everywhere are displaying green credentials by offsetting carbon footprints and toting reusable bags. But have you considered the effect your dining choices might have on the globe? The chairman of the United Nations Panel on Climate Change stated a few months back that to “To reduce climate change, people should start giving up meat once a week.” Rearing animals for human consumption puts a strain on the earth’s resources, and according to the economics of the food chain, the number of crops it takes to feed the animals we eat could feed 10 times as many humans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #006666;">This is one of the reasons many environmentalists are shunning meat altogether. George Jacobs, the president of the website Vegetarian Society (Singapore) (www.vegetarian-society.org) says, “I gave up meat in 1980 when I was 28. I had read a book called <em>Diet for a Small Planet</em>, which explains that the inefficiency of meat-eating means less food available to the millions of people without enough food. Eating meat is inefficient because to produce just one kilogram of meat, many kilograms of plant food need to be fed to the animals whom we kill for our food.” Stella Yfantidis Chen, the director of Whatever Yoga and Healing Space (49 Club St., 6221-0300), a Western vegetarian café that serves organic and vegetarian delights, agrees. “People, turn to vegetarianism for health, environmental and religious reasons, she says. For me it was a natural inclination, there was no conscious reason. I just didn’t feel like eating animal products once I found out how by eating meat, humans were interfering with food groups. I was not comfortable with knowing that the natural food chain was being altered. I have given up meat for 15 years now.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #006666;">But Chen adds that the correct mindset is important when converting to vegetarianism, failing which, one’s health is impacted. She says, “I don’t avoid animal products and animal food completely, although if I do eat them it is not by choice. One shouldn’t put oneself under stress to avoid animal products because the stress will ultimately cause you more damage.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #006666;">But while it is certain that vegetarianism is good for the environment, is it really beneficial to our health? Jacobs feels it is. He says, “Diet is just one of many factors that affect health. The main difference I felt after going vegetarian was when I also gave up dairy products. The sinus problems I had experienced for years disappeared and have not returned since.” But Chen feels that vegetarianism is by no means the only ticket to good health—many other factors come into play as well. She says, “Going vegetarian can lead to good health if one has a well-balanced vegetarian diet consisting of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds that will give all the vitamins and minerals one needs. But vegetarianism depends not just on the food one ingests, but also the mind and body. It requires a holistic approach. There is still a great majority of people who avoid eating animal products but still succumb to illnesses anyway.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #006666;">But can vegetarianism really fight ailments and diseases—and does vegetarianism result in a lower incidence of certain cancers and higher energy levels? Chen thinks so, although there is a caveat attached. She elaborates, “Vegetarianism helps with all diseases if it’s a well-balanced diet. Disease occurs when the body is not in harmony—for instance when one is not in good mental health. So along with vegetarianism, one needs a holistic approach to health to maintain one’s well-being. Vegetarianism is only one aspect of health and wellness.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #006666;">So what do you do if you’ve already decided to embark on vegetarianism, or at least cut down on your meat intake? What is the best way to start? And most importantly, how can one ensure a relatively smooth transition from a meat-filled diet to a decidedly greener diet? It is recommended that you do not immediately plunge into a solely-vegetable diet and suddenly avoid meat altogether. Vegetarianism is best achieved slowly and gradually. As Jacobs says, “Some people go vegetarian all at once, but most people (myself included) do it gradually, reducing meat consumption meal by meal, day by day. This allows us to find alternatives. After a while, it becomes easy. When I first went vegetarian, I saw it as a temporary change; but after 30 years, I don’t see myself ever going back to eating our fellow animals. The more I learn about why one should be vegetarian—for kindness, the environment, more food for hungry people—the more determined I am.” Chen also agrees, “If you’re interested in vegetarianism, start off by taking baby steps. Exchange one item at a time from the food groups you eat. Don’t give yourself too much stress by starting off too suddenly. Educate yourself, have a well-balanced approach, attend macrobiotic and vegetarian cooking classes and modify your vegetarian diet according to your likes, dislikes and lifestyle.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #006666;">If you feel your resolve weakening just think: A couple of vegetarian meals a week is a small sacrifice for our own health and that of the planet, too.</span></p>
