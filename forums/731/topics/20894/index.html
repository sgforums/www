            <div class='col-md body'>RULES OF ENGAGEMENT -- Directives issued by competent military authority which delineate the circumstances and limitations under which United States forces will initiate and/or continue combat engagement with other forces encountered. -- Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Term<br><br>Col. Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson) is a 30-year Marine veteran: a decorated officer with combat experience in Vietnam, Beirut and Desert Storm-- a patriot, a hero. But now, the country he served so well has put him on trial for a rescue mission that went terribly wrong. For his attorney, he has chosen Marine Col. Hays Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones), a comrade-in-arms who owes his life to Childers. Hodges is not the best lawyer in the service, but Childers trusts him as a brother Marine who knows what it's like to risk death under fire. Bound by duty and friendship, Hodges reluctantly takes the case, even as he begins to doubt the man who saved his life in Vietnam three decades ago.<br><br>"Rules of Engagement" stars Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson and is directed by William Friedkin. A Paramount Pictures presentation in association with Seven Arts Pictures, the film also stars Guy Pearce, Bruce Greenwood, Blair Underwood, Philip Baker Hall, Anne Archer and Ben Kingsley. The producers are Richard D. Zanuck and Scott Rudin, and the executive producers are Adam Schroeder and James Webb. Arne Schmidt serves as co-producer. Stephen Gaghan wrote the screenplay based on a story by James Webb, former U.S. Secretary of the Navy. Paramount Pictures is releasing the film in the U.S. and Canada. Paramount Pictures is part of the entertainment operations of Viacom Inc.<br><br>Other behind-the-camera talents include directors of photography William A. Fraker and Nicola Pecorini, production designer Robert Laing, editor Augie Hess, costume designer Gloria Gresham and stunt coordinator Buddy Joe Hooker. Dale Dye is the film's military technical adviser and also appears on screen as a general who gives Childers his support.<br><br>When the U.S. Embassy in Yemen is surrounded by a large crowd of demonstrators, Col. Terry Childers, USMC, is ordered to lead a squadron of Marines to bolster security at the embassy. He has orders to evacuate the ambassador and his family if the situation turns violent. A few short hours after Childers launches his mission, the ambassador's safety is secured, but three of Childers' men are dead, along with more than the 80 Yemeni men, women and children killed by Marine gunfire.<br><br>Childers now faces a court-martial for violating the rules of engagement by killing unarmed civilians. He denies the charge, contending the protesters were armed and had opened fire on the Embassy. But it appears that the government has made the colonel the fall guy for an ugly diplomatic crisis: the men who could have testified on his behalf have been killed in action, one of the witnesses seems to be lying, and the President's National Security Adviser destroys evidence that might help Childers' case. Childers refuses to go down quietly and turns to his longtime friend, Hays Hodges, to defend him.<br><br>[This message has been edited by maestro (edited 12 July 2000).]</div>
