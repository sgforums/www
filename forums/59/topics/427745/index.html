Like that also can get a diploma...</p></div>

              <p>I was from Biomedical Science in RP. I have colleagues was from Biomedical Science SP. Usually poly syllabus is structured in a way such that you will be able to apply what you've learn (from the textbook/resources) to real life practical stuff. So it's a good mix of Theory and Practical Projects.</p>
              <p>Poly Year 1 you will learn the foundation and communications skills. Year 2 and 3 will focus on practical and theories. It's not a difficult course, if you're facing some difficulties in your school work, it means that there are some theories that you may not understand well. It's good to recognise this and start putting in a little more effort.</p>
              <p>There will be one or two projects that are "Major" to your course, which means you will be able to apply almost everything you've learn for the project. Some projects are research-based meaning you will need to research on a new topic based on the proposal. The easier projects are the ones that I called it the "verify" type, which mean tons of scientist have done the project, you will need to verify the data by replicating the experiment. it's the easiest liao.</p>
              <p>Always bear in mind that Polytechnic trains student for the workforce. What you learn in school will probably be your surviving knowledge when you go out to work. Yes, you may wish to advance your education, but the idea of polytechnic education is training students for the workforce. While for secondary school, the focus is about making sure students met a level of education competency before moving up to post secondary or teriary education.</p>
