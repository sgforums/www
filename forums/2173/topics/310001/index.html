              PLANET EARTH AND ITS FOUNDATIONS
              
              It should increase our faith in the Bible as the revelation of Godâ€™s design for mankind, as we realize how accurately it describes many of the essential facts concerning the earth. For example, the ancients believed that the earth was flat, but it is now established that the earth is a spheroid. This fact was referred to by the Bible 3,000 years ago. In the book of Isaiah we read of â€œthe circle of the earth.â€� (Isa. 40:22) Furthermore, the Prophet Job said concerning the Creator, â€œHe stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.â€�â€”Job 26:7
              
              The Creator asked Job, â€œWhere wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.â€� And again, â€œWhereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof?â€� (Job 38:4,6) In the light of geological truths now established, it appears that these questions refer to definite characteristics in the formation of the earth. Manâ€™s home does have â€˜foundationsâ€™ which are firmly established on what is believed to be a solid mass of nickel-iron substance which forms the hard core of the earthâ€™s center.
              
              We note how God uses laymanâ€™s language to describe the scientific principles he employed in forming the earth. The â€˜corner stoneâ€™ of the earth is somewhat like the chief cornerstone of a pyramid, except that instead of being on top, it is in the center. Thus the entire weight of the earth presses down upon its central core. In â€œThe Making of the Earth,â€� (Encyclopedia of Modern Knowledge, pp. 192,193), Prof. J. W. Gregory mentions seven massive foundations which support the upper crust of the earth. They are located in North and South America, Asia, Africa, Australia, and two in Europe.
              
              While the oceans have a tremendous weight, and are well shored up by a floor of heavy basaltic material, the Lord has provided for additional support for the continents. No wonder the psalmist wrote concerning the Creator, â€œHe hath founded the earth upon her bases, that it should not be removed for ever.â€�â€”Ps. 104:5

              MEASUREMENTS
              
              God asked Job another important question concerning the earth, â€œWho hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?â€� (Job 38:5) Measurements are vital to an architect when designing a building. Not only must the building itself have proper proportionate measurements, but these must be related to the surrounding objects and circumstances.
              
              So it was in the design of the earth. The great Architect chose measurements in every way suitable to the purpose of his design. The diameter of the earth is approximately 8,000 miles. The importance of this measurement is appreciated only when it is compared with the smaller size of the moon, and with the much larger sizes of Jupiter and Saturn.
              
              Earthâ€™s oceans, it is believed, resulted from water vapor thrown out in earthâ€™s early stages of formation when it was a hot mass. The diameter of the earth would therefore determine the amount of this vapor as related to its surface measurement. In the case of the moon, being much smaller, the amount of water resulting from its gases was so small that it was completely dried up as the moon cooled, with the result that there is no water on the moon. Scientists tell us, on the other hand, that planets the size of Jupiter and Saturn gave off such huge quantities of water vapor that their land masses are completely submerged under great depths of either water or ice. If the earth was to be habitable for man, it had to be the correct size, and the Divine Architect knew what that measurement would need to be.
              
              Also, the distance from the sun had to be just right in order that the earth might be properly warmed, but not made too hot. The sun is about 91 million miles from the earth. Scientists tell us that should the sun be removed to 120 million miles away, we would all freeze to death. Or, if the sun were brought to within 60 million miles of the earth, we would all be burned to death; that even vegetation would be destroyed by the heat.
              
              We see further in the Bibleâ€™s description of Earth as a habitable home for man, the orderly, intelligent design of the Fatherâ€™s work. The six epoch days of Genesis are not twenty-four hour days, but long epochs. In each period a goal is reached in preparing earth for habitation.
