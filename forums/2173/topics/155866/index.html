His parents slashed his allowance and banned him from going to church. He resorted to sneaking out from home.<br><br>'I felt persecuted,' recalls Mr Tay Swee Kwek, now 22.<br><br>The tension began at age 14 when the Victoria Secondary schoolboy began attending the Shekinah Assembly of God, a charismatic Christian church.<br><br>His family considered themselves Buddhists and his parents opposed his growing attachment to Christianity.<br><br>'Their first worry was I was being cheated and led into something I didn't understand,' he says. 'The second was that I would no longer partake in family traditions.'<br><br>They were right about the second. He refused to eat food placed at the ancestral altar and his mother accused him of becoming 'a religious extremist'. But eventually, his parents came round.<br><br>He believes they did so because 'Christianity taught me to love my parents, to control my temper and be patient and responsible with them'. And when he was finally baptised last month, it was with their approval.<br><br>His first encounter with Christianity was when friends invited him to a 'fun-filled' gathering of youths at a church.<br><br>Six months later, he was praying at home when he experienced what he believes was a 'religious experience'. If fun was the bait and spiritual experience the connection, then 'logic' sealed his conversion.<br><br>'The more I learnt about religion, the more it seemed to me that Christianity is the most logical religion,' he says.<br><br>In the meantime, he aced his O-levels and did well enough in his A-levels to gain a place in the National University of Singapore's medical faculty, where he begins his studies next month.<br><br>LI XUEYING<br><br>LOAD-DATE: July 15, 2005</div>
