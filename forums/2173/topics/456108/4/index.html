              Cut long story short, if you think merely counting tree rings can tell you the history of the earth you must be seriously deluded. Ignoring creationist arguments do not prove the validity of your own evolutionary beliefs.

              <p>Any age you think you can get from counting tree rings are based on ASSUMPTIONS made about how and what the rings meant and the rate of growth of such rings and also about conditions in the past.
