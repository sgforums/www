              <p class="infuse">I think the secular scientists are on to something here, but whether they will consider the effects of a global flood is another thing.

              <p>Except for those God brought to Noah to the Ark, all other dinosaurs and other animals and other humans that lived on land perished in the Flood. The fossil record is not a record of life like what evolutionists claim, it is a record of death by a watery judgement of sin. The general order that is observed in the fossil record is not a chronological order of simple life evolving into complex life, but one in which animals were generally buried according to their ecological zones when the Flood waters overtook them all and buried them rapidly in mud and silt.</p>

              According to the Bible, they died and were buried DURING the year long Flood. The process of fossilisation would take place over the decades or centuries since the Flood ended.
              
              <p>There is no shortage of dating methods. The main issue is with the ASSUMPTIONS used in computing the age of the fossils. Given that the Flood happened about 4,500 years ago it would mean that the fossils would be around that age and if tested for carbon 14 we should be able to detect them. And if so detected then it would be consistent with the Biblical account and age.</p>

              <p>You seem confused. YEC are saying that the fossils are formed as a result of Noah's Flood. But here you are talking about the fossils formed BEFORE the Flood? In the first place you don't even believe that there is such a Flood, so what are you shaking your head about really?</p>
              <p>And your link basically ASSUMED the truth of evolution. Note also the use of the word "belief" as in "A main part of this theory is the <strong>belief</strong> that fossil-bearing rock layers were laid down over an interval of hundreds of millions of years. Fossils thus represent evidence of the evolution of various species over a very long interval." So of course got conflict with the Bible, since it also goes without saying that he also ASSUMED that the Bible is false.</p>

              <p>You seem confused. YEC are saying that the fossils are formed as a result of Noah's Flood. But here you are talking about the fossils formed BEFORE the Flood? In the first place you don't even believe that there is such a Flood, so what are you shaking your head about really?</p>
              <p>And your link basically ASSUMED the truth of evolution. Note also the use of the word "belief" as in "A main part of this theory is the <strong>belief</strong> that fossil-bearing rock layers were laid down over an interval of hundreds of millions of years. Fossils thus represent evidence of the evolution of various species over a very long interval." So of course got conflict with the Bible, since it also goes without saying that he also ASSUMED that the Bible is false.</p>

                  <p>Well, we do know that fossilisation requires rapid burial and other right conditions, which are just what a global flood would provide. Now, creationists do not say that ALL and evry single fossil that exist are formed by Noah's Flood, but that the majority can be explained by this one catastrophic disaster.
