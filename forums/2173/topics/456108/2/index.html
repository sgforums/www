              The explanation is based on the Bible being a historically reliable book that tells us what happened in the history of the earth. On the other hand it has been shown that dating of rocks of known ages have given dates that are far in excess. Such anomalies are seldom made known. See http://creation.com/radioactive-dating-anomalies

               The Bible teaches that Noah brought a pair of each kind of animals, seven pairs of some, into the Ark. Remember though that the animals came to Noah by God's direction, they were not being caught by Noah. Dinosaurs are land animals so representative pairs of the various kinds would also have come to Noah.
