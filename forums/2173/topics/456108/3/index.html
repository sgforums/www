              <p>I wasn't talking about them...  Concerning parties like the christians here. Lurking but silent most of the time. Assumptions like those you made just reflects how prejudiced you equally are. </p>

              <p>It was a way of progressive argument, if it was a proven, fact why was there an arguement then? And you still call me ignorant over things passed... still prejudiced or a intended ad hominem?</p>
              <p><br>One would be corrected in many ways and still be ignorant of plenty of things. Thats how one keep learning. There is another term for continuously refusing correction... just couldnt find a word for it.... stiff necked. <br>Current example: your reply to Jacky a few post earlier. He was not making a argument to me. He was plainly voicing his opinions to me and no one else however openly. Not begging the question... your assumed position hence, was <a href="http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_84.htm">constructing a strawman</a> projected from your own view of what he said... Constructive, not.</p>
              <p>After a couple of "no u"'s, begging questions, strawmans and ad hominems from you, lets divert back on topic... Saw the video of how to correctly interpret the tree rings and conclude the chronology of 11000~ years? Argue on logically, non fallacy style please. The bible did not prove otherwise. Keyword: prove.</p>

              <p>"<span style="color: #333333;">Your kind of allegations is EASY to make, substantiating it is another matter altogether. Of course all concerning parties you are referring to would be those of your ilk, like Jacky, Beta, laurence82 who are already prejudiced against my views etc etc. I won't be surprised if they all stand on your side and nod their heads rigorously."</span></p>
              <p>I wasn't talking about them...  Concerning parties like the christians here. Lurking but silent most of the time. Assumptions like those you made just reflects how prejudiced you equally are. </p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333;">As for your ignorance, I think it is more than just an assumption, it was shown again and again how you, and those of your ilk as well, repeatedly failed to be aware of what the Bible teaches and what creationists are saying. Was it you who mentioned the Flood was only about so many days and I had to tell you it was about a year long?"</span></p>
              <p>It was a way of progressive argument, if it was a proven, fact why was there an arguement then? And you still call me ignorant over things passed... still prejudiced or a intended ad hominem?</p>
              <p><br>One would be corrected in many ways and still be ignorant of plenty of things. Thats how one keep learning. There is another term for continuously refusing correction... just couldnt find a word for it.... stiff necked.<br>Current example: your reply to Jacky a few post earlier. He was not making a argument to me. He was plainly voicing his opinions to me and no one else however openly. Not begging the question... your assumed position hence, was <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_84.htm">constructing a strawman</a> projected from your own view of what he said... Constructive, not.</p>
              <p>After a couple of "no u"'s, begging questions, strawmans and ad hominems from you, lets divert back on topic... Saw the video of how to correctly interpret the tree rings and conclude the chronology of 11000~ years? Argue on logically, non fallacy style please. The bible did not prove otherwise. Keyword: prove.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>So which of the "concerning Christians" are you referring to? Oh I see, the unnamed unknown silent majority. You mean the atheists here are not prejudiced against my views? Have you checked with Jacky and the rest? Actually no need to check also, it's plainly evident.</p>
              <p>Progressive argument???? You really have a way of making yourself look good even after being exposed for your errors and ignorance. That the Bible teaches a Flood that lasted at least a year is something that can be verified from Scripture, if you bothered to read it diligently and intelligently. Probably a reflection of stiff-neckedness?</p>
              <p>Nope. Did not see the video on tree rings. You hardly reciprocate on the things I ask you to see or read anyway. But the point is, and you haven't answered me, how does tree rings tell you about the history of the world? It is simplistic to count rings and think you are counting age one ring at a time.

              <p>Unjust unjust, injustice.  Even in these days and times the evil prevails among those christians who do evil and poor things are those people who they sacrify or attack for their selfish victory.    Same as the innocent animals who were killed in the flood during Noah's times, these people whom the evil christians prey on are just "items" for their sacrify for their victory gain.    And for "Justice" judgment from God for these they have to wait for his second coming.   Many have been sacrificed while waiting for the second coming judgment.   Conclusion is NO JUSTICE !</p>
