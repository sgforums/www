            <div class='col-md body'>Christians are often accused of using the Bible to prove the Bible and many do not know how to answer this and some are even embarrassed by it and try to set the Bible aside in their dialogue with nonbelievers. This article shows how to effectively refute this accusation. See http://creation.com/not-circular-reasoning</div>

              <p>Although I am Christian, I try not to use the bible too much when discussing wif non believers. I see it tis way: If I am the accuse in the court, would the judge trust my testimony if I am the only witness, only defence got myself? However, when testimonies of other ppl comes in, wad they say makes better evidence.</p>
              <p>No matter how true the bible may be, a non believer of it wil not be open to the bible defence of itself. But when we use nature n daily living as explanations n evidences, the non believers can relate better cos nature n daily living r there for everyone to see n validate. after seeing from the natural, then I will show tat the bible also said the same thing but recorded thousands of yrs ago...</p>
              <p>Yhe above though is my own opinions n approach...</p>

              In a sense you are right, God need no defense, in relation to His existence. Paul in the book of Romans said that the invisible God is "seen" in the visible things He has made and that man is without excuse. What happens is that man suppresses the truth about God's existence and deny it. Theologians call this General Revelation. But the Bible is Special Revelation where God reveals things to us that cannot be known via the created world.

              <p>And you believed you are Jesus like? Really!? When you posted the reference, it came off as really repelling because there is close to little similarities as projected by your posts.</p>
              <p>For the last time, ad hominem is for logical fallacy and I'm not even arguing a point. I know you are just using such words to sound authorative or impressive but it made you look stupid and exposed lack of proper understanding of the term.<br>I'm plainly questioning your intergrity and ego comparing yourself to Jesus. To me it is really insulting to my Jesus.</p>

                  Obviously your "Jesus" is not the Jesus depicted in the Bible. Had Jesus been with us today and said the things He said you would have had Him nailed just as well. Jesus said things that would make the atheists squirm and claimed things about Himself that would have you throw all your ad hominem retorts and insults at Him. Go reflect on it more by reading the Gospels and ask yourself honestly whether your "Jesus" bears any resemblance or similarities to Jesus in the Bible.
              
              <p>Also your views and opinions about me is irrelevant and is worthless. The servant is judged by his master. God is my judge, not you.

              only witness, only defence got myself? However, when testimonies of

              <p>No matter how true the bible may be, a non believer of it wil
              not be open to the bible defence of itself. But when we use nature
              n daily living as explanations n evidences, the non believers can
              relate better cos nature n daily living r there for everyone to see
              n validate. after seeing from the natural, then I will show tat the

              Thanks for sharing your approach. Actually that was pretty much my approach until recent years. I came to the understanding in Acts 17 that Paul reasoned from the Scripturea. Even in his preaching in Athens Paul spoke about things that were found in the Scriptures. 
              
              <p>Consider the analogy of martial arts. In most Chinese kungfu movies you would have pugilists claiming that their skills are the best. How does one prove it to be so except by sparring with another? Would it make sense for the challenger to say, "Look, you clamed to be the best but I don't share your belief. Why don't you set asode your skills and engage me in a fight?" In the same way I would not set aside the Bible in order to reason with the nonbeliever. Why grant the presuppositions of the nonbeliever while setting aside mine? As a weapon I should use my Sword of the Spirit to demolish and cut down the arguments against the faith, regardless of whether my opponent has a high regard for it. His weapon is his human reasoning but mine is divine revelation.
              
              </p><p>Thus the atheistic worldview would spar against the Biblocal worldview and I am confident and certain that the Biblical worldview would prevail. Evidence is certainly important, but evidence do not speak for itself but must be interpreted. And interpretation is again influenced by one's worldview.
