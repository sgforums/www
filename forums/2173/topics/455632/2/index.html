              <p>For someone who likes to accuse others of hypocrisy you really act as though you really care that Jesus is being insulted. Anyway, I never compared myself to Jesus, you did. All I said was that Jesus was also being accused of being mad, and the accusations were false. So I am ok with atheists like Jacky calling me mad simply because they can't hold their argument and have to go ad hominem.

              You trivialise that which you are ignorant of. Anyway, unless you demonstrate sincerity in seeking for answers, my giving you the answer would merely be casting pearls before swine. You are just taking potshots without having the decency and humility to really find out the truth.

                      act as though you really care that Jesus is being insulted. Anyway,
                      I never compared myself to Jesus, you did. All I said was that
                      Jesus was also being accused of being mad, and the accusations were
                      false. So I am ok with atheists like Jacky calling me mad simply
                      because they can't hold their argument and have to go ad
                      hominem.</p>

              <p> On contrary, ^that is an ad hominen as you have no more argument but fallacy to defend your position. See http://plover.net/~bonds/adhominem.html for clarification. </p>
