              <p><em>Tuesday, June 16, 2009</em><br><br>A University of Colorado at Boulder team 
              has uncovered an ancient and previously unknown Maya agricultural system -- a 
              large manioc field intensively cultivated as a staple crop that was buried and 
              exquisitely preserved under a blanket of ash by a volcanic eruption in 
              present-day El Salvador 1,400 years ago. <br><br>Evidence shows the manioc field 
              -- at least one-third the size of a football field -- was harvested just days 
              before the eruption of the Loma Caldera volcano near San Salvador in roughly 
              A.D. 600, said CU-Boulder anthropology Professor Payson Sheets, who is directing 
              excavations at the ancient village of Ceren. The cultivated field of manioc was 
              discovered adjacent to Ceren, which was buried under 17 feet of ash and is 
              considered the best preserved ancient farming village in all of Latin America. 
              <br><br>The ancient planting beds of the carbohydrate-rich tuber are the first 
              and only evidence of an intensive manioc cultivation system at any New World 
              archaeology site, said Sheets. While two isolated portions of the manioc field 
              were discovered in 2007 following radar work and limited excavation, 18 large 
              test pits dug in spring 2009 -- each measuring about 10 feet by 10 feet -- 
              allowed the archaeologists to estimate the size of the field and assess the 
              related agricultural activity that went on there. <br><br>Sheets said manioc 
              pollen has been found at archaeological sites in Belize, Mexico and Panama, but 
              it is not known whether it was cultivated as a major crop or was just remnants 
              of a few garden plants. "This is the first time we have been able to see how 
              ancient Maya grew and harvested manioc," said Sheets, who discovered Ceren in 
              1978. <br><br>Ash hollows in the manioc planting beds at Ceren left by 
              decomposed plant material were cast in dental plaster by the team to preserve 
              their shape and size, said Sheets. Evidence showed the field was harvested and 
              then replanted with manioc stalk cuttings just a few days before the eruption of 
              the volcano. <br><br>A few anthropologists have suspected that manioc tubers -- 
              which can be more than three feet long and as thick as a man's arm -- were a 
              dietary salvation for ancient, indigenous societies living in large cities in 
              tropical Latin America. Corn, beans and squash have long been known to be 
              staples of the ancient Maya, but they are sensitive to drought and require 
              fertile soils, said Sheets. <br><br>"As 'high anxiety' crops, they received a 
              lot of attention, including major roles in religious and cosmological activities 
              of the Maya," said Sheets. "But manioc, which grows well in poor soils and is 
              highly drought resistant did not. I like to think of manioc like an old Chevy 
              gathering dust in the garage that doesn't get much attention, but it starts 
              right up every time when the need arises." <br><br>Calculations by Sheets 
              indicate the Ceren planting fields would have produced roughly 10 metric tons of 
              manioc annually for the 100 to 200 villagers believed to have lived there. "The 
              question now is what these people in the village were doing with all that manioc 
              that was harvested all at once," he said. "Even if they were gorging themselves, 
              they could not have consumed that much." <br><br>The CU-Boulder team also found 
              the shapes and sizes of individual manioc planting ridges and walkways varied 
              widely. "This indicates the individual farmers at Ceren had control over their 
              families' fields and cultivated them they way they wanted, without an external 
              higher authority telling them what to do and how to do it," he said. <br><br>The 
              team also found that the manioc fields and adjacent cornfields at Ceren were 
              oriented 30 degrees east of magnetic north -- the same orientation as the 
              village buildings and the public town center, said Sheets. "The villagers laid 
              out the agricultural fields and the town structures with the same orientation as 
              the nearby river, showing the importance and reverence the Maya had for water," 
              he said. <br><br>The volcano at Ceren shrouded adobe structures, thatched roofs, 
              house beams, woven baskets, sleeping mats, garden tools and grain caches. The 
              height of the corn stalks and other evidence indicate the eruption occurred 
              early on an August evening, he said. <br><br>Because it is unlikely that the 
              people of Ceren were alone in their intensive cultivation of manioc, Sheets and 
              his colleagues are now investigating chemical and microscopic botanical evidence 
              at other Maya archaeological sites that may be indicators of manioc cultivation 
              and processing. <br><br>Sheets said Maya villagers living in the region today 
              have a long tradition of cutting manioc roots into small chunks, drying them 
              eight days, then grinding the chunks into a fine, flour-like powder known as 
              almidón. Almidón can be stored almost indefinitely, and traditionally was used 
              by indigenous people in the region for making tamales and tortillas and as a 
              thickening agent for stews, he said. <br><br>Since indigenous peoples in 
              tropical South America use manioc today to brew alcoholic beverages, including 
              beer, the CU-Boulder team will be testing ceramic vessels recovered from various 
              structures at Ceren for traces of manioc. To date, 12 structures have been 
              excavated, and others detected by ground-penetrating radar remain buried, he 
              said. <br><br>Sheets is particularly interested in vessels from a religious 
              building at Ceren excavated in 1991. The structure contained such items as a 
              deer headdress painted red, blue and white; a large, alligator-shaped painted 
              pot; the bones of butchered deer; and evidence that large quantities of food 
              items like meat, corn, beans and squash were prepared on-site and dispensed to 
              villagers from the structure, said Sheets. <br><br>Ceren's residents apparently 
              were participating in a spiritual ceremony in the building when the volcano 
              erupted, and did not return to their adobe homes, which excavations showed were 
              void of people and tied shut from the outside. "I think there may have been an 
              emergency evacuation from the ceremonial building when the volcano erupted," he 
              said. To date, no human remains have been found at Ceren. <br><br>###
