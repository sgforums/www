I've had some practice doing this thing.  The lines roll free and say about what I want them to say.  Now the influence on myself is myself.<br><br>As we live, we all get caught and torn by various traps.  Nobody escapes them.  Some even live with them.  The idea is to realize that a trap is a trap.  If you are in one and you don't realize it, then you're finished.  I believe that I have recognised most of my traps and I have written about them.  Of course, all of writing doesn't consist of writing about traps.  There are other things.  Yet, some might say that life is a trap.  Writing can trap you.  Some writers tend to write what has pleased their readers in the past. Then they are finished.  Most writers' creative span is short.  They hear the accolades and believe them.  There is only one final judge of writing and that is the writer.  When he is swayed with his fame and his fortune, you can float him down the river with the turds.<br><br>Each new line is a beginning and has nothing to do with any lines which preceded it.  We all start new each time.  And, of course, it isn't all that holy either.  The world can live much easier without writing than without plumbing.  And some places in the world have very little of either.  Of course I'd rather live without plumbing but I'm sick.<br><br>There's nothing to stop a man from writing unless that man stops himself.  If a man truly desires to write, then he will.  Rejection and ridicule will only strengthen him.  And the longer he is held back the stronger he will become, like a mass of rising water against a dam.  THere is no losing in writing; it will make your toes laugh as you sleep; it will make you stride like a tiger; it will fire the eye and put you face to face with Death.  You will die a fighter, you will be honored in hell.  The luck of the word.  Go with it, send it.  Be the Clown in the Darkness.  It's funny.  It's funny.  One more new line....<br><br></div>
