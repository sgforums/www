As the novel opens, readers are told that Eddie, unsuspecting, is only minutes away from death as he goes about his typical business at the park.In the third and last thread of the novel, Albom follows Eddie into heaven where the maintenance man sequentially encounters five pivotal figures from his life (a la A Christmas Carol). Each person has been waiting for him in heaven, and, as Albom reveals, each life (and death) was woven into Eddie's own in ways he never suspected. Each soul has a story to tell, a secret to reveal, and a lesson to share. Through them Eddie understands the meaning of his own life even as his arrival brings closure to theirs.<br><br>Ratings : 4 out of 5</div>

This question is quite hard to answer all at once. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But basically, the story is about a group of ordinary rats that were captured by a scientist for experimentation.<br><br>These rats were taught to read, write and speak human languages under the effect of a serium, and they eventually gained sufficient levels of intelligence to plan for their own escape and future.<br><br>In general, the story after the rats' escape goes on to describe how these rats, knowing that they are now different and can no longer go back to their previous ways of scavenging, came forth together to establish a colony of their own and to build a clandestine home somewhere far away and remote from the site of their capture.<br><br>Along the series, the rats faces challenges from the need to remain obscure but yet in interaction with a few other wild animal friends that were to help the rats in their effort and quest for a new future.<br><br>In 'Rasco and the Rats of Nimh', there is even a continuation of the story by generation 2 of the first Alpha generation rats. And like human stories, the rats too, have their own history of heroes and villains, sense of honor and self-sacrifice.<br><br>On the whole, I reckon that this series of stories under the 'Rats of Nimh' range is a must read for any weary urban souls who has a longing to re-experience back the innocent joys of quality stories.<br><br>10 upon 10 stars rating from Spear! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From the very Begining, gal's family objected strongly on her dating this guy, saying that it has got to do with family background, &amp; that the gal will have to suffer for the rest of her life if she were to be with him. Due to family's pressure, the couple quarreled very often. Though the gal love the guy deeply, she always asked him: "How deep is your love for me?"<br><br>As the guy is not good with his words, this often caused the gal to be very upset. With that &amp; the family's pressure, the gal often vented her anger on him.<br><br>As for him, he only endured it in silence.<br><br>After a couple of years, the guy finally graduated &amp; decided to further his studies overseas. Before leaving, he proposed to the gal: "I'm not very good with words. But all I know is that I love you. If you allow me, I will take care of you for the rest of my life. As for your family, I'll try my best to talk them round. Will you marry me?" The gal agreed, &amp; with the guy's determination, the family finally gave in &amp; agreed to let them get married. So before he left, they got engaged.<br><br>The gal went out to the working society, whereas the guy was overseas, continuing his studies. They sent their love through emails &amp; phone calls.Though it's hard, but both never thought of giving up. One day, while the gal was on her way to work, she was knocked down by a car that lost control. When she woke up, she saw her parents beside her<br>bed.She realised that she was badly injured. Seeing her mum crying, she wanted to comfort her. But she realized that all that could come out of her mouth was just a sigh. She has lost her voice....<br><br>The doctors said that the impact on her brain has caused her to lose her voice. Listening to her parents' comfort, but with nothing coming out from her, she broke down. During the stay in hospital, besides crying, it's just<br>her silent cry that accompanied her.<br><br>Upon reaching h ome, everything seems to be the same. Except for the ringing tone of the phone. Which pierced her heart everytime it rang. She does not wish to let the guy know &amp; not wanting to be a burden to him, she wrote a letter to him saying that she does not wish to wait any longer. With that,she sent the engagement ring back to him.<br><br>In return, the guy sent millions &amp; millions of replies, countless phonecalls, all the gal could do was to cry silently.<br>The parents decided to move away, hoping that she could eventually forget everything &amp; be happy. With a new environment, the gal learned sign language &amp; started a new life. Telling herself everyday that she must forget the guy.<br><br>One day, her friend came &amp; told her that her boyfriend is back. She asked her friend not to let him know what happened to her. Since then, there wasn't any news of him.<br><br>A year has passed &amp; her friend came with an envelope containing an invitation for the guy's wedding. The gal was sh attered. When she opened the card, she saw her name in it instead. When she was about to ask her friend what's going on, she saw the guy standing in front of her.<br><br>He used sign language telling her "I've spent a year's time to learn sign language. Just to let you know that I've not forgotten our promise, let me have the chance to be your voice. I Love You." With that, he slipped the engagement ring back into her finger.

As the novel opens, readers are told that Eddie, unsuspecting, is only minutes away from death as he goes about his typical business at the park.In the third and last thread of the novel, Albom follows Eddie into heaven where the maintenance man sequentially encounters five pivotal figures from his life (a la A Christmas Carol). Each person has been waiting for him in heaven, and, as Albom reveals, each life (and death) was woven into Eddie's own in ways he never suspected. Each soul has a story to tell, a secret to reveal, and a lesson to share. Through them Eddie understands the meaning of his own life even as his arrival brings closure to theirs.<br><br>Ratings : 4 out of 5</div></blockquote>the last book i read...not bad!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>and congrats!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
