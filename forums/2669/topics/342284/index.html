              <h1>Alleged briefing to President Reagan on UFOs posted online</h1>
              <div class="article_by">Steve Hammons</div>
              <div class="article_date">published November 02, 2007</div>
              <div class="article_body">What is claimed to be a transcript of a 1981 intelligence briefing to President Ronald Reagan about UFOs and extraterrestrial visitation to Earth was posted on the Web site Serpo.org on Oct. 30, 2007.<br><br>According to the moderator of the Web site and a related e-mail stream discussion list, the transcript is from a briefing Reagan received at Camp David, Maryland, between Friday and Sunday, March 6 and 8, 1981.<br><br>Those present reportedly included several advisors to the president, CIA Director William Casey and a CIA contract employee who worked within a group of "caretakers" safeguarding information and other resources regarding the UFO-ET issue.<br><br>The names of presidential advisors who are still living were redacted by the moderator during his preparation of the transcript for public consumption. Former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and advisor Michael Deaver are named.<br><br>The Web site and discussion moderator indicates that Defense Department and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) personnel provided him with this information to be released to the public as part of an acclimation effort. That is, as part of preparation of the American public for more disclosure about the UFO-ET situation.<br><br>The transcript information posted is reported to be only part of the briefings to Reagan on these subjects.<br><br>REAGAN IN THE LOOP<br><br>In the transcript, Casey begins the briefing. "Mr. President, good morning. As we discussed in February, this briefing contains some very sensational and some very, very classified information. I am not sure, oh, well, I'm not going to make a decision on who you want in the room. That will be your decision, Mr. President."<br><br>This will be a real tough one to follow since the briefing starts back, historically speaking, that is, and runs up to recent times. I believe we have prepared a good chronological order of events. I'm sure you, Mr. President, will have many questions," Casey reportedly stated.<br><br>After a discussion to determine who in the room had a "need to know," the proper security clearance or had not previously been briefed on the matter, Casey continued, according to the transcript.<br><br>as you will see Mr. President, this stuff is pretty high up on the food chain. We call it ATS or 'Above Top Secret.' This stuff has its own classification and markings. We have a special container, special printers and copiers for this stuff. Every word of this material is printed on special paper then placed inside special covers."<br><br>The caretakers have taken special efforts to protect all of this stuff from being released inadvertently or copied by some unauthorized person."<br><br>After further discussion about the information in the briefing, some advisors choose to leave the room. Casey then turns the meeting over to "The Caretaker."<br><br>Good morning, Mr. President. First of all, I would like to give you a bit of information on my background. But before that, please, Mr. President, if you have questions during this briefing, just interrupt me, sir."<br><br>I have been employed by the CIA for the past 31 years. I started the caretaking status of this project in 1960. We have a special group of people whom we call 'Group 6,' that cares for all this information."<br><br>According to the transcript, Reagan was somewhat familiar with the topic, having previously received a one-hour briefing from Casey the previous January, and also had been exposed to other information, stating, "Well, I knew a little about this subject before. Back in 1970. Nixon had all of the good stuff and wanted to share it with some of his friends. Nixon showed me some papers. Not sure about who authored them, but they ... huh ... well something about New Mexico and other places."<br><br>Nixon was pretty ... huh ... well, you know, fascinated with it. He showed me something, some kind of object or device that came from one of their craft. Something that was taken from the New Mexico crash site. I don't know if, well ... huh ... do we know what it was? I don't think we knew or maybe now, after 11 years, we might know."<br><br>After a short break, The Caretaker began the briefing.<br><br>Mr. President, as was mentioned earlier, I must say, that this briefing has the highest classification within the U.S. government. I will start with a slide presentation. I have most of this briefing on the slides, but I also have an outline that I have passed out to each in attendance."<br><br>The United States of America has been visited by extraterrestrial visitors since 1947. We have proof of that. However, we also have some proof that earth has been visited for many thousands of years by various races of extraterrestrial visitors."<br><br>Mr. President, I'll just refer to those visits as ETs. In July, 1947, a remarkable event occurred in New Mexico. During a storm, two ET spacecraft crashed. One crashed southwest of Corona, New Mexico and one crashed near Datil, New Mexico. The U.S. Army eventually found both sites and recovered all of the debris and one live Alien. I'll refer to this live Alien as 'EBE 1.'" <br><br>Mr. President, EBE means 'Extraterrestrial Biological Entity.' It was a code designated to this creature by the U.S. Army back in those days. This creature was not human and we had to decide on a term for it. So, scientists designated the creature as EBE 1."<br><br>Reagan asked, "Do we or did we have others? The number '1' would seem to indicate we had others."<br><br>The Caretaker responds, "Yes, we had others." <br><br>All the debris and EBEs recovered from the first crash site were taken to Roswell Army Air Field, Roswell, New Mexico. EBE was treated for some minor injuries and then taken to Los Alamos National Laboratories, which was the safest and most secure location in the world. Special accommodations were made for EBE. The debris was eventually transferred to Dayton, Ohio, home of the Air Force Foreign Technology Division."<br><br>The second crash site wasn't discovered until 1949 by some ranchers. There were no live Aliens at this site. All this debris went to Sandia Army Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico."<br><br>Reagan asks, "OK, a question, regarding the first site, how many aliens were in the spaceship?"<br><br>Five dead aliens and one alive. The bodies of the dead aliens were transported to Wright Field in Ohio and kept in a form of deep freeze. They were later transported to Los Alamos where special containers were made to keep the bodies from decaying."<br><br>The Caretaker continues, "There were four dead aliens in the second crash site. Those bodies were in an advanced state of decaying. They had been in the desert for the past two years. Animals and time got to those bodies. The remains were transported to Sandia Base and eventually onto Los Alamos."<br><br>We determined both crashed spaceships were of similar design and the bodies of the aliens were all identical. They looked exactly the same. They had the same height, weight and physical features. Here are the photographs of the aliens."<br><br>They don't have any similar characteristics of a human, with exception of there eyes, ears and a mouth. Their internal body organs are different. Their skin is different, their eyes, ears and even breathing is different. Their blood wasn't red and their brain was entirely different from human."</div>
