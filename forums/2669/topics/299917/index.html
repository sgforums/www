            <div class='col-md body'>Does your child have an imaginary friend? Maybe you had an imaginary friend yourself when you were a child. Psychologists will tell you that there are several reasons why a young one may concoct an imaginary friend. Sometimes a young child just needs to have a special friend. Their imagination is very vivid and can seem almost real to them. Sometimes they create an imaginary friend to keep them company and share their thoughts, someone who will always listen to them. In most cases psychologists are probably correct in their explanations. Could it be possible that some children's imaginary friends may be more than just products of their own imagination? What if a supernatural entity such as a ghost somehow made contact with a child? Especially if very young a child would not think anything out of the ordinary. They would see the entity as being real and in most cases would be unafraid. Since the adults would most likely not be open to recognizing or perceiving the ghostly entity it would be assumed that the child simply had a vivid imagination.<br><br>Believe it or not there have been cases where an imaginary friend did in fact turn out to be something more. What would you think if your child met an imaginary friend soon after you moved into an old house? Your daughter has a name for her imaginary friend and can even tell you things about them like where they died.<br><br>I am sure that you would be a little concerned about her ascribing a death to her friend though she claims to see them and talk with them daily. She may even bring them to the dinner table.<br><br>Now, lets say that you become concerned enough by some of the statements that your child makes about her friend that you decide to ask questions around the neighborhood. One of the neighbors informs you that a child by that name did live in that very house but that she had died years ago. When the circumstances surrounding her death is explained to you, you realize that your daughter had real information from somewhere about what had occurred.<br><br>As amazing as it my seem to many of us there can be no doubt that something much more than imagination was at play here. If her friend was truly a product of her own imagination how did she know the name? How did she come to know other aspects about the girl's life and her death?<br><br>To view the rest of this article, please visit <a href="http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=36459" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=36459</a></div>
