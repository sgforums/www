            <div class='col-md body'>Seyi Ojo is a model and student of Osun State Polytechnic. In a chat with Daily Sun, she tells you about her first Prince Charming, the man who introduced her to the world of love and passion.<br><br>Your first kiss<br>It happened when I was in secondary school.<br><br>Who did?<br>My boyfriend at the time. His name is Â…Â… We are no longer together, but at the time, he really meant the world to me. Then it was like if I did not see him, my world was incomplete. He was like a fever in my body until maturity cured me of the insanity.<br><br>How did it happen?<br>I went to visit him in his house. We started gisting. Suddenly, it occurred to us that we were alone. He held me and we couldnÂ’t resist it. The urge just swept through us and before anyone could say donÂ’t, we were in each otherÂ’s arms. We were locked together in a hot embrace and steamy kiss that nearly took us to the next level.<br><br>Any resistance<br>Of course, yes. At first, I was very much averse to it because of my Christian upbringing, which frowns strongly at such things. There was the fear that once we started, we would be lost and thereby commit sin against God. But after a while, the current of our passion overwhelmed my resolve and I yielded to my boyfriend.<br><br>How did you feel?<br>Whao! It was like having a turbo-charged current sweep through me. It brought pleasant sensation through my nerve centres all at once. You know, like you have an electric shock in the most pleasant and warmest way possible. To say I enjoyed it would be an understatement. The kiss swept me off my feet. I not only enjoyed it, I luxuriated in it and fantasized over it for a long time. I did not want to wipe out the effect of his lips on mine.<br><br>Where is the boy now?<br>Well, heÂ’s gone with the passage of time. That was a long time now.<br></div>
