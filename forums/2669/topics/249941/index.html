            <div class='col-md body'><span class="small"><span style="font-style: italic;">They say they've put up with chantings, smoke for nine years; URA says no rules broken </span></span><br><br><span class="small"><span style="font-style: italic;">Apr 22, 2007</span></span><br><br>NESTLED along Dunearn Road is a house that stands out among a row of terrace houses.<br>Not for its architecture, but for the 15 statues of Buddha measuring 1.2 to 2m tall in the front garden, and gold fabric umbrellas that flank the front door.<br><br>Almost every night for the past nine years, neighbours have had to put up with late-night chantings, ringing of bells, the strong smell of incense and crowds of people who park their cars along the pavements when they visit the house.<br><br>Until two months ago.<br><br>That's when one of the neighbours decided she had had enough and called the police.<br><br>'The chantings, singing and bell ringing that stretch into the middle of the night are frustrating especially when my husband and I are tired and just want to get a good night's rest,' said the neighbour, an expatriate who moved in a year ago.<br><br>The houses in that area are worth at least $2 million and some neighbours are worried the late-night activities in the house might devalue their properties.<br><br>The big question was whether the house was doubling as a place of worship, something not allowed under Urban Redevelopment Authority rules.<br><br>But the URA, which had received similar complaints in the past, didn't think so - much to the surprise of residents in the neighbourhood.<br><br>Seven neighbours spoke of massive amounts of joss sticks burning, causing smoke to billow through the vicinity.<br><br>Retiree Peter Chin, 60, who lives a few doors away said: 'The smell of incense is very strong, but I'm more concerned that the burning of incense could pose a fire hazard as his house is next to a petrol station.'<br><br>The problem gets worse during the Hungry Ghost Festival every August. Another neighbour claimed to have seen the home owner, jeweller Danny Loo, 45, in a trance before his 'followers'.<br><br>Mr Loo is disappointed his neighbours are kicking up a fuss. He insists his house is not a place of worship.<br><br>'The people who gather here are my friends and family and we hold parties where we enjoy each other's company and share life experiences with each other,' he said.<br><br>He denied conducting any ritual and is puzzled that his neighbours could hear the chants as he does not use a microphone.<br><br>When asked about a woman in a Buddhist nun's robe who was seen in his house last week, he said she was there to seek a donation from him and was not staying there.<br><br>He also finds it ironic that none of his neighbours have approached him with their complaints before going to the police.<br><br>The neighbours' reply: They were either too afraid to approach him, which is why they declined to be named, or did not think it would make a difference.<br><br>One said that they had complained to the various authorities on many occasions, but the problem persisted.<br><br>A neighbour once stormed over to the house when the level of noise became unbearable, but stopped short as the porch was full of people.<br><br>The parking problem improved after some neighbours started putting potted plants outside their houses to prevent strangers from parking there.<br><br>Mr Loo said: 'I've already cut my gatherings to twice a week, but if I've really become a nuisance to the neighbourhood, I will stop them.'<br><br>A gathering that was planned for last night was cancelled after the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) paid him a visit on Friday.<br><br>Mr Loo said he was 'disheartened' by the latest visit although the SCDF found no fault with him.<br><br>The URA receives about 55 complaints a year about houses that are used as places of worship.<br><br>In another case three years ago, the resident of a house in Lange Road, near Yio Chu Kang Road, was warned because it was used as a place of worship.<br><br>The occupant, a monk, had a 2.4m tall statue of Buddha in his front yard which he was asked to remove. Neighbours said the monk moved out last month and the house is now empty.<br><br>A neighbour, undergraduate Shalini Raj, 23, said: 'The crowds brought vibrancy to the neighbourhood and it's a pity about the statue; it added a touch of quirkiness to our street.'<br><br></div>
