            <div class='col-md body'><span class="small"><strong>Foreword :</strong> This is one rumour I heard from a known aquiantance of mine. She mentioned that it happened to a friendÂ’s of hers but after hearing the exact story once again from another friend of mine whom also told me it happened to her friend, I was a skeptic to what degree of truth is there to this story. Anyhow, IÂ’m sharing this story for everyoneÂ’s benefit of the doubt.</span><br><br>Karaoke! A place where people go to relax, enjoy and have some fun. In the recent years, karaoke centers are getting more popular and most visited by both teenagers and adults of different ages. With the recent boom in this industry, everyone wants a piece of the cake and the most popular and frequented karaoke centers happened to be RxxBxx, Malaysia (supposedly to be originated from Hong Kong)<br><br>MayÂ’s friend, Jolin, and her 2 friends decided to spend the boring weekday by going for some singing sessions. She and her friends like any other teenagers have the fantasy of one day becoming a successful singer like their idols. By going to their favourite karaoke spots at the center of the town, theyÂ’ve always thought that practice makes perfect. That is, until that unfortunate day.<br><br>It was just any other ordinary day except that they had really a lot of fun singing for at least 3 hours. After that, they decided that they had enough and asked for the bill. To their horror, they saw the receipt billing them 4 people instead of 3 (this karaoke center bills per pax).<br><br>In their anger, they called on the manager of the outlet and demanded for an explaination after the cashier refused to change the bill. They asked the manager why are they billed for 4 when thereÂ’s only the 3 of them. Jolin even asked if the manager knows how to count!<br><br>Still refusing to change the bill, the manager showed them a camera footage of their room when they were singing their lungs out. There, the manager pointed another figure of a person sitting at the corner of the room and insisted that they brought along one of their friend.<br><br>The girls were shocked and quickly paid the bill and left.<br><br>The thing was, some thought that it could be one of the karaokeÂ’s scam to trick people into paying more so they could earn even more during the slow hours. But then again, could the girls really Â“smuggleÂ” another friend into the center without being noticed by the staffs there whom were mostly in and out of the room serving them drinks and food? You be the judge.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>can be a prank but the waitress/ waiter might not really observe if another one is really there or not. Even if they notice the wherebout of the another one, they could have simply conclude the other should have been to washroom or for calls..<br><br>waiter/waitress dont really bother how mny of them really in.. since the footage tells everything, of course they tend to believe the footage instead of noticing themself..<br><br>but no idea how they can create another person in the room within 3 hours... i leave this to expert to prove how true is it if anyone can create another person in 3 hours.</div>
