            <div class='col-md body'>I have been thinking for a suitable name to blend the character of the<br>star of this new story of mine. The name should be able to bring up a<br>person that is well educated, with highly paid income but greedy and<br>stubborn. HmmmÂ…I think Durai is a perfect name to use. Well, Durai<br>is a middle age man who is single and is now living with his mother in a<br>private estate. He always wanted to spend his excess saving on a HDB<br>flat near his mum's home for investment but was unable to carry out<br>because he was too busy with his works. Just recently, he was posted<br>back to take charge of the Asia market and thus he has more time in<br>town. So, for the next couple of weeks, Durai spent most of his night<br>and weekend visiting the HDB re-sales unit for a dream home of his<br>own.<br><br>After a few round of extensive selection, valuation and consideration,<br>he finally decided to buy a flat that has been vacant for years and the<br>price was relatively cheaper. The reason for the unit to be vacant was<br>unknown. The day he got an appointment to visit the flat with the HDB<br>officer was a little strange but it doesn't bothered to a non religious man<br>like him. :handsup:<br><br>That day, the sky was sunny and the sun was shining bright on the<br>greenery along his way to his new flat with his mother. But when they<br>first stepped into the new flat, the cloud moved and blocked the sun<br>from shining and thus the flat inside suddenly turned out to be darker<br>and cooler even without any curtains by the window. Older people<br>usually don't like this type of feeling especially if it is about their first<br>visit to a new home. He insisted to buy the flat partly because the flat<br>was not furnished and was almost empty and it would cost lesser to<br>refurnish it. Just that night, Durai had a weird dream. He dreamt of a<br>man at about his age asking him Â“How is it? Are you coming?Â”<br><br>A day was fixed by the HDB for his keys collection. His mother was<br>especially instructed him to bring a packet of salt to throw all corners<br>inside his new flat to ward off any bad luck or spirits or whatever you<br>can imaging. But Durai was stubborn enough to ignore his mother<br>instruction. All because he don't have a religion and he is only have<br>himself to believe. Durai went to the flat himself after collecting the keys<br>and he stayed inside the flat for quite a while to figure out the concept<br>of the renovation. Don't know why the flat is noticeably darker even the<br>sky outside is sunny. Sun lights just don't seem to shine into this unit.<br>But to him, the solution is to add more lighting to brighten up. Nothing<br>seems too unusual. He walked into every room one after another.<br>However, he realized that one of the rooms is unusually cooler than the<br>other. No, he never thought that the room temperature does make any<br>difference with his life later. In fact, he was happily thought that he<br>could gain more saving from the power bill due to the natural cool of the<br>room. That night, Durai had the weird dream again. He dreamt the<br>same man asking him the same question Â“How is it? Are you coming?Â”<br><br>Durai holds a key position in a big organization. He has thousand of<br>work force works under his command. As such, nobody can change<br>his mind once he has made a decision even his mother. Few months<br>later, the renovation work was completed. Durai would made short stay<br>in his new home once awhile if he is in town. Whenever he is out of<br>town, one of his sisters who is a housewife would go over to his new<br>home to help tidy up his flat because a single man is usually cannot<br>tidy up a flat properly . :disgust2:<br><br>One day, as usual his sister went and help tidy up her brother's flat<br>when Durai was away to Malaysia. The flat was still new and therefore<br>it was not very dusty; but she would still try to reach every corner to<br>make sure it is sparkling clean. Suddenly, her attention was caught by<br>the featured wall made up of nine pieces of mirror in the dining room. It<br>is not because the mirror was dusty; it is because she saw a palm<br>printed on the clean mirror. The palm print was about a size of a little<br>child and it was nicely printed at a height that only an adult can<br>reached . She was first puzzle but soon turned worry and frighten.<br>She is now recalled what her mother said and her disapproval of the<br>flat. Beside that, she don't remember Durai mention anything about his<br>flat. She knew something could be not right and she also believed that<br>her brother will never bring up any unusual matter because he wouldn't<br>believe it. :runnynose:<br><br>to be cont</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>part 2 - An Unusual Home</strong><br><br>Durai's sister was very concerned about his safety. She tried to<br>convince him to seek consultation from a medium but failed.<br>Nevertheless, Durai only agreed on inviting his company staffs to come<br>over his flat for a casual gathering. This might help ward off the spirits<br>or anyÂ¡Â®ying qi' inside the flat with the help of stronger Â¡Â®yang qiÂ¡Â¯ from<br>his invited guests.<br><br>Well, the day for the party came. Most of his guests that night were<br>guy from his company. They cracked peanuts, bottoms up mugs filled<br>with beer while watching the English Premiere League on a big screen.<br>Not long after midnight, the power supply to the entertainment ceased.<br>They checked and realized that a safety switch in the DB was trip.<br>They re-activated it but it would trip again after awhile. They thought<br>that the power supply is overloaded and therefore they try to cut down<br>the usage by switching off some unwanted appliances. But, the<br>situation just doesn't improved, the DB trip again and again even after<br>they had done switching off almost all the electrical appliances in the<br>flat. They soon left the 'indoor stadium' and leave the problem to an<br>electrician.<br><br>The next day, the electrician met Durai's sister when she was there to<br>help tidy her brother's junk flat. The electrician checked all the circuits<br>but could not find any fault from the supply. And his sister was taking<br>special notice to the mirror wall. She checked and sniff through every<br>single inch of the mirror for palm. At the height of her kneels level, she<br>found a fresh palm print again but this time it was a size of an adult's<br>palm. The palm size was bigger than the previous one and it was more<br>visible. Thus, she inspects the print closer to see if she could spot<br>anything. The palm was nicely printed onto the mirror. Have you tried<br>making a palm print onto a clean mirror? Try putting your palm onto the<br>mirror, hold it there for awhile before you let go. The result is you don't<br>usually get a nicely shaped palm on the mirror. All you could see is<br>only a few fingers prints plus part of your palm. This is natural because<br>human give out heat from our body and of course included palms.<br>However, the palm print that appears in the Durai's home was really<br>very amazing. the shape was nicely printed; really, I saw it in my own<br>eyes. Only a palm that is cold and doesn't give out heat can produce<br>that type of flawless print on the mirror. Too bad, I didn't have a digital<br>camera then to capture that image for you to see. Anyway, she share<br>her discovery with the electrician hoping that he could give some<br>advises to her. The electrician is one of our helper in our temple. He<br>was shocked to see the palm on the mirror and he share with her that<br>her brother's flat is indeed a bit weird. During the period of renovation<br>work, the electrician would stayed up for the whole night after his each<br>visit to the flat during the day. No matter how hard he tried, he just<br>couldn't get himself into sleep that night. And this happened if only he<br>visited the flat.<br><br>His sister knew exactly what she needs to do now. She went and<br>discussed this with her mother and later they decided to come to our<br>temple for consultation through the help of the electrician. Dua Ya Pek<br>was invited to chair the session. After some intensive checked on the<br>location, Dua Ya Pek found out that the unit in question is in the way to<br>the gate of hell. This also means that there are hundred or thousand of<br>spirits walked pass the flat everyday. Those spirits were just passing by<br>and generally they are harmless. However, it is not advisable for human<br>to live inside a flat with spirits eventhough they may be harmless. The<br>unbalance of Â¡Â®yinÂ¡Â¯ Ã’Ãµ and Â¡Â®yangÂ¡Â¯ Ã‘Ã´ could ultimately affect the health<br>or the luck of the person living inside the flat. The bad news is, the gate<br>of hell cannot be relocated. The good news is, for the case of Durai,<br>the problem can be fixed with offering a Â¡Â®Cheng WangÂ¡Â¯ Â³Ã‡Â»ÃŠ deity<br>inside the flat. That would certainly help balancing the Â¡Â®yinÂ¡Â¯ Ã’Ãµ<br>and Â¡Â®yang qiÂ¡Â¯ Ã‘Ã´Ã†Ã¸ of the flat. But too bad, the latter suggestion would<br>never be approved by the flat owner. Well, we can't force Durai to<br>swallow everything we said if he doesn't believe. We can only leave the<br>rest to fate. :handsup:<br><br>to be cont....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>final - An Unusual Home<br><br>Durai's mother was helpless. Selling off the flat is definitely out of<br>question. All she could do now is to persuade him to rent the unit out<br>quickly which was also a plan intended by Durai for extra income. But,<br>none of the tenants he rented to stayed more than 2 months and he<br>had since changed 3 different tenants within a period of 6 months. All<br>of his ex-tenants complained that his home is too noisy to sleep at<br>night. They describe it as like sleeping along a busiest street in the<br>world. :freakedout:<br><br>Due to the nature of his job, Durai travels frequently to our neighboring<br>country for business and he like to drive up north in his sports car,<br>When he comes back, he would usually Â‘da pao' pumped extra petrol<br>into a spare container for used to refill his tank in singapore later. One<br>sunny day, as usual, Durai parked his car onto his mother's private car<br>pouch. He took out the spare container filled with petrol which he<br>bought from JB during his last visit. He then starts to pour the petrol<br>into his car petrol tank by a plastic funnel. He had been doing this for<br>many times and he can handle it very well. But this time, a slight haze<br>and a careless mistake he made turn out to be a disaster to him. In<br>order to check if the tank was already filled, he did something he never<br>had done it before. He took out a lighter from his pocket and he ignited<br>a flame near to his car petrol tank and put his naked face closed to it<br>just to look into the hole. The petrol tank he was looking at was emitting<br>flammable gas and thus at a flash of a heat, Durai was engulf by a ball<br>of flame. His upper part of the body was caught in the fire very<br>quickly. His family members heard his screaming and dashed out to<br>see him rolling in pain on the floor. An ambulance was dispatch to the<br>scene speedily. His housewife sister accompanied him into the<br>ambulance. Although Durai was badly burnt from the upper part of his<br>body, he was still conscious. I think he must be struggled to be stayed<br>conscious. Why? Because he had a very important word for his sister.<br>He said Â“jie, if anything bad would to happen to me, remember to dump<br>everything from my flat. I think those things are stained and I don't want<br>you to bring back to mom's home.Â” Although his sister was very<br>distraught at this time but she try to make him speak out more<br>information pertaining to his new flat since he want to talk now. The<br>next thing he said with a whisper tone was Â“jie, I think you might be<br>right, the flat is dirty, I kept dreaming a middle age man asking me how<br>is it and am I going since the first day I went to the flat. I also<br>discovered palm prints on the mirror wall but I dare not to tell you.Â”<br><br>Durai's voice got weaker and weaker. By the time the ambulance<br>reached the hospital, he was almost in a state of semi coma. His<br>sobbing housewife sister was the only one heard his untold dreams and<br>the only one in his family to see him wheeled into the operating theatre<br>alive.<br><br>Durai was put into an intensive care unit for observation. His distraught<br>mother and sister are now making an urgent appointment to see our<br>Dua Ya Pek in our temple. All the temple helpers were activated to<br>report for duty in an hour time. As usual, we setup the altar in our<br>temple for Dua Ya Pek but this time, we have another guest to invite. It<br>was Durai. Yes, we were instructed to find out the type of foods, drinks<br>and brand of cigarette he used to smoke so that we could invite his soul<br>into our temple more smoothly. Beside that, not to forget the officers<br>that escorts him to our temple. We have to offer them with wine, food<br>and some incense papers just outside our temple. That was to make the<br>officers feel respected. Respected is a term they use, bribery is the<br>term we use. Haha :biggrin4:<br><br>Anyway, it didn't take us very long to invite Durai's soul into our temple.<br>Our Dua Ya Pek had a word with him. Their communication was<br>soundless. The only sound we heard was from the abacus seeds and<br>sobbing sound from his mother and sister. The whole session didn't<br>take very long to end. But it end with a man's life taken away. Durai<br>was very badly burnt. As such, Dua Ya Pek gave him a chance to<br>choose for himself whether to stay alive disfigures or leave the world<br>with a nice memory to other. Durai, a perfectionist chose the lattar. :cry3:<br><br>The next day, our temple was told by his sister that Durai had passed<br>away in the morning. Well, the middle age man in his dream is now<br>firmed that he is going. In fact, he has gone. Durai die because of an<br>accident. The accident happened because he was down on his luck<br>and he doesn't have enough good deeds to prevent the accident from<br>happening. :runnynose:<br><br>the end.</div>
