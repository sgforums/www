              <p>IT’S called Jalan Wat Siam, but its nickname has a more sinister ring - ‘cemetery road’.</p>
              <p>And true to its nickname, this road at Pulau Ubin has already claimed two lives.</p>
              <p>On Sunday, Madam Lee Yan Inn, 41, died after she was flung off a tandem bicycle together with her daughter.</p>
              <p>The housewife had lost control of the bike while they were going down a steep slope.</p>
              <p>She hit her head, lost consciousness and died 11 hours later in hospital.</p>
              <p>Another fatality occurred two years ago when student Zawiyah Mohd Muliana, 18, fell and hit her head while cycling on the same slope.</p>
              <p>She slipped into a coma and died later in hospital.</p>
              <p>The slope looks deceptively easy to navigate but it’s a 200m- long, curvy slope with a sharp incline of about 30 to 40 degrees.</p>
              <p>To novice cyclists, it can be quite a challenge, said seasoned cyclist November Tan, who helps organise guided cycling tours of the island.</p>
              <p>And there’s an average of one accident along the stretch every month, though most are minor, islanders told The New Paper.</p>
              <p>There are four street signs along the stretch of the slope warning cyclists and motorists to go slow.</p>
              <p>But old-timers on the island have dubbed it ‘cemetery road’ because there’s an old Chinese cemetery on top of the slope.</p>
              <p>Longtime resident Ong Kim Cheng, 50, said he avoids cycling along that stretch because of stories about an old female ghost lurking there.</p>
              <p>He said in Mandarin: ‘I don’t like to ride around this area because of the stories about this place being haunted. People say that they’ve seen a female ghost here while picking durians, so I am not surprised about the accidents.</p>
              <p>‘But the slope is really quite steep and can be quite dangerous if you’re not careful.</p>
              <p>‘I’ve seen cyclists with scratches and bruises walking back to return their damaged bikes after falling along this slope.’</p>
              <p>Superstition aside, the islanders agree that this is one of Ubin’s most dangerous roads to cycle on.</p>
              <p>It’s called Jalan Wat Siam because there was previously a Thai temple there. It was relocated to Jalan Kayu last year.</p>
              <p>Residents call it ‘cemetery road’<br>Reporter Desmond Ng’s sketch showing the area around the accident site. TNP PICTURES: MOHD ISHAK</p>
              <p>When The New Paper visited Jalan Wat Siam yesterday, four cyclists, all foreigners, were riding on the slope.</p>
              <p>All had no problems cycling there.</p>
              <p>Japanese expatriate Momo Matsutani, 28, was shocked to hear about the death.</p>
              <p>She said: ‘It’s not difficult to cycle here. We just came down slowly and we didn’t speed.’</p>
              <p>At the bottom of the slope, there’s also an NParks signboard with a map of the area and a warning: ‘Always wear a helmet when riding in this area’.</p>
              <p>Warning ignored</p>
              <p>But it seems very few visitors pay heed to the warning.</p>
              <p>All four bike rental shops we visited at the main village offer helmets for rent at $2 to $3 each, but they have found few takers.</p>
              <p>Yen Fa Bike Rental’s Mr K H Sit, 55, said in Mandarin: ‘Some people think it’s too expensive to rent the helmets. To many people, it’s just not a habit here to wear helmets and cycle.’</p>
              <p>Mr Sit had rented the bikes to Madam Lee and her family on Sunday.</p>
              <p>He said that if she had worn a helmet, the accident may not have been fatal.</p>
              <p>Owners of bike rental shops there said that only one out of every 10 people rent helmets.</p>
              <p>It costs about $3 to $15 to rent a bicycle for the whole day.</p>
              <p>When The New Paper was on the island yesterday, no cyclist was seen wearing a helmet.</p>
              <p>Cyclist Nick Ward, 25, said: ‘I don’t think there’s a need to (wear helmets). It’s not that dangerous.’</p>
              <p>Some islanders felt that the road should be closed.</p>
              <p>Said Mr Sit: ‘There’s nothing to see there, so there’s really no point for anyone to cycle up there.</p>
              <p>‘If people tell me that they plan to cycle there, I’ll just tell them to go elsewhere. The authorities should either close the road or make it safer for cyclists.’</p>
