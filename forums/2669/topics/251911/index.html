I quickly woke everyone up and rushed out of the flat.'<br><br>More than 20 pairs of shoes went up in smoke when a shoe rack next to the door caught fire.<br><br>The wall next to the flat's door was also charred.<br><br>Firefighters put out the fire after receiving an emergency call at 1.40am, an Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) spokesman said.<br><br>The SCDF also put out fires that broke out on the second and third floors of Block 189.

The wall outside her house, as well as her living room window, were damaged too.<br><br>'My whole family just ran out of the flat and stood outside as my husband and I tried to put out the fire, which they eventually did.'<br><br>The SCDF confirmed the incidents and is investigating.<br><br></div>
