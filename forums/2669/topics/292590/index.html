            <div class='col-md body'>When analyzing dreams it is important to try and determine what has instigated the dream. Dreams can result from a variety of factors. For instance in some circumstances eating something difficult to digest before bed can cause dream's to be revealed as meaningless images.<br><br>In other instances the flu can cause dreams to become fragmented visions caused from a sick body trying to heal itself. Although these pictures mean nothing to us logically, there is likely some pattern there that is applicable to the body. In still other instances dreams can reveal emotional struggles.<br><br>Although dreams can result from a variety of different factors, more often than not, the dreams we recall can be understood. We can recreate the story line, which we can later write down and analyze. These dreams can give us great insights into what we're dealing with in our lives at a particular moment in time.<br><br>They can depict both minor and major emotional struggles. They can also depict problems you have within yourself. These depictions can be some of the most profound life changing messages you will ever receive.<br><br>In his book on Edgar Cayce, Henry Reed talks about a higher self or 'the witness', which watches everything we do, say, feel and think. Our higher self never goes to sleep, it is always awake, watching, processing and seeing things from an objective perspective as we struggle through our lives.<br><br>Our higher self is aware of and connected with the creative energy of the universe. It uses this energy to get our lives back on track by sending us messages through our dreams.<br><br>It is because of this higher self that there is no one better than you for analyzing your own dreams. Only you can understand what you need?<br><br>A therapist can look at your life and see from the outside what appears to be the problem, but only you can see yourself from the inside, having full knowledge of all of your personal history and all of your secrets.<br><br>No therapist can help you if you leave out what could be the most important information of all when trying to deal with a symptom you may be experiencing. You are the only one who knows the full story.<br><br>Our higher self can create images in our dreams in an instant. It can embed symbols inside of dramatic stories, which from beginning to end can have profound meaning for us.<br><br>In her recent book, Debbie Ford talks about the holographic model of the universe. This theory describes every living thing as being a small part of the whole universe.<br><br>The best way to describe this theory is to think of the universe as a large mirror. When a mirror breaks, each piece becomes a mirror in and of itself but at the same time is a piece of the whole. Similarly a drop of water out of the ocean contains all of the same elements of the whole ocean. In other words we are all unique and yet exactly alike and by recognizing patterns in our self, we can relate the patterns to others.<br><br>Dreams have also been described as prophetic or precognitive, actually depicting an event, which has not yet occurred in our time. Skeptics of prophecy have been shocked into belief when they themselves have suddenly experienced a personal precognitive dream.<br><br>These types of dreams can occur to warn of impending illness or accidents. Sometimes they occur to prepare people for an inevitable death about to occur in the family.<br><br>For instance, I dreamt of the death of my young dog. I loved this dog like it was my child. In the dream I experienced gut wrenching grief and endless tears. A year later I was forced to put my dog to sleep as she had severe epilepsy, seizuring up to 10 times a day.<br><br>It was when I was experiencing the grief in real life that I suddenly remembered the dream. In it, a spirit had stood before me with outstretched arms and took my beautiful puppy from me. It comforted me knowing he was taking her and looking after her for me. That memory, which occurred in the dream, comforted me a great deal in real life.<br><br>So dreams can be many things for us. They are a gift from the universe. We can go through life ignoring them, or we can use them, pay attention to them, take advantage of them and learn from them. The answers are there for us; all we have to do is look.<br></div>

It never go 'dormant' even while I sleep or dreaming. It could take action or connect to us anytime including while we're asleep for example to simply wake us at the right moment, to stop our dreams or to give us one. Its presence and action would be seemed as a supernatural phenomenon to non believers or linked with a paranormal ability or psychic. I've found that there's no bound to its ability to either manipulate us or the environment and it knows everything not just about me but simply everything. Time is of no factor to 'it'. And it is definitely a sentient superior being capable of making its own decision which implies that it's capable to think and judge and do its decision based on its remarkable detailed planning. It's very interested in our life. Perhaps care is more suitable.<br><br>And yes it or its avatar or its servant can take physical form tough not as what we might expected from a blood and bone creature. It's definitely biped and humanoid in form down to the muscle though I think(guts feeling) it may change its form into anything it wants. And it's emitting a profound energy (reading).....which while not be able to be seen can be felt clearly by another sentient beings.<br><br>Of interesting note that in every encounter or visit it always try to hide its face either by a very profound white light emission(much more stronger than our own solar) or by a substance which property closely matching that of a black hole which is unable to be penetrated by any light source. And the color white has always been linked to holiness characteristics perhaps it wasn't just a coincidence that its face was emitting that specific spectrum of light. It is very possible that any sentient being may be turned blind by this light exposure though I've a suspicion that the only thing that keeping other sentient beings from being  literally blinded is the light source own will. Again arousing my suspicion that it is an independent intelligent sentient being.<br><br>I've come to known and experience that it is quite active in my life especially in the last few years. I'm referring it as God though. As I've personal experience that made me believe it is God. Though there is a possibility that it is a trickery from the being identified as the devil. But so far my experience with this watcher has never indicated that it is the devil so there is nothing to alarm me to this being.<br><br>Do I sound like Data of Star Trek LOL I've been watching the series these couple days <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well I just want to add that while some dreams are prophetic most are probably a reflection of your mental state and what preoccupy your mind lately including those in your subsconsciousness. Some other are reflection of a past event. It could be in the form of symbols too.<br><br>Only a tiny part of dreams are actually prophetic I think. Though I read from somewhere that most people do have at least one or two prophetic dreams in their life.</div>
