              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>In the MMORPG, RPG gaming world, and Dungeon and Dragon fantasy setting, there is this concept of blessed (sometimes enchanted is used instead) or cursed items/objects that imbue (or harm if it is cursed) the owner or wearer with special supernatural power.</p>
              <p>In the real world, there are some  objects that are rumoured to be cursed, though it can never be proven definitively whether an object is really cursed or blessed and if it is really effective in exerting some unknown and unexplained influence on the environment or people around it. Examples include The Hope Diamond, Bermuda Triangle, Pandora's Box, and Curse of the Pharaoh's Tomb.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">My 1st question: Can an inanimate objects can be blessed or cursed to protect or harm its owner/wearer?</span></strong></p>
              <p>I suppose my question may trigger off suspicion as to why I'm interested to know, and whether I'm thinking of using black magic to harm anyone. The answer is "no." Why I ask is because recently I became interested in antiques and curio items. And of course, I'm concerned about bringing home possibly inauspicious, cursed or haunted objects unknowingly.</p>
              <p>So this leads me to my <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">2nd question: how do we know if an object looks/feels all right/OK to bring home? Any symptoms or tell-tale signs to observe if something is not quite right about it and any best practices to follow?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">3rd question: Must a blessed/cursed object or its material or creation process be of supernatual or divine origin?</span></strong> A book that is blessed could be some sacred religious text passed down for generations which can be traced back to ancient time, or the material used was rumoured in legends/folklore to be given by some divine beings, or the item was somehow rumoured to be created in heaven etc. like some mythical objects e.g. Pandora's Box.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">4th question: How can a seemingly normal object be blessed or cursed?</span></strong> For example, statues of divine beings and amulets are not known to possess any special power (ineffective) until they are somehow activated by a priest, bomoh, shaman, witch doctor or magician to become effective. For example, our SAF Colours, National Coat of Arms and crest are blessed by religious leaders. Not sure what the blessing guarantees, perhaps good luck and success on battle fields?</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">5th question: How do people verify if the blessing is indeed working and effective?</span></strong> If we visit geomancy shops, we usually see they offer a lot of curio items like jade statues, prayer beads, pendants etc., purportedly to bring good luck according to the geomancers. Most are replicas of statues of ancient Chinese mythical beasts (e.g. dragons), casted from moulds or shaped from factory floor I guess. If this is the case, how do I know if indeed an object is blessed or the geomancer is taking me for a ride by giving me a piece of worthless jade/plastic/metal/wood with no special power like those in pasar malam?</p>
              <p>I would like to solicit the opinions of both scientific and religious/occult experts here if it is possible or it is just a concept does not happen even in the supernatural realm. Any idea?</p>

              <p>Hi~</p>
              <p>Found this topic quite by accident and do realise it's a little dated. Would still like to offer my 2 cents though... I'm no expert, just have a keen interest in the metaphysics.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">1) Can inanimate objects be blessed or cursed?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Yes. Not only objects, sometimes even places as well. Just simply think of a time in your life when you enter a room and feel real comfy or real uneasy. Not to say that the room is blessed/cursed, just that after an exposure to a certain type of energy after a while (or a very strong burst of energy in a really short time), the place takes on the energy. Whether or not it sticks (or lasts) is a different matter, just like trying to create a blessed/cursed object. There is a psychic phenomena known as psychometry where pyschic can pick up an inanimate object and tell details of the owner's personal life to it's owner.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">2) How to know if it feels right to bring home? Any tell-tale signs?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">If you are lucky (or unlucky depending on your point of view) enough to be a sensitive, you can feel it. Even if you are not, some people can detect energy pretty good on certain occasions. If it feels bad, don't touch it. If you experience cold spots, headaches, muscle fatigues, cramps, chills etc etc... Buy at your own risk. If you've already bought it, try noticing if your luck is not as smooth or you encounter more friction wih people, energy levels low on a daily basis...</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">3) Must cursed/blessed objects be from a supernatural origin?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Nope. It does help, I guess. It is possible to curse/bless an ordinary object.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">4) How to curse or bless an object?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Through a ritual of some sorts. Or naturally through a long time of exposure to feelings- of a certain type. Usual non-trained humans are very rarely able to direct their energy and what they want the end results to be into an object. So, they are unable to affect the objects. Trained humans, like priests, magi, shamans etc, etc are able to bless/curse an object because they have an understanding in how the energy moves/works, and they are able to invoke a strong enough energy or even entity (for e.g. God, or angels etc) to direct into the object and seal it so it lasts for more than a really short while.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">5) How to verify if a blessing worked?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Feelings are usually accurate. If you can see energy, should be able to detect differences immediately. The blessed objects will start to resonate at a different rate, almost always radiates a more peaceful, protective energy. You will feel happier or more drawn to it, or maybe more peaceful and calm. At the very least, if your home is blessed, you'll be able to sleep better at night, wake up with more energy etc.</span></p>
