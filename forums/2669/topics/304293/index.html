            <div class='col-md body'>tis true encounter was happened not long ago. it was<br>happened in a construction site near the new changi airport<br>terminal 3 building. the project is to be carried out by a<br>reputable japanese construction firm. i shall not disclosed the<br>name of the construction firm for now. well it was all about a<br>tree, an indian guard and a spirit of course.<br><br>__________________________________________________ ________<br><br>sometimes tis year, a decision was made to bring down a tree<br>because it was situated right at the heart of the new building<br>and it was obstructing the work progress of the construction<br>work. not long after, the tree was cut down like it was<br>belonging to the father of the japanese. i dont know whether<br>do u believe or not, most chinese believe that trees or plants<br>are shelter of spirits. it could be more than shelter, perhaps<br>could be a living soul.<br><br>__________________________________________________ ________<br><br>anyway, the japanese firm took down that tree as like they<br>have taken down thousand of trees in asia during the<br>japanese invasion. but tis time, they are not as lucky. few<br>days after the chopping, several staffs tat work till late at<br>night hear crying and moaning voices from the direction the<br>old tree used to be. they couldn't find documents they want<br>in the office at night but it reappear again in the next morning.<br>potted plants tat used to keep in the office for years dried up<br>and die suddenly. even the new replacement plants doesn't<br>stay for long. one of the indian guard there saw the spirit<br>sitting on a tree top at night beside his guard post. he reported<br>tis to his superior and then granted to offer an indian altar<br>inside his guard post to protect him. but it doesn't seem to be<br>working becos some staffs and the indian guard still see the<br>blur image of the spirit at night. the spirit must be protesting<br>for compensation for the demolishing of his private shelter,<br>a tree. however, nothing seem to move the head of the<br>jap firm which is a pure ah noi nei, japanese san. he is a<br>devoter of the japanese god and he has a altar inside his<br>office. things turned around 180 degree only after he saw the<br>spirit in his own eyes.<br>__________________________________________________ ________<br><br>ok, now come back to the head of the project in-charge<br>which is a japanese san. u know japanese are very workaholic<br>and tis particular jap is as no different from other and he<br>usually stayed till very late. have u seen those site office tat<br>built up by specially designed container in the construction site?<br>well, they are stacked into double storey with an exposed<br>corridor leading to the staircase at the side of the container<br>office. so, wat happened on a faithful night was the jap san<br>worked late as usual and juz when he was going down the<br>staircase from the site office, he missed a step of the wooden<br>staircase and he slide down juz like one using an escalator<br>down in a shopping centre. everything happened juz in a split<br>second. the next thing he knew is he was laying face up<br>on the cement floor of the staircase landing. he was shocked<br>and feeling hurt somewhere in his body but juz couldn't move<br>his body for that moment. as he was laying on the ground<br>looking up, he saw an image of a tree on the edge of the roof<br>top of the site office above him. how could a tree be planted<br>on the roof which made of zinc sheet and not soil? tat was<br>wat he was wondering in his mind while still laying on the<br>ground. he was then attended shortly by the indian guard which<br>the guard post was not far away from the staircase. beside<br>making some painful moaning sound while the indian guard was<br>lifting the jap san up from the ground, the jap san keep<br>gesturing and pointing up at the roof to the indian that he<br>found something unusual up there. but after the jap san was<br>helped to sit on a stool nearby, the tree image on the roof<br>was gone.<br></div>
