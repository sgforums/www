              <p><strong>Hospital Duties</strong> - sfogs</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.hungzai.com/wp-content/themes/dark-city-10/images/hospital2.PNG" alt=""></p>
              <p>Since i am an avid fan of true ghostly encounters, i had my friend’s aunt tell me about her encounters whilst working as a nurse in a singapore hospital near outram.</p>
              <p>She told me that they have this pregnant colleague who was supposed to report to work in the noon shift but apparently she did not turn up. they tried to contact her to no avail and her husband claimed to have sent her to work an hour earlier. shortly, a bad news came. her colleague jumped down from the private canteen meant for only nurses and doctors. she came crashing down from the roof with her face badly smashed. reason till today is still unknown as her husband claimed that she seemed alright when he dropped her off at the hospital. during her catholic funeral they put on a surgical mask on her face because her face was badly disfigured from the fall.</p>
              <p>Then on the 7th day of her death a patient from a private one person ward rang the bell for nurse. she insisted she wanted to move to another room because there’s a nurse in her room wearing a surgical mask walking non stop from left to right around her bed. everyone upon hearing that froze and knew that either their colleague came back to pay a visit on the 7th day OR she still ain’t aware that she has died and still come back to the hospital to do her duties. how terrifying!</p>

              <p><strong>Marina Square Basement</strong> - sfogs</p>
              <p>These are 3 accounts of the experiences of women who happened to be at the toilet. There are 2 toilets at the basement in Marina Square. One is located at where u come in from Raffles City (beside some eateries) and another below the Golden Village cinema. Judging from the descriptions, I believe it is the latter one. The toilet is built such that the door is directly along the corridor so when people passes by they can easily look inside to see girls combing their hair or doing makeup.</p>
              <p>I went to the gents there several times too and fortunately my gf never entered hers (I active bladder but she’s not). The toilet is situated at one corner after a pizza stall, on the left just after u come down of the escalator beside Long John Silver. Anyway these are the 3 incidents… Up to u to believe or not.</p>

              <p><strong>Marina Square Basement</strong> - sfogs</p>
              <p>ACCOUNT 1<br>———–<br>It was during the “Hungry ghost festival” that I encountered this strange happening. I was at the toilet at about 7pm and while I am in the cubicle, I heard a lady’s coughing sound (the sound was like someone clearing her throat). So I thought that lady outside was trying to warn me that she was outside so that when I came out I wouldn’t be caught in an alarm!! But the strange thing is that when I came out of the cubicle, no one else is in the toilet beside me.</p>
              <p>At that time I did not think that much but just continue doing my stuff(combing my hair). Then my boyfirend pass by the female toilet and I look out and smile to him and he went away. After I finish combing my hair, I went out and meet up with him. He then asked me a very strange question “U alone in the toilet?”. Well I answered “Yes, why?”. He then say “But I saw a lady wearing white tube top beside u”. My respond was a huge and frightened “Huh??? then I clinged on to him and we left quickly. So be careful when you gers go to that toilet…………</p>

She asked her bf, but her bf said he did not bang her door…… gee..scary..better avoid this one even if it’s not true…</p>

              <p>ACCOUNT 3<br>———–<br>NOTE: Most recent account, after the writer read the two accounts above. (Though the incident happened long ago) Oh yeah! One of my friends do told me about this encounter too! It was happened 2 years ago…..She went shopping with her boyfriend at Marina Square one weekend and was around 8pm that they decided to go home. She went to the carpark toilet to answer her emergency call while her boyfriend waited outside.</p>
              <p>When she was in the cuticle, she heard some funny sound…. something like foot dragging sound when walking. She thought maybe it was somebody else dragging the feet… Then she heard the sound louder &amp; louder…. and this time, she can heard someone sighing! It was like a woman feeling very depressing. When she opened the cuticle door and talk a look…. Nobody….</p>
              <p>Could the woman has left? So fast?? But she didn’t take it to heart, she washed her hands and trying to make some touching up on her make up…. “Ling? Are you OK?” Her boyfriend yelling at her outside the ladies toilet and pouting out his head to look in.</p>
              <p>“I am fine, dear! Will be ready in minutes…” She replied smiling sweetly at him. But, there was an unusual look from her boyfriend eyes as if he is trying very hard to figure out something. She immediately packed up her accessories and run to him, for fear of anger him on being to long in the toilet.</p>
              <p>“I am very sorry, dear. Please don’t be angry….” she trying to apologize. Her boyfriend looked at her and then directly into the ladies toilet where she was standing repeatedly……. Her boyfriend looks really frighten her, she cried. Her boyfriend suddenly pulled her away and ran off as fast as they could without looking back.</p>
              <p>Till they reached City Hall Starbucks….. My friend asked him what happened? Why he turned so pale after she came out from toilet? At first, her boyfriend refused to talk about anything on the toilet incident and what he saw, but after much persuading, he told her…..”I saw a lady with hair as long as you, wearing all white…. looking at you while you putting on your lipstick…..” He paused. My friend frozen, she declared that she didn’t see anyone beside her! She was all alone in the toilet!</p>
              <p>Her face turned even more pale and her limbs were all numbed when her boyfriend poured out the reason on why his expression was strange when she come out of the toilet. He said that the lady all look the same as her except her white clothes…. even her…… face….!!! The next thing I know of was, she was suffering a state shock for a month. And her boyfriend having MC for 2 weeks……</p>

              <p><strong>The Distress Call</strong> - sfogs</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.weirdasianews.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ghost.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>This happened in 2005 somewhere in mid Aug. I was working the graveyard shift that night.</p>
              <p>At about 0330hrs, my partner &amp; I were dispatched to a distress call received via the “Emergency Call System (ECS)” located at the old Jalan Besar NPP.</p>
              <p>nb: Every NPP would have an ECS outside the NPP. This was to facilitate for those (after NPP’s closing hrs) unable to get to a phone in time and the system is connected directly to a Police Operator.</p>
              <p>So on tt nite at the time, our Police Operator had rcvd a “distress” signal fm the ECS at the said NPP. However, the Police Operator was unable to identify if it was a female or a male voice, just that she could hear someone crying there. So my partner &amp; I rushed to the old NPP.</p>
              <p>We could not believe wat we saw when we reached..</p>
              <p>The wall which once had the ECS on it was now bare except for the dangling wires which were still hanging out from the wall. How did our Police Operator managed to get a distress call then??!!</p>
              <p>As fm 2000, Jalan Besar NPP ceased to be in operation. And when operations ceased there, there was no more electricity, water or phone lines connected to it.</p>
              <p>We were spooked by that time, cos we suddenly felt the temp in the air drop several notches..</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, we persisted and conducted a thorough foot patrol arnd the vicinity and some of our colleagues also helped comb the area. Nothing out of the ordinary was found..</p>
              <p>Suddenly, one of my colleagues asked wat’s the date today and my partner answered. Then something passed between them cos they both told the rest of us to move out and return to base as soon as we’ve completed our search of the vicinity.</p>
              <p>Upon reaching base, I asked what happened and questioned on how the ECS could have worked when it was no longer there.</p>
              <p>My partner then related this incident to me which happened a few yrs b4 Jalan Besar NPP ceased operations on the same date and time when the distress call was rcvd by our Operator:</p>
              <p>On tt fateful nite, there had been a distress call for back-up by fellow officers at Boat Quay. Officer ABC (not his real name), who at the time was attached to Jalan Besar NPP (still operational at the time) had responded to that said distress call (with permission fm superiors) on the police scooter. However, he never reached the location.</p>
              <p>Cos he was involved in a fatal accident where he was knocked down by a taxi driver.</p>
              <p>That nite when my Police Operator rcvd the distress call via the ECS at Jalan Besar NPP, marked the death anniversary of Officer ABC. And it was also during the Hungry Ghosts’ Festival.</p>
              <p>Personally, I believe his spirit came back just to say hello to his old friends without any harm intended whatsoever. But I know my colleagues who knew him and had worked with him before all paid Officer ABC respect with incense and food offerings the next day at the old NPP.</p>
              <p>God bless his soul. I hope he managed to find peace somehow.</p>

              <p><strong>Haunted House - Jurong West</strong>  - sfogs</p>
              <p>This is based on a true story that happened when i was living in my old apartment in jurong…</p>
              <p>My apartment was on the fourth floor and directly facing an eerie looking tree.(pls note that the tree was not the problem) When my family first shifted in, everything was ok and we love the place as it was a peaceful neighbourhood and we had a good time in the house.</p>
              <p>Then it started, my sister was the first one to be affected by it. One night while sleeping she said that she felt someone waking her up. She told me that by instinct she went straight to the window and to her horror she found a figure without head was sitting on the swing at the playground (her room faces the playground and our hall faces the spooky tree). She just froze when suddenly the thing stops swinging as if it realises my sister was watching her. She then quickly snapped out of it and went to my mother’s room to sleep.The second incident happened to her was one day when she was watching tv with me late at night, she said she saw a white shadow dashing pass from my mother’s room to my room. As i’m not a believer of the supernatural, I just brushed it aside.</p>
              <p>My mother too experienced a similar encounter while she was taking a nap in the afternoon. She felt that someone came and held her down. She claimed that she saw a black shadow but was too blurry for her to figure out what it was. She prayed hard and soon after it was gone.</p>
              <p>The final one that we had it was when my sister got slapped on the back by something. She was studying late into the night when she felt something slap her hard behind. She started to get sick after that so much that my mother got scared of the house.</p>
              <p>Soon after that my father decided to move out from that place and we shifted out of there. After a few months, i met my neighbour one day in downtown and he told me a spooky tale abt the house, it seems that there were 3 families b4 us and they all shifted out of the house in lesser than 2 months and the second family did all the renovations but never shifted in. We were the longest staying family there as we stayed for almost 2 years. I asked him why he had not told us this earlier and he claimed that since we indians were generally pious, he had a strong feeling that whatever that lurked in that house must have gone away. But i guess he felt it was not the case after I revealed to him our encounters.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">This page is dedicated to the innocent individuals who have lost their lives in East Coast Park, Kallang River and the Singapore River over the past 10 years. Dedicated to the people who drowned even though they were supposed to be good swimmers. To the people whose bodies were found floating, yet without any evidence of suicide intent. For these people, their story will never be told.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>*** The Policeman of Sungei Bedok</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">This is a true story. Names have been changed to protect the innocent.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">It is well known that good Kim Bak Loh (KBL, also known as Sea Bass, Barramundi or Ikan Siakap) fishing spots are often found in secluded areas. It is also well known that large KBL only come out at night… secluded spots at night.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The Setting Sungei Bedok is actually a canal off Old Bedok Road (behind the former Long Beach restaurant). It flows to the sea and most of you who have been to East Coast Park have probably seen it. If you head towards Changi Airport, it appears after the PA Sports Centre.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">I knew that there were KBL in Sungei Bedok. Together with my friends, Beng and Hock, I bought some live prawns and went there at around 11pm. Everything was perfect for KBL fishing. The tide, the date of chinese calender, and the location.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">When we reached there we immediately rigged up and cast our live prawns. We didn’t talk much, we were there on a mission - to catch KBL. Beng went to my left to fish near the bridge. Hock went to my right. This way we had a good spread over the area. After only ten minutes, Beng came to me and said</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">“Tang, I think there’s no fish over here. We better pack up, don’t waste time.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">I looked at Beng incredulously. I had gone all the way to Lavender Street to buy live prawns and this friend of mine was telling me to pack up when we haven’t even used half the bait. I told him straight off:</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">“We’ve only been here ten minutes. Come on man, how come you so impatient one?”</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Beng replied that he didn’t feel like fishing anyway, this place sure got no fish, and he went over to join Hock. After a while, both of them went to the back, sat down to drink from their thermos and ate their snacks. In my mind I was thinking, wah lau man choose the wrong kakis to go fishing. Nevermind, I’ll go over to the bridge to fish. KBL always like to hide near structures.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The Encounter I stood beside the bridge and cast my prawn near the pillar. I was enjoying myself, hunting for my quarry.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">After a few minutes, I heard someone running through the bushes behind me. I thought it was Beng running up to give me a scare, so I turned around. There was nobody.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">I assumed it must have been my imagination, so I resumed fishing. After another 30 seconds, I heard the footsteps again. This time whoever it was had to be a metre or so behind me, but he seemed to be running around from left to right. I was fed up with all this horsing around, I turned around sharply to scold Beng.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">“Beng! Don’t play the foo…..” Again, there was nobody.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">I quickly scanned the area. There was nobody in the vicinity! The closest people were Beng and Hock, but even they were at least 50 metres away. Suddenly, my hair stood on end. Because that only meant one thing. I briskly walked over to the guys, and I could see that both of them also looked quite scared.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">“Come let’s go back, Beng you’re right, this place got no KBL.”</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #333399;">The Explanation</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Neither of us said anything on the way back. But when we reached home, Beng explained what had happened.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">“There was this malay policeman, he was quite tall about 6 foot and he had a very angry expression on his face. When I was fishing by the bridge he kept charging towards my body, like a bull. But everytime he came to contact me he bounced off. He tried charging to me a few times, like as though he was unhappy that I was standing there. I hinted to you to pack up, but you didn’t get the hint, so I and Hock went behind. Then you went over to that spot. Wah lau, you damm irm zai see. From where we were, we could see the policeman running towards you, but everytime you turned around, he disappeared into thin air. You better thank your lucky stars man, otherwise you might have been possessed or something.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">I was shocked. So ghosts really exist?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">I checked with my uncle, who has stayed in Bedok area since his childhood. He said:</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">“Aiyah, you should have told me you were going there. In the 1970s, the gangster Koh Sek Lim killed a malay policeman near the bridge. Came out in the papers. The gangster challenged the policeman, “You want to catch us right? Meet us at the bridge on this date and time and you can catch us.” Of course, the unfortunate policeman was stupid to go alone - he was stabbed to death by the gang. Koh told the police that the murder was committed as ‘an example to the police’.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">So there we have it. It could not have been Beng’s imagination, because he described the ghost perfectly without knowing about the murder. Back in the 1970s he was only a toddler. It could not have been my imagination either, because I was interested in fishing for KBL, not looking for such experiences.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #333399;">Epilogue</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">One frequently reads about people asking in the Fishing Singapore Forum etc.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">“where to catch KBL? what time to catch KBL?”</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">I am worried for these beginners.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>*** The Liang Court Experience</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Diehard fishos like me don’t get scared by just one incident. So there I was back to my old habits a couple of months later. This time I became even more ‘chia lak’. This time I chose to fish alone because I had learnt from a number of occasions not to rely on impatient ‘kakis’.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">It is known among KBL enthusiasts that the mother KBLs (larger than 5kg) need to go to brackish (half salt half fresh) water to breed. The salinity of the water is conducive for their eggs, according to researchers. Brackish estuaries can be found e.g. in Pulau Ubin, Lorong Halus, Kallang River or Singapore River. But you have to go upstream from the sea to find the correct salinity. In the Singapore River, the correct salinity is only found behind Liang Court. I went to the area behind Liang Court and started spinning my live prawn. I could see the people enjoying themselves in Clarke Quay. I wondered what I was doing here on a Saturday night.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Suddenly out of the blue I felt that the faces of a few people were staring at me. You know the feeling right? When someone is looking at you, you can feel it. But the strange thing was that I was the only person in the vicinity. Now let me assure you that I was not trying to imagine things. I was here to hunt KBL, and my mind was set on fishing, not such eerie thoughts. I tried to ignore it, but the sudden image of faces (men and women) just appeared in my mind.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">It spooked me a bit, and I figured there that this place was “unclean”. I immediately packed up my tacklebox and left. Later I asked my father about it and he told me that a car had crashed into the river at the spot where I was fishing a few years ago. (during the era when The Warehouse was happening) All the passengers died of drowning because they could not get out of the car. I do not wish to draw any inferences from this incident, for it could be purely my imagination. I’m sure if Beng was around with me that night he could tell me what he saw.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Lessons to Learn</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">I am not trying to discourage anyone from fishing at night, all I’m saying is be careful and take precautions. I wouldn’t want other people to experience such things in their life - it is not fun, trust me. I for one will not go fishing at night in Lorong Halus or any river by myself anymore.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Here are some suggestions.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">If possible, don’t fish at night. Large fish can be caught in the day if you go out to sea. If you’re Christian, bring a cross. If you’re Buddhist or Taoist, bring some charm or talisman. If you’re a free thinker, better start believing in God. Never fish alone. (Refer to the Kranji case, below) If your kaki tells you let’s pack up and go home, pack up and go home-don’t ask him so many questions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">There is no such thing as a once in a lifetime chance of catching KBL. Even if you see KBL chasing schools of mullet in the middle of the river never, ever feel tempted to enter the water so you can get nearer to the fish. (Refer to the St John’s Island case, below)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Here are some other stories I have heard…..</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>*** The Kranji Case</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">My driving instructor told me this story. His uncle always liked to go fishing for Snakehead (also known as Ikan Toman or Siam Loi) in Kranji Reservoir. As every true blue fishermen knows, the best time to catch snakehead is early in the morning (6.45-7.45) or late in the evening. So his uncle always went alone on Sunday mornings before the sun rises to Kranji reservoir to hunt for his elusive quarry.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">One day he didn’t come back from his fishing trip. Rangers later found his body floating in the middle of the reservoir. To date, the family has no explanation for the death. Furthermore, his fishing rod was still in the shore. No one knows why he entered the water. No one will ever know. Moral of the story: Never fish alone.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>*** The St John’s Island Case</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">I read this story in True Singapore Ghost Stories. This girl went swimming in the waters of St John’s island at night, and in the middle of swimming across the reef, she suddenly felt many hands in the water touching her and groping her body. Needless to say she was terrified and swam back to her boat. Luckily, she survived.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">This “hand phenomenon” is not new or indigenous to Singapore. I have heard from one Malaysian friend that his classmate drowned when crossing the river in Gunung Ledang (Mount Ophir). On recovery of the body, the rescuers discovered hand marks on the ankles of the victim. Similarly in Lake Toba, they say never enter the water because of the evil spirits. I was also surprised when I discovered while visiting Loch Ness last year that the Scottish locals never swim in the water because they believe that the ‘kelpie’ will try to drown them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">I would not be surprised if the many deaths in Kallang River are caused by such evil spirits. It is said that when a person drowns, the only way his spirit can leave the place is to take the life of another by drowning. In other words it is a vicious cycle. How far that is to be believed, I leave it to you. Moral of the story: Never, ever enter the water, especially at night.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>*** Lorong Halus</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Another famous KBL, mangrove jack and tarpon spot, I have read here that people have encountered ghosts that beg for food. So don’t go there at night if you don’t want to experience it, go to Pasir Ris Fishing Pond instead where there’s more people. Moral of the story: Avoid Lorong Halus at night, especially during the 7th Month.</span></p>
