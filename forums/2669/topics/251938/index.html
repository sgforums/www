            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large">He was so brutal that...  </span><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="small">S'porean raped 3 China women who came here with high hopes </span></span><br><br>SHE arrived in Singapore at 3.35am last November with dreams of furthering her education.<br><br>Less than nine hours later, around noon, the China national was brutally raped and sodomised.<br><br>One of her first encounters with a Singaporean man - the Beast of Balestier - has left her scarred for life.<br><br>Likewise, his two other victims, also China nationals who came here with dreams of a better education.<br><br>One of them was a <strong>virgin</strong>.<br><br>All three now carry such deep psychological scars that their lives will never be the same again.<br><br>What Ser Eng Siong did to them was so violent and horrendous that much of it cannot be reported in a family newspaper.<br><br>According to psychiatric reports tendered during Ser's trial, all three have trouble sleeping. And when they do, they have recurring nightmares.<br><br>They became depressed and withdrawn, and two showed signs of post-traumatic stress.<br><br>One felt life was meaningless while another ran in fear when she spotted a man with tinted hair in a crowded place. She had mistaken the man for her rapist.<br><br>Last week, Ser, 33, was sentenced to 28 years in jail and 24 strokes of the cane for his heinous acts.<br><br>The delivery man committed his crimes in the Balestier area, with the first on 3 Nov last year.<br><br>He tricked his way into a hostel room where an 18-year-old girl had just moved in after arriving from China.<br><br>She was sleeping alone in her room around noon when Ser woke her by knocking on her window.<br><br>He told her that he was there to do some repairwork.<br><br>After she let him in, he pretended to fiddle with the gas canister in the kitchen.<br><br>When she returned to her room, he rushed in after her and closed the door.<br><br>Ser then raped and sodomised her several times in her room. He also forced her to perform oral sex on him.<br><br>Later, she ran to the toilet and locked the door. But he forced her to open it and then raped her again in the toilet.<br><br><strong>WIPED FINGERPRINTS</strong><br><br>When he was finally done, he used tissue to wipe surfaces he had touched.<br><br>He told his terrified victim that he was destroying evidence so he could not be traced.<br><br>Before he fled in a pick-up, he also told her he was a Malaysian and was leaving Singapore immediately.<br><br>The victim is now fearful of men and has became quiet and withdrawn, said Dr Bernardine Woo, a consultant psychiatrist with the Child Guidance Clinic, who assessed her.<br><br>She added that the traumatic experience could lead to problems with interpersonal relationships and intimacy later in the victim's life.<br><br>Despite his attempt to wipe away evidence, Ser left fingerprints at the scene which led police to his identity as he had previous convictions for theft.<br><br>But before the police could track him down, Ser struck again on 11 Nov.<br><br>This time, he gained entry by pretending to ask for someone.<br><br><strong>COINCIDENCE</strong><br><br>Coincidentally, the name he used, Xiao Chen, belonged to a previous occupant of the rented apartment.<br><br>He then attacked the woman, 20, who let him in.<br><br>He dragged her to the toilet where he strangled her till she fainted.<br><br>He then raped her.<br><br>While she lay unconscious on the bathroom floor, he went to her room and took her handphone and $50 before going to another bedroom where her flatmate, 22, was asleep.<br><br>He crept up and strangled her. She was jolted awake and struggled. She then bit one of Ser's fingers till it bled.<br><br>After subduing her, Ser bandaged his finger, then tore off part of the bedsheet and tied her hands to the wooden pole of the bed.<br><br>He then returned to the toilet where the first flatmate had regained consciousness.<br><br>Ser choked her till she fainted again, then violated her with a toothbrush.<br><br>After this, Ser returned to the bedroom where his other victim was tied up.<br><br>He told her he had killed her flatmate before raping and sodomising her. He also forced her to perform oral sex on him.<br><br>Ser was arrested in Geylang a day after he attacked the two women.<br><br>The 20-year-old, a virgin before the attack, blamed herself for letting Ser into the apartment.<br><br>Dr Joshua Kua, a consultant psychiatrist with the Institute of Mental Health, noted how she had felt that life was meaningless, although she was not actively suicidal.<br><br>Now, she startles whenever someone opens the door suddenly. She also avoids going to the toilet when she is alone at home.<br><br>Dr Kua noted that she has developed an adjustment disorder with depressed mood as a result of the brutal assault.<br><br>Her flatmate now suffers from post-traumatic stress and major depressive disorder, said Dr Kua in his report.<br><br>She has recurrent and distressing recollections of the traumatic event.<br><br>She dreamt about the brutal incident despite moving out of the apartment where the rapes took place.<br><br>NIGHT TRAUMA<br><br>When night falls, she shivers in fear as she lies on her bed and has difficulty falling asleep.<br><br>She is socially withdrawn, has lost her appetite and weight, and is also afraid of taking the lift alone and avoids bathing when she is alone at home.<br><br>She also panicked and ran when she saw a man she thought was her attacker.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Careless because S'pore feels so safe<br><br>SLEAZY, scumbag, shameless and beast.<br><br>That's what some China women who live in Balestier are calling serial rapist Ser Eng Siong.<br><br>The 33-year-old Singaporean had raped three China women living in the area last year.<br><br>Miss Ice Chen, who lives near one of the victims, was shocked to read about how Ser had entered the homes of his victims so easily.<br><br>Said the 22-year-old student in Mandarin: 'Many China women feel that Singapore is a safe country with a low crime rate. Maybe that's why they opened their doors to the rapist so easily.<br><br>'Furthermore, the rape took place in the morning when most people would not be on their guard.'<br><br>Miss Chen, who is from Hangzhou, added that she probably would have done the same.<br><br>She chose to stay in the Balestier area after noticing the high number of Chinese nationals there.<br><br>The rent in Balestier is considered cheap for its accessibilty to town.<br><br>The area is also well-known for its good food and many eateries which remain open till the wee hours.<br><br>Another Chinese national, who wanted to be known only as Xiao Shan, felt that Balestier is not as 'complicated' as Geylang.<br><br>The 29-year-old who works here as a nurse has also read about Ser in the newspapers.<br><br><strong>WARNING</strong><br><br>She said in Mandarin: 'The incident serves as a warning to us not to open doors to strangers.<br><br>'In fact, we had all been told that since young.<br><br>'I've noticed how some women sleep with their windows open. Maybe their apartments do not have air-conditioning. That can invite unwanted attention.'<br><br>She added: 'Nowadays, I would check that I've locked all the windows and doors before I sleep.'<br><br>Added her friend Xiao Xiao, 20, a student: 'I am glad that the rapist has been caught and put behind bars.<br><br>'Or else I would still be living in fear after what he did to his victims.'<br><br></div>
