            <div class='col-md body'><span class="small"><strong>This happened to a girlfriend of mine who used to stay at the New York Hotel when she has business trips to Johor Bahru. It was rumoured that New York Hotel, Johor Bahru had a suicide case a few years back where a girl killed herself in one of the New York Hotel room.</strong></span><br><br>I used to travel a lot with during my previous job and that included Johor Bahru where my company would book a room with the New York Hotel. Me and my other 2 male companions knew about the suicide case that happened not long and always cautioned the New York Hotel staffs not to put us at that particular floor where it happened (I forgot if it was the 13th or 15th floor, letÂ’s just assume that it was the 13th floor). I would always stay at the non smooking floor which would be located on the 15th floor and above whereas my other 2 male colleagues would stay at the smooking floors.<br><br>Nothing really happened at everytime I stayed at the New York Hotel, that is, until that particular day. It was like any ordinary day and it did not occur to me the slightest when it happened. Co-incidently, I was taking the lift back to my room. Usually, I would be accompanied by my collegeagues but so happen that day, they could not accompany me and I decided to walk back to the h0tel room by myself. I pressed the number to my hotel room floor and the lift started to move upwards. As sudden as it seemed, the lift stopped at the floor where the suicide case took place. I thought nothing of it and waited for the lift doors to close. I have to admit that I was kind of puzzled when the lift suddenly stopped at the floor without any warning. That was not the only thing puzzling me, there was no one at that floor at that particular time! I shrugged it off as perhaps it was just some naughty kids playing with the lift buttons.<br><br>I pressed the close button again and again but the lift doors just wouldnÂ’t budge. I gave up and thought that maybe it was malfunction (it was a pretty common thing) and decided to walk to the 2nd lift that was located on the other side of the building. I have to briefly explain that this hotelÂ’s design is pretty funny. There are 2 lifts and both lifts are located on either side of the building separated by a long corridor of rooms.<br><br>So, bravely here I was walking along the corridors. I was just looking around at the hotel room doors, Â“Room 134Â…Â”, Â“Room 136Â…Â”, Â“Room 138Â…Â” then suddenly, something stopped me. I was staring at a locked room. I mean really locked. I couldnÂ’t recall whatÂ’s the room number but it was obvious that the room was locked from public because the rooms all had eye hole except for this room! Not only that, the slit which was used to slot the card key was sealed and there was no door knob! It suddenly hit me that instant. Could it be the room that the girl committed suicide? I thought no further and quickly walked to the 2nd lift.<br><br>As the 2nd lift came to my rescue, I quickly stepped into the lift and pressed the floor number to my hotel room. As the door closed, the lift was suddenly jammed. It would neither move up or down as I pressed the Â“GÂ” button. I panicked and pressed the Â“OpenÂ” button but the door did not budge. As I pressed the emergency button, I couldnÂ’t help but to feel little goosebumps running down my spine. I was stuck for a whole 5 minutes. By the time someone answered my distress call and fixed the problem, I was fuming with anger.<br><br>By the time the lift got to the lobby, I made it a point to complain to the hotel manager about their service. To my shock, the hotel manager told me that they immediately responsed to my emergency call but no one answered for the first few minutes. As for me, I was pretty sure that it took practically a few minutes for someone to answer the call.<br></div>
