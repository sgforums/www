He has since recovered 95 per cent of his vision.<br><br>He added in a voice raspy from having the chair leg pass through his throat: 'I feel all right at the moment, actually, but I am too weak for work.'<br><br>Earlier this week, Peart pleaded guilty to a charge of negligently causing serious injury. He was sentenced to 400 hours of community service and will be monitored by corrections officers for two years.<br><br>Magistrate Peter Reardon said Peart was lucky that Mr El-Fahkri survived the attack.<br><br>He said: 'It's a blessing in a sense this young man was not killed or really seriously harmed. It might be a wake-up call for you that there are worse-off people than yourself.'<br><br>Mr El-Fahkri holds no grudges against his attacker.<br><br>'I forgive him, totally,' he told The Age.<br><br></div>
