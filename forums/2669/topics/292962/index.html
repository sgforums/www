            <div class='col-md body'>I once rented an apartment.<br><br>The rental for this apartment was unbelievably cheap, but yet I rented it. After staying there for sometime, I noticed the neighboring people started looking at me in a funny manner. Some were even whispering behind my back. I felt curious. Finally one day I got hold of the guard and asked him for answers.<br><br>He told me: "Before you moved in, there lived a couple in the apartment.<br>They were very loving, but one unsuspecting night the couple had a big argument, after that night the girl was never seen again. The guy vanished as well after having the apartment renovated."<br><br>The neighbours noticed that the guy would always scrub the walls late at night.<br>They suspected that the gal had been murdered by the guy and was buried inside the wall. After hearing the story, I felt my spine tingling.<br><br>Upon returning to my dwelling, I searched the place thoroughly, finally I sat on the bed and noticed and peculiar wet spot on the wall. It looked more and more like a human shape, and the position the shape was in appeared to be a person trying to struggle out of there. I was so terrified that I went directly to bed.<br><br>I had a dream in the middle of that night, I dreamt the couple were having a big argument.<br>And in his rage, the guy strangled the gal to death, he later buried the corpse inside the wall.<br><br>I saw the gal's eyes were bleeding terribly, struggling inside the wall and screaming: "Let me out! Let me out!!!!" I was so terrified that I awoke from my sleep, I couldn't stand it anymore and so I started drilling at the wall with a modified drill.<br><br>I finally made a small hole in the wall, after which I saw a pair of eyes staring at me.......<br><br>Oh my god, so it was true afterall......<br><br>Suddenly the pair of eyes turned into a mouth and started talking:<br><br>Hey neighbour, why are you making a hole in my wall!!?</div>
