She was not allowed to enter the hall and had to sleep on the cold kitchen floor and, at times, in the chicken coop.'<br><br>FORCED TO STOP SCHOOL<br><br>Her brother, 9, was forced to stop school. He was then made to pluck vegetables from a farm in Kluang, Johor and handle hazardous fertilisers.<br><br>In the evening, he cleaned a temple near his grandmother's house.<br><br>The children were even deprived of food and had to survive with a meagre half-a-cup of coffee for breakfast, and one meal a day, which consisted of spoilt food.<br><br>Bearing with their pain and suffering, the children often went to bed crying and prayed that someone would come to rescue them from their misery.<br><br>They were rescued on 18 Apr when a teacher at the girl's school discovered their plight and alerted their mother.<br><br>Immediately, their mother picked her up and took her to the hospital.<br><br>The police rescued the boy on that night itself.<br><br>The children had been living with their paternal grandmother in Paloh, Johor since their father's death two years ago.<br><br>Their mother lives 120km away in Masai.<br><br>Kluang police chief Assistant Commissioner Fawzi Arshad said the rescue team, led by Chief Inspector You Swee Ling, had also detained the grandmother for questioning.<br><br>'We are compiling statements on the abuse suffered by the children,' said MrFawzi.<br><br>Mr Deva said the bureau was arranging for the children to continue their education in a Tamil school in Johor Baru and arranging a better paying job for the mother who is now a babysitter.<br><br></div>
