            <div class='col-md body'>Human beings are a bunch of intelligent animal. We are so intelligent<br>that we can cook, eat, work and are thinker. We have questions. Egg<br>first or chicken first? Does God really exist. Many questions but some<br>questions would never have an answer. So are we really that<br>intelligent?<br><br>If God really exist, i wish i could ask him why am i here to suffer?<br>Didn't we were taught that we are to go through punishment in the hell<br>for all the sinful things we had done in life before we get to reborn<br>again? If that is true, shouldn't i says my sin has been purified? If is<br>true that i've been purified and is sinless now, why am i here to<br>suffer? Isn't it true that i should be get started refresh. If God really<br>exist, shouldn't i says i would be in the heaven and not here again? I<br>know no one can answer these questions. I wish i would never here. i<br>know i can't change the fact. All because of a man that played in a rain<br>without a raincoat and as a result, the woman got pregnant. The baby<br>inside is me. And you know what, i never get to see the man. To make<br>the matter worst, i was sent to my grandmother when i was juz a baby<br>because my mum need to work and has no time for me.<br><br>My childhhood life was very care-free becos my grandmother is a<br>addicted gambler and therefore she spent most of her time on a<br>manjong table than me. When she is happy and have some money to<br>spend, she would buy many taoist statues home to worship them for<br>better luck. But if she lost heavily, she would sweep them all away and<br>leave them under a tree in our apartment block below instantly. Maybe<br>becos of what she did, the retribution actually comes to me. :cry3:<br><br>If you are old enough like me, you may still remember that during the<br>early 80's, some of the lifts on the ground floor in the HDB were<br>installed with CCTV and a small TV set would be installed outside the lift<br>for people waiting outside to see the activity inside the lift car. That was<br>to curb lift robbery. I was once waiting for the lift at my block below and<br>i saw someone inside the lift coming down. But, when the lift car<br>opened, there was nothing inside. I was too young to feel frighten then.<br>I didn't bother to tell anyone becos i don't have anyone to talk to and no<br>one would bother me. However, things get worst after sometimes. I start<br>hearing someone talking to me so i answered them back. But people<br>around me says i am crazy 'siao'. It was only after one of my<br>grandmother manjong kakis brought me to a temple that saved me for<br>awhile. I was told that my body was possessed with spirit. And that they<br>can ward it off but the solution is only temporary. Becos my body is<br>sort of weak and it can be possessed by the spirit easily. The long term<br>solution is, i have to get a master which is a deity to possess on me,<br>another word means i have to be a medium so that the stateless spirit<br>cannot own my body. :devil2:<br><br>We went through numerous times of unsuccessful trance before i was<br>finally possessed by Qian Shou Qian Yen Guan Yin. the god of mercy<br>with thousand hands and thousand eyes. i was 17 then and i went thru<br>juz only primary education. But surprisingly, i could read chinese poem<br>without script and write chinese graphy very well like a pro.<br><br>Behind every successful temple is always women. With the helps of the<br>mouth of the manjong aunties, words of our temple spread very fast n<br>wide. Many visitors came to our temple juz to take a closer glimpse of<br>me possessing the rare Qian Shou Qian Yen. Some visitors were<br>purely Buddhists. They were there juz to seek direct enlightenment<br>from the guan yin. Many whom are also very young professional. The<br>temple were usually so crowded that peoples were so closed to me and<br>i could feel their existance even when they are standing behind my<br>back becos they were blocking my thousand hands movement. Of<br>course, they were not doing it intentionally becos they can't actually<br>see my virtual hands. Only i can feel it. :freakedout:<br><br>However, i feel very tired everytime after i detrance becos the load of<br>the thousand hands were so heavy for me. It was very stressful for a<br>young little girl like me. How many times or how many years do i have<br>to go thru this? I'm only 17. I decided to quit after few months becos i<br>cant take the stress in my body anymore. :disgust2:<br><br>With little education, i found a job as a waitress in a music pub. With<br>little family bonding, i felt love for the first time easily. With little<br>knowledge of evil in man (i mean some men) i fall unreservedly for him.<br>juz when i thought the weather is fine for the day, it rain and we went<br>without any raincoat. I got pregnant. i was not ready for this. Thus, i<br>got the baby aborted. :runnynose:<br><br>to be cont...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>part 2 - A gal name annie<br><br>Not only that my physical body is pain due to the abortion, my heart is<br>also very painful. Juz when i'm down and am in need of his love and<br>support at this time, the mother's son of a bitch aborted me. :cry3:<br><br>Why does this have to happen to me?<br><br>My mother re-married to a man whom is a Christian. And she has<br>since baptised and is now a Christian too. She invite me to live with her<br>so that i could continue to enjoy the home cooked food. I started to feel<br>the family bonding and love after all these years. I getting more mature<br>and the invisible wound in me also started to heal soundlessly. Than, i<br>met John in my working place. Although John doesn't have a stable job<br>and income but he always there for me. Waiting for me in a quiet<br>corner in my working place everynight just to see and send me home.<br>He shower me with alots of love i missed from my previous love. His<br>sincerity also touches me deeply. Soon, our love blomson very fast like<br>a bullet train. :love4:<br><br>Financially, John is a poor chap. He has no bright future. But he can<br>give me alot of love and care i have been lacking of since i was young.<br>So, i dont mind giving him all i have in exchange for unlimited love i<br>always wanted. I started paying for his everything. From his<br>handphone bill to his football gambing debts. I dont mind doing that<br>becos money is not important to me. But, i was wrong again. Due to<br>the nature of my job, i met many male customers. John started to feel<br>insecure and he feel worried that i might leave him for someone better<br>and therefore he plant black magic on me so that i would be in control<br>by him. He used the spirit of my aborted child to control me whenever<br>i'm not with him. I would feel sick, restless and moody. But when i get<br>back to him, i feel energetic. Is weird but no one feel anything amissed<br>in me. As such, this thing was dragged for sometimes untill finally the<br>sky opened it eyes for me. Â“VÂ—L ÂŠÃ¡!<br><br>Peoples around me started to realise that i sometimes talked to myself.<br>As for me, i know i was not talking to myself. I was talking to a boy. I<br>always see him around. Sometimes playing by himself, sometimes<br>come near to me and therefore we talks. For this, my family sent me to<br>the Woodbridge hospital again. I scolded the nurses there for<br>restraining me. I struggle to break free from them and thus, they tight<br>me up and isolate me in a pole bed. My mother and her family are<br>Christian and therefore question like spirit and black magic would never<br>come into her mind. They thought i was too stressful with work. It was<br>my cousin that saved me. My cousin is a Buddhist. There was once<br>when she was in the hospital visiting me, she saw me talking to<br>someone she cant see but my eyes was looking down. She suspect<br>that it is a child spirit talking to me. Quickly, she recalled that i had a<br>history of abortion. As a Buddhist herself, she also believing that child<br>spirits would continue to stay within their mother if ritual for them to re-<br>incarnation is not done after abortion. (Chinese believe that once a<br>foetus is formed in a woman, it has heartbeat, it has life. That's why,<br>the age starts counting from the month the woman got pregnant and<br>that explained why every Chinese age is added with one more year<br>above the date of birth) :runnynose:<br><br>With the help of my cousin, the hospital staff was cooperative enough<br>to let me discharged to seek consultation from a medium. By<br>appointment, we went to Dua Ya Tua with my mother. Dua ya was<br>firmed tat the child spirit i saw and talked to was a result of black<br>magic. The child spirit is harmless but i need to do 3 years of ritual for<br>him so that he can be directed back to where he came from and also a<br>chance for reincarnation. For now, Dua Ya Pek has since broke the<br>spell and instructed the child spirit to stay outside the temple and he will<br>bring him back with him after the session. My mother was beside me.<br><br>She asked " i saw black image in our home too, was that the child?"<br>Dua ya says " what is your date of birth, let me check for you".<br>She replied "cannot, my religion dont believe this".<br>Dua ya than answered "then why you asked???"<br>She stucked! :disgust2:<br><br>When i stepped out of the temple, i saw the child standing at a corner<br>mean for the wandering soul beside the temple. I took a glance for the<br>last time. I had not only removed his foetus in me, i had also removed<br>his chance of reincarnation mecilessly. What i cant removed from him<br>is his sadness. I wanted to say sorry to him but i dare not to. I know it<br>would not help ease his pain. I will repay by performing 3 years of<br>ritual for him. I know that is not enough but that is what i can do for him<br>for now. I sincerely hope all the young people out there don't do what i<br>have done so as not to be lived with only regretful. :cry3:<br><br>the end...</div>
