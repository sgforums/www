            <div class='col-md body'>This is a good one, and timely. Please read this all the way to the<br>end<br><br>I have a friend who lives by a three-word philosophy: Seize the moment. Just<br>possibly,<br>she may be the wisest woman on this planet. Too many people put off<br>something that brings<br>them joy just because they haven't thought about it, don't have it on their<br>schedule, didn't know it was<br>coming or are too rigid to depart from their routine. I got to thinking one<br>day about all those women<br>on the Titanic who passed up dessert at dinner that fateful night in an<br>effort to cut back.<br>From then on, I've tried to be a little more flexible. How many women out<br>there will eat at home<br>because their husband didn't suggest going out to dinner until after<br>something had been thawed? Does the<br>word "refrigeration" mean nothing to you? How often have your kids dropped<br>in to talk and<br>sat in silence while you watched Jeopardy! on television? I cannot count the<br>times I called my sister and<br>said, "How about going to lunch in a half hour?" She would gasp and stammer,<br>"I can't. I have clothes on<br>the line. My hair is dirty. I wish I had known yesterday, I had a late<br>breakfast, It looks like rain.<br>And my personal favorite: -"It's Monday". She died a few years ago. We never<br>did have lunch together.<br>Because Americans cram so much into their lives, we tend to schedule our<br>headaches. We live on a sparse<br>diet of promises we make to ourselves when all the conditions are perfect:<br>We'll go back and visit the grandparents when we get Stevie toilet-trained.<br>We'll entertain-when we<br>replace the living-room carpet. We'll go on a second honeymoon when we get<br>two more kids out of college.<br><br>Life has a way of accelerating as we get older. The days get shorter, and<br>the list of promises to<br>ourselves gets longer. One morning, we awaken, and all we have to show for<br>our lives is a litany of<br>"I'm going to," "I plan on" and "Someday, when things are settled down a<br>bit." When anyone calls my<br>'seize the moment' friend, she is open to adventure and available for trips.<br>She keeps an open mind on new ideas.<br>Her enthusiasm for life is contagious. You talk with her for five minutes,<br>and you're ready to trade<br>your bad feet for a pair of Rollerblades and skip an elevator for a bungee<br>cord.<br><br>My lips have not touched ice cream in 10 years. I love ice cream. It's just<br>that I might as well apply<br>it directly to my hips with a spatula and eliminate the digestive process.<br>The other day, I stopped<br>the car and bought a triple-Decker. If my car had hit an iceberg on the way<br>home, I would have died happy.<br><br>Now...go on and have a nice day. Do something you WANT to ......not<br>Something on your SHOULD DO list.<br><br>If you were going to die soon and had only one phone call you could make,<br>who would you call and<br>what would you say? And why are you waiting?<br><br>Make sure you read this to the end; you will understand why I posted this to<br>you.<br>Have you ever watched kids playing on a merry go round<br>Or listened to the rain lapping on the ground?<br>Ever followed a butterfly's erratic flight<br>Or gazed at the sun into the fading night?<br>You better slow down<br>Don't dance so fast<br>Time is short<br>The music won't last.<br>Do you run through each day on the fly?<br>When you ask "How are you?"<br>Do you hear the reply?<br>When the day is done,<br>Do you lie in your bed<br>With the next hundred chores<br>Running through your head?<br>You'd better slow down<br>Don't dance so fast<br>Time is short<br>The music won't last.<br>Ever told your child,<br>We'll do it tomorrow<br>And in your haste, not see his sorrow?<br>Ever lost touch, Let a good friendship die<br>'Cause you never had time to call and say "Hi"?<br>You'd better slow down<br>Don't dance so fast<br>Time is short<br>The music won't last.<br>When you run so fast to get somewhere<br>You miss half the fun of getting there.<br>When you worry and hurry through your day,<br>It is like an unopened gift....Thrown away...<br>Life is not a race.<br>Do take it slower<br>Hear the music<br>Before the song is over.<br><br>It is the true story of a little girl who will<br>soon leave this world, as she has been a victim of a serious and fatal form<br>of cancer.<br><br>she wanted to tell everyone to live his or her life to the fullest, since<br>she never will.<br>She'll never make it to her prom, graduate from high school, or get married<br>and have a family of her own.</div>
