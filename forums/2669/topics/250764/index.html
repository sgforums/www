            <div class='col-md body'>In what most people would rather describe as a one-in-a-million possibility, the coming together of Mr. and Mrs. Maxwell Nwokeji was concluded within two days. But it took another two years to come to reality thus making what would have been the fastest marriage on record take another 24 months to materialize.<br><br>No thanks to the objections raised by some of the brideÂ’s brothers who felt that the husband-to-be does not possess the type of background that is befitting for the kind of man they wish for their sister.<br><br>However, by divine providence the man did not give up, not even after his heartÂ’s desire was ferried to an unknown place for a period of one year.<br><br>Today, they are happily married and blessed with three lovely kids.<br>According to Mrs. Nwokeji, her husband is today the best in-law all members of her family are very proud of.<br><br>In this chat, the couple talked about the events that led to their marriage and how they are coping as a family.<br><br>How we met<br>We met in 1988. Then she was staying at a place that was close to where I did my business. One fateful morning as I was heading to my office, I saw her for the first time. Immediately something in me started prodding me to talk to her or call her attention but that was not possible because I did not know her name.<br><br>At that point so I was very disturbed because if I call her attention what would I tell her or what if she snobs me. After a while, I decided to go on my way and throughout that day I was not myself. Even though I had made enquiries about where she lives, I decided to tarry till the next day. As soon as it was day break the next day I went near their building to enquire about her. I went into a shop where we usually take soft drinks in that vicinity, I met a young girl from whom I enquired from for her name,. The girl innocently told me. Immediately I scaled this first huddle, I thanked her and left. She wanted to know the reason behind my probing I told her that there was no problem.<br><br>From that moment, I started having this feeling I never felt before. It was a feeling that I was going to get married soon to her. All these while, I had not approached her. It took another week before I summoned the courage to face her and as God designed it I was driving past her street. Again, I saw her walking down the road.<br><br>So I stopped, I called her by her name and immediately she turned and was surprised because she had never seen me before. She calmly asked me Â‘but who are you?Â’ And I told her donÂ’t worry I will tell you later. When I said Â‘I will come to your houseÂ’ she said Â‘ah you know my house?Â’ Then I reassured her that I would come to her place to make myself clear to her. She agreed and went on her way.<br>In the evening of the same day I went back to her house. I was afraid to go into their residence because none of her relative knew me.<br><br>I decide to hang outside and fortunately she came out at about that time and granted me an audience, and from that day it took another two years before I succeeded in getting her to be my wife. I must say that I was convinced from the first day that I wanted her for marriage and nothing else.<br><br>What I told her the first day<br>Because I was convinced beyond all doubts what I wanted, I simply said to her Â‘Lady, it is already late this evening and I will not like to take much of your time, I see you as a mature lady and it is of no use telling you words in parables, my spirit has told me to approach you for marriage and I made up my mind to approach you this way, because I want to marry you.Â’<br><br>She asked me, do you know me? I said well it takes someone but a day to meet or know a person. So, since I have mentioned your name and have come this far, all I expect from you is to make enquiries about me. I told her all about myself and told her that before she make up her mind, she should investigate my background especially the morality of the family I come from and all those other things that are important in Ibo land.<br><br>She thought about it for a while and told me that before any other thing that I should come and see her mum and we parted ways for that night.<br><br>The next evening I went straight to their place. This time I did not panic, I just walked in straight and asked for the person I was looking for. I finally met the mother and she received me quite well and then asked me Â‘Young man who are you?Â’ So I told her that I came for her to give her daughter to me in marriage. She asked a few other questions, and then she said to me that all human beings are one and it was really of no use asking a person where he or she comes from.<br><br>She said the most important thing to know is whether the person is of good character and honest. If you fall into this category then I assure you that I will give you my daughter to marry. But we must make enquiry about you first, as is customary. So for a whole year they were investigating me kind of, and I was patient.<br><br>The obstacles, the triumph<br>While I was waiting, the elder brother sent for me and told me to forget about the marriage. He said that his sister was still in school and all that. I told him that I had heard what he said but I told him that I was ready to wait for her for even five years or more. It is only if the marriage is not the will of God that it would fail to materialize.<br><br>For another one year, I did not get to see her again from that day.<br>It was a terrible period for me but I kept faith. About a year after, her mum sent for me and told me Â‘well young man we have finished our investigations and if you said you want to marry my daughter, the door is open you are free to start the process. I could not hide my joy and from that moment I started the marriage process from and later we wedded in the church and since then we have been living happily ever after.<br><br>I can proudly tell you that if marriage is what I am getting then I encourage young men and ladies to hurry into it. It is very honorable and sweet especially when there is understanding between the two parties, when there is understanding love will then follow because understanding comes first before love.</div>
