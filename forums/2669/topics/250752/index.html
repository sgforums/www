Some fled screaming. Others had to be treated for shock.<br><br>A diner, Stuart McMahon, said: 'This guy came running in then charged into the kitchen, got a massive knife and started waving it about.<br><br>'Everyone was screaming and running out as he jumped on a table, and dropped his trousers.<br><br>'Then he cut it off. I couldn't believe it.'<br><br>Police arrived in a few minutes and restrained him with handcuffs. But it was not enough. They needed non-lethal gas to subdue him.<br><br>The detached organ was picked up from the restaurant floor and packed in ice before it was sewn back on its owner.<br><br>The Royal College of Surgeons confirmed that the re-attachment of his organ is the first such operation in the UK.<br><br>After controlling the blood loss, doctors had to repair the blood supply and reanimate the tissue by rejoining the arteries and veins under a microscope.<br><br>Top Italian plastic surgeon Dr Nicolo Scuderi said of the operating technique: 'We don't know how much sensitivity and function will be regained.'<br><br>The man was described as being in a stable condition in hospital on Tuesday.<br><br>Zizzi said the knife-wielder was thought to have no connection to the restaurant, AFP reported.<br><br>The chain said in a statement that staff had tried to stop him from entering one kitchen but he ran into a second one, picked up a knife and started his crazed rampage.<br><br>The diner remained shut on Monday for a clean-up operation.<br><br>The man will be assessed by psychiatrists following treatment for his wounds and is expected to be held under the Mental Health Act for his own safety.<br><br></div>
