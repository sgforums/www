            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="small">April 25, 2007       </span></span><br><br>ONLY a mother would understand the grief she felt losing her child.<br><br>Only a mother would understand the compassion she showed.<br><br>Debra Koh's mother spent hours at the canal near Bukit Batok praying for a miracle. The schoolgirl, 13, had been swept away by the rainwater that filled the canal.<br><br>She also wanted answers. How did a day of fun turn so tragic?<br><br>But there was no blame in her voice. No hysterics.<br><br>As naval divers searched for Debra, her mother was at the National University Hospital (NUH) visiting the other children who were with Debra on Sunday.<br><br>She was concerned for them. She wanted to be sure her daughter's best friend, Toh Shi Hui, also 13, was all right.<br><br>Debra and three other teens were at the canal next to Block 182 Bukit Batok West Ave8 at about 3.30pm on Sunday.<br><br>They were playing and when Shi Hui's bag, which they were tossing about, fell into the canal, they decided to retrieve it. There was a sudden downpour and they ended up taking shelter under a ledge in the canal.<br><br>But an unexpected torrent of water swept them away.<br><br>A teary Shi Hui told The New Paper: 'I felt guilty for not being able to save Debra, and I said sorry to her mum.<br><br>'But she ended up consoling me instead. She asked me not to blame myself. She told me that it was not my fault as it was an accident.'<br><br>She added: 'Debra's mum then told me to study hard and listen to my parents. She was crying when she said that to me. I told her I would and said sorry to her again.'<br><br>Debra's mother was accompanied by two friends when she visited the teenagers yesterday morning.<br><br>She was sobbing outside the teenagers' ward before asking to talk to Shi Hui. She left shortly after talking to her.<br><br>The four friends were on their way to their favourite hang-out - West Mall in Bukit Batok.<br><br>Shi Hui said: 'All of them had put their handphones in my bag. So when the bag dropped into the canal, all of us went down to retrieve it.'<br><br>DRIZZLING<br><br>It was drizzling when the four teenagers went into the canal.<br><br>After they retrieved the bag and checked their handphones, the rain started to get heavy.<br><br>'We then decided to take shelter in the canal.<br><br>'We were waiting for the rain to get lighter, but the water level started rising up fast. When we went in, the water was only ankle-deep. Soon the water had reached our knees.'<br><br>Shi Hui said they panicked and decided to run to the steps to climb out of the canal.<br><br>They had just reached the steps when a sudden gush of water swept all of them away.<br><br>Knowing that her friend could not swim, Shi Hui grabbed onto Debra by putting her arms around her shoulder.<br><br>'But she was panicky and started flapping her arms and kicking her legs. I told her to stop kicking me and hold on to my waist,' Shi Hui said.<br><br>'The water was flowing very fast and soon I lost sight of Alson and Kim Weng. At this time, Debra was crying out, 'How? Save me, save me!'.<br><br>'I tried to calm her down by telling her not to panic and to stop kicking me.'<br><br>The waters then washed Kim Weng,14, towards the two girls. He knew how to swim and tried to help Shi Hui by grabbing onto Debra.<br><br>Shi Hui said: 'But Debra, who was trying hard to keep afloat, started to kick Kim Weng in his face and he went underwater.<br><br>'I panicked and dived in to grab Kim Weng up with one hand while my other hand was still holding onto Debra.<br><br>'But not long after I surfaced, I felt Debra loosening her grip on me. I heard her say 'save me' weakly, and then we both lost our hold on each other.'<br><br>Shi Hui said she turned back to look and saw Debra floating on the water face up. Her face was pale and her eyes were closed.<br><br>'That was the last I saw of her. I could not go back to her as the water was pushing me forward,' she said.<br><br>Shi Hui and Kim Weng then held onto each other for about half an hour.<br><br>She said she was already out of breath and tired when they saw what appeared to be a rope hanging on the slope of the canal.<br><br>'I was close to giving up as I had no strength left. Then we saw the rope,' Shi Hui said.<br><br>RESCUED<br><br>Both of them grabbed the rope. They were subsequently rescued by a passerby and the police.<br><br>By then, they had been swept about 3.5km from where they first entered the canal.<br><br>Their other friend, Alson Chua, 13, had earlier climbed out of the gushing waters on his own by using some steps at the side of the canal.<br><br>He had been swept down the river for about 2km.<br><br>Alson, who also knew how to swim, told The New Paper that he was very scared as the water was coming at a very high speed.<br><br>'I couldn't breathe and it was difficult to swim in the strong current. I won't dare to go into a canal again,' he said.<br><br>All three teens were admitted to NUH for cuts and bruises. They were discharged yesterday afternoon.<br><br>They spoke animatedly to The New Paper when recalling their harrowing experience, but would fall silent at times.<br><br>Shi Hui said she and Debra were studying in Hillgrove Secondary but in different classes. They got to know the other two boys through mutual friends.<br><br>'When I stayed overnight at my godmother's place, Debra would sometimes spend the night there with me. We were as close as sisters,' she said.<br><br>Shi Hui has two elder sisters, but it was believed Debra was an only child.<br><br>Shi Hui said that she had just asked her godmother to buy Debra a similar pair of slippers like hers after Debra mentioned that she liked them.<br><br>Her godmother, who visited her in hospital yesterday, had the pair of new slippers for Shi Hui.<br><br>But it's too late now.<br><br>Police spokesman Danny Tan said Debra's body was recovered around 1pm yesterday from the waters near Sungei Pandan Bridge.<br><br>It is about 5km from where she was swept away.<br><br>At around noon yesterday, after learning that Debra's body was found, all three chatty teenagers turned quiet.<br><br>Shi Hui began weeping.<br><br>'She was my best friend...we got along so well. But now she's gone...'<br><br></div>
