They then send an SMS to the company for their accounts to be activated.<br><br>The investor said he believed that many of those who lost their money were civil servants, adding that they took part in the scheme when the deposits had grown to a sizeable amount.<br><br>George Town senior police officer Azam Abd Hamid said the police were aware of such a scheme but had yet to receive any report from those who had lost money.<br><br>He advised victims to lodge police reports if they have been cheated so that the case could be investigated.<br><br>The Securities Commission (SC) has issued an alert over more than 50 websites which promise quick returns with minimum investments and urged the public not to invest in them.<br><br>'These websites are not authorised or approved under the country's securities laws to deal in securities or whatever investments,' Mr Azam said.<br><br>A check by The Star found that buy-e-barrel was among the websites on the SC list.<br><br>The commission recently froze two bank accounts with RM1.6 million (S$706,000) in them and closed two websites said to be connected to a global Internet investment scam run by Cambridge Capital Trading.<br><br>Last week, the National Fatwa Council passed a fatwa forbidding Muslims from investing in shares over the Internet.<br><br>It said that such Internet schemes, which pay interest and guarantee a steady profit, are banned under syariah law.<br><br>Datuk Seri Najib has likened the online scams to those that took place some years ago.<br><br>He cited a case in 1992, when Osman Hamzah, a director and shareholder of Pestama Bhd, operated an illegal investment scheme that caused many people to lose money.<br><br></div>
