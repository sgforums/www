Mother says:</span></span><br><br><span class="small"><strong>May 02, 2007</strong></span><br><br>ALL she wanted was more time with her dad.<br><br>But now both father Mr Zhuang Rui'an (names in hanyu pinyin), 36, and daughter Zhuang Huiyan, 8, are dead after their motorcycle collided with a lorry in Muar on Saturday afternoon.<br><br>Both were dragged on the road with the bike. Mr Zhuang died on the spot. Huiyan (above) died in hospital from excessive bleeding about two hours later.<br><br>Huiyan only saw her father once every week or fortnight as he was working as a cook in Singapore.<br><br>While he was home over the weekend, Huiyan insisted he take her for her tuition class on his bike, her mother Mrs Lin Zhu, 34, told Malaysian daily China Press.<br><br>MISSED HER DAD<br><br>It was likely that Huiyan, who had pasted a photo of her father on their refrigerator, had missed him so much that she just wanted to spend some time with him.<br><br>Said Mrs Lin: 'Normally, Huiyan's grandfather drives her to tuition class. But last Saturday, she insisted that her father take her on his motorbike.'<br><br>Huiyan's granddad had taken care of her since she was 2 and they had a good relationship, added Mrs Lin.<br><br>She recounted tearfully that her daughter was still alive when sent to hospital by passers-by. While waiting outside the emergency operating room, she even heard Huiyan screaming in pain.<br><br>But all her hopes were dashed when Huiyan was pronounced dead at about 6pm.<br><br>HEARTBREAK<br><br>Said Mrs Lin in between sobs: 'When the doctor told me the worst, I rushed into the operating theatre and carried Huiyan in my arms. Blood came out from her mouth. My heart just broke.'<br><br>Mrs Lin added that her husband was a 'very nice guy and they never quarrelled during their 15 years of marriage'. Huiyan was the younger of their two daughters.<br><br>Huiyan was described as an 'obedient, intelligent and hardworking' girl, who always had good grades in school. As the youngest in the family, everyone doted on her.<br><br>But she was not pampered. The Primary 2 student did her own revision every day and seldom asks to go out to play.<br><br>During examination periods, she would also put in extra effort to ensure that she passed with flying colours. She was often seen studying till 1 or 2am.<br><br>Said Mrs Lin: 'Huiyan had been saving up to fulfill her dream of going to university. She wanted to be a scientist.'<br><br></div>
