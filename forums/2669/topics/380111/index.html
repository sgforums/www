              <p>Would you buy one?</p>
              <p>Some will, some haveThese are walls that have seen too much: blood, violence, innocent lives brutally snuffed out. But some S’poreans don’t mind living there. Just give it some new paint, they say</p>
              <p>THE ninth-storey unit at Block 114, Geylang Lorong 3, where a gruesome murder took place is now eerily empty.</p>
              <p>It was where factory supervisor Leong Siew Chor allegedly killed and cut up the body of China national Liu Hong Mei.</p>
              <p>That happened two months ago.</p>
              <p>Leong’s wife and his three children have since moved out of the flat, which had earlier attracted curious visitors after he was charged with the murder.</p>
              <p>Strangers had turned up looking for lottery numbers. Superstitious neighbours held prayers outside the flat, to ‘cleanse’ it.</p>
              <p>Will the flat be sold? Would anyone want to live there?</p>
              <p>In the same month that Ms Liu was killed, Madam Tan Chiang Eng, 39, was found dead in her Wellington Circle five-room flat in Sembawang.</p>
              <p>Her Indonesian maid, Rohana, has been charged with the murder.</p>
              <p>Painful memories and the publicity surrounding the case often force families to abandon homes where violent crimes have been committed.</p>
              <p>In at least two other cases, such flats have been put up for sale.</p>
              <p>On New Year’s Day last year, Mr Pay Boon Chye, 32, was burnt to death in his flat in Block 757, Woodlands Avenue 4, by his brother-in-law.</p>
              <p>The case was classified as murder but the suspect, Sim Swee Kee, 48, died in Malaysia after an asthma attack last March, while he was on the run.</p>
              <p>And in 2001, Madam Zaiton Abu Bakar, 45, was stabbed to death in her bedroom in Block 303, Canberra Road.</p>
              <p>The family members of Mr Pay and Madam Zaiton decided to sell their homes after the murders.</p>
              <p>Mr Pay’s family managed to sell their four-room flat last year after giving it a fresh coat of paint.</p>
              <p>A property agent helped them sell it to a family of four who have moved in.</p>
              <p>DIDN’T KNOW</p>
              <p>The current owner, who declined to be named, told The New Paper on Sunday that they did not know of the history of the flat before they bought it.</p>
              <p>They only heard about the murder from their new neighbours.</p>
              <p>‘Initially I was shocked and angry that the property agent and ex-owner did not tell us about it,’ said the owner.</p>
              <p>‘They should have been more transparent or they should have lowered the price of the flat. I paid quite a high price for it.</p>
              <p>‘But at the end of the day, I am happy with my new home. After I read about the owner’s plight in the newspapers recently, I do sympathise with her.’</p>
              <p>Madam Zaiton’s flat was sold two years after her death.</p>
              <p>Mr Ahmad (not his real name), a bachelor in his 40s, bought it from her daughter.</p>
              <p>‘I knew that the seller’s mother had passed away, but I didn’t know that she was killed violently in the flat,’ said Mr Ahmad who declined to be named as he does not want his colleagues to know about this.</p>
              <p>He moved into his new home last January.</p>
              <p>But far from thinking that the flat is spooked, Mr Ahmad regards it as his ideal home.</p>
              <p>‘I spent six months looking for a flat. I wanted a cheap unit on a high floor. This flat was clean and cosy and I like its layout,’ he said.</p>
              <p>‘I found the flat with the help of a property agent.’</p>
              <p>The price was $230,000, which was considered to be quite high at that time, added Mr Ahmad.</p>
              <p>He bought it anyway because he liked the flat the moment he stepped into it.</p>
              <p>‘But I wish the agent and ex-owner had been honest with me. At least I could have asked for the price to be lowered a little.</p>
              <p>‘I am not pantang (superstitious) so I would still consider buying it even if they had come clean with me.’</p>
              <p>Mr Ahmad added that his neighbours had not mentioned the murder when he chatted with them.</p>
              <p>If he should decide to sell the flat one day, would he tell prospective buyers of its dark history?</p>
              <p>‘Maybe I will,’ said Mr Ahmad.</p>
              <p>‘I am a good testimony (of its value) since I have been living here alone for almost two years and nothing has disturbed me.’</p>
              <p>——————————————————————————–</p>
              <p>Don’t ask, don’t tell</p>
              <p>Property agents say they won’t tell if you don’t ask</p>
              <p>TO tell or not to tell?</p>
              <p>Property agents whom The New Paper on Sunday spoke to had different views on whether to be upfront with potential buyers about deaths in the flats they sell.</p>
              <p>Said a property agent who wanted to be known as only Mr Koh: ‘If the potential buyers ask about the history of the flat, I will tell them. If they don’t ask, I usually won’t tell them too much.</p>
              <p>‘If we tell potential buyers about the murders or deaths that occurred in the flats, do you think they will still want to buy?</p>
              <p>‘We have to be fair to the owners as well. But if the buyers ask, we have a duty to tell.’</p>
              <p>He said buyers should do their own checks. One way is to ask the neighbours.</p>
              <p>‘Once, I had a buyer who withdrew from a purchase after he learnt from neighbours that the owner had died in the flat. In such situations, I usually convince the seller to return the deposit and let the buyers withdraw from the purchase.’</p>
              <p>Mr Koh, 38, who has been an agent for six years, said a colleague once lost a sale because he came clean.</p>
              <p>‘My colleague had taken a potential buyer to view a flat and the buyer was told that the owner had died recently. The buyer asked a family member of the owner how he died,’ recalled Mr Koh.</p>
              <p>‘The family member said the owner had hanged himself. That really scared off the buyer.’</p>
              <p>Mr Koh has not marketed any flat in which a murder had taken place. But he did sell two flats from which the owners had jumped to their deaths.</p>
              <p>He said: ‘Before I market such flats, I would burn joss paper to the deceased to tell him or her about the sale and to ask that the new occupants not be disturbed.</p>
              <p>‘I would also go to the temples to pray and seek guidance in the sale.</p>
              <p>‘Usually, I would advise the sellers to sell their flats below market value. This way, it’s easier to find buyers.’</p>
              <p>Mr David Cheang, 29, from PropNex Realty, has sold two units next to the flat where a Thai national, Madam Molee Sae Tuang, 54, and her husband, Mr Quek Swee Kia, 44, were murdered.</p>
              <p>ROBBERY GONE WRONG</p>
              <p>Madam Molee’s son, Somrata Sae-Tang, had plotted with two men to rob his mother and stepfather as he needed money to go to Hong Kong to meet a woman he had befriended on the phone.</p>
              <p>But his plan went wrong and his two accomplices ended up killing his parents.</p>
              <p>The bodies remained in the walkup apartment in Balestier Road for seven days till the smell drew the attention of neighbours.</p>
              <p>Somrata got 11 years in jail and the maximum 24 strokes of the cane for helping the two men, who are still at large, to commit robbery.</p>
              <p>Mr Cheang thinks that there are agents who would jump at the opportunity to market such flats when they learn about the murders from newspaper reports.</p>
              <p>This is because such flats are usually sold below valuation.</p>
              <p>‘Ethically, we should reveal the murders or deaths that occurred in the flats. I usually tell potential buyers whatever I know,’ said Mr Cheang.</p>
              <p>‘But sometimes the sellers try to hide the truth from the agents too.’</p>
