The other recipient has not been infected with the virus so far and is still alive, the panel said.<br><br>The deceased man tested negative for the virus before the transplant but was found to be positive shortly before his death, it said.<br><br>HARSH WORDS<br><br>Committee chairman Katashi Fukao, strongly criticised the transplants.<br><br>Said Mr Fukao: 'It was highly likely that the recipient got infected (with the hepatitis B virus) through the transplant.<br><br>'The transplant was fundamentally reckless and cannot be regarded as treatment.'<br><br>The report also concluded that all 20 cases in which diseased kidneys were removed for transplant by Dr Mannami, and 25 cases in which diseased kidneys were transplanted, were inappropriate.<br><br>Said Mr Fukao: 'The patient was an innocent victim of a transplant of a kidney that rarely functioned from the beginning. It was a transplant that should never have been carried out.'<br><br>Dr Mannami, 66, now a senior urologist at the Uwajima Tokushukai Hospital, said he thought infection would not occur at the time of the transplant.<br><br>He also said the patient died of severe pancreatitis, and insisted that the liver damage had no direct link to his death.<br><br>The controversy has prompted Japan's health ministry to review its guidelines on transplants of kidneys from sick patients.<br><br>Currently, transplants of kidneys harvested from dead donors who had cancer or hepatitisB are banned in Japan. However, there are no written rules concerning transplants from living donors.<br><br>In Singapore, doctors routinely screen donors for illnesses like hepatitis B and C, sexually transmitted diseases and HIV.<br><br>The Ministry of Health also introduced a formalised checklist of screenings and tests to be done on all potential donors in late 2003.<br><br>It covers dengue testing as well as the cause of any brain damage and checks for a history of cancer or recent suggestive symptoms. Any cancer, except primary brain cancer, automatically rules out a transplant<br><br></div>
