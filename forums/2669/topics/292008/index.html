            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i139.photobucket.com/albums/q311/roykhong/ufo_picture_2.jpg"><br>It is amazing how many UFOs come out in the day time. This UFO picture was taken in the early morning when a paper boy was doing his rounds in rural America. He just happened to have his camera with him so he took a few snaps but he knew nobody would believe the UFO picture he took. Hopefully he now knows that he isn't the only one that believes.<br><br><img src="http://i139.photobucket.com/albums/q311/roykhong/ufo_picture_8.jpg"><br>This UFO picture was discovered by a man when he was clearing out his parent's belongings after they died. To his best guess, the UFO picture would have been taken sometime in the early 1960's and looks like it was taken a few miles from his parent's home in Kentucky. He doesn't know the story behind the picture as nobody is alive to tell it but when he saw the UFO picture it was he was seeing. To do help himself keep the memory of his parents alive he scanned the picture and put it on the internet so that the whole world could see what his parents saw that night<br><br><img src="http://i139.photobucket.com/albums/q311/roykhong/ufo_picture_6.jpg"><br>UFO picture don't just happen in the United States. This UFO picture was taken on the hillside in Wales, United Kingdom. Proof that UFOs aren't just something that are seen in America. After all, the Earth is a big place and it makes sense that UFO pictures would surface from every corner of the globe.<br><br><img src="http://i139.photobucket.com/albums/q311/roykhong/ufo_picture_4.jpg"><br>This is another UFO picture that was taken in the 1960's. The quality of the UFO picture is a bit grainy but we can clearly see that the UFO is hovering over the tree line. According to the person that took the UFO picture, it stayed hovering in that position for nearly an hour before suddenly vanishing.<br><br><img src="http://i139.photobucket.com/albums/q311/roykhong/alienbaby.jpg"><br>The origins of this picture of a dead baby alien fetus are a mystery. It is obvious from the picture that a medical procedure had taken place but we aren't sure what happened for the baby alien to be dead and there aren't many clues in the alien picture. That said, it seems obvious that there was an adult alien carrying the fetus. What we really don't know is what happened to that adult alien. Perhaps it was already dead or maybe it was killed and the focus of an alien autopsy. Which ever we are happy that somebody there was brave enough to take a picture of the baby alien and send it to various alien believers.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i139.photobucket.com/albums/q311/roykhong/alien_picture_3.jpg"><br>This scary looking alien body was found in a cave in Brazil. It is interesting that its skull is shaped a bit differently than how we would normally think an alien would work. However, what it shows is that aliens come in as many different varieties as humans. Surely, there isn't just one planet the aliens are coming from so it makes sense that they wouldn't all look exactly the same. Personally, we think that makes the whole business of watching aliens all the more interesting and alien pictures more interesting too.<br><br><img src="http://i139.photobucket.com/albums/q311/roykhong/alien_baby_picture_1.jpg"><br>Alien babies aren't always pretty but then again human babies are a bit wrinkled and messy too. This alien baby picture is from the 1950's. Heavens only knows what was thought of the person that took this alien picture way back then but we are glad they were brave enough to pick up their camera and take a picture of the alien baby. We are even more glad that they were brave enough to make sure the picture made it into the public. We don't know what happened to this baby but we do hope it wasn't harmed in anyway but sadly, it probably wasn't treated very nicely.<br><br><img src="http://i139.photobucket.com/albums/q311/roykhong/dead_alien_picture_7.jpg"><br>Not all alien pictures of dead aliens are taken right after the alien has died. This picture is of the bones of a dead alien. Word has it that the alien's bones were found in the Andes but they weren't discovered by the outside world for years later. Once they were found somebody took an alien picture and then the bones were moved to a lab so that better research could be done.<br><br><img src="http://i139.photobucket.com/albums/q311/roykhong/dead_alien_picture_13.jpg"><br>The proof is starting to show that aliens have been visiting Earth for a very long time. This man in India discovered a skull which is clearly that of an alien that died sometime ago. Luckily, there was a camera around to have a picture of the alien head taken so that this discovery could be shared with the rest of the world. The Internet really is a beautiful thing that is bringing all of humanity closer together in our search for the truth of the universe.<br></div>
