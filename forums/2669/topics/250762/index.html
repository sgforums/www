            <div class='col-md body'>When little Vivian Enwere came to stay with her elder sister at the age of eight, she never knew that 12 years after, she would be making a return journey to the family as a wife. This is the story of how innocent childhood admiration ended up in marriage with Kelvin Ugorji.<br><br><strong>How we met</strong><br>I saw my wife when she was eight years old, without any instinct that she will be my wife. Then I was too young. She stayed with her aunty who happens to be my brotherÂ’s wife for five years, and I never saw her again for 12 years.<br><br>By 2005, I was matured for marriage and was contemplating settling down. In March 2005, she visited us at home. I was impressed with what I saw of her and her level of education, her first question to me was if I was married. This question took me back to when she stayed with us, and I held onto it.<br><br>In fact, that question kept on striking my mind after she had left. And as a man, I had to really think deep and at the end of the day, I became very convinced that God in His infinite mercy had shown me the bone of my bone and it is all left for me to make the next move.<br><br><strong>What I saw in her</strong><br>I saw a virtuous woman, a woman who is so close to God. In fact, the moment I saw her, every other person varnished from my mind and I heard a voice saying, this is your bone and the flesh of your flesh.<br><br><strong>The wife speaks Â…</strong><br>I remember with nostalgia the five years I spent with my auntie who was married into my husbandÂ’s family. The people received me with warmth and did not discriminate between their own children and every other child. They show genuine love to anyone that comes their way and I have always admired the members of the family and so, when 12 years later I discovered that Kelvin was single and searching, I did not hide my wish to be married into the family. When he proposed to me, I felt quite happy to accept because I know that we are going to make the best out of this union.<br><br><strong>The future</strong><br>The key to assured or secured future is hard work, determination, focus and proper planning with total faith and trust in God. I donÂ’t normally bother myself about tomorrow because I am always conscious of today. If you plan today very well, your tomorrow will be a walkover. The future is very bright and blissful for us because we are consolidating it today.<br></div>
