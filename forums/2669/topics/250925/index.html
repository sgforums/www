A couple in Kuala Lumpur is upset that a carjacker who took their 9-year-old daughter on a 3-hour terror ride had 'touched her'.<br><br>During the ordeal, the girl lost a tooth after being slapped for crying in the car. But she was let off several hours later near a factory in Shah Alam on Monday night.<br><br>Her mother, identified only as Madam Tan, 47, said her troubles began at around 7pm as she was driving back from her office at Taman Eng Ann to her house in Taman Sentosa.<br><br>She was driving out of a petrol station when a man wearing a helmet waved at her and pointed to her car.<br><br>Realising that the fuel cover was open, Madam Tan got out of her green Toyota Altis to close it. Just then, the man got behind the wheel and sped off, with her daughter in the back seat.<br><br>'I flagged down a four-wheel drive vehicle and we chased the culprit, but we lost him in the traffic,' said the part-time insurance agent.<br><br>She called her husband and the police.<br><br>Then, she remembered that her daughter had a handphone with her. She dialled her number and the man answered.<br><br>'I begged to him to let my daughter go and told him to take my handbag or whatever he wanted. But he was angry as there was only RM200 ($8<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> in my purse,' she recalled.<br><br>He then demanded RM100,000 for the release of her daughter, but Madam Tan said she didn't have the money.<br><br>Several hours later, her husband received a call saying their daughter had been found in Shah Alam.<br><br>The girl had been abandoned by the roadside and made her way to a factory nearby, where she got help from a security guard.<br><br>The first thing her husband asked their daughter was if the man had 'touched' her.<br><br>'I don't care about the car or whatever was inside. My only concern was her,' said Mr Tan.<br><br>The father of five was heartbroken when the girl said yes.<br><br>He told The Malay Mail: 'He is an animal! No one in his right mind would commit such a crime. My family and I are traumatised because of what he has done.<br><br>'My only wish is that he is caught soon. The animal should not be left free to roam the streets,' said Mr Tan.<br><br>Their daughter spent a night at Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital for observation and was discharged yesterday after counselling.<br><br>Police are looking for four men believed to be linked to two similar cases reported in the district in the past three days.<br><br></div>
