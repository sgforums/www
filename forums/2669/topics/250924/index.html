They are members of the school's music ensemble. Jane is also one of its members.<br><br>Students from the school who spoke to The New Paper on condition of anonymity said that Jane had allegedly been spreading malicious gossip about her seniors.<br><br>The group of six or seven seniors decided that Jane should 'settle scores' with them. They summoned her and demanded that she accept their terms. It is understood that Jane agreed.<br><br>The group met at a place outside the school and allegedly stripped and slapped her and recorded the incident on video. They also took pictures of the attack.<br><br>Jane thought the issue had been settled.<br><br><strong>THREATENING SMS</strong><br><br>But it got worse. She received an SMS from one of the older girls, threatening to post the video on YouTube if she didn't pay them money.<br><br>It is believed that Jane panicked at this point and made a police report for attempted extortion.<br><br>In an e-mail to The New Paper, the principal confirmed the incident and said that the school was aware that a police report was made.<br><br>The principal said: 'The welfare and well-being of our students is of utmost importance to the school. The students involved have been counselled, and their families informed.'<br><br>He declined to provide further details.<br><br>It is also understood that the school only knew of the incident after the police started their investigations.<br><br>A police spokesman confirmed that a report has been lodged and that investigations are ongoing.<br><br>Blog posts by some students involved alluded to the incident but did not include any specific details.<br><br>One student wrote: 'Recently, some things happened that involved us... Crying over spilt milk doesn't help much; you have to face the consequences.'<br><br>In the same blog post, the student wrote that the CCA's teacher-in-charge spoke about the incident to the students.<br><br>'She sounded like she wanted to cry, yet she was trying to control her tears,' the student wrote, describing her teacher.<br><br><strong>APOLOGY</strong><br><br>Another student involved apologised to her CCA mates on her blog for what had happened, mainly because the incident occurred just before an important performance.<br><br>She wrote: 'Sorry I made all of you cry. I didn't mean to do it.'<br><br>Most teachers from other schools whom The New Paper spoke to were not shocked by the incident. They said they knew of similar incidents, though these were not known to have been recorded on video.<br><br>Most such incidents, they said, start off as playful gestures.<br><br>Said a secondary school teacher, who wanted only to be known as<br><br>Mr Foo, 34: 'I know of male students who 'taupok' (pile themselves on top of) their classmates on occasions like birthdays. Sometimes, they strip their friends too.<br><br>'On one occasion, the student sprained his ankle.'<br><br>He added that students were increasingly filming such events because of the accessibility to handphone cameras.<br><br>'Sometimes, the students get carried away - they may not intend any harm.'<br><br>A junior college teacher, who declined to be named, said she knew of students who had hit a fellow student on the head with a bag on his birthday.<br><br>'They also do things like dunking their friends in the swimming pool, or in the pond, which can be quite dangerous at times,' she said.<br><br>Students The New Paper spoke to said that 'happy slapping' incidents are relatively common but are seldom serious enough to warrant police involvement.<br><br>Student Ailin Phua, 16, said that she has heard of several similar incidents.<br><br>She said: 'Usually, the school deals with the students, and usually the students are suspended. But they shouldn't get all violent - that's just asking for it.'<br><br></div>
