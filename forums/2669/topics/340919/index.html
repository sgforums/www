              <p>Hi all.</p>
              <p>I have been trawling several threads within SGFORUMS.
              Particularly enjoy the posts on people's encounters with the
              supernatural. Call them ghosts, spirits, hahauntingtc.</p>
              <p>What i am about to relate is a true account. It happened to me in 1991.</p>
              <p>I
              can't remember the month exactly, but i was still serving my full-time
              NS. My appointment by training is an infantry section leader. Which
              makes me a corporal. These days this rank is called "3rd Sergeant". The
              unit i was serving in was 2 SIR.</p>
              <p>It was the first evening of the
              battalion exercise. Most of the unit was outfield for exercise in the brunean
              jungles. Brunei is famous for its dense rain-forests. The tree tops are
              so high that they effectively cut off any moonlight. Making it
              pitch-black after dark..</p>
              <p>I was delegated to stay in camp with
              some of the calafare ( i.e Attn B and Attn C those guys with medical
              sick leave.. The only other NCO ( specialist ) with me was another
              corporal. Let's call him Corporal C. And i will be Corporal B.</p>
              <p>Lakuin  camp
              is rumoured to be built over cheap land. In this case, it was
              supposedly used to be a muslim burial ground. During our nightly RO (
              routine order) read out by that day's Duty Officer, he reminded us that
              if we needed to relieve ourselves. i.e urinate or shit. We should only
              do it in the toilet.</p>
              <p>For those of you who have not been to Lakun
              Camp. The barracks are built long. Almost entirely wooden, except for the tin roofs. They are
              designed with 2 exit points on either ends. Where there should be
              windows, instead it is just window frame without any cover,doors or
              shutters. Rain would be prevented by the fact that the an extra roof
              extends really low.The barrack is built a few feet off the ground.</p>

              <p>Image taken off Google image result.</p>
              <p>It
              was about the late afternoon, me and some of the men were
              bored. And you know what happens with idle minds. We began to think of
              crazy things to pass the time!</p>
              <p>Now the other NCO, Corporal C is a
              much stricter person than i am. I am the type more likely to dish out
              "canteen breaks" as opposed to Corporal C making the men help him clean
              the extra weapons :P  Needless to say. This made him less in favour
              amongst the men.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The hours went by and
              soon it was dusk. The blue hour when the skies durn dark cloudy and
              blue. The yellow lamp-posts were already turned on by then. I was in
              the barrack doing my own admin and i felt the urge to pee. So i walked
              down the wooden steps into the grass clearing by the side of the
              barracks. There were some of the men playing "Hide &amp; Seek". Yes!
              You heard me right. 18-20 year olds behaving like boys still playing
              this game! ha ha!. I felt lazy and decided to just walk towards the
              perimeter fence. The fence seperates the jungle and the bunk.</p>
              <p>Standing by the fence i unbuttoned my fly and wet the ground, letting out a
              satisfying "ahh" to myself. My field of vision was trained on the grass
              where my pee was directed at It was then that i noticed a shadow.
              It looked  like a man with both arms up over head ready to sneak
              towards me and give me a shock. Thinking i was the smarter guy
              discovering this person sneaking towards me, i quickly turned around to
              say "Boo!" to whoever this person was...</p>
              <p>But there was nobody
              behind me... "Hmmm". I thought to myself how strange this is. I turned
              back forward and button up my fly and walked back towards the barracks.
              I brushed this off as a trick of the mind. Although i could'nt help
              noticing the impossibility of that shadow. It couldn't have been the street-lamp simply because it would not create a shadow where i saw
              it. I brushed this off as a trick of the mind.</p>
              <p>Soon
              it was time to
              "Lights-off" so all the men were accounted for and we went to our
              double-decker beds to sleep. My bed was just next to the wall
              nearest to the main door. And i slept with  my
              feet facing the window. Only the monotonous sound of the ceiling fan at
              high-speed could be heard now. Creaking as well with every revolution.
              Soon i drifted to sleep. But it was not going to be a peaceful sleep for
              me..</p>
              <p>To my best recollection, i was asleep as i knew it. But
              suddenly i felt my body enveloped in a shivering chill. My ears felt
              like there was a wind blowing, sounded like the rush of air when you
              ride your bicycle downhill at high speed. I tried opening my eyes but i
              couldnt. I tried moving my limbs but i was paralysed. I felt like an Egytian Mummy!. My arms were stuck straight on both sides of my body and my legs
              lay straight. I felt awake and aware and all the while the "wind"
              blowing in my ears. I felt a silent terror like i never felt before.
              What is happening to me?!! "Help! Help!!" but no voice came forward. In my
              desperation i started reciting a prayer. Being Catholic i started
              praying "Our Father" and "Hail Mary". Imagine the expression on my face
              as in someone muttering the prayers hurriedly, with eyes tightly closed
              as if afraid of what was before me. I must have prayed for what lasted like ten minutes before i felt the
              prayers working... slowly...I felt the "wind" leaving me. It seemed to leave thru
              my head as i felt my body slowly able to move and the "blowing sound" on my
              ears just left. Like somebody just pressed "STOP". I opened my eyes and
              sat up. The feeling of fear had left me. It must have been the prayers.
              I felt at peace and very brave. Brave enough to scan the bunk around
              me. It was still dark except for some light coming thru the window. But
              bright enough that i could see the men were asleep.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>POST-ANALYSIS</p>
              <p>I
              shared my incident to some close friends when they came back from the
              exercise. No one could give me a conclusive answer on what happened. I
              did get reminders that the camp was built over a former muslim cemetery
              and that i should have gone to the toilet to pee.</p>
              <p>Maybe i offended the Muslim spirits" when i pee-ed on the fence, without saying "excuse me" or "sorry". Is Lakuin camp haunted?</p>
              <p>I read on other threads here that what i experienced could have
              been a condition called  " Sleep Paralysis ". If so, can anyone share
              if they too also heard that sound of "rushing wind" in the ears. It
              also sounds like someone was blowing air into your ears at close range.</p>
              <p>Since that incident i have encountered similar experiences, twice. In my home.</p>
