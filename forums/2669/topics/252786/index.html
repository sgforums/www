            <div class='col-md body'>US to file suit over 'rampant' piracy in China<br>May 06, 2007<br><br>DISNEYLAND is too far, reads the China theme park's slogan.<br>Their solution was to build a counterfeit Disneyland from scratch - complete with Cinderella's Castle, and everything else you see at Disney theme park's all over the world.<br><br>In this Beijing attraction, Shijingshan Amusement Park, you'll be able to find actors dressed in Mickey, Donald, Snow White and many other copyrighted characters.<br><br>And none of this is authorised by Disney.<br><br>This state-owned 'Magic Kingdom' has got the US fuming.<br><br>It announced that it would file a case at the World Trade Organisation over 'rampant' copyright piracy in China, a practice which US companies say deprives them of billions of dollars each year.<br><br>'WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?'<br><br>But 31-year-old housewife Zhang Li betrays a typical Chinese attitude on the issue while chasing her young son around the park.<br><br>'I don't understand why that is such a big problem. Shouldn't others be able to use those characters besides (Disney)?' she asks.<br><br>Her view is common in a country where lax societal and law enforcement attitudes toward copyright protection has seen the counterfeit goods industry become a key part of the national economy.<br><br>A US Congressional panel says China's own data suggests such goods account for 15 to 20 percent of goods made in the country.<br><br>Such numbers seem hard to dispute in Beijing, where one can spend a morning at an imitation Disney amusement park, have lunch at a KFC knock-off, shop for fake foreign-brand fashions in the afternoon and relax at night with a DVD of a Hollywood film that is still in the theatres in the US.<br><br>'Its part of living in China,' said Canadian businessman Brian Dugood while he was looking at fake Armani jackets at the Yashow Clothing Market.<br><br>'Why buy the original when you can get a pretty good copy at one-tenth the price?'<br><br>The US case could result in retaliatory trade measures on China but those may be easier to overcome than the task China faces in changing attitudes in a country where most consumers have little hope of affording legitimate DVDs.<br><br>Mr Lei Danni, who runs a small shop selling fake DVD and compact discs, brushes off accusations by US companies that his business hurts sales of legitimately-produced software.<br><br>'We aren't stealing from anyone. Most of my customers say they wouldn't buy the real thing anyway because its too expensive. So there is no connection.'<br></div>
