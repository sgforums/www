              <p> </p>
              <p>"...We went there in a group of about 7 person in 2 cars. Upon arriving the scene, the super star spotted the lady spirit standing inside the building staring at her from a distance. Base on what the super star description of her was, she was wearing all red. Yes, all red and look fiece!..."</p>

              <p>Eh, I don’t know whether is this the right forum to post but whatever it is, let the moderator direct me.<br>Actually I got this serious problem with me and I want to share, I sincerely hope I get a serious reply too…</p>
              <p>Here it goes, a couple of months back my girlfriend, myself and 3 of my friend were in a car spinning around S’pore as we were await for our midnight movies begin at 4am, It is about 12am so we have plenty of time.<br>1 of our friend suggest going to the old commando barracks to explore and find out if we see anything, the place is located somewhere near changi V. Even though, my gf felt a little relecutant, she felt she doesn’t want to trouble me by leavin my friend aside and be with her so she tag along.<br>When we get there nothing seems suspicious and we get out of the place after 10 mins.</p>
              <p>Then when I send her home in Jurong, I was riding a bike then, she claim that a lady in red was flying in the air and following us.<br>She was dressed in pure red like a cheongsam, a red colour high heel shoes, a strong red colour make up and a long red nails, basically everything was in red.</p>
              <p>Sometimes when we quarrel, she claim the lady in red was standing behind me and kept staring at me, thought I can’t see in my naked eyes but I believe what she says. The more my gf angry and shouting at me, the more fierce stare the lady in red is. I don’t know what her intention is but I seek advice on what I can do now or someone has a smiliar encounter.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I have read the story of sfogs , but its abit hard to swollow , sorry about that cos i have my reason , Im religious though , why i dont really belive is becos. When i was in sec 3 (!998) , me and my group of classmates from loyang sec(in paris ris) will go down to old changi hospital after school to play police and theif , and it will be like 2 or 3 times a week as it only take us 20min and 1 bus direct to O.C.H , And during the weekend we will all meet up at O.c.h at night to chill out , right outside the entrance , we even made good friends with a couple of Guards (which i realise now talk alot of bullshit) During our weekend night chill-out at o.c.h , we will just chill out talk cock and maybe drink one or two cans of beer and sometime we will invite a few low sec girls along with us , and play truth and dare with dare , And yeah it was also one of my first times looking at tits bare , only once in a while during night chill-out sessions will we play police and thief , Btw one of my fav place to hide is on-top the roof-top cos you have to go thru a very dark stairs up to the roof. Oh yah , Btw we were the first batch of ppl to wonder at o.c.h , Only after 3 months later den only outsiders started to come to O.C.H to explore , by then we had our fun . AND LASTLY , OUR GROUP OF CLASSMATES CONSIST OF INDIAN(Which is only me),Chinese,malay &amp; a eurasian , In all of this 3months playing catching and chilling out in O.C.H , NOT EVEN ONCE HAS I OR MY OTHER FRIENDS SAW ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY. . OUR Group consist of about 10of us , and maybe + another 3 or 4 girl classmates when they could join us (but they only came during the day after school not at night , And it came to a point , where we had the balls and the females had their pussy to run and hide alone in that big place .... The only crazy thing that we saw is , Seeing tits , My female class mate skirts tearing off cos they tried to climb thru the window and a friend of my mine who had to take a dump badly but there was no plain water (only coke cola)and no one had tissue paper , So he ended up using his school socks to wipe his bum after taking his dump. THose were the good old days , I wonder why arent kids this day during this exploring stuffs , Maybe we didnt have Computers back them and only had at most $2 to $5 dollar allowance a day , so we had to do this stuff to entertain ourself. cheers to all</p></div>
