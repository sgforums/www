              <p>This is my ghost story....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was nine and sleeping sideways on my bed this night. I also had a big blanket on, so big till it touched the floor. Then to my horror, the blanket lifted from the floor...u know from a 90 degrees shape till it became a flat piece of linen....(i'm still covered though). There seemed to be a finger lifting it from below. Wah lau eh, it was enough to make all hair on my body stand. Then I lifted the blanket, peeked below and shouted, who's there?? No one was there....I just ran to my parents room and slept there the next few nights.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is no hallucination, mind you..I'm pretty sure that there was something supernatural beneath. However, no other incident ever happened again.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>For me, once I was playing xbox360 halo2 till around 3am, and was quite tired. I was discussing online whether to have another game when I hear this malay gibberish coming from my window like someone shouting @ me from my window.</p>
              <p>I was like "huh??", and with hairs standing on the back of my neck, I shut down everything and went to bed. I am staying on the 15th floor and the nearest block was like 50m away. I was pretty sure the voice was projected at my level and not from above/below.</p>

              <p>You see, I stay in a maisonette, those 2 storey house in the hdb types. I was downstairs watching football, then suddenly my bro opened his room door upstairs and asked me, "hey u knocked on my door?" I was puzzled and then told him, "where got?" "Sure or not?" he asked again. I paused for 2 seconds and a spine tingling thought whizzed thru my mind. I questioned him back, "how many knocks and was it loud?" He replied there were two and it was loud enough. And there was no one else at home that night that time.</p>
