But when we were halfway across, we saw an oncoming car and she suddenly let go of my hand.<br><br>'I continued crossing and told her to hurry, but she stood rooted to the ground,' he said.<br><br>DRAGGED<br><br>Madam Lim was knocked down and dragged a short distance before the car finally stopped.<br><br>Said Mr Neoh: 'When I rushed to look at her, there was white foam and blood oozing from her mouth. She stopped breathing on the way to hospital.'<br><br>Devastated, Mr Neoh reproached himself over the tragedy.<br><br>'If she had not gone to the accident scene, she would still be alive,' hesaid.<br><br>He added: 'When I married her, she was so pretty. But she left this world in a horrible state.'<br><br>He walked over to her coffin and said softly: 'Why didn't you listen to me? Why didn't you follow me? How can you leave me like that? Who is going to cook and bake cakes for me?<br><br>He added: 'I failed to protect my beloved wife. I deserve the punishment.'<br><br>The couple have been married for more than 10years, but have no children.<br><br>Mr Neoh said: 'Although she didn't say it, I know she had been feeling stressed overnot having kids.'<br><br>He said that Madam Lim, a jewellery shop assistant, started taking medication about a year ago to control her mood swings.<br><br>Her condition improved after she started reading religious scriptures, hesaid.<br><br>'To help reduce her stress, I try to accede to all her requests. I even promised her I would accompany her to read scriptures every Friday,' hesaid.<br><br>The driver of the car that hit them, a man in his 30s, was alone at that time.<br><br>He went to the police station last night to make a police report. The police are investigating the accident.<br><br>The stretch of road from Alor Star to Kedah has no street lights and is a hot spot for accidents, said newspapers.<br></div>
