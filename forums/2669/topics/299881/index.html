            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>During my younger days when I was still a secondary student I stayed<br>in Bukit Merah area which have a lot of Chinese temple activities in<br>most of the weekend. I was a member of the Singapore Boy's Brigade<br>and therefore I was required to attend church service on every<br>Sunday. Not only that, because my English was weaker, I chose bible<br>study as my religion subject in school so that I could improve my<br>English with more English lesson. Despite my rojak religious<br>environment I never take religion seriously. Beside going to school, I<br>spent most of my time with a group of pig friends dog mates Â’Â–Â•Ã¼Â‹Ã§Â—F.<br>One of my dog mate was Jack, his home is a Chinese temple and his<br>father is a medium. Sometimes when his temple needed manpower to<br>play drum, we would be mobilized to take up the role. Among us, there<br>were muslim and catholic friends but they won't really care. We were<br>all doing it only out of fun and for companionship.<br><br>I'm closer to Jack because we attended the same secondary school.<br>Because of his family back ground, Jack can see, hear and feel<br>spiritual around him. He knew I can't and therefore he never want to<br>frighten me and would only tell me after we were away from the scene.<br><br>I remember one incident happened inside the lift of his flat. Jack and I<br>were on our way to his home after school to fold incense papers for his<br>temple's festival. Just when we were walking out of the lift, jack<br>asked Â�gdid you see something?Â�h I replied Â�gsee what?Â�h Jack whispered<br>this in my ear while walking towards his home Â�ga man wearing a white<br>long sleeve shirt standing at the rear of the lift looking on the floor.Â�h<br>HmmmÂ�cI don't remember seeing anyone inside the lift beside both of<br>us. Anyway, I dare not to use that lift when I was going back from<br>Jack's home that night and I never use it alone again.<br><br>Coincidentally, Jack and I were enlisted to the same unit, same platoon<br>and sharing the same bunk in the army. Our unit was 30th SCE and it<br>was located in the Khatib Camp in Yishun before the unit was moved to<br>Jurong later. Discipline was highly demanded even when we were just<br>a recruit because we would be trained to handle explosive after we<br>passed-out. And because of our tough training we would be going<br>through during the day, all the recruits were required to attend water<br>parade, putting a mug full of plain water into our stomach before we go<br>to bed. This is to prevent us from getting dehydration from the tough<br>training the next day. However, due to the mug of water, we usually<br>have to wake up in the middle of the night for the toilet. Because of our<br>tough disciplinary training, we were not allowed to walk in the unit. We<br>must jog to make us move with sense of urgency. Not only that, we<br>were required to greet and ask permission before we passed every<br>officer or corporal on our way. So one morning, as usual, i woke up in<br>the middle of my sleep dragging my tired feet jogging toward the damn<br>bloody far toilet situated right at the far end of the corridor. I passed<br>through many other dark bunks with only sound of pig's snoring like an<br>orchestra along the corridor before I realized I came to an officer<br>wearing a white shirt standing outside a bunk with his back facing me.<br>Although I was very tight at that time, I still managed to stop to greet<br>him and asked for permission to pass-by. He remain silent, no answer<br>from him and he remain facing at the glass vision panel on the bunk's<br>door. I thought since he is not looking at me, why not I just run across<br>him and most likely he won't know was me. So, to save some time for<br>sleeping, I simply run acrossed and went for my business. Few<br>minutes later when I came out, he was gone from a long corridor that<br>has only an exit staircase beside the toilet I was using. But I don't<br>remember I hear any foot step sound walking past the toilet while I was<br>using. But anyway, I was too tired with the training and anything<br>imaginative would not crossed my mind then. I thought - Whew! Lucky<br>that the officer did not wait for me outside, if not I might be punished<br>for not asking for permission to pass-by him.<br><br>The next day, while we were having a short break in between training<br>out in the field, I broke the incident I came acrossed in the morning to<br>my platoon mates. I said Â�ghey hey, you guys better watch-out, I saw an<br>officer standing outside section one's bunk trying to catch some<br>monkeys smoking when I was going to the toilet this morningÂ�h. Our<br>conversation was later over heard by a corporal who was quite closed<br>to us. He asked me Â�gdid you remember any of our white shirts in our<br>unit has no logo?Â�h Yes, all of our unit t-shirt comes with a polar bear<br>logo behind except the one I saw this morning. Now, the corporal<br>reminded me something. The corporal must have known something we<br>don't know. What the hell, how am I going to release my water from<br>my bladder this morning after hearing this!!!!??? :runnynose:<br><br>to be cont..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>part 2 - final.<br><br>As usual, we went to bed after the water parade. But tonight, I have a<br>deal with Jack, I will wake him up to go with me if I got the call from my<br>bladder in the morning. I scare mah! So that morning, I wake him up<br>to attend the call with me. The sound of pig's snoring was business as<br>usual but the officer in white shirt was not there. Anyway, this was<br>going on for the next few days without anything strange happened.<br><br>One Sunday evening, while we were gathering around a table in our<br>bunk after we had tidy up our cupboard from the weekend break. Jack<br>suggested something very constructive. He suggested that we play -<br>plate on the paper game Â¡Â®Die XianÂ¡Â¯ ÂµÃºÃ�Ã‰ inside the bunk to see if<br>spiritual really exists in our company. Everyone in the platoon knows<br>the background of Jack because sometime Jack ask to excuse for<br>attending urgent matter in his temple (Geng One lah). We were not<br>prepared for the game in advance therefore we didn't prepare an<br>original Â¡Â®Die XianÂ¡Â¯ ÂµÃºÃ�Ã‰ from the Chinese book store. However, we<br>use a 50 cents coin and a piece of plain paper to draft words from A -<br>Z and numbers 0 Â¨C 9 onto it. We have at least about 20 platoon mates<br>inside our bunk now but only 4 players were required for the game.<br>Jack, me, Ken and an Indian name Kuma. All 4 of us placed our<br>middle finger on the 50 cents coin. We were then instructed by Jack to<br>read our name out one by one while moving the coin with our fingers<br>onto it in circular motion on the plain paper. After 4 of us had read out<br>our name, Jack asked the first question. He asked Â¡Â°any soul around Â¨C<br>Ã“Ã�Ã�Ã©Â»ÃªÃ”ÃšÃ‚Ã° ?Â¡Â± The coin went round and round and suddenly it<br>stopped at 2. Everybody start cursing at each other for moving the coin<br>intentionally. Well whether was intentionally or not, nobody know but<br>one thing for sure is Jack started to hear foot steps sound coming<br>toward our direction but never reached. I was told by Jack later after<br>the game that the sound of the foot step he heard was very strange.<br>Why strange? Because it was sound of someone walking with a pair of<br>boots, army boots! Who would wear an army boots on a Sunday<br>evening? No, everyone was wearing slippers when we were playing<br>that game in our bunk. With the unusual silent from all the spectators<br>eyeing on the coin plus the weird questions, it does attribute some<br>spooky atmosphere in the bunk. The second question Jack<br>asked Â¡Â°Male or female?Â¡Â± The coin moved to - male. Jack asked Â¡Â°How<br>old are u?Â¡Â± The coin moved to Â¨C B. Jack asked Â¡Â°What is your name?Â¡Â±<br>The coin moved a round and come back to Â¨C B again. This thing went<br>on with irrelevant answers for awhile before we decided to call off the<br>game. By the way, up to this point we were not told of any strange<br>thing from any of our senior pertaining to our unit. So, whether was<br>there a spirit or 2 spirits was still a question mark to me and Jack. But<br>Jack was convinced that there is at least a spirit in our company<br>judging from the foot steps sound he heard earlier. So, Jack decided to<br>make his own investigation. His own because I would not followed.<br><br>Anyway, the whole thing came to light after Jack met face to face with<br>the spirit in the toilet that morning. Jack is a season ghost hunter and<br>he believe doing thing like this is to help clear the resentment from a<br>soul and is considered doing a good deed and since he is one of the<br>few that can be closer to the spirits, he chose not to hide but extend his<br>helping hand to the lost soul if he is needed. Well, the following was<br>what happened to Jack on that fateful morning.<br><br>Although all of us have gone back to our own bed after the game,<br>Jack's mind was still lingering with the moment of the boot's step sound.<br>Just when he was about to take-off to his dreamland, he heard<br>someone moaning very softly from outside the bunk. He walked out of<br>the bunk to check the sound. He noticed that the sound was coming<br>from the direction of the toilet. He walked along the dark corridor<br>towards the toilet unarmed. He saw a man in white shirt with his back<br>facing him standing at the corner inside the toilet. Jack walked to him<br>and starts talking to him. Anyway, Jack already knew who he is at this<br>point. Jack was told that he has no food, no shirt and has no Â¡Â®moneyÂ¡Â¯ to<br>use. So, out of sympathy and goodwill, Jack promised him that we will<br>do something for him if only the unit allowed us to do our prayer inside<br>the camp. And Jack also asked him not to come back after he got what<br>he wanted.<br><br>Well, this piece of news was spread very fast like a SARS in our unit<br>the next morning. Even officers from the other company came to see<br>Jack for interview. Why? Because there was actually an accident<br>happened to a man from Bravo Company about a year ago before our<br>enlistment. Anyone from Bravo in 1985 Â¨C 1987 should know the story<br>very well. I was from Charlie company. Remember the Â¡Â®Die XianÂ¡Â¯ ÂµÃº<br>Ã�Ã‰ ? The coin was stopped twice at Â¨C B and once at 2? B is Bravo and<br>2 is the floor level for Bravo Company. Coincident or what, i dont know,<br>you make your own judgment. Anyway, before Bravo Company go<br>ORD, they were mobilized to take part in one of the few major<br>exercises and it was to build a Battalion Command Post out in the field<br>over night. Although excavators were used to do the dredger of the post<br>but many other things which couldn't be reached by the machine would<br>have to be done by men. The fatal accident happened after the end of<br>exercise when all the soldiers were already very exhausted with the<br>training and the restless night in the next morning. Some of the soldiers<br>were happily resting inside the already done 12 feet deep BCP while<br>waiting for their breakfast that morning, one of the excavator operator<br>had his breakfast before the other and thus he went and start his<br>machine thinking that he can finish his job earlier so that he can rest<br>earlier. He used his machine to doze a pile of soil into the BCP without<br>first checking if any soldier inside. Unfortunately, 2 soldiers were dozing<br>off below that spot. They were buddies. One was awaken by the<br>small falling stones before the pile of soil and managed to jump out. He<br>tried to pull his buddy by the SBO but was too late. His buddy was<br>covered completely from the pile of soil. Everybody there starts using<br>their hands to remove the covered soil furiously. By the time he was<br>pulled out, he had died from suffocation inside the soil. This piece of<br>news was been published on the news paper sometime in 1987.<br><br>Anyway, whether the spirit that Jack last spoken to in our toilet was that<br>the Bravo man or not, no one know. And we would never know because<br>we never see him again after we had done the prayer for him inside<br>the camp. And Jack is still my good friend and for your info, he is a<br>medium now. :rock:<br><br>the end</div>
