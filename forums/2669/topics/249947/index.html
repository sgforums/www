No one was injured.<br><br>During the siege, police had another gangster call Takeshita on the phone to persuade him to give himself up.<br><br>Japanese newspapers reported him as replying: 'I want to apologise with my death.'<br><br>Police threw smoke bombs and stormed Takeshita's apartment shortly after 3am local time on Saturday. They found him with severe head wounds, having apparently shot himself.<br><br>Investigators found a pair of handguns in his apartment and later arrested him at the hospital for illegal possession of firearms.<br><br>Analysts say the recent shootings are signs that gangsters are getting desperate in keeping their turf and finding income sources since the government stepped up measures against them in the 1990s.<br><br>Police believe internecine strife has also been generated by the Yamaguchi-gumi gang's rapid expansion of operations in Tokyo, the traditional base of Japan's second largest gang, the Sumiyoshi-kai.<br><br>Japan has strict gun control laws, and legal firearms are mostly in the hands of hunters and police. Illegal firearms are mostly in the hands of 'yakuza' gangsters, whose mainstays include prostitution, drugs, extortion and finance.<br><br>The shooting of Nagasaki Mayor Iccho Ito by a gangster last Tuesday has prompted lawmakers, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, to call for even tighter supervision.<br><br>The government is set to hold a taskforce meeting on gun control this week, and media reports have said it is aiming to submit a Bill to Parliament to revise gun control legislation by the end of the current session, on June 23.<br><br>Gun-related crimes are not common in Japan, with the number of shootings having fallen to a record low of 53 last year, with most involving members of organised crime. Of that number, 36 were thought to have involved gangsters. Only two resulted in deaths.<br><br></div>
