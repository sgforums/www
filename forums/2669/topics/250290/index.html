He was also on trial over nine other rapes, including that of the Australian, Carita Ridgway, who died after a 1992 attack.<br><br>The Tokyo District Court acquitted Obara of charges involving Blackman's death, but sentenced him to life for a series of rapes, according to a court official who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing protocol.<br><br>She could not immediately clarify whether rape victims under the conviction included Blackman. Obara was never charged with murder, but instead a lesser charge of "rape leading to death."<br><br>Blackman, 21 at the time, was working at a Tokyo night club in 2000 when she went missing after telling a friend she was going on a drive with a customer. Her dismembered body was discovered in a seaside cave in early 2001.<br><br>Real estate tycoon Obara was arrested later that year on charges of rape resulting in death in Blackman's killing. Prosecutors say he gave Blackman a fatal drug overdose in June 2000 before dismembering her body.<br><br>Obara, 54, was also suspected in a string of other rapes, including three that involve foreign women he met at Tokyo hostess clubs. Prosecutors say Ridgway died shortly after being raped by Obara in 1992.<br><br>Obara pleaded innocent to all the charges, suggesting in testimony that Blackman took the drugs herself.<br><br>The Briton's disappearance in July 2000 triggered one of Japan's highest-profile hunts in years. After seven months, her decomposed body was found in a cave near a beachside condominium belonging to Obara.<br><br>Obara allegedly invited Blackman to his condominium, drugged her and sexually assaulted her after she fell unconscious.<br><br>Blackman's case has cast light on foreign women who come to Japan hoping to make money as bar hostesses. Blackman, a former flight attendant, came to Japan in May 2000 and used her earnings to travel around Asia.<br><br>Experts warn that such workers are vulnerable to crimes or exploitation because the justice system does not provide a way for them to work legally on a short-term basis - forcing women to work under-the-table on tourist visas without legal protection.<br><br>The verdict comes as Japanese police are investigating another high-profile murder of a Briton last month.<br><br>The British language teacher whose naked body was found in a sand-filled bathtub at an apartment outside Tokyo was beaten and then suffocated to death, and police are still hunting for the prime suspect, a 28-year-old Japanese male.<br><br></div>
