            <div class='col-md body'><div id="post_message_664571">Translated***<br><br>QingXue this nameï¼Œeasily being associated with a pretty girlï¼Œbut alas! That was not to be. The owner of this name is as ugly and hideous and one can imagine.<br><br>QingXue's parents were recognised as a handsome/pretty coupleï¼Œbut in this world all things do not always come goods, like there was a theory of (positive + postive = negative results).Their daughter was a indescribable ugly girl, thus they decided to abandon her, making QingXue set on going for plastic surgery.<br><br>Actually before she reached 20, Qingxue never thought of going for plastic surgery for 2 reasons. Firstly, dealing with such a 'typical' face of her might cost a bomb, which she can never afford to it. Secondly, she was not confident of going to face the world and doctor, as they might look down on her too. She often need to mask her face which makes her look like a thief.<br><br>Fortunately, Qingxue has a friend that is kind hearted, named Dan Dan. She has her own share of misfortune, as she is color blind. Dan Dan is unable to shop alone for clothes, nor view this colorful world through her eyes. Because of their fate, they seem quite compatible to hang out with each other.<br><br>One night, Dan Dan came to QingXue's house. The first sentence she said when she stepped in was, "QingXue, you look so pretty today! The green top and white skirt you're wearing suits you well!"<br><br>Qingxue was shocked at first, as she did not think that Dan Dan would make a joke out of her, but when she heard the colors that were uttered out from Dan Dan, she was so happy that she jumped up and shouted, "Dan Dan, you can see the green color! What happened to your eyes?"<br><br>"I went to plastic surgery" said Dan Dan. When i knocked off and was heading home today, i met a strangely dressed man, and he could judge me with one look that i was color blind.He said he could help me get well. At first, i did not believe him, but when he reassured me that his shop is nearby and if my eyes do not get well he will not charge me, i went along with him. Anyway, i do not have looks nor money for him to cheat, which should be okay.I never thought that in 1 hour, i can see colors!<br><br>"Really? Is he that miraculous?" Qingxue is abit enticed. "It must be very expensive isn't it?"<br><br>"No it isnt!" said Dan Dan. "Qingxue, he is better than a miracle healer,try him tomorrow!"<br><br>"Me?" Qingxue thought doe a second. "Who doesn't love beauty? ANd the price is so cheap, if i do not go i will regret." So Qingxue asked,"what is the shop name and where its located?"<br>ã€€<br>"WeiMei" beauty salon is opened at the busy streets area. The shop itself is big, and the rooms and spick and span. The owner of the shop is a thirty plus old guy, tall and slim, with sharp eyes.<br><br>When he saw Qingxue coming in, he immediately asked, "Miss, skin treatment or plastic surgery?"<br><br>When Qingxue heard the words plastic surgery, she immediately turned red in her face. She dare not lift her head, nor reply the guy.<br><br>Sensing her uneasiness, the boss immediately say," Miss, its okay, would you please remove your hat and mask so that i can take a look?"<br>ã€€ã€€<br>"I...I'm afraid i might scare you with my looks." Qingxue spoke with shaking voice.<br><br>"Customer is God, and God is merciful, he will never frighten anyone." The boss said. He immeditely remove Qingxue's mask and hat swiftly, revealing her face.<br><br>The boss frowned and spoke with courtesy," Its better than i thought.Why not do a plastic surgery for your whole face,what do you think?"<br><br>He is the only person besides Dan Dan that was not frightened by her looks, so Qingxue was filled with gratitude and said,"Do as you wish."<br><br>"So, lets alter big eyes, high nose cherry lips and nice eyebrows for you.I'll give you a discount... say $3500. Okay with you?"<br><br>"Great!" Qingxue promised without hesitating.<br><br>That day, the owner said that as they were lacking of materials, so Qingxue only managed to alter her nose. The time and price that was charged was far lesser than hospital, and the effects were really good! The nose that she saw was flawless, making her feel that being a pretty girl is not too far off from now. She then make a promise with the boss that in 3 days she would come back to alter the rest of the 'parts' on her face.<br><br>Happily Qingxue went home to receive a shocking news. Dan Dan has died! She died on the dressing table, and the mirror was shattered. Her sharp nailed dug into her eyes that left blood flowing out, expression with terror. The coroner has verdicted that she died from shock.<br>No one saw the killer, nor know the true facts of her death. Dan Dan's death remain as a mystery.Qingxue was the one that cried the most bitter. She had never imagine that her 'good sister' would died just when she can differentiate colors. But, what good does crying do?<br><br>After Dan Dan's funeral, Qingxue went to "WeiMei" beauty salon again.<br><br>Once stepped in, she smell a scent of flowers, which immediately makes her nose turn itchy, and she kept sneezing.<br><br>"Ms Yang, are you allergic to flowers smell?" asked the owner. "No i don't, but today seems abit weird.Suddenly i am allergic to this smell."ã€€ã€€<br><br>"Haha, maybe you just alter your nose, so its still not accustomed.""Do take a nap, we will be done when you wake up and the world will be different." said the boss.<br><br>As promised, when Qingxue woke up, she found that she had turned into a beauty.<br><br>"Is this me?Is this really me?" questioned Qingxue with delight.<br><br>"Absolutely, no mistake, prettier than a star! You can even make all the guys fall in love with you!Are you happy with it?" said the owner.<br><br>"Yes, YES!" Qingxue was overwhelmed. On the road back, she felt everyone looking at her, filled with jealousy and envy and praises. She finally could throw away her mask and be a real human again. That night, she has a sweet dream.<br>ã€€ã€€<br>The following day, Qingxue bought a fish for her lunch to celebrate her renewal in life. But when she start to eat the fish, she vomited it out. "Weird, this is my favorite food, why do i detest it now? Qingxue was filled with doubt.Suddenly, she felt her eyebrows in great pain, like someone tugging at it, and her eyes start to feel it too. No, its her whole face! Her facial features seem to be pulling and trying to escape her face!ã€€ï¼�<br><br>"NO!"shouted Qingxue and ran straight to "WeiMei" beauty salon. <br><br>"Its like this after the plastic surgery. After awhile it will get better." said the boss.<br><br>"But...I'm in pain!"Qingxue cried.<br><br>"We're helpless too, please bear with it. Because it belongs to different owners, that why...." the shop owner mutter. "I... I mean cos the ingredients are abit different, so the reaction is normal." he added.<br><br>Qingxue was filled with doubts, but can only leave. She did not went home after leaving, but loiter around the shop, feeling like the owner kept something from her without letting her know about it.ã€€ã€€<br><br>Suddenly, she say the onwer rushing out from the shop to a guy in shades, carry a bag suspiciously. Qingxue followed them and watched them.<br><br>She only saw the man in shades take out from the bag noses, eyes and mouths, and casually throwing them on the table, making her want to puke.<br><br>"Boss,how's this batch of goods?"said the man in shades."All are fresh."<br><br>The shop owner said,"not bad, did anything happen while getting the 'goods' out?"<br><br>"Nope, who cares!"So how's biz going on?" queried the man in shades.<br><br>The owner replied,"Just took 2 customers, will be better in future. Think about it, there are so many vain girls out there, and our prices are so cheap.In future we will be earning big bucks!"<br><br>"Ya, this kinda low budget biz is really great! You're so clever, boss! Stealing from Professor Wang the human parts will not required money, and now we are earning money from dead persons parts, we can save even more and earn from it!" said the guy in shades.<br><br>"WHAT!DEAD PERSONS!" QIngxue immediately shivered. She use her hands to touch her features, and cannot believe that its ice cold! "They don't belong to me! The human parts have brought over the habits of their owners to me!" the more she thought, the more afraid she is, and she turn pale. She ran out to the streets, falling and stumbling.<br><br>In the bustling streets, it seem different today. <br><br>"Weird, why is there so much people around today?"questioned Qingxue.<br><br>She suddenly notice that the "people" around have facial colors that are greyish, wearing long white robes, hands long enuf to touch the ground. Some have blood by their mouths, some with empty eye sockets. They're....<br><br>"GHOSTS!" shouted Qingxue. Running home with her head in her arms. <br><br>While running home, she felt the ghosts stopping by to stare at her, like hating her to the core.<br><br>She rushed to her room and locked the door, using the table and fridge to block it. She felt so helpless and lost, like suffocating...<br><br>Before she have time to recover and calm down, she feel a gush of cold wind blowing her back. She dare not turn behind to see, but from the mirror by the door, she saw four ghostly apparitions!<br><br>1 without mouth, 1 without nose, 1 without eyes, 1 without eyebrows. Qingxue could hear them saying "return me......return me........" as they draw nearer to her.<br><br>"I'll return them, i return them all to you!" she screamed hysterically, and take the fruit knife beside her to cut off the parts off her face.<br><br>"Dan Dan --------" outside the building, someone heard the painful screams.</div></div>
