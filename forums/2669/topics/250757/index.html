            <div class='col-md body'>Four weeks after a medical student was killed by a hit-and-run driver, his spirit has tracked the suspected killer down in a most unbelievable manner.<br>The driver was using the same road when his bus broke down at the exact spot where he was said to have hit the student a month ago.<br>The victim, Oki Michael Ibelere was going home in the evening on April 18, when he was crushed by the driver in the Ojo area of Lagos.<br><br>Identified as Kazeem Adisa, the driver picked up Ibelere, who just gained admission to study Medicine at the University of Port Harcourt and dumped him in a bush near Mile 2, in Lagos.<br>The driver and conductor were passing the same spot where they hit Ibelere when their vehicle suddenly stopped. One person who had seen the bus hit the boy rushed to alert some policemen who were nearby.<br>The eyewitness said: "The boy was crossing the road when they hit him. I saw them pick up the boy and zoomed off. I wanted to confront them but it was too late. However, I noted the registration number of the bus.<br><br>"As I was sitting outside on Tuesday, a bus broke down and the driver came down. I took a closer look at it and realised that it was the same bus that hit the boy. I shouted to policemen to help me arrest them. It was after their arrest that I learnt that the boy had died."<br>The suspects told Daily Sun that it was fear that made them dump the victim in the bush.<br>According to Adisa, they had taken Ibelere to an hospital but he was refused treatment because they had no police report.<br><br>He said: "On our way to obtain the police report, I felt his pulse and realised that he was dead. That was when I panicked. Akanbi and I agreed that if we took his corpse to the police, we would be in serious trouble. So, we decided to dump it in a bush at Mile 2."<br>His conductor, Akanbi, 23, said that when the accident occurred, Adisa ran away.<br>"He ran away because he was afraid. I was the one that drove the boy to the hospital. Adisa later met me at the hospital. There was no identity card on the boy, so we could not locate his house."<br></div>
