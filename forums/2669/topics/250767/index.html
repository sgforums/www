            <div class='col-md body'>His name is Barret Akpokabayen, an Urhobo from Delta State who is also a lecturer at the Yaba College of Technology. He teaches Graphic Arts. The young man in his 30s appreciates his calling to the extent that he decided to choose a life time partner from his profession.<br><br>He admits that "because of our peculiar nature, it might not have been easy to cope with a lady who does not understand it". His wife, Vivian was an Art student who understood Akpokabayen with ease. Some where, a relationship began between the duo. They waited for Vivian to graduate before they could walk down the aisle.<br><br>How we met<br>She was my student at the Yaba College of Technology. That was where we met. We developed a relationship then, though it was not a loud one.<br><br>Attraction<br>The attraction is that I am a graphic artist. Because of our peculiar nature, it would not have been easy to marry someone who is not an artist. A non-artist might probably not understand the nature of an artist. In the case of my wife, immediately I explain anything to her, she understands it with ease. She is an illustrator, graphic artist, and a visualizer as well. We are both in the same profession. We found ourselves working together, working on the same project. That is the kind of wife I want.<br><br>Ideal marriage<br>My personal view about an ideal marriage is that it must consist of two different people with different ideas and different visions. You would definitely see something you enjoy about each other. Both must make a commitment towards each other to work together, help and improve each others life. The couple must give support and understand each other very well.<br><br>HIV/AIDS Test<br>We went for the test. The result was negative.<br><br>Dislike<br>There is nothing I dislike about her now<br><br>If positive?<br>I would have gone ahead to marry my wife. It is about the time one spends in this life that matters. There have been cases where people die of accidents, plane crash, fire accidents. These are not HIV related cases. We worry too much about little or nothing. I thin, we should appreciate the time we have now, and the good life that we have lived so far.<br><br>Advice<br>No man should allow himself to be forced into marriage. It is not a competitive task. Marriage should be consummated only when the man is ready and sure that this is what he wants for himself.<br><br>Mrs Vivian Akpokabayen (nee Irozuru) is a 27year-old lady from Abia State. Like her husband, she has passion for graphic arts and that was one of the motivating factors that led them to the altar. Pretty Vivian spoke briefly about their relationship.<br><br>How we met<br>We met in school. He was my lecturer.<br><br>Attraction<br>He is a very simple person. I must also tell you he is a good [person.<br><br>Ideal marriage<br>To me, it means understanding each other, being together and loving each other.<br><br>If HIV positive, would you married him<br>Yes, I would have married him. My reason is because what we share is more than HIV"AIDS. Being together and achieving our goals is more important than HIV/AIDS. We have grown to understand each other so well.<br><br></div>
