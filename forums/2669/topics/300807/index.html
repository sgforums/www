            <div class='col-md body'><span class="small"><strong>AuthorÂ’s Note : My friend, Angie related this incident back to me. She mentioned that although this story may not be one of the scariest experience she had with supernatural beings but at that moment, she feared for her son</strong></span><br><br>On one of the holidays, my family, which consists of my son and husband decided to go for a short holiday trip together with my mother and MIL (mother in law). At that time, it seemed like a good idea and co-incidently although it was a last minute decision, there was a rooms available in the usually peaked holiday season. 3 days before we took off to Haadyai, Thailand for the holidays, my son fell sick for 3 days but was however assured by the doctor that he would heal soon.<br><br>On the journey to Haadyai, my son seemed to look better and when we decided to make the first stop at one of the Kuan Yin Ma Temple, he was feeling much better already. As soon as we checked to one of the hotels at Haadyai, Thailand, my son immediately took in fever and vomitted a little blood. Perhaps it was due to the pizza my husband ordered for him over lunch.<br><br>Strange things started happening while we were having a massage at our rooms. The hair dryer at the bathroom started to switch on by itself causing a massive noise at the bathroom. It was only then that I was informed later the next day by my MIL that it was the Chinese Ghost Festival day. For a chinese, it would be unwise to travel during this time of the year and if you happen to be unlucky and accidently bum into one of the spirits, you may be facing great danger ahead.<br><br>That day, I was fuming with anger over my husbandÂ’s stupidity. How could he have made such a decision knowing that it was the time of the year? That night, we slept soundly. Because my son was still ill, he slept in between me and my husband. Strange things started happening again. This time, I heard someone playing the little bells on my anklet. The funny thing that all this while I was keeping still, not moving an inch and yet I could hear clearly the ringing sounds of my ankletÂ’s little bells. I was dumbstruck.<br><br>Fearing that the ghost may disturb my son, I took the courage to wake up, switched on all the lights including the bathroom lights and sat up. At this time, my husband woke up and was puzzled of my actions. I explained to him to caution tonight and he immediately knew what I meant.<br><br>The rest of the night was at peace and after I switch on all the lights, the room was quiet. Perhaps the naughty ghost just wanted to play and meant no harm.<br><br></div>
