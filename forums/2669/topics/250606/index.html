By and large, the Chinese have taken the world by storm with the likes of IT experts and engineers.<br><br>But, as mentioned in a recent report by the LA Times, both systems are well on their way to becoming outdated.<br><br>The report noted that China started to revamp its education system in the 1990s to introduce more creative and critical thinking in the classroom.<br><br>In the US, schools have been urged to adopt a more structured, Asia-influenced math syllabus for younger students.<br><br>For more than a decade, both countries have been quietly studying and integrating each other's strengths into their school systems.<br><br>The result, while encouraging, has thrown up a few surprises.<br><br>Assistant Professor Zhang Baohui, from the National Institute of Education (NIE), has taught science in China and the US at the equivalent of the lower-secondary level.<br><br>His research into both systems at the teaching and learning levels has shown that teachers in China take stock and acknowledge the need to move towards a bigger emphasis on creative thinking.<br><br>On the other hand, educators in the US are scrutinising flaws in their system.<br><br>'You cannot erect a tall building without laying a strong foundation first. That foundation necessarily comes from knowledge-based learning,' he told The New Paper.<br><br>But Assoc Prof Zhang said it was hard to generalise, especially since reforms to education has blurred the lines.<br><br>'Usually, people have the impression that western education places an emphasis on self expression, while in China, it's about how much you know.<br><br>'It's actually difficult to generalise, because both countries are big, and you can find a range in both,' he said.<br><br>Still, he believes that Singapore lies somewhere near the middle.<br><br>While it is also going through an educational reform of its own, it is well on its way to becoming bigger and better.<br><br>'While working with Singapore students on a computer-based science learning project, I found that they have both US and China in them. The emphasis is still on knowledge, but the government has been very encouraging of inquiry-based learning, and integrating more technology-led learning tools into schools.<br><br>'There is no doubt that students from Singapore perform very well at the international level when compared to students from other countries.'<br><br>There are still a lot of changes to be made here, but Assoc Prof Zhang is 'optimistic'.<br><br>One of the changes he would like to see is in the students' mindsets.<br><br>Believe it or not, the brightest students here have surprised academics by showing the most resistance to creative-based learning in all three countries.<br><br>'Not all students welcome open-ended learning, especially the high achievers who are used to listening and following. These students are not willing to take the risk because they are afraid to lose their advantage,' he said.<br><br>Students who get high grades in conventional exams may not do as well as low achievers, who may well hand in higher quality work when working, say, on computer models to minimise water pollution by manipulating variables, he observed.<br><br>'Problem-solving tests understanding and creativity, which cannot always be learnt using conventional techniques that high achievers are used to.'<br><br></div>
