So each side of the bunk should have 5-7 beds...<br><br>One night there was this recruit who just can't fall asleep His bed is Bed 3... He heard a sound in the middle of the night.. a sound like feet scruffling...<br><br>He opened his eyes and he turned green.... when he saw a malay girl with a teddy bear sitting on the cupboard of the opposite bed!!...<br><br>The little girl is saying something..."Satu.. Tidoh ( Number 1 sleeping..).. Dua.. Tidoh ( Number 2 sleeping)... Tiga Ta Tidoh...( number 3 not sleeping)"... The recruit saw her pointing at him... and he quickly pulled the blanket over his head... suddenly he felt something hit him.. and then it was silence....<br><br>The recruit thought it was the end and he peeked over his blanket... and he saw 2 eyes looking at him... the girl is standing right beside him!! The girl said again " TIGA TA TIDOH!!"... The recruit fainted...<br><br>Next morning, he woke up in the medical centre.. The doctor say he was suffering from severe fatigue... When he approached his bunkmates... the bunk mates asked him " Why you bring a teddy bear to camp?? must hug the bear to sleep ah?" The recruit turned green and his feet start to wobble....<br><br>He was out of training and placed in a hospital where he stayed for 1 month... and we never knew what happen to him again...<br><br>(Anyone still got any Army Ghost Story to share, pls post it here.. keke)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="small">(it does not happen on mi)</span></strong><br><br>Anyway, just for sharing, during my days at BMT in Tekong ah, its said that 1 particular company, which my mild obese frens were in, was damn haunted 1, of coz not my coy.<br><br>1- Griffon Coy....didnt manage to read every single one of the posts pages back, if repeated or similar, i'm sorry.<br>Griffon Coy was notorious and infamous back then, duno now's wad.<br>1 particular platoon's bunk, whenever a certain day or a certain wk came, around 3am+ or exactly the 3am tat time, all the ppl living in that particular bunk would suddenly JUMP up, totally awaken from their sleep. Wad my fren told me, was that they were being forced to wake up although he cant really recall wad made or forced him and his other bunkmates up. All woke up at the same time...<br><br>2- Unknown Coy ... It was said that recruits are not allowed to bring in raw food, such as raw meat for example, into the bunk and/or stored into the individual closet/cupboard. Once, there was a recruit who brought in meat of duno wad, then in the wee hours at night, the whole cupboard was shaking so strong that woke up the entire platoon and company (if i remember correctly). All of the bunkmates were so scared, they dun dare to enter the bunk again, and watched the cupboard shake with the other people from other platoons of the coy.<br>Whole thing stopped when dawn reaches, and the shaking stopped.<br>when they opened the cupboard, the platoon sergeant found raw meat inside, and immediately scolded the owner, after that incident, the people there don't dare to bring in any more raw meats to bunks ...<br><br>3- Cougar Coy ... My company back when I was in my BMT period.<br>Nothing much happened, just that every morning when we woke up to do area cleaning, there would be a strand of long hair on 1 of the beds, sometimes throughout the week, same beds or different beds would have the hair, so long that its a females... funny thing was that only males would be in the bunk and company... .... ... :runnynose:<br>Another would be the viewing of funny figures from the 5th floor by platoon 4. Some would see figures at the stadium late at nite when they walk along the corridor towards the toilet.....<br><br>4- Another unknown coy ... its all about a person dreaming... that became true....hard to say if its true or not... to me, its not quite convincing to me....:confused2</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The above incidents were all related to BMTC Tekong.<br><br>The following that I wanna share would be when I was posted 1st to Signal Institute, followed by a Camp which is near SAFT and Pasir Lebar Camp, which is also an active unit (Not SCE).<br><br>Signal Institute:<br>-Those who were there before should know. When doing prowling on guard duties, the stray dogs within the camp are really very irritating and a nuisance, and sometimes need to use lights to flash them so as to drive them away. There're people who even said that some of the stray dogs spotted, were actually phantom dogs, not actual dogs.....<br><br>-The unoccupied floor, which is the 5th/6th floor (most top floor before the roof), one of the bunks and sometimes the corridor's light will always auto on itself when its 9pm, or sometimes at the wee hours in the morning. One of the bunks (light auto on 1), believed to be unoccupied, is very tidy when my frens and I tried peeking into it from outside (stepping someone to overlook into the bunk of coz). Description was: 2 beds, both at different ends of the whole bunk. Neatly folded shirts, uniforms, towels on the beds. Fans and lightings were on all the time.<br><br>Well, thats my own account, who knows, maybe there ARE really other people living in the bunk, just that they made up the story and scare ppl from disturbing them ...<br><br>?SIG BN, J????G Camp (? Division):<br>- COS Terror 1... of coz, this happens to my coy when I was at the unit.<br>Of all the COS duties done by those whom I knew, all told me this incident that whenever they are doing COS duties in the coy, plus no other personnels were in the coy or camp except the various COSs, such as weekends or public holidays or Block Leaves.<br>The COSs in my coy, will always sniff a super, pungent smell, or rather a stench from duno where:confused2:. Cant really detect the source of the smells, so they endured with it and prayed nothing else happens till some1 take over them the next day. In addition, other than the pungent smells, there is also this funny hot and warm feeling throughout the whole company, even at night. These kind of things never happens when e whole company is around. Also, although e stench might come from dead rats, area cleanings were done very often, &amp; toilets, bunks were all clean everyday by external cleaners, can't say that the people living there never clear e dead rats right?:notimpressed2:<br><br>-COS Terror 2 ... This happened around 2, 3 months ago from now.<br>The coy opposite mine, the COS was another one of my frens, and was doing the COS duty in his coy ... nothing happened until after midnite. He went back to his bunk to get something, and of coz to get a little sleep in his own comfortable bed and Zzzzzz ....:shifty3:<br>After he woke up, and was ready to raise the flag the next morning, he went back to the company office to get the flag .... to his surprise, he found that the radio he had left on for the whole night, was turned off.<br>Thats the funny part, the office's doors and windows were locked, no one other than the COS himself has the key to unlock it ... then who the hell off the radio?!:runnynose:. Feeling something amissed, he quickly went off to raise the flag, then came back and pack his things and after the next COS took over him, he just ran off out of the camp almost immediately...:cry3:<br><br>To add on, I was so 'lucky' to hear from them bcoz during each of the COS incidents, I was doing duties too, but not COS though. They just called me to say that they suspected that those things are playing pranks .... wad can I do? Laugh at them?:biggrin4:<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Story of Mysterious Death of Army Recruit (1)<br><br>I heard this story from my army mates back in late 1980s, whom I believe may have belonged to the time when this event occurred. The story should have occurred just a few years before I heard about it.<br><br>It was said that in Pulau Tekong, there was a rout march conducted for a group of army recruits. That day they rested somewhere, and when they were about to set off, 1 particular recruit said he needed to rest a while more, and asked the rest of his comrades to go ahead.<br><br>After awhile when that platoon realized that that recruit did not catch up with them, they went back to the place they left him. He wasnÂ’t there.<br><br>Then they searched in vain, reported back to camp about the missing recruit, and the entire camp searched the island in vain.<br><br>The body was found after the 2nd or 3rd day, just below a tree, very near the place where they last left him. There was no wound to be found on him. He was lying facedown.<br><br>They did not know how he died, or why they couldnÂ’t find him in the first place, so near their last resting place.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Story of Mysterious Death of Army Recruit (2)<br><br>Being a army officer stationed in Pulau Tekong, I (Platoon commander Colin, formerly of Delta Company Camp 1) have to take special induction training courses in order to perform my duties as a platoon commander.<br><br>In one special session, which I unfortunately missed, but my fellow officers told me, it involved a Mindef Directives on not conducting training on Thursday nights. The reasons cited included an increased risk in accidents, injuries and incidents occurring in Thursday Trainings in the evening. The session included an actual case study of a mysterious death of an army recruit. The incident supposedly occurred in the 1970s.<br><br>Basically it involved the incident of a recruit who went missing halfway through a route march. First the platoon, then the company, then the camp, and eventually the entire island was mobilized to look for him. They found him the next day, with his body disemboweled, along the route of the route march.<br><br>I am aware there is a 3 door bunk in Charlie Company. I am not aware there is a connection with this story I just mentioned. I believe that the 3 door could have been built for a reason, whether paranormal or not.<br></div>
