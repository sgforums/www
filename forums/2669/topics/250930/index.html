A man came over and punched his face. The blow cut his lip wide open, sending blood dripping down his clothes. This happened a few months ago.<br><br><strong>His crime?</strong><br><br>He had the same name as the attacker's friend's husband.<br><br>Sales engineer, Michael, 33, has seen his fair share of bar fights.<br><br>So, it was no surprise to him when he heard that Mr Eugene Chua, 31, died from injuries yesterday after being attacked outside a bar at Clarke Quay on Monday. The case has now been classified as murder. (See report below.)<br><br>Michael was at a nightspot at StJames Power Station with six friends. It was a Friday night and the regulars were winding down after reaching there at about 10pm.<br><br><strong>DEADLY HELLO</strong><br><br>He said a female friend of his walked by and called him by name. Her husband has the same name as his and Michael returned her greeting.<br><br>That was it. Or so he thought.<br><br>At 3am, he got a nasty surprise.<br><br>He said: 'She was sitting at the next table with a group of friends. I was with some friends at our table and we were just chatting.<br><br>'Then one of her male friends got up, walked over to me, called my name, and punched my face.<br><br>'All our friends were so stunned that they did nothing. I was confused as I did not know him or what I had done to offend him.'<br><br>He said his attacker was drunk and could hardly stand on his feet. Bouncers threw the man out.<br><br>Michael said he later found out that his female friend had told her friends that she was having problems with her husband.<br><br>He said: 'Her friend, who was drunk, assumed I was her husband just because we had the same name.'<br><br>He said he did not pursue the matter. The next day, after sobering up, her friend SMSed him to apologise and later pleaded with him not to pursue the matter.<br><br>Michael decided to let it rest.<br><br>Married with a 11/2-year-old son, Michael said he visits nightspots three times a week and said fights usually start after 3am after patrons have had one glass too many.<br><br>He added: 'People get intoxicated, want to boost their ego in front of the girls and they start a fight. So, we tend to be more alert after 3am because people are more drunk.'<br><br>But it has not scared him off such places.<br><br>He said he and his friends used to go to one particular pub and would occupy their regular table near the exit.<br><br>He said: 'If we see people falling off their chairs, or if things get too rowdy, it's time to go. If anything happens, we just head for the exit.'<br><br>But even taking these precautions may not be enough the moment people get drunk, he said.<br><br>Michael said: 'You can't predict what will happen. No matter how well you prepare yourself, if you are caught in the path of the missile, too bad.'</div>
