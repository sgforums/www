            <div class='col-md body'>While many of you may not know the exact time of your birth or the planetary position in your horoscopes, I am sure most of you have heard your parents telling somebody else the approximate time of your birth. Or you could find it out by referring to your birth certificate. Once you have done it, the readings given below can be of some help to you in understanding yourself and the nature of work you can do best.<br><br>BIRTH TIME-4.00a.m. to 6.00a.m.<br><br>Your Sun is in the first house, giving you a good constitution and self-confidence. You will be assertive and will have sudden good fortune. It also assures success.<br><br>BIRTH TIME-6.00a.m. to 8.00a.m.<br><br>Your Sun is in the 12th, which makes for many mysterious happenings, which cannot be explained away easily. It would be best therefore to work a tight schedule and keep a cool head. Expenses could outrun income.<br><br>BIRTH TIME-8.00a.m. to 10.00a.m.<br><br>Your Sun is in the 11th house, which means plenty of friends, social life and the money necessary for it. Your bread, butter and jam will come from knowing your well-wishers and retaining your friends. Many times, you'll find that you earn a little more than you deserve, or get into money without sweating it out.<br><br>BIRTH TIME-10.00a.m. to 12 noon<br>Your Sun is in the 10th house, a very strong place for the Sun to be in both by Western and Indian astrology. This assures a good position in your chosen work. It also means the successful completion of projects and plans. It would prove best to be on your own. The misuse of power and bossy attitude could get you into trouble.<br><br>BIRTH TIME-12 noon to 2.00p.m.<br><br>Your Sun is in the 9th house, or the house which indicates journeys, philosophy, religion, higher mind, philanthropy, and publicity by all the different media.

Many astrologers also connect it with sex and accidents. Therefore, a degree of self-control and caution is advisable in your case. Legal matters will crop up from time to time.<br><br>BIRTH TIME-4.00p.m. to 6.00p.m.<br><br>Your Sun is in the 7th house, commonly called the house of partnership (all kinds). Evidently marriage affects you more than it does others and so try to make it a success even if it means working hard for it. Also you will find that you have to deal directly with the general public or people en masse. Choose a profession or business or a job which leads you on to a direct contact or dealing with people. Since the 7th is also the house of your enemy or enemies in life, legal issues might give you sleepless nights. However, it is a strong placing for the Sun. You will make news.<br><br>BIRTH TIME-6.00p.m. to 8.00p.m.<br><br>Your Sun is in the 6th house, which means that all will depend upon the cooperation you get from colleagues and inferiors. It is also an indication of social service and you will have much to do with the health and hygiene of the people. This position of the Sun favours work in which you have to attend to details. You will be meticulous and painstaking, qualities that make for success and respect in the long run.<br><br>BIRTH TIME-8.00p.m. to 10.00p.m.<br><br>Your Sun is in the 5th house, giving you innate artistic ability and talent. Also an optimistic outlook on life and willingness to take chances. Your hobby can be made into a profession or a vocation. Also, your heart will reach out to people easily and spontaneously, and this could make you responsive to all outside influences. You could play the Great Lover both on stage and in real life. But try not to overdo it.<br><br>BIRTH TIME-10.00p.m. to 12.00 midnight<br>Your Sun is in the 4th house, which is a splendid placing for home and property. You could gain through any work tied up with land, real estate, farms and so on. Since home signifies parents, they will affect life for better or for worse to a remarkable extent. Be more pushing and outgoing.<br><br>BIRTH TIME-12.00 midnight to 2.00a.m.<br><br>Your Sun is in the 3th house and foretells marked intellectual ability and a love of travel and high adventure. In fact, it favours all media of transport and communication, say journalism, TV, and so on. Also, your brothers and sisters and neighbours will either make you or mar you. But it is certain that you will have much to do with them. This position of Sun makes you fond of company, though you will not be very choosy about it. It is also excellent for a stimulating social life.<br><br>BIRTH TIME-2.00a.m. to 4.00a.m.<br><br>Your Sun is in the 2nd house or house of finance and family. Naturally, it means that you'll be able to make money, if not keep it. In Indian astrology, the 2nd house stands for speech and food. You could be an ideal host, a great orator. Yes, you should be in money too, other planets aspects your Sun favorably.</div>
