            <div class='col-md body'>April 22, 2007<br><br>ROYSTON Tan is used to being called the 'bad boy of Singapore films', but the enfant terrible hopes that this label will not extend to describing his debut performance at New York's Central Park.<br><br>The 30-year-old director will be performing getai - in Hokkien no less - during the open-air concert for Singapore Day today, with the leads of his new film 881, Yeo Yann Yann and Mindee Ong.<br><br>'Singing in Hokkien is very difficult. I have to get the intonation and accent right,' said Royston who is a self-confessed karaoke fan.<br><br>Singapore Day is the inaugural festival of Singapore food and entertainment. The event is organised by the Prime Minister's Office's Overseas Singaporean Unit (OSU), for Singaporeans living and working in the Big Apple.<br><br>Royston, Yann Yann and Mindee will be singing songs from 881, a musical comedy about two getai singers who perform at the annual Hungry Ghost Festival.<br><br>When The New Paper met them on Monday, they had just begun rehearsing for the show.<br><br>While he may be worried about hitting the right notes, Yann Yann, 30, and Mindee, 27, are worried that their costumes may not protect them from New York's chilly spring weather. Designed by Mothar Kassim, they include calf-high gold and white boots and feathered mini skirts.<br><br>Royston will also work in a portion of 881 - which is due to be released on National Day this year - into the show.<br><br>He said: 'Our segment will give Singaporeans the feeling like they are back in their HDB void decks watching the getai performances.'<br><br>The Singapore Day concert will also include Kit Chan, indie band Great Spy Experiment, and a musical medley by Robin Goh, George Chan and Dwayne Tan called Singapore Got Musical Meh?<br><br>Jonathan Lim, Hossan Leong and Rodney Oliverio will also enact their parody show, Chestnuts.<br><br>HUGE AUDIENCE<br><br>The event is held today at Wollman Rink in Central Park, which is New York's outdoor skating rink. The venue was chosen as it could accommodate a higher-than-expected turnout. The OSU had earlier planned for 1,000 Singaporeans but now, it believes up to 5,000 people may show up at the day-long event.<br><br>The event also has video screens and exhibition panels to give overseas Singaporeans an updated view of the country.<br><br>Some 20 hawkers will also be plying Singapore favourites, from chicken rice to roti prata.<br><br>Said Mr Quek: 'Someone told us that some friends in New York were planning to go very early to the venue for Singapore Day. because they want to be first in line to get to the food, to see the exhibitions and basically, to make sure they get in.'<br><br>Which goes to show that even in New York, you can't take the kiasu out of the Singaporean.<br><br></div>
