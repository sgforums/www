            <div class='col-md body'><span class="small"><strong>(Note : Its does not happen on mi, thanks, ops i hope it really happen on mi,  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> )</strong></span><br><br>One fine day, I was sleeping at my boyfriendÂ’s place. It was a very tiring day so I thought of taking a nap while my boyfriend went out to meet up with his friend for a couple of hours. Initially, I was watching a movie on his laptop but after an hour or so, I was getting a little drowsy and decided it was time for a nap.<br><br>I proceeded to switch off the computer and headed for the bed. Just for some brief description of how the bedroom looked like, well, it was a simple triangular room. With the bed at one corner and the door at the other, I had to get up to get a clearer look if anyone was at the door.<br><br>Because of the very old style door lock my boyfriend had in his room, anyone in or going out of the room had to bang the door. That afternoon, as I dozed off to sleep, I was suddenly awaken by a rude bang. I thought it was my boyfriend that came back and didnÂ’t bother to wake up. Because my back was facing the door, I would have to turn around to get a look at him. I could feel him touching my back softly and I decided to turn around. Feeling very blur, I slowly opened my eyes expecting it was him but to my shock, I could not see anyone. I opened my eye wide and even checked the door to see if it was locked (because it was locked before go to nap). Still, everything was right where I left them before I sleep. I thought of nothing and continued my nap. In my sleep, I thought I heard the door banging again.<br><br>A few nights later while eating dinner, I shared my strange experince with my boyfriend. It was only then he shared with me that a few nights before this happened to me, he too had strange experiences. In the middle of the night, he could suddenly feel someone staring closely at him. On another night, he could hear footsteps pacing up and down his door. And on another night, he heard sounds of papers flipping although the fan wasnÂ’t blowing the direction of the papers and he was positive that he did not leave any stray paper lying around. After the sounds of the papers flipping bothered him to an extent, he woke and switched on the lights. As mysteriously as the sounds appeared, it disappeared. When he switched off the lights again, he heard the sounds again.<br><br>Now, he placed a Buddha picture in his room just in case. After that, nothing funny happened anymore.<br><br></div>
