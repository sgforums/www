He was caught stealing a ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â£pounds;1m ($3m) yacht, part-by-part, literally.<br><br>A British court was told yesterday how, over 7years, James Light, 35, stole hundreds of components belonging to his employer, luxury boat builder Sunseeker, in the hope of building a dream boat.<br><br>According to The Times, he accumulated parts worth ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â£pounds;55,000, including electrical components, a 1.2m radar mast, widescreen television, lifting straps and sternlights.<br><br>They were carefully stored in a lockup garage in Bournemouth, England.<br><br>Most of the stolen items were for the luxury 16m-long motoryachts that Light worked on - normally the preserve of film stars, Formula One racing drivers and Russian oligarchs.<br><br>The Bournemouth Crown Court was told that Light was caught when a DVD player was found in his toolbox.<br><br>He had yet to start building the yacht.<br><br>ADMITTED TO CHARGES<br><br>Although Light claimed he had obtained the parts legitimately from a third party, he admitted charges of theft and handling stolen goods.<br><br>Detective Inspector Jez Noyce said: 'Through an investigation at his home, we found a rented lockup garage. There were over 100 boxes of items believed to be from Sunseeker.<br><br>'I have no idea how someone managed to sneak all these items past security at Sunseeker, especially a 1.2m radar pole and a large television.'<br><br>The prosecution said that Light had worked at Sunseeker for 11 years and was employed as an electrical engineer.<br><br>He was caught in Sep 2005. A spokesman for Sunseeker said they had sacked Light.<br><br>Light admitted to 17 counts of handling stolen goods and two counts of theft. He also admitted cultivating cannabis and possessing Ecstasy tablets, cocaine and cannabis.<br><br>He was sentenced to 12 months in prison, which was suspended for two years, and ordered to do 200hours of community service.<br></div>
