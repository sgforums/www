            <div class='col-md body'>Hello dear folks,<br><br>As so many people are interested in Guman I would like to state here that for the greedy folks who are interested in Guman it is better to look out for a real Chochook amulet by a Guman Master.<br><br>Chochook is not just easier to take care of, it's just like you will get everything you want.<br><br>You only need to carry him with you in your pocket and say it when you bargain or when you do business or when you are in front of the person of your desire.<br><br>The Chochook spirit just gets what it wants, never showers, don't care if you put it in your bag on a table or in your trousers pocket. You just don't put it close to a Buddha as it would be a disgrace for the Buddha.<br><br>It is easier if you put sure that you get a real one, because you don't need to be the one who pick it up - so you can buy them over the net.<br><br>Beware that if people see you have one and know about that amulet (like me) will give you a very very hard time and distrust you. It's not very popular in Thailand and people won't like you.<br><br>I did rent a consecrated one - in order to try (no worry those are tryable - and not like the bullet savers).<br><br>Went to an Amulet shop where I know there is a very greedy lady  who wanted to bulls@itt me with a LP Ngern copy - and as she has a BIG Chochook shown to everybody as a protector of her shop I just want to see what will happen.<br><br>It's just the only shop in our Jungle here where you can buy the amulet cases, and so I went there with my (real) Chochook in the pocket.<br><br>I said, this case how much, she: 80 Baht, (I am shocked because normally 50) ...and so on... I said and that (a big one) 120 Baht, ... and so it went on.<br><br>Ok I said, four of this 80 Baht and two of this 120 ones, and rings and that small case for free and as I said that I knocked on my Chochook.<br><br>She said: Altogether, 200 Baht. I payed slowely and smiled, she smiled.<br><br>... well, have to add that after Chochook went to the king and demanded to get his daughter, even the king couldn't refuse. But one day he demanded a banquet with all sorts of food and ate and ate and ate .......... and blasted. Now he has to serve those other greedy folks forever. I gave it back. There is another version of the story too I know ...... well he got quite old.<br><br>They are mostly out of .. bonepowder (baby) or ivory - wood is a possiblility too.<br><br>faj<br><br>PS: the look is not so important than the material and the consecrator, as is the oil which it was put in.<br>Nice how those oils are made. A candle put under the chin of a death mother corps ......... well, I know the process but don't say I like that.<br>There are oils out of elephant tears and tiger spittle mixed by but those are for other purpose</div>
