Cho was recognised by friends as a boy of knowledge.'<br><br>And even though Cho was shy and reserved back then, Mr Kim said that he was a good dresser who was popular with the girls.<br><br>'Seung-hui could have been a popular kid, but he kept a distance from others on his own,' he said.<br><br>'I only have good memories about him.'<br><br>But all that must have changed when he entered high school.<br><br>His high school classmates' accounts add to the psychological portrait that is beginning to take shape, and could shed light on the video rant Cho mailed to NBC in the middle of his rampage at Virginia Tech.<br><br>In the often-incoherent video, Cho portrayed himself as persecuted and ranted about rich kids.<br><br>Northeastern University criminal justice Professor James Alan Fox told the San Jose Mercury News that Cho's background was consistent with the profile of a school killer - a painfully awkward, picked-on young man who lashes out with methodical fury at a world he believed was out to get him.<br><br>'In virtually every regard, Cho is prototypical of mass killers that I've studied in the past 25 years,' he said.<br><br>'That doesn't mean, however, that one could have predicted his rampage.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Virginia's handgun laws differ from other states<br><br>HAD Virginia State strictly followed federal regulations on gun sales, Cho Seung-hui may have never gotten his hands on the weapons that he used to kill 32 people, anti-gun advocates say.<br><br>Under the so-called Brady Law, convicted felons or those who are judged to be 'mentally defective' are barred from buying guns.<br><br>Critics insist that Cho shouldn't have been able to buy the guns because a judge had ruled in 2005 that he 'presents an imminent danger to himself as a result of mental illness'.<br><br>However, Virgina's handgun laws are slightly different from those followed by other states.<br><br>NOT RED-FLAGGED<br><br>In Virginia, a person is not red-flagged in the mental health system unless he forcibly committed to a mental hospital.<br><br>Since Cho was only ordered to seek treatment at an outpatient clinic, no record was made of his condition, allowing him to pass background checks.<br><br>Since a judge had ruled Cho to be 'mentally defective', Mr Paul Helmke, president of the Brady Campaign To Prevent Gun Violence, believes that he should have failed the checks.<br><br>'This event appears to have been preventable under the Brady law,' he said.<br><br>Virginia officials have argued that they did nothing wrong because they followed the state laws to the letter.<br></div>
