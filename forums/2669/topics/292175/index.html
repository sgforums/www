            <div class='col-md body'>The Bermuda Triangle is a strange and mysterious place in the southern Atlantic Ocean. It is roughly the shape of a triangle and it is said to have sucked planes and boats into its dark and murky waters. No one knows what happened to the planes and boats. When some enter the waters of the triangle they disappear forever.<br><br>The Bermuda Triangle is an imaginary triangle in the Atlantic Ocean. It starts in Florida and goes to Puerto Rico then to Bermuda then back to Miami. There have been many unexplained disappearances in that area, although many ships and planes go through safely everyday. There have been many disappearances including the WWII airplane squadron Flight 19. Other pilots have reported seeing little balls of light flying next to their airplanes. Some pilots have reported seeing wakes on the water caused by boats,(hundreds of them) but there were no boats in the water. The Mary Celeste was found with no one on board. Some of these mysteries have been linked to science, but what happened to Flight 19 ? There was never any evidence of airplane wreckage.<br><br>Many people have tried experiments, but no sure answer has been found. Christopher Columbus said that he saw lights in the sky, and his compass wasn't showing guidance at all. Some scientists believe that the light that they saw go into the water was just a comet that crashed into the ocean, and the compass problem might have been caused by wind or someone with a magnet. Some scientists explain some disappearances caused by natural phenomenon such as lightning or whirlpools. Some people even believe that there are under water causes that sunk some shipsa. One ship was found in a cave. Other people think that some ships went underwater and sunk into sand and are totally covered. The water is so deep that investigators may never know if that happened.<br><br>People think that air planes are sucked into a black holes and just disappear. The Black Hole hides behind a cloud. Although some people cross through it everyday, like military carriers and jets and cruises, people are still afraid to even go through it. Other people believe that UFOs have flown down and have captured all of the ships. No one has proved this, but many people have tried. People think that a small UFO has flown down and shot the space shuttle Challenger.<br><br>See all the details in <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/3717/" rel="nofollow">http://library.thinkquest.org/3717/</a></div>
