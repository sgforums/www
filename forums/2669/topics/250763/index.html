            <div class='col-md body'>For Mr Francis Eze, it was love at first sight. On the other hand, the woman he was dying for, was equally head over heels in love with him. After their first encounter, things began to take shape and they had a wonderful courtship.<br>So, it was time to seal the bond but Nkechi refused his proposal.<br><br>Instead, she told him to wait until she hears from the Lord. He waited patiently for more than five years and luckily he did not wait in vain. It was at this point that she eventually agreed to be his wife forever.<br><br>Daily Sun spoke with the couple recently .The husband, who was looking very happy and fulfilled, spoke first while his bettter half completed the story.<br><br><strong>How we met</strong><br>I went to church one day and discovered her sitting somewhere. I found out that she was one of the best among the women as I got closer to her. I also found out that she had a noble character. As a born again Christian, I prayed to God seriously to be convinced that she is my true wife before approaching her for marriage. When I was sure enough, I went to her and expressed my feelings. I must say that I felt on top of the world when I met her.<br><br><strong>Attraction</strong><br>Her height, intelligence and her character actually attracted me. It did not end there because I continued to study her to know more about her. In the course of our courtship, I found out that she is a true believer.<br><br><strong>Proposal</strong><br>I kept watching her and monitoring all that she does. When I was convinced and sure, I went close to her to know her feelings towards me. Although she was not the only woman I ever met, I proposed to her because I was convinced that she was what I wanted. It was a difficult task but God made it easy for me. Eventually, she accepted to marry me and today by the grace of God, we are happily married.<br><br><strong>HIV test </strong><br>We did and both of us were negative. We also did other tests and we were confirmed okay.<br><br><strong>Pressures</strong><br>Of course, as a man, and as old as I was, there were pressures most especially from my family. Many of them were looking up to me because I was from a royal family. Some people actually said to me, let us organise a wife for you but those things did not move me because at the end of the day, they will all run away.<br><br><strong>Then the wife speaks</strong><br>I liked him from the first day I saw him. When he proposed, I told him to give me time. This was necessary because I needed to seek the face of the Lord. I needed to pray concerning the marriage.<br><br><strong>What I like about him</strong><br>He is handsome, trustworthy and sincere. He is very reliable and understanding. My husband is any womanÂ’s dream and hope for a good partner.<br><br><strong>Advice</strong><br>I pray that God will grant the unmarried their heartÂ’s desire. The singles should always wait on the Lord for the appointed time to come to pass.<br></div>
