I just wanted to get to the interview so that I would have a new job,' said Ms Diana, who stopped working as a factory operator a few weeks ago.<br><br>But she never made it to the interview.<br><br>A passer-by saw her fall and called for the ambulance.<br><br>FRACTURED HEEL<br><br>Yesterday morning, she underwent surgery to insert a metal plate and some bone from her hip area into her fractured heel.<br><br>Although she was in great pain, she forced herself to take a walk around the hospital grounds.<br><br>'I don't want my muscles to become weak,' said Ms Diana, who is single and has two other siblings.<br><br>Her voice was hoarse from a bad cough. She appeared close to tears while speaking to us.<br><br>This was because whenever she coughs, sharp pain shoots through her heavily-bandaged foot due to her body movement.<br><br>When asked what she intends to do next, she said: 'I will just have to wait until my leg is well before I can go find a new job.<br><br>'I really regret climbing out of that window.'<br><br></div>
