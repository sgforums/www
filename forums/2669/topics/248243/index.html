            <div class='col-md body'>By Jane Smith<br><br>4/13/07 Â—<br>In what may be the biggest case of sex crimes against children in Crawford CountyÂ’s history, 28-year old David T. Cook of 1088 S. Main St., Meadville, entered 14 guilty pleas Thursday in the Crawford County Court of Common Pleas.<br><br>Law enforcement were alerted to the abuse after the children revealed it and it came to the attention of their mother.<br><br>Meadville Police Department, the Crawford County District AttorneyÂ’s Office and Children and Youth Services became involved, said Paula DiGiacomo, assistant DA, and used the child interview center for a joint investigation.<br><br>The center was established to allow victims to be interviewed at one time in a non-suggestive, non-leading manner, rather than having them repeat their statements multiple times, easing some of the trauma involved with these types of cases.<br><br>DiGiacomo called it Â“one of the largest, if not the largest,Â” criminal cases involving sexual crimes against children.<br><br>Cook, handcuffed and wearing leg shackles, stood before President Judge Gordon R. Miller, his head often bowed silently, as he confirmed he had committed each of the 14 offenses for which he was charged.<br><br>In exchange for the plea, 85 other charges were dismissed.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s one of the largest (cases) in term of the number of counts for sexual assaults in the last 13 years that IÂ’ve been here,Â” said DiGiacomo, who is the prosecuting attorney in the case.<br><br>Cook entered guilty pleas to six counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse with children, two counts of rape, three counts of criminal attempt to commit rape, two counts of criminal solicitation to have children commit a criminal sexual offense, and one count of indecent assault.<br><br>The charges involve three children Â— two boys, ages 7 and 9; and one girl, age 5.<br><br>Cook faces a mandatory five-year sentence and could face up to 425 years in a state prison and/or $335,000 in fines. Eight of the 14 counts call for a mandatory five-year sentence, but the court could make the sentences concurrent instead of consecutive when Cook is sentenced in July.<br><br>No date for the sentencing was set until Cook is tested by a state board to determine whether he qualifies as a violent sexual offender under the state MeganÂ’s Law.<br><br>Miller questioned Cook on each of the 14 counts, ensuring that Cook did in fact commit the offenses, saying he wouldnÂ’t accept a plea from an innocent man.<br><br>Cook told the judge that police had told him the court would Â“more than likelyÂ” go easier on him if he cooperated. However, Cook said he would have cooperated without that, saying, Â“I know I need help.Â”<br><br>Â“I just want this to stop,Â” Cook told Miller about why he voluntarily spoke with police when questioned about the incident.<br><br></div>
