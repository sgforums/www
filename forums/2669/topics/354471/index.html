              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Lucida Console, monospace;">The air hostess, as she passed along the aisle of the plane on the transatlantic flight from Amsterdam to New York noticed that the baby, nestled between the couple who were asleep, didn't look very well- in fact it looked extremely ill.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Lucida Console, monospace;">Not wanting to disturb anyone she gently lifted up the baby and took it back to her station. Feeling the baby's forehead, she found it was cold and with a sudden panic she realized that the infant was dead.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Lucida Console, monospace;">Calling upon a doctor she knew to be on board, he examined the baby and confirmed that, not only was it dead, but it was embalmed. The child's body had been hollowed out and it was full of the drugs that the couple were trying to smuggle into the States.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Lucida Console, monospace;">---------------------------------------------------</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Lucida Console, monospace;">A young lady is alone in her apartment. She goes to bed with her dog on the floor beside her. In the middle of the night, she is woken up by a strange sound. She is alarmed, but reaches down to the dog, who licks her hand.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Lucida Console, monospace;">She is reassured and goes back to sleep. In the morning, she finds the dog hung in the shower. Where the dog slept, she picks up a note which reads "Humans can lick too."</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Lucida Console, monospace;">---------------------------------------------------</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Lucida Console, monospace;">A woman living in the city [Salt Lake] was visiting some friends in Ogden. When she got into her car in front of this friend's house, she noticed that a car started up right behind her car.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Lucida Console, monospace;">It was about 2:00 in the morning, and there weren't any other cars on the road. After she had driven to the highway, she began to think that this car was following her.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Lucida Console, monospace;">Some of the time he would drive up real close to her car, but he wouldn't ever pass. She was really scared to death and kept speeding to try to get away from him.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Lucida Console, monospace;">When she got to Salt Lake, she started running stop lights to get away from him, but he would run right through them too. So when she got to her driveway she pulled in really fast, and this guy pulled in right behind her.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Lucida Console, monospace;">She just laid on the horn, and her husband came running out. Just then, the guy jumped out of the car, and her husband ran over and said, "What the hell's goin' on here?" So he grabbed the guy, and his wife said, "This man's followed me all the way from Ogden."</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Lucida Console, monospace;">The man said, "I followed your wife because I was going to work, and as I got into my car, I noticed when I turned my lights on, a man's head bob down in her back seat."</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Lucida Console, monospace;">So the husband went over to her backseat, opened the door, and pulled a guy from out of the backseat.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Lucida Console, monospace;">---------------------------------------------------</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Lucida Console, monospace;">Two roommates remain at their deserted college dormitory over a holiday break. One of the girls goes out on a date that evening, and the other one turns in and goes to bed before her roommate returns. Later that night the sleeping girl is awakened by gurgling and scratching noises coming from outside the hallway door. Frightened, she locks the door and cowers inside the room until morning. When the girl finally opens the door and ventures outside, she discovers the bloody corpse of her roommate in the hallway.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Lucida Console, monospace;">The murdered girl's throat had been slit, and she had bled to death in the hallway while clawing at the door.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Lucida Console, monospace;">---------------------------------------------------</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Lucida Console, monospace;">In Berlin, after World War II, money was short, supplies were tight, and it seemed like everyone was hungry. At that time, people were telling the tale of a young woman who saw a blind man picking his way through a crowd.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Lucida Console, monospace;">The two started to talk. The man asked her for a favor: could she deliver the letter to the address on the envelope? Well, it was on her way home, so she agreed. She started out to deliver the message, when she turned around to see if there was anything else the blind man needed. But she spotted him hurrying through the crowd without his smoked glasses or white cane.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Lucida Console, monospace;">She went to the police, who raided the address on the envelope, where they found heaps of human flesh for sale. And what was in the envelope?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Lucida Console, monospace;">A note saying "This is the last one I am sending you today."</span></p>
