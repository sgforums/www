Residents living there are not taking any chances.<br><br>And so three Taoist priests went from floor to floor to bless the block last Sunday.<br><br>The priests also prayed for the souls of those who had died, said Mr Chan Chee Hing, chairman of the residents' committee of Queenstown Hock San zone, which is in charge of the block.<br><br>He said in Mandarin: 'Many residents felt uneasy after five people died in two months.<br><br>'About 60 of them asked for rites to be conducted to appease the souls of those who died.'<br><br>HELPING OUT<br><br>Mr Chan, 65, said he helped the residents to organise the ritual and raise funds for it in his personal capacity.<br><br>Mr Chan has lived in Jalan Bukit Merah, just a stone's throw away, since the early '70s and has been involved in grassroots activities for more than 30 years.<br><br>As the block's residents needed help, Mr Chan stepped in, not as RC chairman but as a resident of the estate.<br><br>More than 500 people, mostly from the lower-income group, live in the block, which has only one-room HDB flats, Mr Chan said.<br><br>The rites started at noon and ended at 7pm.<br><br>A resident told The New Paper the priests started from the top - the 14th storey, and worked their way down to the ground floor.<br><br>Ms Chong Kwee Mui, 42, said in Mandarin: 'I waited on the ground floor while the priests went to every floor chanting.<br><br>'I've lived here for more than 20 years and this is the first time such a thing has happened.'<br><br>Ms Chong lives on the eighth floor with her aunt and mother, who are in their 70s. Her aunt donated $10 for the rites.<br><br>Another resident, Mr Tan Soon Chwee, 66, said he didn't chip in because he didn't have any money.<br><br>The retiree said: 'I am not scared even though there have been deaths here recently.<br><br>'If you don't harm anyone or do bad deeds, why be afraid?'<br><br>Over three weeks, $5,100 was raised to cover the costs of hiring the priests and buying ritual offerings.<br><br>Even those living in other blocks chipped in. Hawkers in the nearby coffeeshops and wet market offered money too.<br><br>The smallest donation was $4 while the largest amount was $250, donated by a woman who lived in Hougang but who worked near the block.<br><br>Mr Chan said: 'Although it was a Taoist ritual, people from other races and religions donated.<br><br>'They told me it was good as too many bad things have occurred in such a short time.'<br><br>The money was also used to buy incense paper and offerings, like a three-storey bungalow and a boat, both made of paper.<br><br>Together with 30 bags of incense paper and 'gold ingots' made of paper, they were burnt on Sunday night.<br><br>Mr Chan said: 'The boat was meant for the souls to sit on and then leave the estate.'<br><br>After going from floor to floor, the priests passed through the block's void deck before circling the block, chanting and ringing bells all the way.<br><br>Mr Chan said: 'The residents will have peace of mind now that the rites have been conducted.<br><br>'Hopefully, the residents will be protected and bad things will not happen in the future.'<br><br>Ms Chong said: 'I believe the rites can chase away ill-fortune.'<br><br>Mr Tan isn't so sure.<br><br>He said: 'Two of those who died were involved in traffic accidents. I don't think it can be blamed on bad luck alone.<br><br>'Some things jn be prevented. For example, if you are drunk, don't cycle on the road.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Recent deaths<br>1 Apr: Body of a woman found at the block. She was believed to have fallen from her 13th storey flat.<br><br>28 Mar: Mr Hoo Mong Tai, 67, died after an alleged fight with his flatmate. They lived on the 7th storey. His flatmate was arrested for causing death by a rash act.<br><br>27 Mar: The body of a 70-year-old man was found hanging from a tree near the KTM railway tracks, a 15-minute walk from the block.<br><br>1 Mar: A 51-year-old man was hit by a car on Alexandra Road at 5.47am. He died after being taken to hospital.<br><br>1 Feb: A 63-year-old man died after being hit by a taxi while cycling on Jalan Bukit Merah towards Queensway.<br><br></div>
