            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Former opposition figure J B Jeyaretnam on Monday got what is known as a "conditional discharge from bankruptcy" from the Court of Appeal.<br><br>This means he will be in the clear, as long as he pays up the full amount owed to creditors within three weeks.<br><br>The amount he owes is S$233,255.<br><br>Mr Jeyaretnam had been declared bankrupt in 2001.<br><br>He was not able to pay creditors after being hit by a series of defamation lawsuits in 1996 and 1997, including one by Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong.<br><br>Mr Jeyaretnam subsequently lost his seat as a Non-Constituency MP in Parliament.<br><br>He was back in the Court of Appeal to try and close that final chapter and be discharged from bankruptcy.<br><br>The court learnt that creditors had agreed to accept 45 percent of what was owed, but just how much money exactly that 45 percent translated into was disputed.<br><br>Lawyers for the creditors said it was just under a quarter million dollars but Mr Jeyaretnam argued he should pay about half that amount.<br><br>But the Court of Appeal asked both sides to come to an agreement on the amount that should be paid.<br><br>After the judgement, lawyers for the creditors said this was the offer they had made all along since last year but Mr Jeyaretnam had disputed the figures.<br><br>If it hadn't been for that, the matter could have been settled and Mr Jeyaretnam could have been discharged by now.<br><br>As for Mr Jeyaretnam, he said he was thankful for small mercies although the final figure was higher than he had expected.</div>
