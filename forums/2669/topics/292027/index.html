            <div class='col-md body'>A person who first called himself timetravel_0, then John Titor started posting on an Internet forum from November 2000 to 21st~24th March 2001. He told of a tale of him, a soldier based in Tampa, Florida from the year 2036 and went back to 1975 for an old portable computer, IBM 5100 from his grandfather to fix a clock error in UNIX systems that occurs in 2038. He also spoke of a civil war in the United States from 2004/2005 to 2015 when Russian Federation launched nuclear attacks on USA and starting a short nuclear World War III which kills 2 billion people of the world. He also gave details of his time machine (called C-204, fitted on a vehicle), various details on time travel, the US Government, Mad Cow Disease, US Civil Rights and the worldline of 2036 (the one John Titor came from).<br><br>He said that all time travel paradoxes are false and the everett-wheeler model of world is correct (i.e. infinite worlds of ourselves of every outcome). Therefore, doing anything in the past would not have any impact on a specfic worldline as such actions (i.e. killing your grandfather in the past will only create another worldline without your grandfather and yourself).<br><br>Eeriely, most of his prediction have came true, especially the one involving high level physics, black holes, quantum physics and about the US President's many "lies".<br><br>Is this person an elaborate fraud, or he is really a soldier selected to return to 1975 to procure a IBM 5100 from his grandfather and will the US [second] civil war start and the nuclear WWIII happen? Discuss.<br><br>Read more about him on:<br><a href="http://www.johntitor.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.johntitor.com/</a><br><a href="http://johntitor.strategicbrains.com/" rel="nofollow">http://johntitor.strategicbrains.com/</a><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Titor" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Titor</a><br><br>I personally believe he is real but we have the power to change the future of our worldline and hope the WWIII never happens.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Predictive failures<br><br>The posts were met with skepticism when they were being posted, but it was impossible to prove beforehand that they would not happen. Titor claimed the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics was correct, effectively meaning that his arrival back in time created a different "world" where things could occur differently. This makes his claims unfalsifiable. At any rate the predictions have failed to come true in this time line.<br><br>One of Titor's earliest claims was that CERN would discover the basis for time travel some time around 2001. This event did not occur. An article about miniature black holes being created by CERN (a recurring theme, also ascribed to Fermilab and Brookhaven at various times[14]) was taken by some to be evidence of this claim, but these events did not actually occur either. Civil war did not break out after the 2004 presidential elections, and though Titor claimed that the 2004 Summer Olympics would be the last to be held, the successful 2006 Winter Olympics demonstrated this claim to be wrong as well.<br><br>Equally problematic are the predictions Titor failed to make. In May 2007, Seattle-based dentist and time travel expert Dr. Bruce Goldberg, on Coast to Coast AM, brought up that Titor never tipped the world off regarding September 11, 2001.[15]<br><br>extracted from wikipedia...<br><br>it's mentioned that his predictions didn't come true <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think what John Titor saw was a potential of the future of what could have happen if humanity had been on the path of destruction. But humanity is now on the path of progression, peace and tolerance. There is cleary no room for war on such a path, as such, its highly unlikely that a war will take place in the near or forseeable future</div>
