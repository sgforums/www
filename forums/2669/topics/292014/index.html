            <div class='col-md body'>my frens told me this story:<br><br>I was taking a nap during the day and I awoke (why I woke up at that particular moment I don't know) to my husband standing beside my bed. Strangely enough he was drinking a 20-ounce bottle of soda and shaking his hips back and forth as if to say "Ha ha, I have a soda and you don't!" -- like a child would, I suppose. Immediately I became aggravated, and I sat up and yelled, "Louis, go away and leave me alone!" As I watched, fully awake and right before my eyes, my "husband" started to disappear from the feet up in a fashion that looked digital! I began to be able to see that "he" was made of little squares and they were quickly disappearing from his feet up until he was completely gone! I have NEVER been so freaked out in all of my life!<br><br>The other thing about this vision was that it was completely deathly silent. There was no sound at all and it was almost like there was a vacuum or as though the thing itself made everything around it even more silent. For example, my fan that was beside my bed didn't seem to be making a sound. I immediately went upstairs and called him on his cell. He was (and had been all day) in Alabama working! (He is a railroad supervisor).<br><br>The things I know for sure are: 1. That "thing" was NOT my husband. 2. I was definitely awake and not dreaming because I went directly upstairs after seeing "it." 3. I know the everyday term for these things are "doppelgangers."<br><br>I want to know more. What exactly is behind a "doppelganger"? What or who is it that makes them occur? Also, if anyone is an expert on these things, I would be interested to know why it chose to imitate my husband, and why the dorky childish "soda dance"? I have seen paranormal things in the past but to see evidence of a ghost makes sense -- you know what they are and pretty much where they come from. But this thing is just too bizarre to me!<br><br>What creeps me out the most about it...I wonder how long "it" stood over me while I was sleeping before I sensed it and woke up and saw it!!<br></div>
