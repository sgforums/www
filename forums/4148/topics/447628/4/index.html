              We won't know who will visit this forum, present or future.
              
              As long their is a direction, we will get there somehow, it is only the matter of time.
              
              I am glad to see topic on cultivation of Positivity., such topic will somehow generate positive energy and leading me to ply positively.
              
              There are too much talk, discussion on negative issue. Although it create a sense of "companionship", but it generate hatred, sickness over our customer as well. It consistently affect our mood when such incident happen again.

              BCL, how you know I do not have an elaborate website? How you know I do not have a pool of drivers?
                      
                      I am not the type to hao Lian or set up forum to advertise my number or recruit new members.
                      
                      Just to share with you, do you know that I can get a Maxi/high roof/Chrysler/Alphard in 5-15mins at most 25 mins? I never say does not mean I can't do.
                      
                      I am just try to share that there are many possibilities for the limo drivers, their mindset is just to fetch tourists and business visitors, have they thought of proms, d &amp; d and etc?
                      
                      No problem about digging info, as I mentioned, even if they start a new business t take our business, you think we will run road? Our business will still be there. Just take hotel for example, after MBS and RWS open, the other hotel in Singapore got run road?
                      
                      Must have an open mind, competition is always there and it will make us strive to do better...
                  
                  To add, I got money to burn, I do not need any shareholder. Thanks for the offer though...

              As of sharing of information, it is the main factor to attract viewer/reader and participant in the forum.
              
              Keeping all information and leaving only TCSS within friends in the forum, will not help the forum to grow. This might as well setting a Private Forum and conversation only done among Friends.
              
              There are always two side to any point of view, some see information leaking will harm, but i see it as Help.
              
              Information given are usually partial, it is not complete. For eg,
              Some might post 
              1) their one trip collection is up to $100, easy money. But they didn't tell you how long they got to wait for such "durian"
              
              2) some post it as a pleasure to do disposal job, sleeping job. But they didn't tell you about the boredom during the process.
              
              3) some can tell you they make $10,000 per month, but did they tell you the hardship they been thru?
              
              All these information, when disagree, can always reflect the other side of the story in our posting, but not discourage or even forbidden to reveal.

              <p>Wa BCL thanks for cuming. Are u suggesting we start something like Limo View ? And u volunteer to be octopus (controller) ? Wait next door throw parang how ?</p>
              <p>But seriously we needed an association of pte combis to come together to eradicate this $30 or $35 transfers. We need a body of members who will quote nothing less than CDG prices. 13-seater hiroof rates should be 1.5 - 2 times maxicab fare.</p>
              <p>There are too many limo drivers, many limo websites, but no standardisation of rates. Undercutting the market to earn a living is not the right way.</p>

              I would like to reiterate, Our intention was never to promote our own services. 
              
              F1taxidriver has his own website but he has never openly publicize his website.
              
              JDIL is self sufficient
              
              As for me, I am also self sufficient with my own clientele and also I have a website, I venture with many marketing platforms and I do not need any jobs from DHs.
              
              To open a forum to get business? Quite impossible, who would come into the forum and take down telephone numbers for remembering so that they can call for a limousine?
              
              Our nature of business is that we will not know what will happen tomorrow.
              
              Example, yesterday night, I do not have any jobs for today but at the end of today, I might have 4 jobs or 5 jobs.
              
              Somewhat similar to Taxi, when the pax need us, then they will call us. They don't go into forums t source for limo driver or limo.
              
              This is something about our trade that I know, I believe others know too. Get business from forums? Wait long long!

              <p>But seriously we needed an association of pte combis to come
              together to eradicate this $30 or $35 transfers. We need a body of

              hiroof rates should be 1.5 - 2 times maxicab fare.</p>
              <p>There are too many limo drivers, many limo websites, but no

              <p>We do not like competition, esp. from foreigner, cheaper foreigner. Since it is an already an Open Door policy, we can only learn to benefit from it.

              <p>i get this la that la. hahaha.</p>
              <p>Simply said , you dont wish to do jobs with 'suicide rates' , then you should explore the possibility of going straight to the source. </p>
              <p>Am i not right in suggestin having a website? Oh and if your hands are full , i can always lend a helping hand since i cho bo for 3/4 of my days. alamak like that tio liao ... haizzzz</p>
              <p>Its not about startin something like limo view, you have an issue with the low rates , then something has to be done in relation to the source.</p>
              <p>I hardly think setting up a forum here can change anything :D</p>

              <p>Every subforums or even the main Sgforums will have it's agenda

              <p>Tries after tries, only deemed unsuccessful will then be
              discarded.  Are we in the rush to built something in a limited
              time space ?  No !  We have at least 8-9 years to do

              <p>The subforum next door has been around 8 to 9 years yes. has anything changed?</p>
              <p>Other than getting a bunch of newbies in to come in and add on to the very crowded market , policies has not been changed 1 bit.</p>
              <p>There is a difference between being idealistic and practical.</p>
              <p>But JDI bro , it seems your owner isnt very receptive to criticisms coz the moment someone speaks out , he will bring out his credentials and capabilities haha.</p>
              <p>For that , i think i better jump back to other side and suan my prata man friend coz at the end of the day , when i and him bump into one another , its a round of chit chat + kopi.</p>
