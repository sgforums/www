              Last year, I was offer by this senior limousine driver to take up this new toy. Very tempting, but no money to venture new things. He show me the list of drivers going to confirm, 80% from Comfort, and mostly are very season drivers. I heard most of them had already put $1k confirmation fee. Than something happen, a lot of coffee talk, and most of the people who had confirmed wanted to opt out, than it die down, nobody wish to mention on this again after that.
              
              Maybe Prime found another set of drivers to launch this new toys. Not within my mean, so better don't think about it.

              I guess he should be popular among limousine trade if we are referring to the same guys. His sales speech number one, no doubt on that.  I don't go Zion Road for tea 
              break. Anyway, if I do have spare cash, maybe might be keen to try on it, but at this moment, definitely a no no.

              Today spoken to one of the cabby who had place the $1k fee for the Vellfire.
              His reaction is very piss off, curst and swear, and claim that on the day of delivery, he won't collect the vehicle, let the vehicle stuck there for 10 days, he rather forgo this $1k.

              <p>As the vehicle is running on Hybrid, there are actually <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">a few types of hybrid vehicle</span></span>s in the market.  </p>
              <p>Some may need daily re-charging the electric batteries, which means, alot of time will be wasted.</p>
              <p>It the vehicle is running on partial hybrid, then, the engine consumes petrol with a greater mileage as compared to other petrol-run engines.</p>
              <p>So, we really need some information here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              Currently depend on Comfort jobs a lot, 2 years of limousine only manage to secure one regular. Most so call regulars come and go, except this one stuck with me 9 months already. But I can forsee this Vellfire will be another Estima, failure story.

              Very true, on the deposit part, don't understand why need $10k, Vellfire can't be as costly as my mercedes, right?  and Comfort only required $1k for deposit. Although they claim can put $5k first, but with that sum of money, isn't it better to drive Comfort with lower cost and use that money as a capital to secure account job. How I wish I had $10k now, many opportunity need money to roll, without that, one had to be contended with company jobs.

              I don't think I could venture out from Comfort at this point of time. Many limousine drivers in Comfort hate to serve their corporate clients, but I look in different ways, like what you say, fast clearance, I took minimum 3 jobs, sometime 4, and payment will clear the next working days, which company or DH can do that. It actually indirectly solve my rental problem. Is there really so much quarantee jobs? Many people ask? They had to ask themselves, whether they are willing to put that little finger onto the MDT.
