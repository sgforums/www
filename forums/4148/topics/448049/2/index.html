              <p>At what daily rental then the limousine drivers are willingly to rent the vehicle ?</p>
              <p>When the new Maxi Cabs (Viano) came onto the road in June 2011, the daily rental is $155 (almost the same with the Chryslers)... should be able to survive... but why there are still TDs returning the vehicle ?</p>
              <p>Hence, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">daily rental must be priced reasonably</span></span>, affordable for TDs to make a living after deducting the daily operational cost (which is the rental + diesel + cash wash).</p>
              <p>If a TD can't survive, he will surely return the business vehicle asap.  If the TD failed to pay daily rental promptly, then the company need to look around for another TD to take he's place.  At the end of the day, if company is a listed company like CDG, they will need to answer to their shareholders the decision invest so much in these vehicles and they are not wholly rented out, right ?</p>

                  We understand the basis of COE. But didn't the rental inclusive of many factors and not just COE alone.  Diesel, road tax, insurance, maintainence..etc. Comfort using existing scrap vehicle's COE to replace a new vehicle. So definitely they have the sufficient COE to replace old vehicles, simple logic, one to one exchange only. Is just too bad that this period the COE price escalate too much, so to factor this different to current pricing, is really not fair. For Prime is different, they waiting for LTA allocation of COE to bring out the new taxi, so they are at LTA mercy hand. Maybe we will see another round
               of $50 COE, remember?  That month, so coincidence, Comfort came out the first 100 big/small headlamp mercedes.

              <p>That's why the last few rounds of bidding, Premier cab aka Silvercab went in bids higher than COE (category A) average prices, bringing the premiums higher.... (reported in the papers)...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              The very first thread created by Sam was locked by Fireice, so I thought nothing will come out from there, as I notice Sam was as new as me in terms of posting. Anyway, I totally agree that normal taxi forum and limousine forum cannot be together, why? In term of view, is really different. Many forummers will come in to read, but to totally understand what we are talking about, one must be in limousine driving himself to be able to feel the topics or else will be just like next door presently, rubbish.

              I'm not saying they can't post over here, I believe good threads attract hot debate, what I mean rubbish is some threads over there like ' where to find place to pee'..etc is really nonsense. I don't even bother to open up and read. And recently, they are happy to have more and more of this kind of "hot" topics.
