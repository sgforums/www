Most important the TD was safe, and my presence there stopped the robbery. Anyway the guy already run, the most appropriate thing to do is to observe him, which block he run and call the police.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Very easy to say what to do or will do, when not there? Anyway why must I give my pax a free trip after driving for 30 mins or so, he go 2 places somemore? Most important no injury and the threat was no longer present. The other party also never call police what more shuld i do. If he stay put at least I can support him. At least I went around after looking for the culprit.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Anyway why talk about free fare? You got do free service and standby at CC View? Priority is TD is safe and no robbery took place, he only lose a fare. Why should I also lose a fare? My bills who pay?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Talk so much for what....doing the correct thing is more important.</p>

No right? But come here post like internet warrior, scold this and that, curse this and that, all talk no action. And this for 1 of his best friends or 1 of the nicest ppl he's ever met, according to his words.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">At least I know if I got trouble, some of my friends will volunteer to go down to the scene the next day if I ask them, or they will do on their own accord. They will not be posting rubbish on the Net.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">How stupid can 1 be, 2 middle age men going to chase after the robber in his 20s? If he got weapon how? No injury and robbery already is the best thing in the circumstances, but no some ppl say they will do more, but never think or think thru their arse.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">You abandon everything and go after? That means a) you let the fare go (ok fair enough) b) will you lock the cab? c) will you wait for the other party to lock the cab?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Say 1 of you never lock and run after the guy who's already had a headstart, you run until pancet, and then walk back, suddenly your cab not there how? They robber go 1 round take your cab and escape? Or someone else take it and go for joy-ride? Who gonna answer for this? If the victim run never mind and his cab got stolen, but you only witness, your cab stolen, you think CDG, Transcab etc will be very nice and let the case go? You think insurance will cover?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Say you manage to catch the guy how, you fight with him, bash his head etc, he get injured how, serious injury? You think police will let you go? You think his defense lawyer will let you go? He kena charged 1 thing, you also hero will kena.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">1) Do not resist Surrender valuables if have to.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">2) Observe his description</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">3) Call the police immediately.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Did this driver do that? Nope maybe he never resist but 2 and 3 he never do. Here got 7000 strong police at your service at a call, but ppl don't activate them, activate Poolman, he's the superman who might or might not come to the scene, but be rest assured he'll post in support of you on the Net!</p>

              <p>Since story telling, let me tell the whole story, now I free (tom off). It begins:</p>
              <p>Friday nite sometimes I dont drive, because 1 like to do 5 nights driving (Tues to Thurs for hirer A and Sat?sun for hirer B). But this week my washing machine ki chia, plus got bills to pay so bo pian drive last Friday.</p>
              <p>Normally once after midnight say 230 onwards on Fri/Sat, CQ got many pax, I do short working trips like SBS buses. I wont do long ones, wait must come all the way back. But last Friday, it was still early, I think around 1 am or 2 am +, CQ still not fully packed. So lan lan join the queue. Knn then my turn, got 1 FT Indian guy and his Pinoy gf, but he actually ask me nicely can go Tlk Blangah and then Hougang Ave 3. What to do, queuing what must take, But once in, he slightly tipsy but still very polite, say thanks uncle blah blah.</p>
              <p>Anyway send his gf first then take CTE go Hougang. He was dozing off, finally reached Hougang Ave 3 near the rental blocks, he asked to stop at the bus stop. I observed a citycab taxi stopping at 1 end of the bus stop while I stop at the other end, abt 10-20 m away. Knn then this fella want to pay by Nets, so Nets la, but last friday I dunno why Nets got problem, earlier ok, but for the previous one and him, payment not approved.</p>
              <p>He then try a few times, so I was concentrating on him, thinking knn, this fella got money or not. Then my attention was drawn to the TD in front, he came out of his cab and walked over to my cab, not very fast I must say. His pax  a Chinese aged ard 20 + got out of the rear seat. I thought maybe he wanted change or something, I wind down my window, he tell me the guy tried to rob him.</p>
              <p>I open my door, the fella already run, I then told him, faster call the police and see where that guy is going. At this point the fella already running way. He then went back to his cab and began driving. My pax then asked me to drive over the opp side where got ATM so he can try. I move forward, no sign of the robber or taxi driver. I then went opp, while he withdraw I looking at the opp side, see whether can spot the guy. Then I think saw the TD again driving out of a carpark. My pax paid and left, I went over to the other side, thinking the driver will return back but he never, I then went into the nearby carpaks (hougang Ave 5 and 7) to see whether can spot the robber or the taxi driver.</p>
              <p>But no sign of either. I return a final time to the scene, the driver also not around and no police was activated. I call also no use, because I not the victim, the victim dont want to call, I call for what?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Now coming to the issues raised by our learned taxi mentor next door?</p>
              <p>a) Why I never help? Errm I think presence made the robber get cold feet, earlier he was alone with the TD @ the busstop.</p>
              <p>b)
               If he kena robbed, and then ask a fellow cabby for help, that cabby say
               call the police, he will fuck him, say 'you think I dunno how to call 
              police?' Very interesting way to ask for help, to ask and then fuck.</p>
              <p>Bbut
               do you know that most ppl when in state of shock, go blank and even the
               most logical thing dont do. Did BJ call the police starightaway (dunno 
              who did, he or passerby) or did he activate panic button? I think not.</p>
              <p>c)
               Said he will tell the pax, 'today is free trip for you' and then go 
              after the robber with the victim. Says money is not important. But when 
              his own best friend kena attack did he rush down? Nope he despatched his
               another 'junior', ok fair enough that's good or enough we say, but did 
              he forgo rental, his time and money and go to the assailant's supposed 
              place of residence over the next few days? Nope, he didnt forgo his 
              rental or his earnings, but instead went online ranting and blaming the 
              police, justice system etc. Even got the time to edit posts, but no time
               to forgo his money and be proactive on the ground.</p>
              <p>Coming back to
               this action I should have taken according to him. Let's see, here the 
              robber has a headstart, is much fitter, maybe is stronger or has a 
              weapon, is it correct to go after him, when the victim and me are 
              neither fit nor young? What happen if really say only 1 of us manage to 
              catch up with the robber (the other couldn't), say I try to apprehend 
              him, then he whip out a knife and attack me how? Here no injury took 
              place now become injury case.</p>
              <p>Or put another way based on his 
              idea, that tag team works better. Here tag team means, a) I must get my 
              pax to leave the cab, it will take a few seconds. b ) then I must get 
              out lock the cab c) the victim must do likewise. This whole exercise 
              will take say 20-30 seconds, the robber already run away, now he has a 
              headstart of say 1 miniute or more than 200m, wah we old men will become
               Olympic runner and manage to catch him? Say then we forgo points 2 and 
              3, just leave everything, maybe I even leave my pax behind in the cab 
              and chase after.</p>
              <p>Later lan lan, go here and there cannot find, or
               if find, must still be down there away from the unattendended cabs 
              until the police arrive. Say after come back, neither taxi is there how?
               Who gonna answer for that? Or say if the robber saw us coming run back 
              take the cab and drive off how? Or passersby take the cab for 
              joyride&gt; Say if either of them got involved in an accident and injure
               or kill somebody how? We both can kiss goodbye to taxi driving, our 
              families and other ppll hv to suffer, why? because we wanted to be 
              heroes!</p>
              <p>d) He says as an ex-cop I should know better and help 
              more. But what exactly does the police say to do in such cases? Yes, 
              exactly what I said.</p>
              <p>e) Finally should I hv collected my fare or 
              was I being selfish? The attempt already over, the driver went back into
               his cab to drive off, maybe he went to look for the guy. He also 
              suppose to call for the police and report any observations he sees of 
              the suspect. The police for this kind of case will respond pretty fast, 
              within 10 mins, maybe even 5 mins.</p>
              <p>That was the crucial part, if 
              done, why shouldnt I complete my fare and then go and join the driver 
              around the vicinity or at the scene if he remained?</p>
              <p>If say, when I
               was there, the robber and TD were struggling and he shouting for help, 
              or kena stabbed etc, then I must abandon my pax and cab also and go to 
              his rescue. If taxi stolen, leceh, but at least got justifiable reason. 
              But the danger not present anymore, then wanna be hero for what?</p>
              <p>Next
               door he only talk and whine and complaint, say will do this or that, 
              make big statements, trumpetting his own importance and points, but when
               dissected, all hollow.</p>

              <p>Do you know that all policemen are deemed on duty 24 hours not during working hours?</p>
              <p>Yet even the police teach their staff, dont be hero, you off duty, not ampai carry gun, dont go and intervene if dangerous. Observe, call the emergency services and render assistance if possible.</p>
              <p>Police also never teach their staff to be heroes. Even if you alone on duty in the police post and say a robbery happened in the next block, you're NOT supposed to abandon your post and go and help. Call for back up. If really must then you have to lock the post up, this of course takes sometime.</p>
