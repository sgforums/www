              <p>Maybe he only member of 1 forum, which he is a Mod. He doesn't know abt exchange of views, to learn and understand certain things. He should try being a Mod at EDMW, see how long he can last, or how many people will jump at the wild accusations.</p>
              <p>Only becos he's a Mod, he feels shiok. Plus the fact got teach a few newbies who follow his pattern, he become their mentor or chief, he shiok liao.</p>
              <p>Never realised TD driving got mentor, junior and senior one. Maybe next time I call my hirers senior also better.</p>

               edit to save his face. But doesn't save face, it proves the stupidity 
              even more and the childishness. Proves what I say when someone has the

              <p>From the topic: Taxi Forum Private or Public:</p>
              <p>I was chuckling with amusement with the latest events in this forums.
               So many threads deleted, and almost all of them threads which showed 
              the actions of a moderator that were illogical and wrong, rofl.</p>
              <p>For
               me it doesn't matter, delete my threads or posts, don't affect me - I 
              will either post a duplicate in the Limo Forum after given approval by 
              the Mod there (your say unlimited) or repost, or even ignore altogether.
               The more you delete, edit or lock the more it proves my point.</p>
              <p>I 
              was just curious whether the other Mod (Andrew) had anything to do with 
              this, but he denies any knowledge and has no involvement in the affairs 
              of the other mod, who is trying to turn this forum into a private one.</p>
              <p>Well
               if you want to have your own private forum or blog and post anything 
              that's your right, but once it's a public one, then there has to be 
              certain responsibilities.</p>
              <p>1) Post logically</p>
              <p>2) Do not challenge authorithy</p>
              <p>3) Do not listen to hearsay and take it as a true fact</p>
              <p>4) Do not affect the sensitivities of race or religion</p>
              <p>5) Be prepared to face differing views to your own</p>
              <p>6)
               Do claim knowledge of everything, state clearly it's your own personal 
              views or experience, but be prepared to accept the views of others who 
              may know better than you.</p>
              <p>7) Be humble</p>
              <p>8) Do not trumpet 
              your own 'good deeds' - self praise is an international disgrace. If you
               did good, the other party will post it here and thank you, you needn't 
              do it for yourself.</p>
              <p>9) Respect the rights of other posters, give 
              fair warning if you wanna delete or edit, don't think by deleting edit, 
              or as seen having the last word then locking means you have won. This is
               not a game of win or lose. This is a forum. It proves only 1 thing - 
              your immaturity when you do things like that.</p>
              <p>and finally)</p>
              <p>10)
               Do not post things about illegal activities or encourage such things, 
              like suggesting 'don't call the police when in trouble because the 
              police are useless - activate palringo or give the pax first, talk 
              later. This is a most dangerous advice and borders on criminal conduct.</p>
              <p>So
               you want start anew? Well let's see how 'new' things will be. If you 
              post sensibly, I've got no issues. If you raise your hands and say, yes I
               was wrong and am sorry, well goodonya.</p>
              <p>But if you post rubbish 
              or state claiming things without being backed by the facts and figures, 
              then sorry, not all of us here are 'ayam', if the cockerel crows, not 
              all of us will cluck in unison.</p>
              <p>Anyway I got it from another 
              forummer who complained that this forum has lost it's lustre with too 
              much rubbish posted and little tips or info for use of taxi drivers. He 
              also said that deleting certain threads wasted the efforts he posted in 
              trying to exchange information, he felt the mod's action was totally 
              wrong and disrespectful - I have to agree. And no this person is not Rbs
               but just an ordinary taxi driver too.</p>
              <p>So I leave it to the other 
              Mod to reflect. If he deletes this thread, locks it or edits, then it 
              only goes to show how shallow and immature he is. But maybe, just maybe 
              if he lets it be, then we can perhaps say he wants to change and change 
              the forum for the better.</p>
              <p>Let's see shall we...</p>

              <p>Hahaha, it didn't take long to delete and prove beyond doubt that all
               this 'new changes' purely fictional only to remove posts/threads where 
              the moderator's wrong comments were exposed as rubbish.</p>
              <p>Even the 
              other Mod (Andrew) came in to this thread and made a comment, he saw no 
              reason to do anything to it, because it got lieu and was fair comment, 
              but even his fellow Mod's comments and decision to leave it alone, he 
              don't respect. He deletes it, because it shows his immaturity.</p>
              <p>Tell
               others not to spend so much time on the forum and go and drive, but 
              look who's talking. He himself does it, spending hours, waiting to edit,
               delete and lock any post that proves him wrong.</p>

              <p>A new thread - Comedy Gold in Taxi Driver Forum:</p>
              <p>So the Supreme Leader of this forum can't bear to see or read 
              anything that criticises his opinions, he's taken to editing, deleting 
              and locking threads.<br><br>Nowadays I count every 1 deletion, editing 
              and locking as 1 count of childish behaviour on his part. Guess tonight 
              he's done it over 20x.<br><br>His latest desperate measure, locking every thread every night! He's actually coming in every other hour to edit/delete/lock. <br><br>I
               must thank him, I find this hilarious!  In all my years in so many 
              forums I never seen any mod behave this way. Pure comedy gold!<br><br>He will get up and delete this later, no worries for me. I want to see every thread I post deleted, it really amuses me.<br><br>For
               my dear Poolman who obviously likes to play childish games, I am most 
              prepared to entertain you. Uncle Joe always got time to amuse small kids
               and keep them occupied.<br><br>In case anyone forgets why all of this? 
              Well he started this by posting rubbish, questioning my integrity, 
              cursing the Law, deleting all the treads of others who took time to post
               and answer. He only wants newbies who will agree with everything he 
              says, no matter how wrong it is. He cannot accept a differing view.<br><br>No worries then<br><br>All cut and paste nice nice for you ok?</p>
              <p>Big
               baby Poolman, don't cry ok. Uncle Joe will play with you, make you 
              happy ok? Everyday you wake up, come find Uncle Joe ok and delete 
              Uncle's threads ok? Uncle entertain you la, so big also nobody to play 
              with you right? Now become Mod got chance to play child games, yay, 
              Uncle Joe happy for you.<br>B4 go to sleep come find Uncle Joe ok? Wake 
              up find Uncle Joe. Drive time also find Uncle ok? Uncle see how many 
              hours in a day you like to play, Uncle will help you.<br>Doing well 
              Poolman, don't sleep much ok? Got a lot of edit, locking and deleting to
               do. Uncle Joe waiting for you as always, keep you company, so you don't
               have to play by yourself.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #333333; padding: 0px;">Hi to everyone!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #333333; padding: 0px;">A short intro of myself - I'm Jeremy and I'm a sort of gay activist, in other words to promote the tolerance and understanding of gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender people or LGBT.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #333333; padding: 0px;">I have been asked by 1 of my friends to come in here and explain or clarify 1 or 2 things. I shall try my best and feel free to ask any questions and I may answer them when I am free or on my next visit.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #333333; padding: 0px;">My friend is a friend of a cabby and was told there's some kind of anti-gay feeling among cabbys in this forum. I was directed to this post. Sorry I haven't been able to read all the the previous ones or what has transpired up to now. So my answer will be based on what i read here and what I was told. Sorry if it's long but I think clear the air explanations might be long to emphasize a point or 2, I may have to make multiple posts. Ermm I noticed there's no spell checker here, so if I make some grammar mistakes, I apologise - we really have become too used to such things.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #333333; padding: 0px;">Ok first let me begin by what I was told. A cabby here was condemning others on being poor parents and scolding others on all sorts of things, and also some name calling. This caused the cabbys affected to do some digging and they found out from some sources that the person doing all this was actually gay. And he was married with kids and kept this from his wife and others. They then exposed him after finding out about his gay activity in another forum where he posts. I haven't checked out that forum but maybe I will in the coming days.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #333333; padding: 0px;">Now I have read this post from the start and it's clear that the cabby mentioned is Bingjames as he has posted his feelings above. But I am also confused about some things he says about policemen and abusing authority? But anyway let me just stick to what I came here for.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #333333; padding: 0px;">==============================================================</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #333333;">
              </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">There seems to be a lot of things here, but let me start with the most important.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">There's nothing wrong being gay or bisexual. Many gay men contribute to society and are law abiding, they even defend their countries. I am sure you read of brave soldiers fighting in wars and saving lives while being gay or bisexual. So please don't condemn gays for their orientation. They are humans too and have feelings like you and me. 1 gay activist I look up to is Alex Au - please feel free to read his blog, Yawning Bread. Mr Au has stood up for democratic rights for all Singaporeans besides just gay rights. In many ways, it's Mr Au who brough this AIM saga into the open.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">It takes time to discover that you're actually gay or lesbian. These feelings can begin at an early age or sometimes a person discovers it when they are older, even sometimes when they are married - in this case they are of course bisexual, since they have a wife and maybe kids as well. Myself I discovered it in my 20s and it took sometime to really discover the real me, if you get my drift.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The next important is coming out - Coming out refers when a LGBT person openly declares to the world - or to his friends, relatives etc that he is gay. This is not an easy thing believe me, even in more open countries like the US or Europe, what more Singapore. But despite what some LGBT say, I think Singapore today is much more tolerant of PLU - People Like Us, than it was say 10 or 20 years ago.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">It's really a hard thing to do to come out in the open and say you're gay or bisexual. You may get rejected or worse get mocked or ridiculed for being frank and open. It may cause relationships to fail and I know of some parents who totally reject their kids after being told so. Then of course there is religious associations that reject gay lifestyle choices but let's not go there.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">====================================================================</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #333333;">
              </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I'll make a small confession here, I have come out but not fully - that is my friends, colleagues etc all know I am gay but not to my parents, yes they suspect it afterall I'm nearly 40 and unmarried.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">But as a gay activist we generally advise gay people the following:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Come out if its safe to do so. That means if you're from a religious group that is very anti-gay, then maybe its better to keep mum.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Come out if the people around are matured and understanding. Come out if you are confident enough. And better to come out if you know someone is going to expose you.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">For bisexuals its a bit different:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">If you discovered your orientation early - as a kid, teenager or young adult, then perhaps its better you tell your partner if he/she is straight. And you must tell them this before marrying them. Why? Because if you fail to do so, it can wreck havoc to your marriage, it can be devastating to your wife/husband and worse to your kids. You must have the guts to explain this before marriage or at the very latest just after marriage, where a quiet divorce can be done if the other partner rejects it. But don't keep it silent until you have kids, it's very unfair and cruel to them.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">We in the gay community demand others respect our right to be gay but similarly what we must do is we must respect others right to be straight. So if you are going to marry a straight person, then shouldn't you tell them?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Of course if you marry another bisexual, then it becomes a lot easier and both parties should come clean with each other.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Finally there are the few cases where a person only discovers his/her orientation after marriage or in adulthood. Here the advise is subjective and on a case to case basis. If you think coming out will cause damage to your spouse and kids then its better to keep silent until a time when the kids are older. But generally we would advise that at some point its better to come clean than live a lie.</p>

              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong>Bingjames</strong> I am not sure which discovery category you are in, but I think its safe to say you are married with kids and a bisexual. If you discovered you were gay or bisexual early before marriage then you should have told your wife that, shouldn't you? If you have told her already and she accepted it, then hey, that's the best thing right? Everyone is happy.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Next then is marital fidelity or for gays/bisexual</span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"> - being faithful to 1 partner. You will find that almost all gay activists promote this - being faithful to one partner. If we want gays to be accepted as normal people then we must also behave normally - that is be true to your partner and not sleep around.</span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">So<strong> Bingjames</strong> I think you best can answer this question as I as know little of transpired before this. Are you faithful to your wife after marriage? You see you were the one who made the choice to marry if you knew your orientation before marriage. You must again make the choice of being faithful, either to her or if you have a gay partner, to him. It's not fair to either party, if you keep silent, or worse if you have multiple partners.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Then we must also caution on unprotected sex if you have multiple partners. Do you use a condom, have you gone for regular screening for stds?</em></span></strong></p>

A person's sexual orietantion has nothing to do with his/her character or their jobs. And even a cabby can be gay, lesbian or bisexual.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br>As for parenting, gays, lesbian and bisexuals can be good and even great parents too. So that should not affect bingjames giving parenting advise, provided he too has come clean with his orientation to his spouse and eventually to his kids.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br>My personal advise to <strong>bingjames</strong> is you shouldn't be name calling and judging people or doubting their parental skills. To each his own, right brother?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br>As a bisexual man, you should stand proud, dispense good advise and not mock others. You must remember that the straight communtiy also have a right to demand that we in LGBT movement behave civilly and properly with them, if we want their respect.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br>Ok I think this should be enough food for thought. Feel free to ask questions.<br>Bye bye and remember - 1Love</p>
