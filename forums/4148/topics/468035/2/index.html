              <p>I older, they younger 20 + only still not strong enough. Bo pian next morning called the rental company, they send tow truck. The ah chek come also say, you deffo cannot unlock the tyre lah, this one machine tighten. 1 min all he took to unlock with the motorised drill.</p>
              <p>So if your company fixed the tyres very tightly bo pian must call tow truck also, but must explain why need to.</p>

              <p>Once a upon a time, I was very close to my headman. Those days when younger, every week also got taichi, at least 1 month 2 or 3 times got fight.</p>
              <p>Then when he become older late 30s and early 40s already, sometimes middle of the night also got ppl call say got taichi. I also advise him, now not young anymore, got children somemore, go and fight maybe got bigger problem, best is call for police. He also do that, unless really have to go down then will go, that also not to fight but to sua. See can settle thru talking not fighting. His sized like hammer one, also got hot temper, but he also know that age catching up.</p>
              <p>Another time, 1 of our closest friends, a fellow policeman kena kidnap ( yes kidnap).

              <p>Everything over, he come and call us say this happened, we all hot liao want to go find the fellas, roughly know sit where. But he said never mind, he made police report, let police handle first. If really nothing done, then we can take action another day.</p>
              <p>In the end, the police did work and arrested the culprits, some kena like 4-5 years plus rotan. So did he and we do the right thing by not getting hot blooded? Of course.</p>
              <p>Now after many years, some times, we actually bump into the group, usually individually, they also never do anything, we also never.

              <p>If u are OTR and the tyre punctured suddenly, my advice is..... drive to the Expressway .. and park on the road shoulder.....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>If your vehicle breakdown or got problem, after following normal procedures, like parking 1 side, hazard lights etc, call the LTA @ 1800 - Call LTA. They will despatch marshals and tow truck to scene and tow to nearest exit carpark. Sometimes b4 you call, they are aware and will come down on their own.</p>

              <p>Because the Chief Justices of the forum have decided, which posts are relevant and which are not. Like the court throw out evidence gained faultily or wrongly, there also like court, will throw out threads not to their liking!</p>
              <p>But never mind la, some ppl find satisfaction with some form of power, even if it's only in the virtual world, not in real life. Real life they cannot exercise power, so any chance to have some, very steam liao!</p>
              <p>Like I say to myself when stopping a pedestrian crossing, some ppl very yaya, walk slow, give you 1 kind of look, never mind la give them chance, knn whole life nobody gives a fuck to them, here at least they have some feeling of power or shiokness, because all vehicles have to stop and wait for them.</p>
              <p>A moderator is a very high rank in a forum, you know! Especially in such a powerful forum as the Sg TD forum. Everyone come and read, even the big shots from Govt body. Dun play play ar!<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
