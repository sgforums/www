              <p>It is a cycle....</p>
              <p>1) I sounded that Fellow that C&amp;C has a last unit of Vehicle at $190,000 (was quoted at $218,000).</p>
              <p>2) That Fellow placed booking for a discounted vehicle.  Still pressed for more discounts and goodies, even wrote an email to C&amp;C telling the admin that Sale Agent trying to mislead him to buying vehicle - should include 1st month installment &amp; Insurance premium.</p>
              <p>3) Agent - got his insurance broker to quote (less discount from agent's pocket).  At last minute - This fellow told agent he has already got his own insurance (monthly payment).  Agent TL - kena played out again.  Agent called me... F me for introducing a Tai-Ko to him......</p>
              <p>4)<strong> It is my fault for introducing F1-taxidriver</strong> to purchase the new Viano that saved him $28,000 ???</p>

              <p>The agent assisted him in bidding for his vehicle number which is not compulsory.</p>
              <p>The agent also paid for his tinted windows &amp; replaced a new set of lights (which included the new LED day lights for Viano), 3M car mats.  Easily cost more than $3k from his pocket.</p>
              <p>He even tried to squeeze a $3.5k insurance coverage from agent.  (Hello, your car is sold at a $28,000 discount already.... did you remember or forgotten?)</p>

There is always a limit on things we do.... we don't go over board, (If I want, I can). but we always left a way out for that somebody.  When he emailed a letter to C&amp;C admin, did he think it over before sending out ?

              <p>JDIL terminated the relationship a while back. He is a fellow with a weird temperament. Writes alot of things here. Sibei eng. It all started with a comment about limo jobs. I said I was not going to pass him limo jobs, because after 3-4 attempts, he was always busy with his clients. That statement got into him, until now. I feel bad for him. Anger eats into the angry person. Immediately after this, JDIL took a long leave of absence from this forum.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But lets be clear about several things. I never denied JDIL the free dinner. He terminated all communications. How do I thank someone who left in a rage <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> ? JDIL got big ego, so it was clear he will not want my free dinner. Just look at what he had written.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How do I treat someone who terminated all communications before I even got the car key <img style="border: 0px initial initial;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png">  ? He does not even want coffee.... So how to repay the kindness ? Refused to pick up his handphone too.... <img style="border: 0px initial initial;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> Immediately after that, he posted a comment above. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for car insurance, it is my right to choose my insurance agent. I chose that company because the legal coverage was significantly better than what the in-house insurance company could offer me. I paid the car salesman an ang bao as compensation for his loss from the insurance sales. How can this be tai-ko ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the freebies....  All I got was a xenon headlamp, but that was already costed into the car price. It was included and documented when I placed the deposit. The other 2 white cars were sold to 2 separate limo owners at a $1.5K discount, so that accounts for it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Solar film is not free, I paid for it in full, separate from the car sales.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My car did not come with a free 3M car mat. Just the normal C&amp;C black car mat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Salesman promised the car kit, but none was given in the end.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Salesman claimed only my car got cruise control, but after checking with the other recent SK-plate and PC-plate owners, I realised they also got cruise control.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now lets talk about limo jobs. I passed JDIL several jobs before, but he was always busy. Not even once he accepted. It shows how good his business is.... Same thing for Sam Seah. Do they need my jobs? Of couse not. So I passed most of my jobs to another friend whom I had known since childhood. I do not owe JDIL nor Sam Seah anything, vice versa. No further explanations nor justifications are needed for my actions. Its a free world. All I did was one arrival job for JDIL. None from Sam Seah so far. Really it is no big deal. We all got our own things to attend to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for forum moderator, I never begged to be one. It came freely, it was removed freely. Where got so much time to come here and read everything and moderate ?? Let some else take over better. Thank you.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>My elder brother is in Borneo , i recommended an old NS friend
              to him to buy a vios. unknowing to me , this chap went to see my
              brother . Demanded sports rims , floor mats , tinted windows and a
              host of other stuff and also a steep discount!</p>
              <p>My bro calculated after everything he will end up losing $ on
              the deal, the only saving grace is that he will achieve his monthly
              sales quota +1.</p>
              <p>Best part is he went to tell my bro , Nissan can give him this ,
              honda can give him that wtf? might as well save all the trouble and
              get from nissan or honda right?</p>
              <p>so i got a call from my bro also , complaining to me how come i
              have friends like that . then i called this guy and gave him a
              piece of my mind!</p>
              <p>I didnt earn anything from this deal but i feel TL when my bro
              is made to go thru hoops and loops for someone who is trying to
              squeeze everything out .</p>
              <p>how abt driving  your pax around the whole island and then
              have him bargain with u until u 1 cent also dont make??</p>
              <p>so i understand how JDI feel coz i been thru it.</p>

              <p>JDIL terminated the relationship a while back. He is a fellow

              <p>How do I treat someone who terminated all communications before

              <p>As for car insurance, it is my right to choose my insurance
              agent. I chose that company because the legal coverage was
              significantly better than what the in-house insurance company could
              offer me. I paid the car salesman an ang bao as compensation for
              his loss from the insurance sales. How can this be tai-ko ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the freebies....  All I got was a xenon headlamp,
              but that was already costed into the car price. It was included and
              documented when I placed the deposit. The other 2 white cars were
              sold to 2 separate limo owners at a $1.5K discount, so that
              accounts for it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Solar film is not free, I paid for it in full, separate from the
              car sales.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My car did not come with a free 3M car mat. Just the normal
              C&amp;C black car mat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Salesman promised the car kit, but none was given in the
              end.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Salesman claimed only my car got cruise control, but after
              checking with the other recent SK-plate and PC-plate owners, I
              realised they also got cruise control.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now lets talk about limo jobs. I passed JDIL several jobs
              before, but he was always busy. Not even once he accepted. It shows
              how good his business is.... Same thing for Sam Seah. Do they need
              my jobs? Of couse not. So I passed most of my jobs to another
              friend whom I had known since childhood. I do not owe JDIL nor Sam
              Seah anything, vice versa. No further explanations nor
              justifications are needed for my actions. Its a free world. All I
              did was one arrival job for JDIL. None from Sam Seah so far. Really
              it is no big deal. We all got our own things to attend to.</p>
