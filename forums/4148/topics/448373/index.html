              I believe many had gone through all parts of the world
              
              Singaporean tends to compare taxi services in various countries, let's share the experience.
                      
              Last December, I was at Gold Coast via Brisbane. If you think Singapore taxi expensive, try Australia one, your balls will drop.
                      
              In Brisbane, taxi is territory, various companies plying various parts of Brisbane, nobody are allowed to venture in to others territory, mainly like Singapore, various companies determine by colour. Of course if you need a cab to travel beyond the cabbies territory, his term and condition will lay down to you, that include his meal, his lodging and his wages.
                      
              Normal taxi plying on the road also run by meter, you won't want to know how their meter jump, very clear decal, they will explain all the tariff like what we do, but there's this wording, they particularly written in bold, '$0.10 per second '
              
              And their cabbies usually will take the most longest route to your destination, why? Imagine per second jump is $0.10, just meter jump alone will make your heart beat jump like hell.
                      
              When I try negotiate terms with this cabby to take me from Brisbane to Gold Coast, guess how much? $1,600 Aus, that include his meal, lodging and empty cab back. Imagine between Bris-Gold Coast only 100 over km.
                      
              Is quite an experience for me on their taxi services, and hotel concierge even advice me to engage limousine service for transfer to airport, just $50 Aus, and is quarantee, the cabby will wait unti you on board and for every 5 min of waiting charges is cool additional of $10 Aus.
                      
              I took a cab out from Airport upon arrival, meter running and the bill came out to $156.70 Aus. So decided to listen to concierge advice, book a limousine, came down promptly, at least when I on my way back Singapore, I know I had save that cool $100 Aus.
                      
              FYI, I'm on free and easy tour, so everything's got to settle myself.
              
              Cheers!

              <p>I don't travel much even with my previous job before my "downward curve days" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">.  </p>
              <p>I really wished I could travel more often - but at my my current capacity, I guessed I can't do that because I'm having a contract obligation with my regular guests.</p>
              <p>Been to Hong Kong, Macau.... probably my furthest venture away from home sweet home.  In Hong Kong, public transports like their MTR is so efficient, you dun even need to own a car even for most of their residents.   There are plenty of taxis too.  </p>
              <p>Limousine taxis ? Not common there.  Probably Pte Limousines, saw a few websites offering services.  May go Hong Kong again maybe at the end of the year or early next year.... (cos) my accommodation there is FOC...(my brother work there). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
