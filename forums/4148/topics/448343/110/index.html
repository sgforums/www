              <p>No no, they are friends, I am the outsider, I drive for 2 friends. Both old timer Chinese, very decent, never scold pax, humble and cincai.</p>
              <p>Fetching not a problem, but I start suka suka one, so don't want a hassle of fixing a time. Only sometimes when I want to start promptly, then I ask for fetch.</p>
              <p>My weekend hirer on the ball one, every day drive, because got young family (he marry Viet woman) He will return the cab before 6 and will start around 6 to 6.30 every morning, so for him, I also never return late (anyway I seldom drive late except sometimes Sat after returning to watch football I go out around 2 am until 5.30 - 6am.</p>
              <p>My weekday hirer is more of semi retirement mode, before he started around 930 to 1030 am, but because of mileage law and timing now he start around 8.30am. He sometimes return later abit say 615 to 630pm, but no issue because I never start so early, but if I want to return later than 6am also no problem, because he wont start so early. We just sms and inform if late, no issue.</p>
              <p>Very easy for me with them, everythng they do, top up diesel, wash car etc. I just wipe inside and clean the windows and pay $2 extra for the washing for weekday. Because he calculate the whole day diesel usage and divide according to mileage, I only pay yesterday's diesel today, unless I drive full day sometimes, then we both top up full tank for each other.</p>
              <p>For weekend, he go by diesel per litre per km, so he charged 11cts at the start, I pay 13cts to include washing, now because price go up, I pay 14cts (for his price of 13cts).</p>
              <p>Everything easy for me, they make it like that. I just take the cab and return the cab, they handle everything, save me a lot of time and hassle, I couldnt ask for more.</p>
