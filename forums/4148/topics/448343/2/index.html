              <p>Share one encounter I had that early moring.</p>
              <p>Got a 45pts departure on that early morning, suppose to pick up from his home, but change location to St James Power Station.</p>
              <p>So I guess early morning in St James should be having beer too much through the night.</p>
              <p>Upon on board, the alcohol smell is unbearable, no choice, accerate a bit faster and pray hard he won't vomit in my taxi.</p>
              <p>Reach Terminal 3, cause he only having a suit case, guess should be going for a short trip, so just waiting for him to pay the fare and hope that he Fxxx off from my taxi asap.</p>
              <p>To my frustration, he was so drunk that every movement was dame bloody slow, he slowly took out his wallet, and I can visibly see stack of note in his big fat wallet.</p>
              <p>And shockness came next, in very slow motion, he took out the stack of note from his wallet, mostly in 50...and he started to count while slowly passes the note to me...</p>
              <p>Never realising his hand was holding a stack of $50, he started to count and pass piece by piece to me.</p>
              <p>5...10....15......20......25.......30.........35........40</p>
              <p>By that time, my hand was shivering cause now I'm holding a cool 8 pieces of $50 amounting to $400....</p>
              <p>At this moment, I know that he had mistaken the $50 note to $5 note, still in the stage of shock, he suddenly shouted! SHIT! I owe you 5 butt, than I realised there's no more note in his hand anymore.</p>
              <p>Never mind sir, next time we see each other than you pay me back...I quickly come out from my taxi, run over, open his, make sure he came down and left nothing in my cab, run back to my seat, step my accerator and zoom off as fast as I could...</p>
              <p>And for that very morning, is my first and also last trip of the day, straight drive home and sleep with heart laughing...</p>

              <p>Share another encounter with you guys.</p>
              <p>That afternoon, pick up an old lady along Sungei Road, very ordinary old folk, dress sloppy like a old nanny, and look something like a samsui woman, I guess, must have just finish her day at the flea market.</p>
              <p>Upon on board my cab, she told me she's going to,</p>
              <p><img src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ8H7eNQuSccP6h_rACUZxGCmB9AEBrSgq0RUcwNFgpEr9ZLgw4hw" alt="" width="240" height="118">.at Alexandra Road.</p>
              <p>My heart thinking, most likely she's reporting her duty as a cleaner there.</p>
              <p>Throughout the whole journey, we never talk or chat.</p>
              <p>When reaching the destination just before turning in to the lobby, suddenly she pointed to a,</p>
              <p><img src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSMsiJVSRpNXjcKXi79Dj3cRnTd6cPCYPUcYUTAYWJ1CGrhueze0Q" alt="" width="259" height="194">..and say "My car ready"</p>
              <p>In my heart was thinking "she crazy or what"</p>
              <p>Anyway, after dropping her, I continue plying the road without thinking much of that.</p>
              <p>A few hour later, I notice my tyre need some air as I can feel the wobbling of my vehicle.</p>
              <p>I drive in to SPC station along Bukit Timah Road to get my tyre fixed.</p>
              <p>While I was busy dragging the air hose here and there, suddenly someone horn at me.</p>
              <p>OMG, a S350 actually horn at me and I thought I had blocked his way or what.</p>
              <p>Than a old lady came out from the vehicle who look so familiar to me.</p>
              <p>"Hi, remember me, just now you sent me to collect my car, I'm staying around here"</p>
              <p>At that very moment, I feel so pai seh that....</p>

              <p>And it really teaches me, never judge a person by the looks.</p>
