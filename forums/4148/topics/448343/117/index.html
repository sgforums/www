              <p>The SIA story:</p>
              <p>This guy - 1 small man was i/c charge of all the overseas claims of flight attendants. In SQ, they will pay your basic pay according to you rank and years of service, which is quite little actually, around 900 - 1500 a month.</p>
              <p>You make the money on the flight allowance - genrally the further and longer you travel, the more you will earn.</p>
              <p>After each flight or a few flights, you have to submit your travel claims by a certain date to this guy, let's just call him Mr See, so it can be paid by a certain date, or you can just submit it later and it will be paid. Since there's no way you will be doing the same flights every month, you salary can fluctuate a bit depending where you are assigned to.</p>
              <p>There it's really up to you to maintain a record of your travel claims as SIA cannot afford to spend long man hours data filing all this.</p>

              <p>Mr See was in charge of doing this for a long time. It just so happened that 1 day he made a mistake, he submitted a claim twice and it was paid twice to the recipient, who in honesty informed him and the money was deducted back.</p>
              <p>This was how the idea hatched. Since the volume of claims was quite huge and not possible to track all of them, what he did was simple, say for my friend (who actually awas a crew) went to Amsterdam and upon return filed the claim with Mr See.</p>
              <p>What Mr See did was : 1) prepare the original claim and thus ensure my friend got paid into his bank account and as such will never complain and b) made a duplicate of the same claim and gave another account - initially his, then his wife then his mistress's.</p>

              <p>Plus the claims in itself was not suspicious, he always kept to the lower figures like the $200 to $400 figures sometimes lesser amounts, at no time did it hit the tens of thousands or something that would raise the auditors eyes.</p>
              <p>And he obviously didnt do it for each and every claim, maybe every 10th claim or even more like every 20th claim. He was also friendly and nice and was careful not to make enemies, so no one had any reason to complain, plus he had many years of experience behind him. And he did it for years!</p>

              <p>The true story of 2 friends (Crime story), this incident came to light in the late 90s:</p>
              <p>The names, ages and location have been changed.</p>
              <p>Once there 2 friends, Ah Tee and Ah Kau, both were childhood friends and their friendship extended into adult life. Ah Kau eventually got married and bought a flat in Bedok. He had 3 kids, an eldest daughter (Jane) then aged ard 14, a younger one (Lisa) ard 10 and a boy 6 (John). Ah Tee remained a bachelor.</p>
              <p>As a close friend, Ah Tee would come and go and was treated like an uncle by Ah Kau's kids, and a brother in law by his wife. Ah Tee would always be welcome at Ah Kau's house and sometimes would also help babysit the kids, if the parents were working.. In short he was like a family member.</p>
              <p>1 day during a visit in the afternoon, Ah Tee was again alone with the kids, when John demanded they play hide and seek. So Ah Tee and the 2 sisters entertained him, they went to hide while he counted. This time they hid inside a cupboard, Ah tee and Jane, while Lisa in another one.</p>
              <p>Due to their close proximity, Ah Tee began to feel aroused by Jane's tender body, and he hugged her and kissed her. She didnt resist andactually seemed to enjoy it.</p>
              <p>This was the start. Soon the visits became more touchy feeling, it descended into  oral sex and finally sex itself.</p>
              <p>Sometimes she would lie to her parents that she was staying over at her freinds, when she actually would be spending the night with Ah Tee in a hotel. On other occassions, Ah Tee himself would bring Jane out with the other kids, or just lke fetch and send her, since he was considered family.</p>
              <p>Ok continue later.</p>

              <p>Story cont'd.</p>
              <p>So this dangerous affair carrried on for some time, then Ah Tee suddenly felt guilty. So he stopped going to Ah Kau's house and disappeared.</p>
              <p>After a few months, Jane herself cannot tahan ( I'm sure you know that women after experiencing it for the first few times, might want it even more than men), so she tried to locate his contact no, but changed. Eventually she managed to find his address from her father's personal diaries. So she went to see him at his place.</p>
              <p>But Ah Tee couldnt resist the temptation, and the sex and the affair started all over again. Sometimes, she lie to her parenst say got camp in school but stay at Ah Tee's place over the weekend.</p>
              <p>Then what happened?</p>

              <p>Well the obvious, young virgin girl having unprotected sex repeatedly = pregnancy.</p>
              <p>She started missing periods and then feeling nauseous, when she tried to inform Ah Tee, he panicked and again went missing. So Jane didnt know what to do and confided in her sister Lisa, who did the right by informing Ah Kau.</p>
              <p>Imagine the horror to Ah Kau and his wife. He went to find Ah Tee, keropk him and lodged a police report.</p>
              <p>Ah Tee was arrested and eventually jailed I believed ( I only got the details up to the point of arrest).</p>
