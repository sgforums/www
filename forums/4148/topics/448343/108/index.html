              <p>This thread is a classic example why I have stayed away. It seems 
              this forum has changed. Every thing also edit, everything also close 
              thread, but if certain ppl do or say some things can one.</p>
              <p>This goes to both Poolman and Ang, as moderators. Is this LV forum, a Poolman forum or is it an sgforum?</p>
              <p>We
               are all adults here, like what RBS said forum is to exchange idea and 
              opinion not to encourage havoc. But it seems some ppl can encourage 
              havoc and post certain things but others can't.</p>
              <p>Pls la we are all
               adults here, not just young adults but some of us are already in our 
              40s and 50s, maybe even 60s. Adults can and should speak their mind, 
              even if it upsets 1 or 2 ppl, so be it, provided the person giving is 
              prepared to receive. As long it doesn't insult a race, religion or 
              encourage hate and violence, it should be fair game.</p>
              <p>As adults we 
              can judge whether what 1 says got lieu or not. A forum should be left 
              untouched as much as possible, not just in support of some people or 
              groups who can say what they like, but when they get answered back, the 
              thread is quickly edited or closed.</p>
              <p>Remember when you left this 
              forum because of Fireice's constant meddling? It seems that now the very
               things that you didn't like her doing, you and Ang are doing. Just 
              because she doesn't come and intervene anymore, desn't mean you have a 
              license to post inflammatory things, which she definitely would have 
              intervened for in the past.</p>
              <p>If she had her way, this thread would 
              have been closed long time ago. In fact if somebody else posted a thread
               like this, I think you or Ang would have closed it, very quickly. Why 
              the double standards? Think about it.</p>

              <p>Just because a cabby is assaulted, and say the police can't or don't do anything. Do you think can carry baseball bat and use that to hammer people? Go and try la, next time somebody assault you or your friend and you use a weapon and claim self defense.</p>
              <p>Just because justice is slow to catch up for your case, can you take the law into your own hands?</p>
              <p>And then the talk cock story abt ang mo woman knocking down a Korean and her child which resulted in death and the ang mo was found not guilty, what has that got to do with BJ case? What has that got to do with justice or miscarriage of justice? And the judge go down to the scene some more means the judge is trying to help an an Ang Moh and won't do the same for Singaporeans?</p>
              <p>Did you read the full facts of the case or just the newspapers abt it? Pls la, this is like a child's argument. Perhaps the defense lawyer raised the issue and asked the judge to go down? Or the judge used his own initiative, which is good isn't it?</p>

              <p>I once attended a fatal accident, a rich local student studying Australia knocked down and killed a Bangla in Seranggon Road. He also act yaya a bit and can't remember whether he got drink or not, I think he did. Anyway he claim Bangla dash across and he couldn't stop. I arrested him and told him, I will make sure he pays for it.</p>
              <p>Then sometime later TP IO called me up. We had a friendly chat because fellow officers, but he said he cannot prove the driver's version is wrong. No independent witness came forward and the facts seem to indicate the bangla did dash suddenly without looking. Even the drink driving couldnt prove because % was too low for it. He could only summon the driver for careless driving at best.</p>
              <p>So does this prove the law is fucked up? Is the law favouring the rich guy? Of course not, the law is fair to everyone. It's up to the police and prosecution to prove their case without reasonable doubt. The defense only has show that there is such doubt.</p>
              <p>Maybe the Ang Mor woman was right, it was dark and at a corner ( I remember that case and the location). Maybe she really never see as it was dark the korean child unfortunately stood on the road. It's up to the prosecution to prove otherwise and they couldn't and she got away. Is this an injustice? No it was an accident, not that the Ang Mor woman was looking to hit and kill somebody.</p>
              <p>But to our Poolman this is injustice and shows the poor standard of the law, that it only sides with foreigners. Pls la, you tell this to some 10-12 year old they will believe but some of us can think.</p>

              <p>Ya we know this happened to your friend and you're upset and sympathetic, fair enough, who wouldn't if it happened to us. If my friend kena bashed up, I also would be angry and demand justice or some of form of payback, but the law is the law.</p>
              <p>The police can only operate under the Law. Assault with fists is a non-seizable offence, it is passed by Parliament (in fact this is part of the laws the British gave to us which we still use). It isn't the first time and unfortunately won't be the last time it happens.</p>
              <p>But you go spouting rubbish etc etc, did you do the same when it happened to other cabbies? Plus I think BJ driving comfort, if this happened to another CDG driver unknown to you, would you be making such comments in support?</p>
              <p>Yes you do a good job helping newbies and sharing experience, but everything has a 2 way street. You're not a master taxi driver and when some of the things you say is wrong, be a man and admit it. Just because newbies etc praise you don't make you invincible.</p>
              <p>Yes many have benefitted from you and your help is genuine, that is good and you deserve praise for it, but you also gotta let things happen and some newbies learn the hard way or somethings for themselves. This is what is called expereince and it's the best teacher still.</p>
              <p>As you grow older and hopefully wiser learn to understand how things work here, and accept certain things the way it is, not go round making wild claims how powerful the forum is or show whatever you say is right, when certain things happen.</p>
              <p>You are only 1 taxi driver among 25000 or so, maybe you're better than most and know how to survive, good for you and I hope it continues, but don't get too bigheaded.</p>
              <p>Remember all it takes is for some big shot in LTA to say, you must stopped and that's it. Can you fight an organisation as big as LTA. Can you guarantee they can never find fault with you? Remember the tiger only needs to get it right once while you must be 100% everytime.</p>
              <p>You expect others to behave in a certain way in the forum and give respect. I think respect is a 2 way street.</p>

              <p>Ok enough of that. Now for BJ whether he wants to follow or not, it's up to him.</p>
              <p>Firstly, I am very sorry to hear of your ordeal, this is something I won't wish on any taxi driver, whether it's you or anyone else. I hope you can learn a few things from this sad affair and be better prepared next time, if something similar threatens you.</p>
              <p>Before I go on, I think it also fair that I relate to your conduct here (my own opinion) and the incident. But let me say, both are different issues, what happens here has nothing to do with that.</p>
              <p>You say you're a Buddhist, good for you and wish you well for it. May you find the peaceful karma that Buddhism espouces. But let me also say, I think you must also look back at some of the things you have posted here over the months and accept that you perhaps did not act in the best Buddhist spirit.</p>
              <p>There is no harm in apologising to anyone here if you hurt their feelings or made some crude remarks. And if some did that you, accpet it and forgive them also. You're 56, I didn't realise that until I read the papers.</p>
              <p>But some of the things you posted (no I'm not gonna be bothered to pore thru your past posts) looked like the posts of a 30 something not an 50 + man which much worldly experience. You sound like an internet warrior sometimes or take things far too personally. Is it really necesarry to highlight replies in colour to buttress your case?</p>
              <p>Your tone also seem to indicate you're an expert not a newbie, that you already know so many things. You also resort to name calling. Hand on heart, ask yourself is this what a good Buddhist would do?</p>
              <p>And because of this some have taken a dislike of you and when this happened they were rubbing their hands in glee or at the very least, suggesting that you deserve it. I am not saying what they did is correct, but won't you accept this as normal human behaviour? Can you be bigger than them and raise your hands and say, look I know we've had our differences and maybe I pissed you off and you me, but we settle this and go back to the start?</p>
              <p> Can you sympathise or emphatise with me as a fellow driver, and not rush to judgement? I am 100% sure if you did that, they too would carry their hands and say sorry. It doesn't matter who does it first. But you shouldn't fire back the way you did.</p>
              <p>When you have the moral high ground, stick to it and be quiet abt it, it speaks far more than rebutting. You are older than me, and know some things more than me, but also accept that I may know some things better than you.</p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>As for your case, I am sure you've had many advise and have taken some action. Here's a bit more for you to consider:</p>
              <p>This as you know is Sec 323 (simple assault). It's a non seizable offence and police CANNOT arrest without a warrant issued by the court.</p>
              <p>So don't get your hopes up, when Poolman said got police car with flashing lights at Chin Chwee, they are not there to arrest your man.</p>
              <p>The most important thing I think now for you, is to liase with your IO (I think from Clementi Stn right). Ask him what should you do if the assailant is spotted by you. (Pls do not listen to what others say or ask someone else to detain him, if they spot someone like him in the area). The most they should do is follow and observe him and wait for you to arrive to confirm it.</p>
              <p>I think the IO will advise you, to call for the police, wait for them to arrive and ascertain his particulars. Unless of course the IO has issued a warrant of arrest (thru the court) then they will arrest him. If not they will let him go and some other day the IO will issue him a letter to attend Clementi for a statement.</p>
              <p>In 323 cases, sometimes the police may act on their own and investigate without a court, sometimes they wait for the order and sometimes, they don't do anything at all. That's what the magistrate told you about civil suit. You have to file a suit at the civil registry and the police will provide the details to the registry. You then engage a lawyer to sue him for damages.</p>
              <p>However I think you did the right thing in getting the press involved, usually for such cases of public interest they will investigate anyway and take action. But don't forget this is a 2 sided thing, even with your injuries and medical report, the assailant might give a different version, they or the AG chambers might decline to proceed further. Then you have to sue him own your own.</p>
              <p>But as said, I think they will take action if they can locate him. If they do don't worry, if he's found guilty this 100% got jail term. You can also sue for damages. Or he might offer you money to drop the case, then you gotta decide if you agree with it.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>The next step if not done, is to liase with CDG. Go down, speak to a DRO and ask them to assist you. That's a good thing about CDG, in such cases having a big co behind you is beneficial.</p>
              <p>See what assistance they can offer. Maybe you ask the DRO check their data to see if any Indian man has booked a cab from Coleman street to Chin Chwee before. I dunno if they will do this or release the details to you, but they might do so and supply it to the police and maybe the police can get a picture of him thru NRO and ask you to come down to verify if it's your assailant.</p>
              <p>But as said the most important thing is to check with your IO, how are they gonna verify his identity, maybe if Coleman Street where you picked up got camera, then perhaps the IO can retrieve it. Similarly also check at North Buona Vista exit if got camera, and asked the IO to view it from TP or LTA to get his snapshot.</p>

              <p>But you hv to accept that not all IOs will investigate such cases throroughly or go to that extent. This is simple assault not robbery or assault with weapon.</p>
              <p>You however shouldn't rush the IO, give him a ard 2 weeks to see what's being done. If after that nothing still, then perhaps you can go see your MP or I will advise further at that stage.</p>
              <p>On your part, make the effort to trawl Chin Chwee or Coleman to see if you can spot him. Dunno if he really stay there, or thi is a friend or relative house, or maybe because of the heat he go somewhere else to stay for a while.</p>
              <p>In the end you also must be prepared that there might not be anything done about your case, if he can't be located within these time frame. You might spot him much much later and can still hope for action taken, but he might claim wrong identity, either way let's see how things happen first.</p>
              <p>Don't get your hopes up, CID will not get involved neither will he be going to jail anytime soon, if spotted and identified. It might take many months before that happens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If really in the end he escapes scot free (it could happen) don't fret over it and let it bother you too much. Life is sometimes unfair, yes? On your part, examine your actions on that day, and see how best you could improve and take better action. ( I spotted some errors on your part and I think you can deffo improve on them) But no matter what, he has no right to touch you, irrespective if you provoke him or not.</p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>I will tell you a few reasons why I did not post for so long in the TD forum): Here are the main reasons:</p>
              <p>1) The constant closing, editing and deleting of posts and threads (and I am not referring just to my own). In fact I am more pissed with the editing and deleting of some other people's thread/posts than my own. What this forum means cannot hv a robust exchange of ideas? Cannot criticise or point out another's fault when he's wrong? But some ppl can post whatever or start whatever, and when it turns back on them, it's quickly closed up.</p>
              <p>Is this a public forum, yes or no? Can there never be arguments in a public forum?</p>
              <p>2) The constant posting of money related issues, be it daily earnings or daily targets. Hullo pls tell me what is the difference of publishing a daily takings of say $200 or to say I target $200 per day, sometimes I make it, sometimes only half?</p>
              <p>What impression does this give to the public, taxi companies, LTA and the authorities? Is there any benefit to state such things at all, or is there a disadvantage of stating it?</p>
              <p>3) The childish behaviour of certain members/mods. Take the Darryl/Ah Guan saga. Who brought him to LV? Who support him in the forum? Who cover for him in here? Then because an issue happens inside LV, the suggestion comes that Ah Guan should be banned from this forum? Pls tell me how the 2 are related?</p>
              <p>And even the issue inside LV, I find amazing. Hullo you are the senior man, he is the junior. You bring him in, he fuck you up, and you threaten to leave LV unless he's sacked? And then some of your supporters also agree to follow and leave, you never talk them out of it? You cari makan your pasal, how can you encourage others to follow suit, will you help them financially if they are unable to achieve the targets they had when in LV?</p>
              <p>Ah guan can be the biggest bastard, but that doesn't mean you give an ultimatum to your LV bosses, either him or me? Is this the adult thing to do? Ah guan fark you up, you fark him back la, tell him in his face, you want him out, He doesn't leave never mind, you make sure he'll regret, but you don't issue ultimatums in such a way.</p>
              <p>You made an error of judgment, accept it and move on. At the most ignore the fucker, in the end he'll realise he's not welcome and leave.</p>
              <p>4) The constant boasting of the forums supposed powers. Alamak this is a just a small forum frequented by say less than 0.5 % of total Taxi drivers. It can a be good source of information and assistance. But that doesn't mean everything we post here is being closely monitored and whatever recommendations we make will be implemented just because we suggested it. Alamak we got so many former civil servants here, we know how it works, how often has the authorities ever taken ideas from a forum? 1x, 2x, 10x or Zero times? There have been too much boasting and too little humility.</p>
              <p>Anyway that's life. For me it doesn't matter if I post here or not, but I think the record must be set straight.  I don't hv any grudge with anyone, if I think It's not prudent for me to continue posting never mind. As an adult I think sometimes I must act like one, although yes I'll be the first to say, I act childishly too, but on serious issues I know where I stand and how to react.</p>

              <p>Just 1 final thing to say abt the tit for tat between JDIL, RBs and BJ. Aiya Rbs and JDIL, kasihan him a bit la as a fellow cabby not over what has happened in here.</p>
              <p>He only attacked us with words not fists. Some of us here aren't blind and know what or who got lieu and who don't. He deserve to get farked for his posts, or at the most let him standby what he said and we can standby on what we said. This is a forum after all and we aren't kids anymore.</p>
              <p>But as a fellow human being we can empathise, we stand up for the weak and certainly we don't tolerate someone getting beaten over such a trivial matter. Even if maybe he got provoke the farker, no way should violence be used.</p>
              <p>So let's wish him well and hope this things doesn't happen to him or anyone again.</p>

              <p>As for BJ, search yourself and your actions that day and in other days, and see where you have gone wrong and how you can improve. or what precautions you can take.</p>
              <p>No 1, be mindful of this GPS postal code thingy. Hv you noticed that sometimes some pax you send back to private estates don't drop in front of their house. Some ppl do not want to disclose their residence. Think of a better way to overcome this issue with pax who don't know the way and how best to get the GPS detail.</p>
              <p>And learn to cut short on the long explanations to some pax. I tell you some Ang Mor, not even Indian like all the long explanation. Short and sharp. Even if your intentions are good, some mistake it or think you're trying to be funny. Or evn the tone use, some thnk you're being patronising.</p>
              <p>Learn to judge pax before picking them up. Learn to figure the nearest police stations enroute. Know when to stop a trip immediately when the abuse starts. Dont wait for physical violence.</p>
              <p>Keep the call centre informed of any such issue.</p>
