              <p>Me.... I have been a devil since 1981. Those days have to best

              <p>Not from EPL. My team like me lah, had seen better days! - Nottm Forest. I started supporting them 1 year before you.</p>
              <p>Actually most Saturdays I wont return home to watch soccer unless got Forest game telecast on the Net.  However recently they have had a good run and lie 5th in the Championship in the play-off place. So whether got telecast or not, I will return to keep updated on their match. Last year they never do well, so I didnt return back unless got telecast. This season cannot, if I drive the tension will kill me, wanting to know their progress.</p>
              <p>I fanatic sometimes, will drop everything for football. Last season final day for the Prem race, was listening to BBC on radio while driving, but the tension and excitement of City's match with QPR got the better of me, so quickly close shop and join my cousin at Orchard Towers to watch the finale.</p>

              <p>Not trying to stir things but finally after HH posted I got a better picture of the 'Ah Guan incident' next door. He posted:</p>

              <p>Ah Guan KNN super sarka kia. Sibeh attention seeking. Me and RSM
              is the first one to meet him and we dun like him liao. Why I say
              sarka....got once near CNY period we got kopi at Lavender. That day
              this 25 kid supposed to be off day and he just recover from one of
              his sickness. Then he got a staff pick up job at Rasa think is 1am.
              That day we have makan session before that at farm mart so I park
              my cab there and long pang pool's cab to lavender as he is going
              back after makan and I want to try his power Skoda. Half way there
              about 12plus that jiao kia titi pte pool asking him what time he be
              there as he got something to pass him. I ask pool pass smlj he also
              dunno. Then reach there he pass pool some CNY goodies and kong wu
              kong bo but we all mostly ignore him. KNN here sarka pool behind
              back stab him.</p>
              <p>What happen is one fine day he watsapp pool and pool out of good
              intention tell him Rasa staff job all on account sometimes will
              drag a bit and not everytime full payment. So he advise him if he
              buay tong then do less of the Rasa job. Then one fine day at the LV
              stand with Boss Bob and Meng the Rasa controller he suddenly dunno
              why go and show them pool's watsapp conversation to them. So when
              pool learn about it sibeh tulan give Boss Bob the ultimatum LV got
              Guan no Pool....Got Pool no Guan....Like that loh.....</p>

              <p>As a neutral outsider, this is my take - anyway since posted on the Sgforums, it's open to everyone to read and comment.</p>
              <p>I think both actions taken was wrong. Obviously what Ah Guan did was dumb and who wouldn't be angry. However, I also think Poolman was wrong to demand his sacking and the way he handled the whole issue.</p>
              <p>First of all Ah Guan is a newbie and young fella, early 30s I think. He very kancheong and blur, always talk before thinking (or posting). We have seen this thru his interactions here. Not very mature. Yet he still so greenhorn, our friend invite into his LV club and back him up everytime.</p>
              <p>PLus he also should known abt his 'sarka' behaviour. Poolman bet to drive to Punggol for x no of days if WP win, he also follow suit, like pupil following a master. Plus the CNY goodies thingy, can see clearly the 'sarkaness'. But perhaps it's quite shiok to be 'angkated', but definitely not when others get it, at your expense.</p>
              <p>This guy so kancheong and blur blur, dont know how to drive properly, say he not earning much or so little, that's why he do the Rasa jobs. (I also recommend him 1 job do ferry service for pub workers, dunno what happened there, whether he do or not). Then he ask about the job and the payment, our hero open his big mouth and let loose about possibility of late payment etc, why also only known to him. So now put yourself in Ah Guan's shoes, what would be his natural reaction?</p>
              <p>Knn, he already struggling, you tell him this kind of news, he surely more kancheong right? See the boss and controller, he's likely to ask them to allay his worries. Whether that info was stated when given to him in confidence or not, I dunno, if never say so, then you got to blame yourself. If stated so, then of course it's sad and wrong, but what to do, this is a very common thing, once you started opening your mouth and giving advise like giving out parking summons.</p>
              <p>Some of us have kena this before, share a secret or private info to someone, but somehow the other party pecah lobang to the person you talked about, or he tell person B who then inform that party.</p>
              <p>What would be the normal and proper reaction, fuck the fella for breaking your confidence and tell dont need to ask for advise anymore, none will be given, or simply say, I think it's best we become less of friends, because of the issue of trust.</p>
              <p>Can you and demand his expulsion or sacking, if say this happened in your company? Can you give the boss an ultimatum, either him or you, for what in reality is not a very big issue?</p>
              <p>Can demand he be banned from this forums, yes I read somewhere that Fireice would be told to ban him if he log on? Whether done or not, I dunno, but the whole idea is wrong.</p>
              <p>He behave immaturely, you also behave immaturely, and the whole thing started by your stupidity in admitting such a greenhorn, kancheong maybe 'sarka' fella into your private group.</p>
              <p>That gentlemen, is my take on the issue. Maybe got more I dunno, but based on HH post, this is my observation.</p>

              <p>My humble tots on this, since LV is the main contractor to ferry
                      their staffs home, they should pay the TDs first. Then they bill
                      Rasa or whoever. I am sure they have a service agreement
                      right??</p>
              <p>Why make the TDs ferry the staff and wait for the payment???
                      This one abit dunno what to say...</p>

              <p>Hence, normally, the TD will asked the staffs to sign on the receipts (travelling on his taxi) and returns the receipts back to the caller the next day.</p>
              <p>The caller will compound all the receipts and then submit for payment at the end of the month.</p>

              <p>Rbs work as what now? Honestly in the 1 year + I've been here, I
              never saw him as a stirrer, rather, someone keen to get a
              discussion going and trying to do it in a funny way.</p>

              <p>Never mind, Now I become stirrer. Life has to be fair yes, cannot only 1 side make sweeping statements while the other diam diam?</p>
              <p>Anyway it's not stirring on my part, just speaking my POV and correcting wrong misconceptions. My character flaw (if it's a flaw) is that when I'm right, I will not let someone 'makan me', even my mother I will argue.</p>
              <p>Only my late father I will kowtow, and he wrong, I also keep quiet let him win. I believe in fairness and would not normally tekan somebody when down, but those who perch themselves high up. I also dont go ask for support when I'm right, If right means right, 1 person no supporter, also never mind.</p>
              <p>But I wrong, you point out nicely my mistakes, treat me with reasonable respect, I deffo will kowtow and backdown. I wrong I dun mind kena f, but at a reasonable level, dont go f my father mother etc, or my religion.</p>
