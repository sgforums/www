              <p>I know next door been promoting relief first for newbies...I start from OMO since day 1..don't see any disadvantages on that.</p><p>
              
              </p><p>Of course is up to individual to decide what suit you the best. Partnership never in my right mind, there's no word call chin chin chye chye in Taxi Driving, you will realize that once you start to OTR.</p><p>
              
              </p><p>Especially for white, half shift never,never work well in long run..as soon as you get your first regular, that will be the start of the problem.</p><p>
              
              </p><p>Last week, my regular call me for departure at 3pm..ended up hourly for 5 hrs before her departure..just imagine I had to change shift, how? Tell my regular, my relief taking over me? She will tell you to go fly kite and that might be the last time she call you.</p><p>
              
              </p><p>Some regulars just want you to drive them around, they like your personal touch and services, in fact, most white kakis sacrify personal time a lot...just need to be careful on juggling personal and working time.</p><p>
              
              </p><p>Of course that's for white, normal taxi, bo dai ji, start engine all the way and stop engine, but during those years, I still prefer to be OMO, pay a bit more but save all the problems on human relationship...hahaha</p><p></p>

              <p>I think I can understand that. Once you have regulars, it become quite troublesome if you can only drive 12 hours and has to hand over to your hirer/relief.</p>
