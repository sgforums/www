              <p>I have a good maxi friend. He very good at AQ and EQ. DH passed
              him many jobs. Still at the end of the day, his income was just
              enough to feed his family of 3 kids.</p>
              <p>As a driver operating a maxicab, its impossible to hit GM pay
              except during New Year.</p>
              <p>@OptimalTrans, if you follow others and support the DHs, in the
              end it is yourself who suffer. Its ok to follow them and angkat
              them initially to learn how they run the show. After that serving
              your own lobangs is the key.</p>
              <p>The MDT is your best friend. Be prepared to sit still for hours
              just to bid for your flat fares.</p>
              <p>Finding a reliable maxicab buddy is very impt.</p>
              <p>Initially some DH will approach u to help out with some taiko
              jobs to test u. You can either carry balls or reject them.</p>

              <p>Lucky he got enough for the family, what are we working for? For our families and nothing else.</p>
              <p>Somehow true and somehow false too, best is to find and follow a good DH, payment on time and really take care you, I really believe there are some good DHs around though majority are taiko who like to gamble and womanise.</p>
              <p>To be honest, it is better to be a driver than to be a DH, DHs have their own set of problems too.</p>
              <p>Imagine they get their account jobs, the corporate company drag the payment for 2 to 3 months but the DH have to come up cash to pay the driver first.</p>
              <p>Then about the Hotels, sometimes, in the middle of the night, they are woken up by the Concierge to get car, CNY come, must pao ang pao, sometimes hotel ask for complimentary transfer for the staff or VIP, they have to come out from their own pocket. Driving VIP halfway, the hotel call look for car now and you have to take the walkie and "member, job paging"</p>
              <p>Then some DHs will kena some taiko drivers who sum their pax or account and screw up their jobs, then the DHs will kena fxxk up down left right centre... Very stress also..</p>
              <p>Why I explain the different tiers, ans :</p>
              <p>1st tier DH, they are in this line for more than 15 years, ever since the 80s or 90s, to earn a GM kind of salary is t difficult for them</p>
              <p>2nd tier is those in tis industry for about 8 to 10 years, they have their own Lobangs and also have somewhat a good relationship with the 1st tier DH, so their salary is quite comfortable.</p>

              <p>Lucky he got enough for the family, what are we working for? For
              our families and nothing else.</p>
              <p>Somehow true and somehow false too, best is to find and follow a
              good DH, payment on time and really take care you, I really believe
              there are some good DHs around though majority are taiko who like
              to gamble and womanise.</p>
              <p>To be honest, it is better to be a driver than to be a DH, DHs
              have their own set of problems too.</p>
              <p>Imagine they get their account jobs, the corporate company drag
              the payment for 2 to 3 months but the DH have to come up cash to
              pay the driver first.</p>
              <p>Then about the Hotels, sometimes, in the middle of the night,
              they are woken up by the Concierge to get car, CNY come, must pao
              ang pao, sometimes hotel ask for complimentary transfer for the
              staff or VIP, they have to come out from their own pocket. Driving
              VIP halfway, the hotel call look for car now and you have to take
              the walkie and "member, job paging"</p>
              <p>Then some DHs will kena some taiko drivers who sum their pax or
              account and screw up their jobs, then the DHs will kena fxxk up
              down left right centre... Very stress also..</p>
              <p>Why I explain the different tiers, ans :</p>
              <p>1st tier DH, they are in this line for more than 15 years, ever
              since the 80s or 90s, to earn a GM kind of salary is t difficult
              for them</p>
              <p>2nd tier is those in tis industry for about 8 to 10 years, they
              have their own Lobangs and also have somewhat a good relationship
              with the 1st tier DH, so their salary is quite comfortable.</p>
              <p>3rd tier is new bird like me(only 3 years), sometimes earn ok,
              sometimes earn just enough, sometimes OBK</p>
              <p>As for me, I don't believe in angkat and somehow, I have my own
              ideas to get jobs... But I strongly believe that if you get into a
              good group and have many GUI ren to help, life will be much
              easier.</p>

              </p><p>Indeed, it is importance that one's know how to draw the line, periodically. It is also true that we got to accept "bone" at time, but doing it for a favor and should expect "meat" in return.</p>
              <p>People will not hesitate to explore our bottom line, if we couldn't handle it well, that piece of "bone" will eventually get even smaller, by then we can almost forget about "meat".  All our time and energy are used up for that little piece of bone.</p>
              <p>Yes, people may test and observe us, but that goes vice versa. Newbies should start of at the losing end to obtain confident and trust from people, but there are always a limit. When there isn't any balance created, the relationship should halt.</p>
              <p>There are good and reasonable people around, one or two is enough to keep us buzy. It is all about continuously searching and securing.</p>
              <p>As for those "taiko", let them ROT.</p>

              <p><br> Bro SLPUN...in big organization, must know people one, is true life
              story....my servicing date always on Saturday, some cabby drive 10
              years also never kana Saturday servicing date, why? Not to angkat,
              is part and parcel of life.....forums is fun place to de-stress,
              that's why I amazing forumers here can know each other so
              well.....my actual life is a very serious guys, knn paying so much
              for rental just to play a fool.....I spent almost half of my life
              explored CDG.....money also cannot buy back my time......when I
              found out this forum one year ago, I read and read and read before
              I start post recently due to some issue....don't worry, CDG premier
              department is facing crisis now, after this year, things will be
              more clear.....try relief for MERC first, there is a lot of white
              trying very hard to get relief, list out your term, most likely
              they will LAN LAN and accept your offer.....</p>

              <p>Its good to hear CDG premier in crisis. Current white car meter, invoice job prices and rental prices are bad for limocabbies. Only a few can drive the white sampan and earn sufficient income. Too much driving, too little money. New white limos must use $5+0.33 meter to be viable. </p>
