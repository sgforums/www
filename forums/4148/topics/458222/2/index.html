              <p>I have nothing against DH , in fact i admire them for having the capabilities to capture a whole hotel for their livelihood. Its not easy, when i started out , i had the same plans , to attack all the major hotels.</p>
              <p>Approached conrad , asia hotel , M hotel and a couple of others hinting them of some 'benefits' should they use me, they nodded and  took my card . Did some follow ups along the way but they never responded in a positive manner.</p>
              <p>So for the hotel to actually use the services of the DHs , theres gotta be something and for this up till today , i very pei fu these people.</p>

              glossory page on Limo lingo? U must be kidding. Haha.
              
              DH is a person who has Hotel's jobs to be arranged out. He has the priority to the jobs. If he cannot fulfil these jobs' obligations, he will arranged out thru the walky talkie group talk. Normally, there r a levy for every job... Can't go too deep into it... Can PM me if u want to know in detail. Haha.

              Anyway, they may have the " CONTACTs " to secure frequent jobs from... normally the hotel outlets.... If there isn't any support from fellow limousine taxis drivers... Their contact will probably stop calling them totally.  
              
              Hence, DHs needs limousine members more than the group's members need them. Haha.

              <p>Very good insight, bro.......come in more often, 4P also not
              bad....lol</p>
              <p>Bo dai ji la.......my friend aka Durian Head only beh song on
              certain points......</p>
              <p>My thinking very simple, everyone start from somewhere, ie
              Normal to limousine cab to pte limo, and those who are supreme,
              might start a business and operate fleet of transportation business
              like knn....Woodland Transport.......</p>
              <p>Most of us had to crawl first before started to run or even
              fly......</p>
              <p>But when one had accumulated experience and lobang, mustn't
              forget where they came from........</p>

              <p>good post bro.</p>
              <p>im just merely recollecting my experiences 10 years ago hahaha. as i said , i have nothing against DH and their mode of operation.</p>
              <p>I wont go so much as to say they are pieces of shit.</p>
              <p>I believe hotels will still continue to use DHs and this cannot be eradicated. Hotels also want ease of operations. Do they want a few thousand unknown ah kows , ah ters dispatched by the Taxi cos to serve their guests or just 1 solid , powerful individual with back up vehicles ready or them?</p>
              <p>thats my point.</p>

              <p>Thank You BCL and RBS70.</p>
              <p>Both of you share very insightful points.</p>
              <p>We should not be too harsh on our words saying DH are piece of xxxx.</p>
              <p>I do agree that all of us hold steering wheel... Yes, Maybe it's true that these DHs tunnel jobs to their khakis who can carry balls.</p>
              <p>I have nothing against them too but to me, it's quite simple. </p>
              <p>For a group to be successful, you need to have</p>
              <p>1) a few powerful callers</p>
              <p>2) a lot of workers who are waiting for jobs</p>
              <p>3) many hungry Luohans who are willing to take all kinds of jobs</p>
              <p>If the whole group got no callers, members die cock stand, peak hour, Walkie talkie have radio silence... Lol...</p>
              <p>Just to side track a bit. Nowadays where got so many durian jobs from eg, xxx hotel to Clarke quay, MBS, Paragon? These near near one they take 2 taxis also good lah... Now pax know how to calculate, their maths all A1...</p>
              <p>If they want flat rate, chances are those far west and far north jobs lah...no need worry peak hr, no need worry ERP, etc </p>
