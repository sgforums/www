              <p><strong>Mr Darius Cheung (seated) has come up with a new mobile app, Billpin, with partners (from left) Ms Aileen Sim, Mr Saurabh Mandar and Mr Ruiwen Chua. Last week, he received $50,000 from iJam Reload.</strong> -- ST FILE PHOTO</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>NEW start-ups should be clear about what they want to do before they raise funds, according to experienced entrepreneur Darius Cheung.</p>
              <p>   After all, business development begins as soon as funds are received. If a start-up is still trying to find its footing, the funds will be quickly depleted, he warned.</p>
              <p>   Mr Cheung said early funds usually go towards hiring developers to help build a product.</p>
              <p>   "If you're still trying to find your way, then you're burning cash instead of using it well in product development."</p>
              <p>   His experience comes from developing his first start-up, TenCube, a mobile security firm which he started in 2007. The company was acquired by global software security giant McAfee in 2010 for an undisclosed sum.</p>
              <p>   Putting into practice his TenCube's experience, he and three other co-founders of Billpin spent the first four months finding out the best look and feel and features for a phone app which lets people split bills incurred by friends over, say, a dinner.</p>
              <p>   Feedback received after its first iPhone app was released helped to improve the product. Only then did he apply for funding.</p>
              <p>   Last week, he received $50,000 from iJam Reload, an initiative for interactive digital media start-ups by the Media Development Authority. It could receive follow-up funding of $100,000 for additional product development.</p>
              <p>   "There were many things we wanted to do. Ultimately, we focused on making Billpin the best app for the settlement of bills among friends."</p>
              <p>   Once a Billpin user enters the amount spent, for example, on a bottle of perfume selected as a birthday present, it will split the bill among the number of friends.</p>
              <p>   The user enters their e-mail addresses and Billpin notifies the people who owe the money.</p>
              <p>   The funding will be spent to build more features into the app such as letting it calculate GST and to include a payment function to let people pay their portions easily.</p>
              <p>   An Android Billpin was released last week. Further development could include a payment gateway letting friends pay each other at the click of a button, said Mr Cheung.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: x-large;">Crowdfunding platform launched </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SINGAPORE's first reward-based crowfunding website was launched yesterday allowing anyone online to make a donation - in this case, towards cash-hungry local start-ups.</p>
              <p>   Initially, the site, Crowdonomic, is running six campaigns by start-ups with the aim of raising up to $30,000 for each one, said founder Leo Shimada.</p>
              <p>   Donations start at $10. In return, supporters are rewarded with digital assets in a game, T-shirts, books or products and services.</p>
              <p>   Mr Shimada said: "Our ultimate goal is to help entrepreneurs by addressing a key pain point - the funding gap. Since the market, or "crowd", decides who to fund, it offers a more democratic alternative to how capital is allocated."</p>

              <p>ASPIRING start-up firms from Singapore and Malaysia will get a chance to pitchtheir business ideas to potential investors this Saturday.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>A COMPANY spun off from the National University of Singapore (NUS), AyoxxA Biosystems has raised another $600,000 in additional to $4.6 million it raised in September last year.</p>
              <p>   It also announced a two-year research collaboration with the department of bioengineering at the NUS' Faculty of Engineering to further strengthen its research and development efforts.</p>
              <p>   The biotech firm, with bases in both Germany and Singapore, has created a bead-based biochip that can identify a large number of different proteins, including markers for diseases, from a very small sample size. It will be useful in areas such as pharmacological screening and diagnostics.</p>

              <p>ONLINE tech and start-up news portal TechinAsia has closed a second financing round led by Russian-based angel seed fund Simile Venture. East Ventures, which invested in the first round, also participated.</p>

              <p>   Simile Venture Partners' general partner Tatiana Kim said: "South-east Asia is one of the world's most exciting regions today, fast evolving for tech start-ups. Access to trusted tech news and information and quality industry events are very important for the regional ecosystem development."</p>
