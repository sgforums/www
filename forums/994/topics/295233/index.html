              <p>online business also need capital for products.</p>
              <p>But there's no rent. Thus, rent savings can be translated to consumers, who can enjoy lower costs. Again, if you see those push carts, you also see the sales person sitting there for a long time before finally someone come along to make a purchase. An online business has no such time wasting problem.</p>
              <p>The only disadvantage is that the buyer has no instant gratification of testing and buying immediately. Of course, there are some ways in which you can reduce this disadvantage, one of which is I have mentioned, lower price.</p>
