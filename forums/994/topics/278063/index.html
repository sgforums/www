What if they don't like the taste?</strong><br><br>1st: Arouse the curiosity pushes people to buy and try.<br><br>He having seen watched a news bulletin about how a shopping centre in Japan conducts this annual special where they pack a lot of stuff into a bag and customers just pay a specific amount without knowing what is inside.<br><br>2nd: Do market research on people's preferences of soft-drinks.<br><br><strong>Singaporeans are known to rave about new products, but when the fads die down, many shops hocking those goods struggle to make ends meet. How will you ensure that your beverages do not lose their novelty?</strong><br><br>It depends on how you create your brand name.<br><br>We will probably work more on developing the brand instead. What we are doing is a concept drink, and this is an idea that no one has though of.<br><br>We ill not be complacent and keep it that way, however. We are doing research ans will make some adjustments to the taste to cater to more customers.<br><br><strong>Let's talk about the advertising campaign that had to be pulled due to vandals and thieves. Do you see it as a costly venture that went wrong, or was the publicity garnered worth it?</strong><br><br>Believe it or not, within a few hours of the campaign launch, most of the cans were either dented or hand their flaps opened, and some displays were even completely gone!<br><br>As the situation worsened over the net two days, we gave up and decided to pull the displays.<br><br>Even today, I'm still not sure if it's more positive or negative for us but based on the first month sales, we sold 3.5 million cans of drinks surpassing our initial target of 2.4 million.<br><br><strong>Were there any concerns of criticism when the idea for such drinks was first bandied about?</strong><br><br>There were many people who tried to talk me out of doing it because they thought it would not  be easy for me to penetrate the soft drink market, which is dominated by the "big boys".<br><br>I had no prior experience in beverages, but once I set my mind on doing something, I never look back. If I believe I can work something out, and that it could be a success, I will go all out.<br><br>The most important thing is never say die.<br></div>
