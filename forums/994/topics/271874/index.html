I thought can rely on existing contact, but it doesn't really turn out that well. Along the way, luck play a part in getting to closed some "big" deal, and some "gui ren" render some help. Now still struggle. Journey not easy. Really need investment to reach the next step.</div></blockquote>I'm sure your family and friends will stand by you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Entrepreneurs huh?<br><br>I have my finger on a few business schools and english languages school. These schools run on a business model I developed during my tertiary years. It covers everything from employee relations, students, right down to marketing strategies.<br><br>I dont think I would call that entrepreneurship. I think in this cutthroat business world, one should have good business acumen and take the necessay risks to succeed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well in the case of entrepreneurship, i very much delve in the mode of "hit and run" business. Meaning, i pay close attention to the current trends and exploit them to my target customers. Just last month alone, on a capital of $3000, i managed to break even in 20 days and reaped 2x profits after 2 months. I buy niche clothes all over Japan,Taiwan and Hong Kong and sell them back here to my power buyers (rich teens and young working adults)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I turned down the opportunity to become an entrepreneur.  In my university I won entrepreneurship competition &amp; took the prize of SG$2500.  The first piece of advice is this: Not everyone is cut out for it.  Stop dreaming of riches &amp; think to yourself why you should be successful &amp; why the product/service you're offering is good.<br><br>Investment angels look at 3 things:<br>1. People - are you top of what you do &amp; capable of putting the right ingredients in character &amp; mentality together.<br>2. Product - just how good is this idea?  What gap in the market have you spotted?  Is it financially viable?<br>3. Business plan - just what steps are you going to take to set-up &amp; launch?  What's in it for the investor?  What strategies do you have?<br><br>My team was comprised of other students from my university, we specialised in Information Systems, Materials, Electrical, &amp; Computing.  The advantage we had was our technical knowledge, we actually built a working prototype, identified steps to take in order to get market awareness, put together scenarios on P&amp;L etc.  Despite winning that prize we didn't go ahead with it.  Starting a business is still risky &amp; basically we were all capable of getting great jobs with great firms.  Perhaps one day we'll turn around &amp; think about going ahead with it after like 10 years of success in the corporate sector.</div>
