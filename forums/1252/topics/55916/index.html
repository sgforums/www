            <div class='col-md body'>One Sunday morning George burst into the living room and said, "Dad! Mom! I have some great news for you! I am getting married to the most beautiful girl in town. She lives a block away and her name is Susan.<br><br>After dinner, George's dad took him aside, "Son, I have to talk with you." "Look at your mother, George. She and I have been married 30 years, she's a wonderful wife and mother, but, she has never offered much excitement in the bedroom, so I used to fool around with women a lot. Susan is actually your half sister, and I'm afraid you can't marry her."<br><br>George was broken-hearted. After eight months he eventually started dating girls again. A year later he came home and very proudly announced, "Dianne said yes! We're getting married in June."<br><br>Again his father insisted on another private conversation and broke the sad news. "Dianne is your half sister too, George. I'm awfully sorry about this."<br><br>George was livid! He finally decided to go to his mother with the news his father had shared.<br><br>"Dad has done so much harm. I guess I'm never going to get married," he complained. "Every time I fall in love, dad tells me the girl is my half sister."<br><br>"Hehehe," his mother chuckled, shaking her head, "don't pay any attention to what he says. He's not really your father."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A business man met a beautiful girl and asked her to spend the night with him for $500. And she did. Before he left in the morning, he told her that he did not have any cash with him, but that he would have his secretary write a check and mail it to her, calling the payment "RENT FOR APARTMENT."<br><br>On the way to the office, he regretted what he had done, realizing that the whole event was not worth the price. So he had his secretary send a check for $250 and enclosed a note:<br><br>Dear Madam,<br>Enclosed find a check in the amount of $250 for rent of your apartment. I am not sending the amount agreed upon because when I rented the apartment I was under the impression that:<br><br>(1) it had never been occupied;<br>(2) that there was plenty of heat;<br>(3) that it was small enough to make me cosy and at home.<br><br>Last night, however, I found out that it had been previously occupied, that there wasn't any heat, and that it was entirely too large.<br><br>Upon receipt of the note, the girl immediately returned the check for $250 with the following note:<br><br>Dear Sir,<br>First of all, I cannot understand how you expect a beautiful apartment to remain unoccupied indefinitely. As for the heat, there is plenty of it if you know how to turn it on.<br><br>Regarding the space, the apartment is indeed of regular size, but if you don't have enough furniture to fill it, please don't blame the landlord.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A man was walking along a California beach and stumbled across an old lamp. He picked it up and rubbed it and out popped a genie.<br><br>The genie said "OK, OK. You released me from the lamp, blah blah blah. This is the fourth time this month and I'm getting a little sick of these wishes so you can forget about three. You only get one wish!" The man sat and thought about it for a while and said, "I've always wanted to go to Hawaii but I'm scared to fly and I get very seasick.<br><br>Could you build me a bridge to Hawaii so I can drive over there to visit?"<br><br>The genie laughed and said, "That's impossible. Think of the logistics of that! How would the supports ever reach the bottom of the Pacific? Think of how much concrete...how much steel!! No-think of another wish."<br><br>The man said OK and tried to think of a really good wish. Finally, he said, "I've been married and divorced four times. My wives always said that I don't care and that I'm insensitive. So, I wish that I could understand women....know how they feel inside and what they're thinking when they give me the silent treatment....know why they're crying, know what they really want when they say 'nothing'....know how to make them truly happy...."<br><br>The genie said, "You want that bridge two lanes or four?"</div>
