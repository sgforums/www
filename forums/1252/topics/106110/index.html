            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, zyn here. I think the free accomodation is really free because 1) My mother got it from another timeshare company, and my friends have went on similar trips. 2)I worked at IRN as a holiday job, and to tell the truth, everyone who is qualified (above 25, below 55, etc etc, singaporean or pr..) gets the accomodation prize. And we surveyors are happy because firstly it's real hard to find a fully qualified person, and if they stay for the exhibition, we would get paid. You see, we are not paid on basic, so the money we earn is from commision whenever our clients stay through the exhibition. And you're wise not to buy the packages... they're real expensive. Oh, and if clients buy, the surveyor gets an additional bonus. So you see, if you want the shopping voucher as well as the holiday (you can get a presidential suite in a 5 star hotel) all you have to do is to sit thru that holiday exhibition and say 'nononono'. I don't think there are many strings attached, but you may get phone calls from IRN for a couple of times. Just shout at them, but don't be too harsh please cos the telemarketeers are also just students ranging from 14 to 20+ yr olds working part time. And they'll not bother you after that. Just enjoy your trip! =)<br>And since i'm here, i'd just like to appeal... surveyors on the streets, orchard road, wherever are just kids working to earn some money for themselves, so when you really do not want to do that stupid survey, and have been approached countless times, please do not be so @$#%! and call the police or whatever, just lie and say you've done it or whatsoever. Bcause surveyors are viewed as the scum of the road, we get all kinds of funny funny shit from people in buisness suits and even young kids. And it really hurts, because we're just doing our job and it's not wrong, even if we can be a bit pesky. (Disclaimer: This does not include surveyors who block people and pester and hang on till the person wants to slap the surveyor, nor those rude ones, etc..) So my main point is, JusT TreAt Us BettEr, ok... =)</div>
