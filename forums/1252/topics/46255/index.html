            <div class='col-md body'>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - Prophecy Discussion<br>(source of informatio: T. Chase, Revelation13)<br><br>In mid-March 2003, it was announced to the world that there was a new Pneumonia-like disease causing a spreading epidemic in the world. A new disease epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), started in Guangdong Province in China in November 2002, and then spread to other countries in Asia: Hong Kong, Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Singapore. It has also spread to Canada and the U.S.. Many cases have been linked to a Hotel in Hong Kong. It is a Pneumonia-like illness with an incubation period of 2 to 7 days. There is a great danger of it spreading worldwide. Apparently it is related to Saturn being at its brightest at the start of 2003 (Saturn is equivalent to Satan, and Satan on earth would also be the dragon, Red China).<br><br>About the deadly diseases, from the point of view of Astrology, Biblical prophecy including the Book of Revelation, and numerical analysis were considered. Note that 1999 has 666 upside down, and 1998=666x3, so the Antichrist may have appeared in year 2000, and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse may ride, including the Fourth Horseman Death by disease, which could be AIDS, Ebola, Influenza, and other diseases.<br><br>Let us consider here three diseases that are a threat to mankind: AIDS, Ebola, and Influenza. The virus that causes AIDS, HIV, was discovered in the year 1983, so therefore associate AIDS with the number 83. The galaxy M83 is in the constellation Hydra, which was a multi-headed serpent in mythology that kept growing a new head, each time a head was cut off. This sounds like AIDS, which keeps mutating to allow it to get around any treatment or vaccine. The Hydra was defeated by Hercules, by his nephew Iolaus burning each of the mortal heads as Hercules cut them off, and burying the immortal head under a stone.<br><br>Note that the AIDS virus has 9213=111x83 bits of genetic information, so again the number 83.<br><br>Ebola, a lethal disease of Africa that kills in two weeks of infection, had its virus discovered in 1976, so if we associate galaxy M76 with it, we are near the constellation Andromeda. Remember the movie "Andromeda Strain" about a lethal disease that threatened humanity? That could be Ebola if it mutates to an airborne form.<br><br>Influenza or "Flu" was discovered in 1933. Galaxy M33 is in the constellation Triangulum. That may imply we should look for a triangle. The numbers 33, 76, and 83 do form a right (90 degree) triangle with an angle of 66 degrees.<br><br>Since 666 is the number of the antichrist of the Book of Revelation chapter 13, this may imply that these three diseases will threaten humanity when he appears. In fact, ebola virus frequently twists itself into a shape that looks like a "6".<br><br>These diseases may also relate to three animals used to describe the Antichrist in Revelation 13:2: he is like a leopard, has the mouth of a lion, and the feet of a bear. Maybe Ebola corresponds to the leopard, with its great speed; Ebola kills in two weeks of infection. Influenza could be the lion; it causes coughing like a lion's roar. And AIDS could be the bear; bears hibernate, like AIDS can do in people, until it wakes up and kills them.<br><br>Another recent disease is BSE, Mad Cow Disease. On April 3, 1996, Comet Hyakutake was visible during a lunar eclipse, which interestingly occurs between Palm Sunday and Good Friday. When this comet passed near the constellation Virgo (the actual constellation, rather than the astrology sign), Mad Cow Disease appearing in people was announced to the world. The Egyptian version of Virgo, Isis, depicted with cow's horns. And Europa, the symbol of Europe, could also be considered a version of Virgo the Virgin. Europa rides a Bull-- this image is similar to the 17th chapter of the Bible's Book of Revelation, where a woman named Babylon rides a beast. The woman is holding a cup in her hand, full of filthiness. The analogy would be Europa riding the Bull, with the cup of filthiness being the Mad Cow Disease spread through infected beef. Also, according to Revelation, the woman sits on a city with seven hills, which is Rome-- again implying she is Europe. And note that BSE was discovered in 1986, so if we assign a galaxy to it by this number 86(Galaxy M86), Galaxy M86 is in the constellation Virgo the Virgin, representing the woman Babylon and Isis. And note that if we assign a Book of Revelation passage to this number 86, we have Revelation 18:6, which refers to the woman Babylon and her cup.<br><br>Another disease, Tuberculosis (TB) is becoming an increasingly bad worldwide epidemic, with drug resistant TB common. TB also is common in cattle. The bacteria Mycobacterium was identified by Robert Koch as the cause of TB in 1882, so we will associate the number 82 and the Galaxy M82 with it, and Revelation 18:2 (King James Version):<br><br>"18:2 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird."  Note that TB is spread by poor sanitation and hygiene, that we can relate to the "unclean" in the passage above; and Babylon was in Iraq.<br><br>Concerning SARS, it could be related to influenza, and therefore the Influenza part of the three diseases attacking humanity as the Fourth Horseman, Death. Note that in early 2003, with Saturn/Satan at its brightest as I explain on the calendar page, there is an Ebola epidemic in Africa, AIDS is out of control in Africa and elsewhere, so SARS could be the 3rd part of the Fourth Horseman, Flu. Note that SARS has been found to be caused by a new virus, which could be a type of Paramyxovirus (the virus family of measles and mumps), or a coronavirus (a type of virus that usually just causes colds), or it may belong to a new family of virus.<br><br>Note: the first letters of SARS, Ebola, AIDS spells "sea", and the Antichrist (the beast) rises out of the sea (of world politics) in Revelation 13. Also: the first letters of: Influenza, BSE, Ebola, AIDS, SARS, TB:<br><br>This suggests that these diseases will cause worldwide epidemics as the Beast rises to power, and the Fourth Horseman Death rides.<br><br>Also, SARS began in Guangdong Province, China, which is at geographic coordinates of 23 degrees North 112-115 East. Corresponding to 23 North would be the Bible's Psalm 23: (23:4, King James Version): "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me"<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>So this relates to this disease being the shadow of death. Also note that Hong Kong is near Guangdong Province in China, and Hong Kong is a former English colony: this may relate to the "mouth of a lion" of the Red Dragon Red China, the lion I related above to Influenza. Also note that I relate the lion of the Antichrist to Iraq, the lion being a symbol of Babylon, the ancient empire that was located in Iraq. So war in Iraq in March 2003 may relate holographically to this "lion" disease SARS appearing then. This disease of SARS may be symbolic of the disease of Saddam Hussein that has existed in Iraq. Also, since SARS had its virus discovered in March 2003, then we can relate it to Galaxy M23, which is in the Constellation Sagittarius, Sagittarius being the half-man half-horse archer. This again would relate it to the Antichrist, since in Revelation 6:2 the Antichrist is a man on horseback with a bow and arrow. So SARS may indicate the rise of the Antichrist, the Satanic imitation of Christ, to world prominence soon. And SARS coming out of China: the Antichrist gets his power from the dragon. Also, corresponding to 23 for SARS (since SARS was discovered in 2003, and started near 23 North in China) would be Revelation 12:3 where the red dragon is seen in heaven, the dragon being Red China, and also the Terrorist dragon. Also, the Hong Kong airline Dragonair in March 2003 on Flight KA901 from Beijing to Hong Kong had a SARS infected person on board, so health people are trying to contact the 222 passengers who were on that flight to try to see if they were infected, to stop more spread of SARS. The interesting thing with that flight is that again we have the dragon and China, and 901 in the flight number KA901 could be associated with Revelation 9:1 where a star falls from heaven into the bottomless pit; this is about the Antichrist. And "KA" in KA901 sounds like "key" as in "key to the bottomless pit" in Revelation 9:1, which would be the key to the Gates of Hell. Revelation 9:1,2:, King James version:<br><br>"9:1 And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.<br><br>2 And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit."<br><br>A general pattern:<br><br>Ebola: 76 (virus discovered in 1976)<br>Rev. 17:6, the bloodthirsty woman (Ebola makes people bleed to death)<br>Also in 1976: Chairman Mao dies in Red China, he was noted for being bloodthirsty, like this disease<br>Galaxy M76 near Andromeda ("The Andromeda Strain")<br><br>AIDS: 83 (virus discovered in 1983)<br>Rev. 18:3, the corrupt woman Babylon (Babylon being Iraq today)<br>Also in 1983: religious radicalism in the Arab World is increasing, after the assassination of Anwar Sadat in 1981; Osama was in Afghanistan in 1983<br>Square root of 83 is 9.11, as in 9-11 (September 11)<br>Galaxy M83 in Constellation Hydra (the Hydra being like the Radical Terrorists, El Qaida, it keeps growing a new head each time you cut one off, as AIDS keeps evading a vaccine)<br><br>BSE (Mad Cow Disease): 86 (discovered in 1986)<br>Rev. 18:6, the woman with the cup of filthiness<br>Galaxy M86 in Virgo the Virgin, here representing the woman, who is also Isis (who had cow horns)<br><br>Tuberculosis (TB): 82 (bacteria discovered in 1882)<br>Rev. 18:2, the unclean city Babylon (Babylon was ancient Iraq)<br>Galaxy M82 in the Great Bear; the Antichrist has the feet of a great bear.  But then who is the great bear?<br><br>Influenza: 33 (virus discovered in 1933)<br>Rev. 13:3, the beast (the Antichrist) rises out of the sea<br>Galaxy M33 in Triangulum<br><br>SARS: 23 (virus discovered in 2003)<br>Began near 23 degrees North in China<br>Rev. 12:3, the Red Dragon seen in heaven: Red China<br>Galaxy M23 in Sagittarius, the Archer horse/man, corresponding to the man on horseback with a bow in Revelation 6:2, the Antichrist<br><br>So: there is a real danger of SARS spreading worldwide in 2003, lets hope it is stopped soon. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta are investigating it now and attempting to stop its spread. The SARS disease has for symptoms high fever, coughing, difficulty breathing, and may include muscle stiffness and pain, sore throat, headache, loss of appetite, stomach symptoms, and rash. Its incubation period being only a few days it could spread very rapidly around the world. It appears it is airborne, and spreads from person to person, either by air or by contact. Also, the number 23 mentioned above may somehow be a clue to a cure or treatment for SARS (but I have no idea of how). And in Revelation 12 Michael battles the Red Dragon, defeating him in Revelation 20 by chaining him: so again that may be a clue of how to stop SARS, but again I don't know how. The Angel Michael is able to chain up the Red Dragon, Satan, in Revelation 20 and send him back to the bottomless pit (Revelation 20, King James Version):<br><br>"20:1 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.<br>2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,<br>3 And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season."</div>
