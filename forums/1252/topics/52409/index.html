            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: green;">Grandmother's Table.<br>(adapted from the Brothers Grimm) </span></strong><br><br>It may be that the older we get the more this story will mean to us. But we should learn it while we are young, for the sake of the generation coming before us ...<br><br>Once there was a feeble old woman whose husband died and left her all alone, so she went to live with her son and his wife and their own little daughter.<br><br>Every day the old woman's sight dimmed and her hearing grew worse, and sometimes at dinner her hands trembled so badly the peas rolled off her spoon or the soup ran from her cup. The son and his wife could not help but be annoyed at the way she spilled her meal all over the table.<br><br>And one day, after she knocked over a glass of milk, they told each other that enough is enough. They set up a small table for her in the corner next to the broom closet and made the old woman eat her meals there. She sat all alone, looking with tear-filled eyes across the room at the others. Sometimes they spoke to her while they ate, but usually it was to scold her for dropping a bowl or a fork.<br><br>One evening just before dinner, the little girl was busy playing on the floor with her building blocks, and her father asked her what she was making. "I'm building a little table for you and mother," she smiled, "so you can eat by yourselves in the corner someday when I get big."<br><br>Her parents sat staring at her for some time and then suddenly both began to cry. That night they led the old woman back to her place at the big table.<br><br>From then on she ate with the rest of the family, and her son and his wife never seemed to mind a bit when she spilled something every now and then.<br><br></div>

It is touching and may sway some minds to become pro-life. Please send this page to everyone you know! We must do all we can to stop abortion! </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Dear Mommy,<br><br>I am in Heaven now, sitting on God's lap. He loves me and cries with me; for my heart has been broken. I so wanted to be your little girl. I don't quite understand what has happened. I was so excited when I began realizing my existence. I was in a dark, yet comfortable place. I saw I had fingers and toes. I was pretty far along in my developing, yet not near ready to leave my surroundings. I spent most of my time thinking or sleeping. Even from my earliest days, I felt a special bonding between you and me. Sometimes I heard you crying and I cried with you. Sometimes you would yell or scream, then cry. I heard Daddy yelling back. I was sad, and hoped you would be better soon. I wondered why you cried so much. One day you cried almost all of the day. I hurt for you. I couldn't imagine why you were so unhappy.<br><br>That same day, the most horrible thing happened. A very mean monster came into that warm, comfortable place I was in. I was so scared, I began screaming, but there was no sound. I guess they had you all pinned down because you never once tried to help me. Maybe you never heard me. The monster got closer and closer as I was screaming and screaming, "Mommy, Mommy, help me please; Mommy, help me." Complete terror is all I felt. I screamed and screamed until I thought I couldn't anymore. Then the monster started ripping my arm off. It hurt so bad; the pain I can never explain. It didn't stop. Oh, how I begged it to stop. I screamed in horror as it ripped my leg off. Though I was in such complete pain, I realized I was dying. I knew I would never see your face or hear you say how much you love me. I wanted to make all your tears go away. I had so many plans to make you happy. Now I couldn't; all my dreams were shattered. Though I was in utter pain and horror, I felt the pain of my heart breaking, above all. I wanted more than anything; to be your daughter. No use now, for I was dying a painful death. I could only imagine that terrible things they had done to you. I wanted to tell you that I love you before I was gone, but I didn't know the words you could understand. And soon no longer I had the breath to say them; I was dead. I felt myself rising. I was being carried by a huge angel into a big, beautiful place. I was still crying, but the physical pain was gone. The angel took me to Jesus and set me on His lap. He said: "He loved me, and He was my Father." Then I was happy. I asked Him what the thing was that killed me. He answered, "Abortion. I am sorry, my child; for I know how it feels." I don't know what abortion is; I guess that's the name of the monster.<br><br>I'm writing to say that I love you and to tell you how much I wanted to be your little girl. I tried very hard to live. I wanted to live. I had the will, but I couldn't; the monster was too powerful. It sucked my arms and legs off and finally got all of me. It was impossible to live. I just wanted you to know I tried to stay with you. I didn't want to die. Also, Mommy, please watch out for that abortion monster.<br><br>Mommy, I love you and I would hate you to go through the kind of pain I did. Please be careful.<br><br>Love,<br><br>Your baby girl<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;"><strong>The Littlest Firefighter</strong></span><br><br>In Phoenix, AZ. a 26-year-old mother stared down at her son who was dying of terminal leukemia. Although her heart was filled with sadness, she also had a strong feeling of determination. Like any parent she wanted her son to grow up and fulfill all his dreams.<br><br>Now that was no longer possible. The leukemia would see to that. But she still wanted her son's dreams to come true. She took her son's hand and asked, "Billy, did you ever think about what you wanted to be once you grew up? Did you ever dream and wish what you would do with your life?"<br><br>Mommy, I always wanted to be a fireman when I grew up." Mom smiled back and said, "Let's see if we can make your wish come true."<br><br>Later that day she went to her local fire department in Phoenix, Arizona, where she met Fireman Bob, who had a heart as big as Phoenix. She explained her son's final wish and asked if it might be possible to give her six-year-old son a ride around the block on a fire engine.<br><br>Fireman Bob said, "Look, we can do better than that. If you'll have your son ready at seven o'clock Wednesday morning, we'll make him an honorary fireman for the whole day. He can come down to the fire station, eat with us, go out all the fire calls, the whole nine yards! And if you'll give us his sizes, we'll get a real fire uniform for him, with a real fire hat-not a toy one-with the emblem of the Phoenix Fire Department on it, a yellow slicker like we wear and rubber boots. They're all manufactured right here n Phoenix, so we can get them fast."<br><br>Three days later Fireman Bob picked up Billy, dressed him in his fire uniform and escorted him from his hospital bed to the waiting hook and ladder truck. Billy got to sit on the back of the truck and help steer it back to the fire station. He was in heaven. There were three fire calls in Phoenix that day and Billy got to go out on all three calls. He rode in the different fire engines, the paramedic's van, and even the fire chief's car. He was also videotaped for the local news program.<br><br>Having his dream come true, with all the love and attention that was lavished upon him, so deeply touched Billy that he lived three months longer than any doctor thought possible.<br><br>One night all of his vital signs began to drop dramatically and the head nurse, who believed in the hospice concept that no one should die alone, began to call the family members to the hospital. Then she remembered the day Billy had spent as a fireman, so she called the Fire Chief and asked if it would be possible to send a fireman in uniform to the hospital to be with Billy as he made his transition.<br><br>The chief replied, "We can do better than that. We'll be there in five minutes. Will you please do me a favor? When you hear the sirens screaming and see the lights flashing, will you announce over the PA system that there is not a fire? It's just the fire department coming to see one of its finest members one more time. And will you open the window to his room?"<br><br>About five minutes later a hook and ladder truck arrived at the hospital and extended its ladder up to Billy's third floor open window. 16 firefighters climbed up the ladder into Billy's room. With his mother's permission, they hugged him and held him and told him how much they loved him.<br><br>With his dying breath, Billy looked up at the fire chief and said, Chief, am I really a fireman now? "Billy, you are, and the Head Chief, Jesus, is holding your hand," the chief said. With those words, Billy smiled and said, "I know, He's been holding my hand all day, and the angels have been singing." He closed his eyes one last time.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;"><strong>SPEEDING TICKET</strong></span><br><br>Jack took a long look at his speedometer before slowing down: 73 in a 55 zone. Fourth time in as many months. How could a guy get caught so often?<br><br>When his car had slowed to 10 miles an hour, Jack pulled over, but only partially. Let the cop worry about the potential traffic hazard. Maybe some other car will tweak his backside with a mirror.<br><br>The cop was stepping out of his car, the big pad in hand. Bob? Bob from Church? Jack sunk farther into his trench coat.<br><br>This was worse than the coming ticket.<br><br>A cop catching a guy from his own church. A guy who happened to be a little eager to get home after a long day at the office. A guy he was about to play golf with tomorrow.<br><br>Jumping out of the car, he approached a man he saw every Sunday, a man he'd never seen in uniform.<br><br>"Hi, Bob. Fancy meeting you like this." "Hello, Jack." No smile.<br><br>"Guess you caught me red-handed in a rush to see my wife and kids."<br><br>"Yeah, I guess." Bob seemed uncertain. Good.<br><br>"I've seen some long days at the office lately. I'm afraid I bent the rules a bit -just this once." Jack toed at a pebble on the pavement. "Diane said something about roast beef and potatoes tonight. Know what I mean?"<br><br>"I know what you mean. I also know that you have a reputation in our precinct." Ouch. This was not going in the right direction. Time to change tactics.<br><br>"What'd you clock me at?"<br><br>"Seventy. Would you sit back in your car please?" "Now wait a minute here, Bob. I checked as soon as I saw you. I was barely nudging 65." The lie seemed to come easier with every ticket.<br><br>"Please, Jack, in the car."<br><br>Flustered, Jack hunched himself through the still-open door. Slamming it shut, he stared at the dashboard. He was in no rush to open the window. The minutes ticked by. Bob scribbled away on the pad.<br><br>Why hadn't he asked for a driver's license?<br><br>Whatever the reason, it would be a month of Sundays before Jack ever sat near this cop again. A tap on the door jerked his head to the left. There was Bob, a folded paper in hand. Jack rolled down the window a mere two inches, just enough room for Bob to pass him the slip.<br><br>"Thanks." Jack could not quite keep the sneer out of his voice.<br><br>Bob returned to his police car without a word. Jack watched his retreat in the mirror. Jack unfolded the sheet of paper. How much was this one going to cost? Wait a minute. What was this? Some kind of joke? Certainly not a ticket. Jack began to read:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Dear Jack,<br>Once upon a time I had a daughter. She was six when killed by a car. You guessed it -- a speeding driver. A fine and three months in jail, and the man was free. Free to hug his daughters All three of them. I only had one, and I'm going to have to wait until Heaven before I can ever hug her again. A thousand times I've tried to forgive that man. A thousand times I thought I had. Maybe I did, but I need to do it again. Even now. Pray for me. And be careful, Jack, my son is all I have left."<br><br>"Bob" </span><br><br>Jack turned around in time to see Bob's car pull away and head down the road. Jack watched until it disappeared. A full 15 minutes later, he too, pulled away and drove slowly home, praying for forgiveness and hugging a surprised wife and kids when he arrived.<br><br>Life is precious. Handle with care.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This was written by a 12 year old girl on the horrors of been born when the parents were not ready. It is touching and may sway some minds to become pro-choice. Please send this page to everyone you know! We must do all we can to stop the madness!!!<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Dear Mommy,<br><br>i have made up my mind,sitting by the window's ledge. i know u loves me and cries with me; for my heart has been broken. I so wanted to make u happy all my live. I don't quite understand what has happened. I was so excited when I began realizing my existence. I was born in midst of much confusion and chaos. I saw lights shining above the ops table. I was pretty weak as i did not have much nutrient or even food sometimes. i know sometimes its hard for u. I spent most of my time in ICU and ran up a hugh bill. Even from my earliest days, I felt like a big burden to you even tho' u do not admit it.after i was discharged from the hospital,i already ran up a bill so big,i know in my heart that u would take a long time to settle it(if they let u drag,that is.if they dun,i really do not know wat will happen) Sometimes I hear you crying in bed and I cried with you. Sometimes you would yell or scream, then cry. I heard Daddy yelling back. I was sad, and hoped you would be better soon. I wondered why you cried so much. most days you cried almost all of the day even at work. I hurt for you. I couldn't imagine why you were so troubled.<br><br>most days i do not get to see daddy....u tell me that he is busy at work...holding 2 jobs,and the $$$ is still never enuff.after all the bills,there is almost nothing left.u tried to look for a job,but then whos gonna take care of me??so i cried and beg u not to...sometimes i know u do not eat just so that i could...i could see u growing weaker and weaker each day.it hurts me so but u showed me that u love me by sacrificing yourself.some days when daddy is around,i will hear u guys shouting about this thing call choice,but at that time i really dunno whats going on .sometimes there would be no lights and water,sometimes i will go hungry for 2-3 days before i get food...so it went on for many years.<br><br>my 1st pre-school days were again filled with confusion.u had to borrow $$ from granny and a few other adults that i do not know.but i know u were hiding it from dad,as it will cause him more worries and there will most likely be a shouting match again....<br>2 years in pre-school taught me a lot of things...things like love!!!and i know that u love me more than anything else in this world.and it made me happy.<br><br>primary school-u grow weaker every year.while i eat bread everyday sometimes u go a few days without food.i did not understand why would someone not eat .night after night,there would be these evil looking men knocking at our door.asking for $$$.about some loans...i do not understand it all,but i know that we are deep in debts...daddy will almost always not be around,i can feel that he loves u,but work is bogging him down,almost killing him.he will almost always be in a bad mood when he's back.there would be a lot of shouting and screaming,sometimes i can even hear the slaps.there were times when he carried me and i could feel the sadness in his heart,sometimes i think it would be happier for the both of u if i was not there.like the times when u guys went to the beach.or the times u guys stayed at home for 1 whole week jux loving each other.have i become a monster in both ya eyes??i know i m a burden.u will not want to admit it,but we all know the truth.<br><br>I'm writing to say that I love you and to tell you how much I wanted to be your little girl. I tried very hard to make u happy. I wanted to live. I had the will, but I couldn't; the monster was me. i know that love cannot be so selfish. It was impossible  for me not to love u. I just wanted you to know I tried to stay with you. I didn't want to go. Also, Mommy, please do eat everyday from now on.and tell daddy that i love him to.i m sorry to cost u guys so much pain.<br><br>Mommy, I love you and I would hate you to go through the kind of pain I brought again. Please be careful.<br><br></div>
