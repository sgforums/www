            <div class='col-md body'>LONDON : Rock star Ozzy Osbourne is in "stable and comfortable" condition after an emergency surgery following a quad bike accident at his English countryside home, a doctor said on Tuesday.<br><br>Doctors said Osbourne's injuries were not life-threatening but it will take time before the 55-year-old heavy metal singer can leave his hospital bed.<br><br>The former Black Sabbath frontman sustained numerous injuries in the accident on Monday at his estate in Chalfont Saint Peter, northwest of London.<br><br>"When admitted he had a fractured left collarbone and damage to the blood vessels, eight fractured ribs on the left side, a small but stable fracture of the vertebrae in his neck," said Dr Dick Jack, medical director of the Wexham Park hospital in Slough, west of London.<br><br>There were no details on how the accident happened.<br><br>Osbourne underwent emergency surgery after the crash, and was now in intensive care.<br><br>"His progress is steady. He is stable, he is comfortable and satisfactory but it's going to be slow and I don't expect any major changes, certainly for 24 hours," Dr Jack said.<br><br>Ozzy is expected to recover from his surgery.<br><br>Looking pale and drawn, Sharon Osbourne immediately flew in from Los Angeles.<br><br>While she was allowed to be by her husband's side, reports say the star was unable to speak as he is on a ventilator.<br><br>The rocker was taking a day off from a British promotional tour to publicise a duet with his daughter Kelly when the accident happened.<br><br>The song 'Changes', which has been released in Britain, is a likely contender for the number 1 spot in singles charts this Christmas.<br><br>While all travel plans for Ozzy are now on hold, fans can still catch a sight of the star in the third season of the reality TV series 'The Osbournes' which is expected to debut in January. - CNA<br><br></div>
