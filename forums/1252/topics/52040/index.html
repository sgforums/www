            <div class='col-md body'>Tonight the night sky burns as bright as the sun, except it burnt even hotter way hotter than the sun. The white man has been dropping 30 tonnes napalm bombs on the jungle canopy! The jelly burns everything it touches even on the surface of waterÂ…<br><br>Areas and areas of jungle just turn into orange inferno,for miles and miles it just keeps on burning and burning and burning!!! Everything within 80 -100 miles will turn into ashes within 2 hours. Nothing will survive the onslaught of the fire god. Entire villages hundred upon hundreds of women children and men were killed in an instant. I wonder what they are fighting for, these white men? These are my people my land my home.i fight for these and more. My pride, my family, my dreams of a better Vietnam under the malevolent rule of ho chi minh. Now these men come and take away our land, our food.they take away our brothers with their bullets. With them they brought along their problems. Small towns have sprang up just to cater to their needs. Diseases bar brawls touting illegal substances prostitution gun fights....<br>i will not let them win this war.this war that is not even theirs.i will not go down without a fight.i will not let them rule.they claim that they do not wanna rule,they jux wanna help.can i even believe them!!!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Today big brother sam gave the green light to use napalm on the major parts of the Vietnam jungles.weÂ’ve been waiting for this go-ahead for 17 months now.wat was to be a short splendid war for the politicians has turn into a day to day inferno hell for us fighting grunts!<br><br>I have lost 7 personal friends and more than 80 comrades in these 6 months alone not to mention those that have been sent back to the world due to really bad injuries. Some have half their faces blown off and they r still alive. TheirÂ’s will be a hard time back in a world where looks will be judged and I pray for their recovery back in the real world. I may get to see them again if I live thru this hell on earth. And those that I lost, may god keep your souls, for you have serve your time in hell its time you rest in heaven.<br><br>Now its finally payback time. with napalm we can now light up the night, the dark evil night where the gooks hide in every nook and corner where they jump you in an instant where the feces filled bamboo spikes put you down almost as fast as the ak rounds! The night the darkness has made a pact with the gooks. Now we will show them our new friend. The light and THE FIRE. Liquid petrolume that will not only light up the night it will also torch everything it touches. Just like hands of ifrit . and it will also suck the air out from your lungs like a vaccum Â…..<br><br>Whistleing out in the open its ak rounds,once u heard it,u will never ever in this life forget its sound.the sound that took away so many livesÂ… we are under attack againÂ…..<br></div>
