Weird Drugs                                              by The Jolly Roger<br><br>Bananas:<br>Obtain 15 pounds of ripe yellow bananas.<br>Peel all and eat the fruit. Save the peelings.<br>Scrape all the insides of the peels with a sharp knife.<br>Put all the scraped material in a large pot and add water.<br>Boil 3 or 4 hours until it has attained a solid paste consistency.<br>Spread paste onto cookie sheets and dry in oven for about 20 minutes. This will result in fine black powder. Usually one will feel the effects after smoking three to four cigarettes.<br><br>Cough syrup:<br>Mix Robitussion AC with an equal amount of ginger ale and drink. The effect are sedation and euphoria. Never underestimate the effects of any drug! You can OD on cough syrup!<br><br>Toads:<br>Collect five to ten toads, frogs will not work. The best kind are tree toads.<br>Kill them as painlessly as possible, and skin immediately.<br>Allow the skins to dry in a refrigerator four to five days, or until the skins are brittle.<br>Now crush the skins into powder and smoke. Due to its bad taste you can mix it with a more fragrant smoking medium.<br><br>Nutmeg:<br>Take several whole nutmegs and grind them up in an old grinder.<br>After the nutmegs are ground. Place in a mortar and pulverize with a pestle.<br>The usual dosage is about 10 or 15 grams. A larger dose may produce excessive thirst, anxiety, and rapid heart beat, but hallucinations are rare.<br><br>Peanuts:<br>Take 1 pound of raw peanuts (not roasted.)<br>Shell them, saving the skins and discarding the shells.<br>Eat the nuts.<br>Grind up the skins and smoke them.<br><br></div>

Harmless Bombs                                           by The Jolly Roger<br><br>To all those who do not wish to inflict bodily damage on their victims but only terror. These are weapons that should be used from high places.<br><br>The Flour Bomb<br>Take a wet paper towel and pour a given amount of baking flour in the center. Then wrap it up and put on a rubber band to keep it together. When thrown it will fly well but when it hits, it covers the victim with the flower or causes a big puff of flour which will put the victim in terror since as far as they are concerned, some strange white powder is all over them. This is a cheap method of terror and for only the cost of a roll of paper towels and a bag of flour you and your friends can have loads of fun watching people flee in panic.<br>Smoke Bomb Projectile<br>All you need is a bunch of those little round smoke bombs and a wrist rocket or any sling-shot. Shoot the smoke bombs and watch the terror since they think it will blow up!<br>Rotten Eggs (Good ones)<br>Take some eggs and get a sharp needle and poke a small hole in the top of each one. Then let them sit in a warm place for about a week. Then you've got a bunch of rotten eggs that will only smell when they hit.<br>Glow in the Dark Terror<br>Take one of those tubes of glow in the dark stuff and pour the stuff on whatever you want to throw and when it gets on the victim, they think it's some deadly chemical or a radioactive substance so they run in total panic. This works especially well with flower bombs since a gummy, glowing substance gets all over the victim.<br>Fizzling Panic<br>Take a baggy of a water-baking soda solution and seal it. (Make sure there is no air in it since the solution will form a gas and you don't want it to pop on you.) Then put it in a bigger plastic bag and fill it with vinegar and seal it. When thrown, the two substances will mix and cause a violently bubbling substance to go all over the victim.<br></div>

Being of a rational, intelligent disposition, you wisely choose to avoid a (direct) confrontation.  But as he laughs in your face, you smile inwardly---your revenge is already planned.<br><br>Follow your victim to his locker, car, or house.  Once you have chosen your target site, lay low for a week or more, letting your anger boil.<br><br>In the mean time, assemble your versatile terrorist kit(details below.)<br><br>Plant your kit at the designated target site on a Monday morning between the hours of 4:00 am and 6:00 am.  Include a calm, suggestive note that quietly hints at the possibility of another attack.  Do not write it by hand!  An example of an effective note: "don't be such a jerk, or the next one will take off your hand.  Have a nice day." Notice how the calm tone instills fear.  As if written by a homicidal psychopath.<br><br>Choose a strategic location overlooking the target site. Try to position yourself in such a way that you can see his facial contortions.<br><br>Sit back and enjoy the fireworks! Assembly of the versatile, economic, and effective terrorist kit #1: the parts you'll need are:<br>Â·	4 AA batteries<br>Â·	1 9-volt battery<br>Â·	1 SPDT mini relay (radio shack)<br>Â·	1 rocket engine(smoke bomb or m-80)<br>Â·	1 solar igniter (any hobby store)<br>Â·	1 9-volt battery connector<br><br>Take the 9-volt battery and wire it through the relay's coil. This circuit should also include a pair of contacts that when separated cut off this circuit.  These contacts should be held together by trapping them between the locker, mailbox, or car door. Once the door is opened, the contacts fall apart and the 9-volt circuit is broken, allowing the relay to fall to the closed position thus closing the ignition circuit. (If all this is confusing take a look at the schematic below.)<br><br>Take the 4 AA batteries and wire them in succession. Wire the positive terminal of one to the negative terminal of another, until all four are connected except one positive terminal and one negative terminal.  Even though the four AA batteries only combine to create 6 volts, the increase in amperage is necessary to activate the solar igniter quickly and effectively.<br><br>Take the battery pack (made in step 2) and wire one end of it to the relay's single pole and the other end to one prong of the solar igniter.  Then wire the other prong of the solar igniter back to the open position on the relay.<br><br>Using double sided carpet tape mount the kit in his locker, mailbox, or car door. And last, insert the solar igniter into the rocket engine (smoke bomb or m-80).<br><br>Your kit is now complete!<br><br>---------&gt;&lt;---------<br>I    (CONTACTS)    I<br>I                  I<br>I                  -  (BATTERY)<br>I                 ---<br>I                  I<br>I      (COIL)      I<br>------///////-------<br>/-----------<br>/           I<br>/            I<br>/             I<br>(SWITCH) I        I<br>I        I<br>I       --- (BATTERY)<br>I        -  ( PACK  )<br>I       ---<br>I        I<br>I        I<br>---- -----<br>I I<br>*<br>(SOLAR IGNITER)<br></div>
