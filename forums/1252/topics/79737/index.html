            <div class='col-md body'>Once there was a tree..... and she loved a little boy. And every day the boy would come and he would gather her leaves and make them into crowns and play king of the forest. He would climb up her trunk and swing from her branches and eat apples. And they would play hide-and-go-seek. And when he was tired, he would sleep in her shade. And the boy loved the tree.......very much. And the tree was happy.<br><br>But time went by. And the boy grew older. And the tree was often alone. Then one day the boy came to the tree and the tree said "Come, Boy, come and climb up my trunk and swing from my branches and eat apples and play in my shade and be happy"<br><br>"I am too big to climb and play", said the boy. "I want to buy things and have fun. I want some money. Can you give me some money?" "I'm sorry," said the tree, "but I have no money, I have only leaves and apples. Take my apples, Boy, and sell them in the city. Then you will have money and you will be happy." And so the boy climbed up the tree and gathered her apples and carried them away. And the tree was happy.<br><br>But the boy stayed away for a long time.. and the tree was sad. And then one day the boy came back and the tree shook with joy and she said, "Come, Boy, climb up my trunk and swing from my branches and be happy." "I am too busy to climb trees," said the boy. "I want a house to keep me warm," he said. "I want a wife and I want children, and so I need a house. Can you give me a house?" "I have no house," said the tree. "The forest is my house, but you may cut off my branches and build a house. Then you will be happy." And the boy cut off her branches and carried them away to build his house. And the tree was happy.<br><br>But the boy stayed away for a long time. And when he came back, the tree was so happy she could hardly speak. "Come, Boy," she whispered, "come and play." "I am too old and sad to play," said the boy. "I want a boat that take me far away from here. Can you give me a boat?" "Cut down my trunk and make a boat," said the tree. "Then you can sail away...... and be happy." And so the boy cut down her trunk and made a boat and sailed away. And the tree was happy....<br><br>but not really. And after a long time the boy came back again. "I am sorry, Boy," said the tree,<br><br>"but I have nothing left to give you----" "My apples are gone." "My teeth are too weak for apples," said the boy. "My branches are gone," said the tree. "You cannot swing on them------" "I am too old to swing on branches," said the boy. "My trunk is gone," said the tree. "You cannot climb--------" "I am too tired to climb," said the boy. "I am sorry," sighed the tree. "I wish that I could give you something------ but I have nothing left. I am just an old stump." "I don't need very much now," said the boy. "just a quiet place to sit and rest. I am very tired." "Well," said the tree, straightening herself up as much as she could, "well, an old stump is good for sitting and resting. Come, Boy, sit down. Sit down and rest." And the boy did. And the tree was happy.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>long time ago, there was a huge apple tree. A little boy loved to come and play around it everyday. He climbed to the tree top, ate the apples, took a nap under the shadow. He loved the tree and the tree loved to play with him.<br><br>Time went by. The little boy had grown up and he no longer played around the tree everyday. One day, the boy came back to the tree and he looked sad.<br><br>"Come and play with me," the tree asked the boy.<br><br>"I am no longer a kid, I don't play around trees anymore." The boy replied, "I want toys. I need money to buy them."<br><br>"Sorry, but I don't have money. But you can pick all my apples and sell them. So, you will have money." The boy was so excited.<br><br>He grabbed all the apples on the tree and left happily.<br><br>The boy never came back after he picked the apples. The tree was sad.<br><br>One day, the boy returned and the tree was so excited. "Come and play with me" the tree said.<br><br>"I don't have time to play. I have to work for family. We need a house for shelter. Can you help me?"<br><br>"Sorry, but I don't have a house. But you can chop off my branches to build your house."<br><br>So the boy cut all the branches of the tree and left happily. The tree was glad to see him happy but the boy never came back since then. The tree was again lonely and sad.<br><br>One hot summer day, the boy returned and the tree was delighted. "Come and play with me!" the tree said.<br><br>The boy said, "I am sad and getting old. I want to go sailing to relax myself. Can you give me a boat?"<br><br>"Use my truck to build your boat. You can sail far away and be happy."<br><br>So the boy cut the tree truck to make a boat. He went sailing and never showed up for a long time.<br><br>Finally, the boy returned after he left for so many years. "Sorry, my boy. But I don't have anything for you anymore. No more apples for you." the tree said.<br><br>"I don't have teeth to bite" the boy replied.<br><br>"No more truck for you to climb on"<br><br>"I am too old for that now" the boy said.<br><br>"I really can't give you anything. The only thing left is my dying roots." the tree said with tears.<br><br>"I don't need much now, just a place to rest. I am tired after all these years." the boy replied.<br><br>"Good! Old tree roots is the best place to lean on and rest. Come, come sit down with me and rest."<br><br>The boy sat down and the tree was glad and smiled with tears.<br><br></div>
