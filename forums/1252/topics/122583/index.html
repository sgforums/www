Â‘Post Revolutionary EraÂ’ is like ZhangÂ’s version of Dave MarkeyÂ’s Â‘1991 - The Year Punk BrokeÂ’ (1992) in that it documents with love and solidarity, a whole generation of musicians and music lovers who live and struggle for the music they make. It is a eulogy to the new Beijing, to rock bands of any ilk who live dirt poor in rural farm areas, co-existing peacefully with their landlords (poor farmers themselves) and save up every yuan to simply rock out. Chockfull to the brim with footage of live shows, poetic explosions and manifesto-like declarations, ZhangÂ’s documentary is joyous, as it rightfully should be.<br><br>Director: Zhang Yang<br>Country: China<br>Duration: 100min<br>Year: 2004<br>Rating: NC-16<br></div>

Here, he focuses on the famous city of Angkor, widely recognised for its bas-reliefs and religious iconography. Panh gleans stories from the inhabitants of the city and their hopes, however slim, for the future. A peddler who has yet to learn to read and cannot afford an education wonders what direction to take. A former peasant who now labours at restoration sites remembers his agrarian days fondly and cherishes his fighting cock named Â“Lemon SoupÂ”. Through these different stories, both humour and pathos emerge.<br><br>Director: Rithy Panh<br>Country: Cambodia / France<br>Duration: 90min<br>Year: 2003<br>Rating: PG<br></div>

Armed with a DV camera, the director roamed the streets of Shibuya around Tokyo. Dislocated, apathetic and apparently without conventional family lives, these characters engage in the classic exhibitionist-voyeur ritual, get off on Internet images and TV news flashes of disasters. Day or night, Yutaka TsuchiyaÂ’s low-grade grainy insights into urban, contemporary Japan are both startling and revelatory. Winner of the FIPRESCI Prize at Rotterdam International Film Festival 2004.<br><br>Director: Yutaka Tsuchiya<br>Country: Japan<br>Duration: 98min<br>Year: 2003<br>Rating: M18<br></div>

The Ghoti siblings are virtual orphans, with both parents in jail. While their father was a Taliban fighter, their mother is arrested for remarrying in order to avoid starvation and poverty. As Zahed and Ghoti are homeless, they frequently visit their mother in prison and eventually, one of the guards allows them to spend nights with her. When the warden puts an end to this arrangement, insisting it is not an orphanage, they try their hand at petty crime just to be able to gain entrance into prison and a life off the streets. Ironic, beautifully shot in the characteristic style of the Makhmalbaf Film House and filled with pathos for a struggling people, Meshkini shows herself to be an exquisite filmmaker in her own right.<br><br>Director: Marziyeh Meshkini<br>Country: Iran<br>Duration: 93min<br>Year: 2003<br>Rating: NC16<br></div>

She meets a mysterious stranger who persuasively lures her into a game of manipulation. The film is a postmodern rendering of Little Red Riding Hood, where seduction, innocence and fear all combine to produce a picture of the human psyche. Like TzangÂ’s previous film eÂ’Tzaintes, Â‘A Wicked TaleÂ’ uses expressionistic techniques and a subterranean dream landscape to let the story unravel. Premiering to accolade in Rotterdam, Tzang's film will be an Asian Premiere here in Singapore.<br><br>To be screened with A Wicked Tale and Malice.<br><br>Director: Tzang Merwyn Tong<br>Country: Singapore<br>Duration: 45min<br>Year: 2004<br>Rating: NC16<br><br>Malice<br>Sam Loh (Outsiders, 2004) maintains his fascination for the intersection of lives and desires leading to conflicting, often violent conclusions. Aimee (Amy Cheng) and Gerald (Lim Kay Tong) are in a listless marriage, while Jon (Timothy Nga) and Julianne (Agnes Wong) are engaged, though there is an apparent lack in their relationship as well. Aimee and Jon play strangers in public but are having an affair, something they both want to reveal so they can come clean and commit to each other.

West Papua has the highest concentration of HIV cases in Indonesia. Looking For Madonna begins with an intriguing, almost witty story about men and sex workers narrated by Minus, one of the "characters" in the film. But afterwards, we are taken on a journey into the lives of sex workers and another narrative arc is built around the true story of a cremation of one HIV victim.<br><br>Rantau's clever melding of genres allows him to show how the disease spreads through the sharing of needles, as well as the illicit trade in substances of various kinds. An illness as critical and ubiquitous as this one is as rampant in Asia as it was once thought to be in other parts of the world.<br><br>To be screened with Dajang Soembi.<br><br>Director: John De Rantau<br>Country: Indonesia<br>Duration: 93min<br>Year: 2004<br>Rating: NC16<br></div>
