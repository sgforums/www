In a clap-board shack with a roof of tin<br>Where the rain came down and leaked within<br>A young Mother frozen on a concrete floor<br>With a bottle and a box and a candle<br>of straw Tupelo ! O Tupelo !!<br>With a bundle and a box and a candle of straw "<br><br>( 'Tupelo' from " The First Born Is Dead )<br><br>#4." We talk about it all night long<br>We define our moral ground<br>But when I crawl into your arms<br>Everything comes tumbling down "<br><br>( taken from ' The Ship Song ')<br>on the album The Good Son<br><br>#5."
