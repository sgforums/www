The rest marry the most suitable person who comes along when they are ready to settle down.<br><br>A friend in his 20s came to this conclusion after confiding in me that he had recently met a woman who is more attractive than his wife, and so occupies his thoughts more often than his wife does.<br><br>'If only I had met her before I got married,' he said wistfully.<br><br>But I think even if the love of one's life appears when one is single, one may not be in the right frame of mind to recognise him or her as such.<br><br>And then love passes by.<br><br>Life is littered with near misses and lost opportunities.<br><br>I attended my ex-boyfriend's wedding last month, which triggered many memories.<br><br>-From the Straits Times.<br><br>We met five years ago when I was 23 and he 31. It was love at first sight.<br><br>He had an established career, was down-to-earth and steadfastly religious.<br><br>I was then working as an air stewardess and my head was - literally and metaphorically - in the clouds.<br><br>I was also - well, let's put it this way - not religious.<br><br>Despite our differences, we were soulmates. We had the same quirky sense of humour and shared long, intense overnight conversations.<br><br>But human nature is perverse. When someone is excessively nice to us, we start taking things for granted, instead of appreciating them even more.<br><br>My ex sent me to the airport, fixed my PC, reminded me to take health supplements - and go to church.<br><br>He had everything I could want in a husband - except that I was not looking for one. A boyfriend was all I could cope with then.<br><br>I loved fast cars, danced wildly at Zouk and took off on shopping holidays at a whim. My life revolved around I, me and myself.<br><br>In the six months that we were together, he popped the question several times and talked ad nauseam about having children. He wanted us to enrol for a Christian marriage preparation course.<br><br>Yes, I did often fantasise about a Vera Wang wedding gown, but I was at that stage of my life when I was more interested in Guess than Baby Guess.<br><br>And where - dare I admit it? - I still wanted to meet other men.<br><br>So I was a 23-year-old with the emotional maturity of a 13-year-old. Responsibility? Wasn't that for adults?<br><br>In short, I met Mr Right at the wrong time.<br><br>The more he talked about marriage and religion, the more I felt pressured and the more pressured I felt, the more irritable I became.<br><br>I was too impatient to compromise. Every trivial matter blew up as a big deal. My mood obliterated the good in our relationship and reached a point where I just wanted out.<br><br>He was heartbroken; I was sad but relieved. He still called me regularly, beseeching me to change my mind.<br><br>The calls stopped finally after a year. Now and then, we say 'Hi' via e-mail.<br><br>I had a few painful relationships after that. Served me right, as those rude wake-up calls were necessary for me to realise the meaninglessness of my hedonistic high life.<br><br>I missed the tenderness of my ex and began having second thoughts.<br><br>Perhaps I also felt more urgency to find someone marriageable before my biological clock reached zero hour. It dawned on me that I am not a pixie like Peter Pan who can flit around forever. One day, I'd wake up sick and alone when my fair weather friends flit away.<br><br>But I was too proud and too unsure of my ex's reaction to call him until last year.<br><br>The first thing he told me excitedly was that he had found The One. My heart tumbled to my feet. So, that's Fate.<br><br>If only I could turn back time. If only I had met him later. If only... what feeble words.<br><br>These days, I am more circumspect. I have come to terms with my loss. There is nothing I can do about timing, but I can do everything about my choices.<br><br>Sometimes, when the nights get lonely, I toy with the idea of marrying a platonic friend of mine, who often assures me earnestly that, if the worst comes to the worst, he'd be willing to marry me.<br><br>But I always dismiss that. I have already made one mistake. I should not make another by settling for second best merely for the sake of getting hitched - only to regret it soon after, as the guy who confided in me did.<br><br>Hopefully, the best is not over but yet to be.<br></div>
