We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less time.<br><br>We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness.<br><br>We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too<br>recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom.<br><br>We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our<br>values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often.<br><br>We've learned how to make a living, but not a life.<br><br>We've added years to life not life to years.<br><br>We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor.<br><br>We conquered outer space but not inner space.<br><br>We've done larger things, but not better things.<br><br>We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul.<br><br>We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice.<br><br>We write more, but learn less.<br><br>We plan more, but accomplish less.<br><br>We've learned to rush, but not to wait.<br><br>We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less.<br><br>These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small character, steep profits and shallow relationships.<br><br>These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes.<br><br>These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do<br>everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill.<br><br>It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom.<br><br>A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit<br>delete.<br><br>Remember, spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not going to be around forever.<br><br>Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and leave your<br>side.<br><br>Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a cent.<br><br>Remember, to say, "I love you" to your partner and your loved ones, but most of all mean it.<br><br>A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you.<br><br>Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person will not be there again.<br><br>Give time to love, give time to speak, and give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind.<br><br>Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath way."<br><br></div>
