            <div class='col-md body'>kingston trio<br>tom dooley<br><br>Spoken recitation over musical accompaniment)<br>Throughout history, there have been many songs written about the eternal triangle. This next one tells the story of Mister Grayson, a beautiful woman, and a condemned man named Tom Dooley. When the sun rises tomorrow, Tom Dooley must hang.<br><br>Chorus:<br>Hang down your head, Tom Dooley. Hang down your head and cry.<br>Hang down your head, Tom Dooley. Poor boy, you're bound to die.<br><br>I met her on the mountain. There I took her life. Met her on the mountain. Stabbed her with my knife.<br><br>(Chorus)<br><br>This time tomorrow. Reckon where I'll be. Hadn't-a been for Grayson, I'd-a been in Tennessee.<br><br>(Chorus)<br><br>This time tomorrow. Reckon where I'll be. Down in some lonesome valley hangin' from a white oak tree.<br><br>(Chorus)<br><br></div>
