Gartner believes that by year-end 2007, Microsoft, Yahoo, AOL and IBM among others will introduce SaaS offerings that compete with Google Apps.<br><br>Microsoft's SaaS offering, <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/officelive/default.aspx" rel="nofollow"> Office Live</a>, does not have Office suite cognates, but the analyst firm expects it to evolve into a "direct competitor" to Google Apps.<br><br>"However, we believe that Google will have an edge in faster feature evolution. By the end of 2010, 30 per cent of enterprises in North America will likely sanction the use of Google Apps (or the equivalent from a competitor) for at least some of their users," Gartner stated.<br><br>"Through 2010, we do not expect Google's competitors to match the scale and efficiency of the 'Googleplex' as a global-class architecture for delivering SaaS.<br><br>"We expect Google Apps' collaboration features will evolve at 'internet speed'. Expect Google Apps improvements monthly or quarterly."<br><br>However, the analyst firm went on to advise firms that Google Apps is not ready as an enterprise-wide SaaS collaboration option for most enterprises.<br><br>"This is a version 1.0 product and lacks key features, such as offline availability. Furthermore, costs may exceed $50 per user per year after factoring in fees for integration, onboarding, oversight and extras such as archiving and calendar synchronisation," Gartner warned.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Google Apps Premier Edition will be the first SaaS offering that enterprises will seriously consider</span></div>
