            <div class='col-md body'>ImgBurn carries on from where DVD Decrypter left off! (Well, for the burning part anyway!)<br>ImgBurn can write most types of CD / DVD images and it supports all the latest writers (including booktype / bitsetting on many of the major ones - i.e. BenQ, LiteOn, NEC, Plextor, Sony). You can even use ImgBurn to erase / format your rewritable media!<br><br>ImgBurn will try its very best to burn your DVD-Video double layer images using the layer break you've specified in the IFO files, but it can also calculate the best place for you, to save you the trouble.<br><br>Advanced functionality can be found in context menus that appear when you right click on various bits of the user interface. Can you find<br><br><img src="http://www.filehippo.com/img/ex/631__imgBurn1.png"><br><br>Change Log:<br><br>- Added: 'Read' mode for basic (sector by sector) creation of images direct from a cd/dvd.<br><br>- Added: Unicode support to everywhere that needs it!<br><br>- Added: An 'AUTO' write speed where you can now have custom write speeds for individual media types/dyes on a drive by drive basis. You can also use things like 'CD-R', 'DVD-R', 'DVD+R' etc.<br><br>- Added: Ability to preview Cells in the Build mode's 'Create layer break position' dialog box (or doing it via Tools -&gt; ISO -&gt; Display IFO Layer Break Position). This uses PgcEdit's little PgcEditPreview.exe file.<br><br>- Added: Option of Standard/DOS/ASCII characters set for ISO9660 file systems. (previously only Standard/ASCII was supported)<br><br>- Added: Ability to build ISO9660 file systems where files can have no extension at all (not even a '.' (dot)).<br><br>- Added: Options to disable warnings when checking 'seamless' or 'don't update ifo/bup files' boxes in the layer break dialog windows.<br><br>- Added: Options to automatically check the 'seamless' and 'don't update ifo/bup files' boxes in the layer break dialog windows.<br><br>- Added: Support for reading/parsing UDF v2.50 - as used on HDDVD / Blu-ray discs.<br><br>- Added: Build mode now has the ability to look for and optimise duplicate files so that only 1 copy of that file actually exists in the ISO/on the disc.<br>- Added: /EJECT CLI command.<br><br>- Added: 'Auto Change Book Type' option to the settings. This is only used for LG and Samsung drives. When enabled (default), it will make the program send the appropriate command to tell the drive to booktype the disc to DVDROM at the start of every burn - obviously just for Plus format media -i.e. DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD+R DL.<br><br>- Added: Ability to insert a layer break position in the MDS file made by the 'Create DVD MDS File' tool.<br><br>- Added: Early warning message on DVD Video builds where the files are probably too big for the destination DVD media.<br><br>- Added: Checks for people loading '*.000' and '*.ISO' files in Write mode when a '*.DVD' one exists.<br><br>- Added: Ability to burn small images JUST to the first layer on DL media (normally you would split the data between layers).<br><br>- Added: Warning message if user specified layer break differs from that in the loaded *.MDS/*.DVD file.<br><br>- Added: Additional check for file splitting suitability when doing a read/build to hdd using the FAT/FAT32 file system.<br><br>- Added: 'Sector Viewer' button to Read/Verify modes in the 'Source' box.<br><br>- Added: 'Cancel' option when loading an IBQ file and none of the images are in the right place!<br><br>- Added: Files created in Read/Build mode are now (optionally - default = on) pre-allocated. This cuts down on fragmentation.<br><br>- Added: Options to set process priority during Read/Write/Verify.<br><br>- Added: Support for reading hdd partitions to an image file suitable for use as the boot image when building a bootable disc/iso.<br><br>- Added: A button on the 'volume label' windows to have it insert the current date/time in YYYYMMDD_HHMM format.<br><br>- Added: Answer 'Yes' / Answer 'No' options to the 'Don't prompt VIDEO_TS content' option.<br><br>- Added: An optional timeout to the auto volume label window (default is ON and 30 seconds).<br><br>- Added: Layer break positions are now displayed in the main GUI if the MDS/DVD file loaded in Write/Verify mode contained one.<br><br>- Added: Options on the 'Create DVD MDS File' window are now remembered between sessions.<br><br>- Added: The option of preserving full pathnames within MDS files created by Read/Build modes.<br><br>- Added: Improved logging options for files that have their names shortened due to file system limitations / restrictions currently in place.<br><br>- Added: Ability to add device id strings that are really OEM LG / Samsung drives - for use by the 'Auto Change Book Type' feature.<br><br>- Added: New 'Filter Driver Load Order' feature so you can see which drivers all your I/O is going through - and spot ones that could be messing things up. (Available on Windows 2000 and newer)<br><br>- Added: When the book type commands fail, the 'reason' (I/O SenseArea interpretation) is now also displayed in the messagebox.<br><br>- Added: Support for Vista's new 'OnDVDArrival' autoplay stuff - so it now says 'Burn an Image' (using ImgBurn) as an option when you insert a blank DVD. (This had already been implemented for OnCDArrival and I had assumed it would apply to both - it didn't!)<br><br>- Added: Support for showing supported write speeds on CD.<br><br>- Added: Support for identifying DVD+RW DL booktype.<br><br>- Added: 'TOC Information' to the Info panels in all modes.<br><br>- Added: Detection/Identification of 'HD DVD-ROM' etc type drives to the log when ImgBurn first starts.<br><br>- Added: Detection of HD DVD-RW read/write capabilities.<br><br>- Added: Context menu with 'Copy' option on it to the 'Label' field in the 'Previous Image' groupbox on the 'Please insert next disc' window.<br><br>- Added: Message in 'Build' mode when user tries to write an ISO image - where they should probably be using 'Write' mode.<br>- Added: 'Free Space' to the info page in build mode - used as part of the 'Calculate' function.<br>- Added/Changed: 'Preferred Format Capacity' value to info window for rewritable media. This value is now used during full erase rather than the maximum one.<br>- Added/Changed: A little workaround for a glitch in Vista with windows using a non resizable frame under the Aero theme. Pixel 0, 0 is not the absolute top left of the window - making the window appear off the screen.<br>- Added/Changed: The shutdown options / API's now use the 'FORCE' flag if ImgBurn detects the computer is 'Locked' - this can be disabled in the settings.<br>- Changed: Only the first cell in an angle block is now shown as a potential layer break. Other cells in the block take on the same SPLIP flag as the first.<br>- Changed: Check for updates defaults to 'Weekly' now. (Beta versions still do it every time it's started)<br>- Changed: 'Time' column header in layer break dialog boxes to say 'Start Time'.<br>- Changed: Some of the 'Program Update' code to hopefully reduce the chance of getting a cached response when checking for version updates.<br>- Changed: When looking for firmware updates, only the model is now passed to the www.rpc1.org search engine rather than make + model.<br>- Changed: On a fresh install, people with over 1GB RAM get a 40MB buffer, not 20MB.<br>- Changed: Process priority for Verify mode now defaults to 'Normal'.<br>- Changed: Some of the little hdd/cdrom pictures to their XP equivalents.<br>- Changed: New images for the column sort arrows shown in the Queue window (Applies to all OS's prior to XP - XP handles arrows by itself). The previous ones were not very clear.<br>- Changed: The icon on the DVDInfoPro buttons so it matches the new one used in the latest version of the program.<br>- Changed: Samsung 'change book type' screen always used to say the current setting was DVDROM. This was 'forced' because the drive doesn't appear to report the current value. ImgBurn now tells it like it is.<br>- Changed: BD-RE Full Erase code now also writes 0's to all the sectors on the disc. Unlike with DVD+RW erase, the drive doesn't do this automatically.<br>- Changed: The exe is now compressed using UPX 2.92 (beta). This new version appears to fix the Windows 98 crashing bug that plagued it previously and UPX doesn't suffer from the XP crashes that PECompact does.<br>- Changed: Update to using NSIS 2.23 for the installation program.<br>- Changed/Fixed: There wasn't anything 'logged' when a file wasn't readable when building an image in 'Build' mode.<br>- Changed/Fixed: Errors caught during the sync cache / disc finalisation stages were not taken into consideration when deciding if the burn succeeded/failed.<br>- Changed/Fixed: Loads of stuff for Blu-ray media / burning. (BIG Thanks to SVP for letting me borrow a drive!)<br>- Changed/Fixed: Some bits for HD DVD media / burning.<br>- Changed/Fixed: Now only single session/track data discs can be processed by Read &amp; Verify modes.<br>- Changed/Fixed: Unless the user specifically overwrites an image in read/build mode, the MDS file will not overwrite an existing one with the same name - it'll rename / create a new one in the 'filename(x).ext' format.<br>- Fixed: IFO parsing code wasn't processing VMGM / VTSM cell info properly (well, ok, at all!) and so they'd show up as non seamless when they shouldn't have in the layer break selection boxes.<br>- Fixed: Build mode's layer break code was a little too good at skipping analysis of files it didn't think would work - as such, some perfectly valid potential layer break positions were missing from the dialog box.<br>- Fixed: Bad/failed copies in a multi-copy queued burn were not being taken into account when decided whether or not to delete an image based on the 'Delete the image when done' setting.<br>- Fixed: The Patin-Couffin I/O interface caused BSOD's on Windows 9x. This is probably due to changes in the driver as 9x used to use different code to NT. ImgBurn now uses the same code for all OS's. Tested with v36.<br>- Fixed: UDF Version was displayed using OS's regional setting for a decimal place rather than being fixed as a '.' (dot).<br>- Fixed: Drag + Drop of folders into the write queue could lead to duplicates if a .DVD and .ISO were present in the same folder and had the same name (well, first part anyway!).<br>- Fixed: Times were wrong in layer break dialog for PGC's using multiple angles.<br>- Fixed: Having 'Auto Calculate' enabled messed up builds initiated via CLI.<br>- Fixed: The 'Verify Against Image File' option in the settings (Write tab) had no effect on the 'Build' Mode virtual image and so a verify always compared the burnt disc to the original data.<br>- Fixed: Just adding VIDEO_TS type files to the source box in Build mode failed to build a DVD Video disc (after you answered 'yes' to say that's what you wanted to do). The operation was aborted instantly.<br>- Fixed: /LOG CLI command didn't work if the program was already auto saving the log somewhere due to normal option in the settings (Events tab).<br>- Fixed: Pasting text into ISO9660 volume label boxes allowed for characters that should have been restricted (it bypassed the normal checks).<br>- Fixed: 'Weekly' and 'Fortnightly' were round the wrong way in the 'check for program update' option drop down box.<br>- Fixed: Couldn't just specify a filename (no path) for the /SETTINGS CLI 'File Name' argument. It would save ok but wouldn't load.<br>- Fixed: LBA offset was wrong in one of the UDF descriptors if the file descriptors for a given directory spanned multiple sectors. (Some OS's didn't then show all the files)<br>- Fixed: Starting the build/write automatically via CLI could mean the autoinsert thread was run after it should have already been terminated. This could cause errors to pop up as the disc continued to burn (so not really damaging anything).<br>- Fixed: Memory leak if you used the 'Create DVD MDS File' tool.<br>- Fixed: Incorrect decoding of I/O errors when using the 'Write (12)' command.<br>- Fixed: A couple of glitches in the GUI on Vista.<br>- Fixed: A problem where the MD5 hash wasn't always calculated/displayed in the log after a burn/verify etc.<br>- Fixed: The open file dialog boxes now have the places bar down the left hand side on Windows Me.<br>- Fixed: 'Chapter' column in layer break dialog boxes was showing a number with a base of 0, instead of with a base of 1 - i.e. it was 1 too low!<br>- Fixed: Layer break positions in the list view were only sorted by LBA and those with the same LBA could appear in the wrong order - LU / PGC / Chapter / Cell wise.<br>- Fixed: Tools -&gt; ISO -&gt; 'Display IFO Layer break position' could start with part of an internal (to the program) string in the 'file' box.<br>- Fixed: Open/Save File dialog boxes were not resizable.<br>- Fixed: The AutoPlay (on insert blank cd/dvd) 'Burn Image / Build + Burn Image' entries were passing the drive letter with the '/SOURCE' CLI parameter rather than the '/DEST' one.<br>- Fixed: Some memory leaks when closing the program down on Vista (with UAC enabled) due to it not being able to write certain registry entries.<br>- Fixed: Lots of error catching code so Borland's internal exceptions are deleted properly and not 'leaked' when the program closes.<br>- Fixed: Some issues to do with the 'DVDRAM / BD-RE FastWrite' option.<br>- Fixed: Old CD-R/RW drives that don't report the current media properly would cause ImgBurn to prompt the user to select which type of media they wanted to erase - when CD-RW was the only one it could ever be.<br>- Fixed: Discovery mode's 'Sectors' box wouldn't accept a large enough number for use on large discs - i.e. HD DVD, Blu-ray.<br><br></div>
