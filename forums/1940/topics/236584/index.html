            <div class='col-md body'>Adroit Data Recovery Centre (Also known as Â“ADRCÂ”), together MC2 bring you the first and only Â“Data Recovery ClinicsÂ” in the city. Called Adroit Data Recovery Clinics @ MC2, they are designed to educate the public on data recovery and also help clients recover the most precious asset of our times Â– digital data.<br><br>With the launch of new Windows Vista, digital data will be more easily transferred between different media, thus there will be higher risk of digital data loss, be it on your laptop, your MP3, your camera, etc. But many Singaporeans are unaware that digital data of all forms (data on your laptops, PCs, mobile phones, cameras, camcorders, CDs, VCDs, DVDs and even MP3s) can be recovered when lost. ADRC aims to make these data recovery clinics a place where visitors can seek FREE advice and evaluation, when they get into "digital accidents" resulting in a data loss situation. Customers with any form of lost digital data can bring their damaged data to the clinic and request for a free evaluation on whether the data is recoverable.<br><br>One of the key partners for this clinic is MC2, a notebook retail chain with retail footprint in major shopping malls, such as Suntec City, Funan Centre and Sim Lim Square. The company has recently won the Â‘Singapore SME 500 - Promising SME AwardsÂ’ a few weeks ago, when its revenues grew from $3m to over $20m within a year. Â“As MC2 grows rapidly, we realize that customers have high expectations of not just our Â“hardwareÂ” (such as product range, pricing, etc.), they also want more Â“softwareÂ” (quality service, product knowledge, etc.) and data recovery is one of the biggest queries that have been often brought up. We are delighted to officially bring such a renowned data recovery service into our offering and we believe that our customers will definitely benefit from it. Also with the newly launched Windows Vista operating system, which promises convergence of digital data such as photos, music and video, end- usersÂ’ data has became increasingly important.Â” Leslie Lim, Director, MC2 Pte Ltd<br><br>As education is its main drive, Adroit Data Recovery Clinics will also be giving out freeware to educate the public about data recovery. Some of the free software that will be given out at the clinics is as follows:<br><br>a) ADRC Data Recovery Tools V1.0<br>Helps undelete files (even when it is already deleted from the recycle bin), back up disk images, restores backup image, copy files from hard disk with bad sectors, disk cloning, backup, edit and restore your boot parameters<br><br>b) ADRC Hard Disk Health Checker V1.0<br>Scans and tests the health of hard disks, especially for presence of bad sectors<br><br>c) ADRC Binary Disk Editor<br>Assists advanced users access the hard disk contents at low level binary format<br><br>Â”This initiative seeks to inculcate media literacy skills in Singaporeans. As Singapore moves towards the digital age, there will be higher risk of digital data loss, be it on your laptop, your MP3, your camera, etc. The experience of losing data, be it business or personal, could be extremely traumatic. Frequently, lost data could be prevented, minimized or even recovered completely in the worst case situation for discerning users. Adroit Data Recovery Centre (ADRC) aims to help people retrieve their precious lost data fully at the lowest price within the shortest time." Felix Chang, Managing Director, Adroit Data Recovery Centre Pte Ltd<br><br>Adroit Data Recovery Centre is able to offer data recovery services at such low cost with much shortened turnaround time as it owns the first Â“class 100Â” clean lab in Singapore, and have developed proprietary tools for recovery. The company is able to offer a 3-5 day turnaround time, vs competitors who commonly offer 14 to even 20 days. Having its own lab in Singapore also give customers peace of mind that their most confidential data will not be traveling to labs in other countries and thus suffer the fate of being lost or leaked out. Adroit Data Recovery Centre is also the first data recovery centre in Singapore to provide the status of customersÂ’ data recovery online, 24 hours a day.<br><br>Data recovery is a highly skilled discipline that takes years of practice to establish credentials, made possible by constant research and development, and proficiency with working on storage technology as it is developed. With Adroit Data Recovery CentreÂ’s experienced team and strong hardware, they have full knowledge of recovering data from damaged hard drive. Its prestigious list of testimonials include key executives from MNCs such as ExxonMobil and Frost &amp; Sullivan, and it has successfully served them due to their emphasis on innovation, experience and perseverance to constantly upgrade their knowledge of data recovery and keep up with the fast changing technology and to provide our customers the best services.<br><br>When it comes to data recovery, there is only one chance to achieve a successful recovery, which might be lost forever if the data recovery service is not performed by experienced recovery specialists with unique hardware replacement techniques in a world class clean lab.<br><br>Adroit Data Recovery Clinics can be found at all MC2 outlets at Suntec City, Funan DigitaLife Mall and Sim Lim Square. From now till end April, MC2 will also be offering free one year data recovery plan with selected laptops purchased at MC2.<br></div>
