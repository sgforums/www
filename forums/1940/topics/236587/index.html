            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore, 6th February 2007 -- Sony Ericsson announces two new Walkman phones, the W880i and W610i. Built on the success of hit models such as the W810i, these 2 phones are set to broaden the appeal of the Walkman phone range, which has hit sales of 20 million phones to date. Complementing these 2 phones are a suite of music accessories designed to enhance the Walkman phone music listening experience.<br><br>At just 9.4mm thin, the W880i is the slimmest Sony Ericsson phone yet and combines the full Walkman phone experience with a device that fits easily into your pocket. The 1GB Memory Stick Micro (M2) that is provided allows you to store up to 900 full length tracks*, whilst the host of innovative music applications (such as Walkman Player 2.0 and Disc2Phone) makes it easy to transfer and search for music on your phone. All of this, plus a 2.0 megapixel camera, is packed into a UMTS phone thatÂ’s as slim as a standard CD case.<br><br>The W610i Walkman phone is all about detail, whether it is detail in design that builds on the look of earlier Walkman phones or the detailed combination of mobile music with a credible digital camera. The W610i stores up to 470 full-length music tracks* on the 512MB Memory Stick Micro (M2) provided, and offers the inventive TrackID powered by Gracenote Mobile MusicID . This feature lets the user record a clip of an unknown music track onto their phone, and immediately receives a notification of the track name, artist and album from the Gracenote worldwide music database. Add to this a 2.0 megapixel camera with auto focus, and the W610i is a credible fusion of phone, music player and digital camera.<br><br>Â“Our Walkman phones have proven to be phenomenally attractive to our consumers Â– we have sold 20 million Walkman phones since launch Â– and we are continuously developing the portfolio to extend their appeal,Â” says Peter Ang, Director, Product Marketing, Sony Ericsson Asia Pacific. Â“The W880i and W610i prove how the Walkman phone can appeal to different lifestyles Â– the W880i is a hi-specification device that looks every bit as good as it sounds. And the W610i Walkman phone combines the best in both music player and digital camera, whilst first and foremost remaining a phone thatÂ’s intuitive and pleasurable to use.Â”<br><br>The W880i represents a milestone in the Walkman phone portfolio. Although without doubt one of the slimmest music phones available with a 1GB capacity, the true beauty of its design is seen in the brushed stainless steel finish and the stand-out colour variants; either Steel Silver or Flame Black.<br><br>Of course, the W880i is more than just good looks. The Disc2Phone music management software allows the user to transfer tracks easily and with no fuss from PC straight onto the phone. With Bluetooth Audio Streaming, all of that music can be enjoyed wirelessly on a Stereo Bluetooth Headset such as the HBH-DS970, or by streaming music directly to a home or car stereo (via the new Music Bluetooth Receiver MBR-100). Paramount to a music phone, all of this functionality has been introduced without having to compromise on battery life. The W880i delivers up to 18 hours of music listening time and features a Flight Mode which allows the phone to be switched-off in mobile-prohibited environments.<br><br>The W880i Walkman phone is a UMTS 2100 GPRS 900/1800/1900 music phone and will be available in selected markets from Q1 2007.<br><br>The W610i Walkman phone is a fully specified music phone that does not compromise on its digital camera offering. As well as the 2.0 megapixel camera with auto focus, video recording and playback, the W610i provides a horizontal camera menu Â– so that the user holds it as they would a regular camera when taking a picture Â– and a Picture blogging facility for uploading photos directly to a userÂ’s online blog site. Where the music credentials are concerned, the W610i includes an RDS FM Radio to enliven the daily commute or workout at the gym. In fact, the only thing you will need to do with the W610i Walkman phone is choosing between the two colour options; will it be Plush Orange or Satin Black?<br><br>The W610i Walkman phone is an EDGE 850/900/1800/1900 music camera phone and will be available in selected markets from Q2 2007.<br><br>The Perfect Musical Accompaniments<br><br>Sony Ericsson also announces 2 new music accessories that make your Walkman phone a complete music listening centre. Users can listen to music on their phone in hi-fi sound quality with the Bluetooth Music Receiver MBR-100. This discreet accessory streams music via Bluetooth from the userÂ’s phone straight to a home or car stereo, using the phone as a remote control to alter the volume or skip through tracks. The standard 3.5mm input or RCA cable provided fits most home or car hi-fi systems. The MBR-100 was announced in January 2007 and will be available from Q1 2007.<br><br>Of course, if a user wishes to share their tunes, no matter where they are, they can do this with the Portable Speakers MPS-70. Light on power as well as weight, these compact speakers plug into the phone, contain an FM antenna for improved radio reception and will also run on the phoneÂ’s battery. Tuned for Sony Ericsson phones, the MPS-70 delivers great sound and, with a design thatÂ’s a true match for Walkman phones, no one will want to leave home without them. Available from Q2 2007.<br><br><img src="http://hardwarezone.com.sg/img/data/nnews/2007/6559/Image/W880.jpg"><br><br>W880i walkman phone</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore, 6th February 2007 -- After shipping 4.5 million of its Cyber-shot camera phones since the launch of the K790i/K800i, Sony Ericsson today introduces two new phones to the Cyber-shot phone family. Delivering Cyber-shot phones to a broader audience, these phones help make sure you never miss a shot.<br><br>The K810i Cyber-shot phone is a sleek, high performance device boasting a 3.2 megapixel camera, including auto focus and Xenon flash. Innovative new applications such as PhotoFix help to further improve the quality of your pictures, even after you have taken them. Illuminated Camera Icons to the side of the main keypad, which light up when in camera mode, allow the user to access camera menu options at the touch of a button.<br><br>As a complement to this, the K550i Cyber-shot phone delivers the benefits of the Cyber-shot phone in a compact (14mm thin) form factor that places ease-of-use at its heart. Equipped with a 2.0 megapixel camera with auto focus plus advanced LED photo light and active lens cover, the K550i helps ensure that youÂ’re always ready to shoot and share the best possible images. Add to this Bluetooth technology and Picture Blogging and you have a camera phone that takes the complexity out of sharing quality images with friends and family.<br><br>As a distinct variant of the K550i, the K550im is the first Cyber-shot phone to support i-mode, the operator service that gives direct access to a huge range of multimedia content and email.<br><br>Â“Worldwide, consumers are realising that the best digital camera is the one you have with you,Â” says Peter Ang, Director, Product Marketing, Sony Ericsson Asia Pacific. Â“The K800i established this and positioned the Cyber-shot phone as a credible fusion of phone and camera. Now the K810i and K550i are moving the market forward. They introduce new applications that equate to real improvements in the customer experience, as well as presenting these phones to a whole new audience.Â”<br><br>The K810i will appeal to those regularly using their mobile phone to capture quality shots while on the move. Its slender good looks belies its high specification; itÂ’s not only a UMTS device for high-speed picture blogging, but also one of the most advanced camera phones available. When in camera mode, the Xenon flash with red eye reduction will help to achieve great picture results in low light conditions. Equally, the new Illuminated Camera Icons will allow the user to select advanced camera settings (such as picture size and self timer) by simply clicking on one of the hard keys; so there is no need to navigate into the full camera menu and risk missing that special shot.<br><br>If a photo needs some improvement after it has been taken due to poor light conditions and lack of contrast, then the new PhotoFix solution can optimise brightness and picture contrast at the touch of a button. Meanwhile, if a user is shooting a moving object (perhaps at a sporting event), then the BestPic feature will let them take nine photos in quick succession and they simply choose the best one.<br><br>Sharing your pictures is easily done with the K810i Cyber-shot phone thanks to a host of connectivity options. Picture blogging allows you to upload your shots to your own blog site, whilst Bluetooth technology and USB 2.0 make it easy to share photos with friends or connect to your PC.<br><br>The K810i Cyber-shot phone is a UMTS 2100 (GSM 900/1800/1900) device available within Q2 2007. Both will be available in two stylish colours: Noble Blue and Golden Ivory.<br><br>Even if you are new to camera phone photography or the Cyber-shot phone menu, the new K550i is designed to be used intuitively. Simply by sliding open the lens cover, the camera is activated and the Cyber-shot menu appears in the phoneÂ’s screen, which at 1.9Â” serves as a clear viewfinder.<br><br>Once an image has been captured, sharing it can be done in a number of ways with the K550i, each one a simple process: Picture Blogging again makes it easy to send images to a blog site; support for Memory Stick Micro (M2) allows the user to transfer images easily between compatible devices and Bluetooth 2.0 provides for easy sharing with other phones and Bluetooth-equipped devices. If a user wishes to print out their latest holiday pictures, PictBridge makes it possible to print directly via USB (provided in-box) from the K550i to a compatible printer, further simplifying the process.<br><br>As the first Cyber-shot phone to support i-mode, the K550im (distinct from the standard K550i) gives the user access to a world of Internet content and email at the touch of a button. Following on from the popular K610im, the K550im delivers a rich experience for handling imail, browsing the Internet and viewing content; all with the superior imaging capabilities synonymous with Cyber-shot phones.<br><br>Available in Jet Black or Pearl White, the K550i Cyber-shot phone is guaranteed to stand out from the crowd. A Quad-Band EDGE device launching in selected markets from Q1 2007.<br><br>Add more to your memories<br><br>Announcing at the same time as these latest Cyber-shot phones are two new optional accessories, designed to let the user manage their calls and their photos with ease. The Desk Stand CDS-65 allows the user to speedily transfer photographs between phone and PC via USB, or simply to synchronise data between the two while charging the phone. Attach a portable handsfree and the user can enjoy voice conversations while transferring images and music. They are ideal for a home or office environment and will be available from Q2 2007.<br><br>For those who are regularly using their Cyber-shot phone (or other compatible Bluetooth phone) on the move, the Bluetooth Car Speakerphone HCB-120 attaches effortlessly to a carÂ’s sun visor and provides for safer handsfree calling. With a digital display to show who is calling, and leading talk/stand-by times (up to 24 and 450 hours respectively), this speakerphone is a perfect complement to the Bluetooth functionality in K550i and K810i, and is compact enough for regular use in the car, office or home. A built-in tilt sensor ensures that the display reads the right way up.<br><br>The HCB-120 will be available from Q2 2007.<br><br><img src="http://hardwarezone.com.sg/img/data/nnews/2007/6559/Image/K810i.jpg"><br><br><strong>K810i Cyber-Shot Phone</strong></div>

Of the four, the K200i and K220i are both camera phones, whilst the K220i again and the J120i bring music into an affordable segment with integrated FM Radios, complete with headsets. All four, including the J110i, display Sony EricssonÂ’s signature stylish and premium feel, yet manage to keep simplicity and ease-of-use at the heart of their design.<br><br>K200i<br><br>The K200i is all about having a camera on your phone just when you need it.<br>The VGA camera and photo album are immediately accessible with just one click on the dedicated button. Given that the K200i has a slideshow view and can store up to 40 images, it is easy for users to view their pictures in full screen mode and share them with friends.<br><br>Navigating the phone couldnÂ’t be easier either, as the menu can be set to a series of simple, single icons. To keep things hassle-free, the central navigation key is set up to give one-click access to key features such as the phone book (which stores up to 300 contacts) and messaging menu. Available from Q2 2007 in selected markets in either Metallic Black or Light Champagne, the K200i allows you to always have your favourite pictures in your pocket.<br><br>K220i<br><br>As with the K200i, the K220i is an easy-to-use camera phone with a single icon display, but with the advantage of an integrated FM radio with RDS. Perfect for those quieter moments, the K220i can store up to 10 pre-set stations so there is no need to hunt around when it is time to change channels. It will even provide a wake-up call since a favourite station can be set on the Radio Alarm Clock.<br><br>Choose your station and choose your colour; the K220i comes in two striking finishes - Frost White or Ocean Blue, and will be available in selected markets from Q2 2007.<br><br>J110i<br><br>Keeping in touch is made even simpler with the J110i, a classic Â‘candy barÂ’ phone with large, legible keys and easy navigation.
