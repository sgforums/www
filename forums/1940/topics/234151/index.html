This also marked a record shipment volume for a single quarter.<br><br>"Emerging markets contributed to the high volume sales," said Ramon Llamas, a research analyst in IDC's Mobile Technology and Tracking team.<br><br>"It was not long ago that shipments into mature markets, including Japan, North America and Western Europe, consumed the majority of devices shipped worldwide.<br><br>"More recently, however, device shipments into emerging economies in Asia/Pacific, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America have surpassed shipments to mature markets, and the difference between the two continues to grow."<br><br>IDC expects this trend to continue as mature markets reach saturation, and as emerging markets with much lower "teledensity" provide opportunities for handset vendors to attract first-time users.<br><br>"In addition, the time to set up a mobile network is much shorter and less expensive than the time to set up a landline network, propelling cellphone shipments further," said Llamas.<br><br>"Finally, mobile phones are seen as both a practical necessity and a status symbol in many emerging markets.<br><br>"Together, these economic, technological and social conditions will continue to drive strong demand for mobile handsets in emerging markets for some time to come."<br><br>The research also noted that location-based services have "come to life" across many regions, with Nokia's acquisition of Gate5, a supplier of mapping and navigation services, reinforcing this trend.<br><br>Meanwhile, the so-called 'prosumer' space also received a boost with the launch of the BlackBerry Pearl from Research In Motion.<br><br>"We believe that the Pearl was a trend-setting device because it was the first professional consumer release from a company that has always been associated with strictly business-focused users," said Ryan Reith, a research analyst in IDC's Worldwide Mobile Phone Tracking Group.<br><br>"It is no secret that the vast majority of people in society use email, regardless of their profession, and a device like this has made mobile email more of a reality.<br><br>"Elsewhere, mobile TV, which has been talked about for many years, is finally coming to the forefront in select markets."<br><br>Reith predicted that mobile advertising will play a key role in the adoption of mobile TV by consumers.<br><br>From a vendor perspective, Nokia ended 2006 in the same way that it began the year as the undisputed worldwide leader in mobile phone shipments.<br><br>Having reached a new shipment record of more than a million units on average each day during the quarter, the Finnish giant experienced downward pressure on its profits from the same quarter a year ago.<br><br>Despite reaching a record level of shipments during the fourth quarter, Motorola missed its fourth-quarter profit target<br><br>The company acknowledged "challenges" within its product portfolio mix and its late introduction of 3G devices.<br><br>Samsung edged above the 30 million unit mark twice in 2006, exceeding its sales target for the year. Sony Ericsson took the fourth spot, beating LG Electronics into fifth.<br><br></div>
