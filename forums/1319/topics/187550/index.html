            <div class='col-md body'>Pacific Internet, Intel Collaborate on Mobile WiMax in Singapore<br><br>email | link | print<br>Wirelessiq.com<br>April 24, 2006<br><br>Pacific Internet Limited or PacNet, the largest telco-independent Internet communications service provider by geographic reach in the Asia-Pacific, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Intel Technology Asia Pte Ltd to work towards Singapore's first mobile WiMax infrastructure.<br><br>Based on the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers' (IEEE's) 802.16e standard for mobility, the companies believe mobile WiMax (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) is poised to be the next market disrupter, offering fixed, nomadic and mobile access to data, voice and video applications at broadband speeds. With nomadic access, users are not restricted to a single Internet access point but are able to tap multiple access points within the same network. With mobile access, users can stay connected even when on the move.<br><br>Through the collaboration, PacNet and Intel look to advancing wireless adoption in Singapore and the region, bringing wide-ranging benefits to businesses, residents, content and application providers as well as government agencies.<br><br>The interoperability of mobile WiMax will allow access via various devices and global networks that are running on the WiMax standard, enabling users to tap into a wide range of solutions and services.<br><br>Individuals will be able to enjoy the freedom of network accessibility across the island for communication, entertainment and commerce. Business applications supporting a mobile sales force, field maintenance, asset management, security and marketing among others can benefit from the mobile broadband capabilities of WiMax.<br><br>The network is also key in public safety and emergency situations where critical responses are required. For example, a police officer can access a database within a moving vehicle, and hospital staff can view real-time images of a patient in an ambulance before it reaches the hospital, to make the necessary preparations in advance.<br><br>''Mobile WiMax is an exciting development for Singapore. It is personal broadband on the move, providing access to a wide range of applications and information. It will empower a mobile workforce, bringing about stronger communication and higher business efficiency. The network will also open up exciting opportunities for content and application providers," said Kevin Lim, Managing Director of PacNet Singapore.<br><br>Under the MOU, the two companies will conduct studies, including market trials, to better understand market needs and behavior. PacNet will leverage on Intel's know-how and worldwide experience in WiMax and wireless access technology, including its strategic partnerships along the value chain, to build new business models in offering differentiated wireless services that will benefit operators worldwide. The two companies will also look to sharing some of the insights gained through the release of educational white papers.<br><br>''Our collaboration with PacNet once again shows that WiMax is real,'' said Patrick Liew, Singapore country manager, Intel Technology Asia. ''Intel continues to work with the ecosystem to supply cost-efficient WiMax-based solutions around the world. The future deployment of mobile WiMax will complement with the other wireless technologies to achieve ubiquitous broadband wireless access. It is going to change how governments and enterprises are run, how students learn and how people communicate.''<br><br>''This MOU represents a shift in the way PacNet will bring increased value to our customers,'' said Teck Moh Phey, President and Chief Executive Officer of PacNet. ''Through strategic partnerships with leading technology companies such as Intel, PacNet will offer differentiated services by combining our strong regional knowledge and presence with next-generation products and solutions from these vendors. Such services will be offered to all applicable countries in the PacNet network.''<br><br>PacNet's joint trial with Intel is expected to start in the middle of 2006 for select customers. PacNet will test the performance of both nomadic and mobile access, such as ensuring a smooth handover so that the connection and quality of service are maintained as users move from one place to another within the mobile WiMax network.<a href="http://www.wirelessiq.com/content/topstories/1307.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wirelessiq.com/content/topstories/1307.html</a></div>
