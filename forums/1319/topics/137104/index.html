Unregistered blogs will be shut down.<br><br>"Following Yahoo, here is a second American internet giant giving way to the Chinese authorities and agreeing to self-censorship", said the group in a statement.<br><br>"The lack of ethics on the part of these companies is extremely worrying. Their management frequently justifies collaboration with Chinese censorship by saying that all they are doing is obeying local legislation."<br><br>"We believe that this argument does not hold water and that these multinationals must respect certain basic ethical principles, in whatever country they are operating."<br><br><strong>'Pragmatic' approach</strong><br><br>Microsoft is not alone in co-operating with the Chinese authorities to police what people can do online.<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/40622000/jpg/_40622832_china_netcafe203ap.jpg"><br>Internet cafe in China<br>Internet cafes have to police what the Chinese do online<br>Both Yahoo and Google have been criticised for similar activities and restricting what people can search for and read online.<br><br>"If you want to deal with the Chinese, you have to deal with their rules," said William Makower, CEO of Panlogic a marketing consultancy with operations in China.<br><br>"It is all very well to have high-minded ideals about how you want the Chinese to behave, but opposing China is going to be counter-productive."<br><br>"Microsoft is being pragmatic in its approach," said Mr Makower.
