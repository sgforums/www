            <div class='col-md body'>Countdown to Mystery Moon Begins<br><br>By Amit Asaravala<br>Wired.Com<br>02:00 AM Dec. 24, 2004 PT<br><br>After hitching a ride on the back of NASA's Cassini orbiter for seven years through more than 2 billion miles of space, the European Space Agency's Huygens space probe is finally stepping out on its own.<br><br>Mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena plan to cut the 700-pound probe loose from Cassini Friday evening, initiating a 21-day free-fall that will end with Huygens crashing into the surface of Saturn's mysterious moon Titan. The journey is expected to answer a question that astronomers and scientists have been asking ever since the Voyager spacecraft spotted the moon's thick atmosphere in 1980: Just what exactly is hidden underneath all that haze and smog?<br><br>Though mission scientists don't think Huygens will stumble upon anything like the green forests and blue oceans here on Earth -- nor any forms of life, for that matter -- they do think it will encounter conditions very similar to those that existed soon after the Earth formed.<br><br>"(Titan) is the only moon in the solar system with a thick, nitrogen-rich atmosphere" -- relatively similar to that on Earth -- said Huygens project scientist Jean-Pierre Lebreton. "In this atmosphere, we may have chemical reactions similar to ones occurring before life appeared on Earth. Going in situ will allow us to better understand what causes those chemical reactions to take place."<br><br>Scientists are especially interested in figuring out where the small percentage of methane in Titan's atmosphere is coming from. Normally, light from the sun would break it down into other chemicals that would then fall on the moon's surface like rain. But the fact that some methane still exists in the atmosphere suggests that the surface might harbor pools of liquid methane which regularly evaporate back into the atmosphere.<br><br>The Cassini spacecraft, launched on Oct. 15, 1997, has tried to peer through Titan's haze to find these oceans several times. But despite using radar and cameras that can see "around" the haze by analyzing different wavelengths of light, the orbiter has revealed little more about the moon's surface than the fact that it contains rough and smooth areas.<br><br>However, these observations were all made from a distance of at least 590 miles from the moon. Huygens, on the other hand, will enter Titan's atmosphere and drift down to its surface, taking readings and sending them back to Cassini as it goes. The plunge into Titan's atmosphere is expected to last about two and a half hours and will take place on Jan. 14.<br><br>As it drifts to the surface, held aloft by three successive parachutes, Huygens will use six instruments to gather as much data as possible about the composition, density and volatility of Titan's atmosphere. The probe will also take photographs in multiple directions -- and listen for sounds.<br><br>"We are going to hear what Titan sounds like," said Lebretton. "There is a simple microphone on board, but it should be able to collect sound -- for example, if there is lightning, we will hear it. We may also detect sounds due to winds."<br><br>If the mission scientists are lucky, they may even receive data directly from the surface of Titan for as long as 30 minutes after Huygens touches down, provided the instruments survive the impact. Likewise, they may continue to get readings if the probe lands in a lake or ocean, though the existence of such is now in doubt.<br><br>"If we believe the observations made by Cassini on Oct. 26 and Dec. 12, we are not seeing oceans," said Lebretton. "It's still a possibility, but we're not sure. We'll see what we find when we get to the surface."<br><br>Cassini is scheduled to eject the Huygens probe at approximately 7:08 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on Dec. 24. The maneuver must go exactly as planned, or else Huygens could slip away from the plotted trajectory, possibly jeopardizing the mission. The probe has no thrusters onboard to correct itself if it goes off course.<br><br>Lebretton said the project team is not all that worried, especially given the impressive track record of the Cassini mission so far.<br><br>"There is a certain tension, but things are going so well," he said. "We are fairly confident this will happen."<br><br></div>
