            <div class='col-md body'>No disrespect to all the log personnel and the rest of the support arms like signals. I am from the Combat Engineers and we also wear the blue berets. But I think it is high time we Engineers are given a different colour or something to distinguish us from the rest of the support arms. The work we used to do ie. carrying hundreds of kgs of metal bridge and connecting them by hand is no mean task. We also do alot of explosive ordinance. Although alot of manual bridging is being phased out, I hope SAF does something to recognise us Engineers who completed NS with injured backs, a minority even with broken fingers or even worse, missing fingers.<br><br>Infantry, Guards, and Commandos are distinguished by their berets, and I think Engineers more than deserve their own colours or something of difference.<br><br>A good thing I heard is that all Engineers will be crossed trained to be experts in explosives handling thereby giving us each an EOD batch to distinguish us as Engineers.<br><br>Oh yah, by the way, I have ORD.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Considering all the crap the engineers have to put up with and go thru, they do require some recognition, i guess. I think the thing is that SAF threw all the support arms into one category, and just gave everyone in the group a blue beret cos they ran out of colours...<br><br>As for me, no i was not from engineers, but i was under of Supply and Transport, which automatically meant a blue beret. Had quite a few chances to work with pple from engineers tho... Always found them very nice and jovial despite all the nonsense they have to put up with....</div>

Ok, I'm from Tengah airbase. I orded in Dec 98. We air techs keep the aircraft air worthy and of course have to bear with the nonsense some pilots give.
