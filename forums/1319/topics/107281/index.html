            <div class='col-md body'>SPACE WIRE<br>EU transport ministers okay Galileo satellite tracking system<br><br>BRUSSELS (AFP) Dec 10, 2004<br><br>EU transport ministers gave final approval Friday to build and deploy the Galileo satellite navigation system with the aim of starting operations in 2008, the European Commission announced.<br><br>The satellite network will complement the US Global Position System, which was originally developed for military targeting and position finding. The European system was the first to be designed for purely civilian use.<br><br>The United States and the EU signed an agreement in Ireland June 26 to adopt common operating standards for the two systems.<br><br>Friday's decision was to build and launch satellites and build ground receiving stations following a three-year design and development phase, costing 1.1 billion euros (1.45 billion dollars).<br><br>Deploying the Galileo system will cost a further 2.1 billion eurosbillion dollars), with industry putting up two thirds of the investment and the commission one third.<br><br>The commission says the globe-girdling satellites will enable the development of new services in areas such as transport, the environment, agriculture and fisheries that are eventually expected to cover the running costs of the system, estimated at 220 million euros (290 million dollars).<br><br>Two consortia are fighting to obtain the contract to operate the system, and ministers were expected to decide on the winner by February next year. The Eurely alliance includes Alcatel, Finmeccanica and Vinci, while the iNavsat consortium comprises Thales, EADS and Inmarsat.<br><br>Jacques Barrot, a European Commission vice president, said Galileo was "without a doubt the most wonderful European technological project. We are now on the home straight."<br><br>He predicted it would be as great a technological revolution as mobile telephony.<br><br>"This venture shows how capable Europe is of making a united effort in pursuit of a common goal," he said.<br><br>European law already requires or envisages the use of satellite navigation to monitor shipping, operate electronic road toll systems and protect animals during transportation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What is Galileo?<br><br><img src="http://www.esa.int/export/images/galileo02777A4,1.jpg"><br><br>Galileo will be EuropeÂ’s own global navigation satellite system, providing a highly accurate, guaranteed global positioning service under civilian control. It will be inter-operable with GPS and GLONASS, the two other global satellite navigation systems.<br><br>A user will be able to take a position with the same receiver from any of the satellites in any combination. By offering dual frequencies as standard, however, Galileo will deliver real-time positioning accuracy down to the metre range, which is unprecedented for a publicly available system.<br><br>It will guarantee availability of the service under all but the most extreme circumstances and will inform users within seconds of a failure of any satellite. This will make it suitable for applications where safety is crucial, such as running trains, guiding cars and landing aircraft.<br><br>The first experimental satellite, part of the so-called Galileo System Test Bed (GSTB) will be launched in the second semester of 2005. The objective of this experimental satellite is to characterize the critical technologies, which are already under development under ESA contracts. Thereafter up to four operational satellites will be launched in the timeframe 2005-2006 to validate the basic Galileo space and related ground segment. Once this In-Orbit Validation (IOV) phase has been completed, the remaining satellites will be installed to reach the Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 2008.<br><br>The fully deployed Galileo system consists of 30 satellites (27 operational + 3 active spares), positioned in three circular Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) planes in 23616 km altitude above the Earth, and at an inclination of the orbital planes of 56 degrees with reference to the equatorial plane. Once this is achieved, the Galileo navigation signals will provide a good coverage even at latitudes up to 75 degrees north, which corresponds to the North Cape, and beyond. The large number of satellites together with the optimisation of the constellation, and the availability of the three active spare satellites, will ensure that the loss of one satellite has no discernible effect on the user.<br><br>Two Galileo Control Centres (GCC) will be implemented on European ground to provide for the control of the satellites and to perform the navigation mission management. The data provided by a global network of twenty Galileo Sensor Stations (GSS) will be sent to the Galileo Control Centres through a redundant communications network. The GCCÂ’s will use the data of the Sensor Stations to compute the integrity information and to synchronize the time signal of all satellites and of the ground station clocks. The exchange of the data between the Control Centres and the satellites will be performed through so-called up-link stations. Five S-band up-link stations and 10 C-band up-link stations will be installed around the globe for this purpose.<br><br>As a further feature, Galileo will provide a global Search and Rescue (SAR) function, based on the operational Cospas-Sarsat system. To do so, each satellite will be equipped with a transponder, which is able to transfer the distress signals from the user transmitters to the Rescue Co-ordination Centre, which will then initiate the rescue operation. At the same time, the system will provide a signal to the user, informing him that his situation has been detected and that help is under way. This latter feature is new and is considered a major upgrade compared to the existing system, which does not provide a feedback to the user.</div>
