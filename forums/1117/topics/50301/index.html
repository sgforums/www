So, I didn't actually know why, I juz thought I did.<br><br>I'm talking lesser these days. I find words really cheap, they can't convey my message much either.<br><br>Humans are stubborn.<br>They wont u/stand pain until they knock themselves against the wall.</div></blockquote>I've found that I'm talking less now too....<br><br>I used to be able to give my friends a lot of advice whenever they confided in me their problems, I always seemed to have something to say...<br><br>nowadays, I find that a lot of times when people tell me their problems, I have nothing much to say....<br><br>I guess it's due partly to the fact that whatever I feel like saying is what I think they already know and they obviously don't need me to have to tell them those things, b'cos that would just sound lame....<br><br>I've found that when friends tell me about their problems, what I do is not to advise, but to give them the view from a different perspective and let them analyse for themselves with a slightly clearer picture, and not just the one-sided view they may have of the situation. I may end up confusing the person, but I think it's still better to give him/her views from different perspectives and just leave the rest to them.....<br><br>Telling them what to dois of no use b'cos they just won't listen... People don't take advice at face-value nowadays, I know I wouldn't.... I would prefer to figure it out for myself.....</div>
