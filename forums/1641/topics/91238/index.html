            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;"><strong><img src="http://www.belladora.com/images/tears.jpg"><br><br>By the time the Lord made woman,   he was into his<br>sixth day of working<br>overtime.<br>An angel appeared and said, "Why are you spending so<br>much time on this<br>one?"<br><br>And the Lord answered, "Have you seen my spec sheet on<br>her? She has  to<br>be<br>completely washable, but  not plastic, have over 200<br>movable parts,<br>all<br>replaceable and able to run on  diet coke   and<br>leftovers, have a lap<br>that<br>can hold four children   at one  time, have a kiss<br>that can cure<br>anything<br><br>from a scraped knee to a broken  heart  -and she will<br>do everything<br>with<br>only two hands."<br><br>The angel was astounded at the requirements. "Only two<br>hands!? No way!<br>And<br><br>that's just on the  standard model? That's too much<br>work for one day.<br>Wait<br><br>until tomorrow to  finish."<br><br>But I won't," the Lord protested. "I am so close to<br>finishing this<br>creation<br><br>that is so close to my own heart.   She already heals<br>herself when she<br>is<br>sick AND can work 18 hour days."<br><br>The angel moved closer and touched the woman.  "But<br>you have made her<br>so<br>soft,  Lord."<br><br>"She is soft," the Lord agreed, "but I have also made<br>her tough. You<br>have<br>no<br><br>idea what she can  endure or accomplish."<br><br>"Will she be able to think?", asked the angel.<br><br>The Lord replied, "Not only will she be able to think,<br>she will be able<br>to<br>reason and negotiate."<br><br>The angel then noticed something, and reaching out,<br>touched the woman's<br>cheek.   "Oops, it looks like  you have a leak in this<br>model.   I told<br>you<br>that you were trying to put too much into this one."<br><br>"That's not a leak," the Lord corrected, "that's a<br>tear!"<br><br>"What's the tear for?" the angel asked.<br><br>The Lord said, "The tear is her way of expressing her<br>joy, her sorrow,<br>her<br>pain, her disappointment, her love, her loneliness,<br>her grief and her<br>pride."<br><br>The angel was impressed. "You  are a genius, Lord.<br>You thought of<br>everything!  Woman is truly amazing."<br><br>And she is!  Women have  strengths that amaze men.<br>They bear<br>hardships<br>and<br><br>they  carry burdens, but they hold happiness,   love<br>and  joy.  They<br>smile<br><br>when they want to scream.  They sing when they want<br>to  cry.They cry<br>when<br><br>they are happy  and laugh when they are nervous.  They<br>fight for what<br>they<br>believe in. They stand up to injustice.They don't take<br>"no" for an<br>answer<br>when they believe there is a better solution.  They go<br>without so their<br>family   can have. They go to the doctor   with a<br>frightened<br>friend.They<br>love unconditionally. They cry when their children<br>excel and cheer<br>when<br>their friends get awards.They are happy when they hear<br>about a birth<br>or<br>a<br><br>wedding.  Their hearts break when a  friend dies.They<br>grieve at the<br>loss of<br><br>a  family member,   yet they are strong when they<br>think there is no<br>strength left.They know that a hug   and a  kiss can<br>heal a broken<br>heart.<br><br>Women come in all shapes, sizes and colors.They'll<br>drive, fly, walk,<br>run or<br><br>e-mail you to show how much they care about you.   The<br>heart of a woman<br>is<br>what makes the world   keep turning. They bring joy,<br>hope and love.<br>They<br>have compassion and ideals.  They give moral support<br>to their family<br>and<br>friends. Women have vital things to say and everything<br>to give.<br><br>HOWEVER, IF THERE IS ONE FLAW IN WOMEN, IT IS THAT<br>THEY FORGET THEIR<br>WORTH.</strong></span></div>
