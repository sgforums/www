              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1439618006341_867" class="first">WASHINGTON  — 
              The octopus already is an oddball of the ocean. Now biologists have 
              rediscovered a species of that eight-arm sea creature that's even 
              stranger and shares some of our social and mating habits.</p>
              <p>With 
              their shifting shapes, mesmerizing eyes, and uncanny intelligence, 
              octopuses "are one of the most mysterious and captivating species," said
               Rich Ross, a senior biologist at the California Academy of Sciences.  
              "They're aliens alive on our planet and it feels like they have plans."</p>
              <p>For
               Ross and colleagues, it got stranger when they got a batch of octopuses
               from Central America to study. The critters just didn't fit the loner 
              denizen-of-the-deep profile that scientists had drawn for the rest of 
              the 300 or so octopus species.</p>
              <p>While most octopuses live alone, 
              coming together for ever-so-brief and dangerous mating, couples of this 
              species can live together to mate for a few days in the same cramped den
               or shell.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1439618006341_874">While other male 
              octopuses mate from a distance to avoid being cannibalized, these 
              octopuses mate entangled beak-to-beak. That style could almost be 
              thought of as romantic, said Alvaro Roura, an octopus expert at La Trobe
               University in Australia, who wasn't part of the study.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1439618006341_889">While other females lay one batch 
              of eggs and then die, the female of this species lives longer and 
              produces eggs constantly, bettering the species chance of survival, Ross
               said.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1439618006341_890">But it's more than sex. 
              These octopuses clean out food waste from their dens. They twirl their 
              arms like an old-timey movie villain with a moustache. And they quickly 
              learn that people mean food: when someone enters the room, they leave 
              their dens and head to the top of the tank.</p>
              <p>"It's the most amazing octopus that I've ever gotten to work with," Ross said.</p>
              <p>The
               octopus, normally a dull chocolate brown, suddenly sports stripes and 
              spots when it gets excited or upset, said Roy Caldwell of the University
               of California, Berkeley. He is the lead author of a paper on the 
              octopus with Ross and others published Wednesday in the journal PLOS 
              One.</p>
              <p>The species is preliminarily called the Larger Pacific 
              Striped Octopus, although it's really not much bigger than a tennis ball
               — just bigger than a similar species.</p>
              <p>It was found almost 40 
              years ago off the coast of Panama.  Other scientists wouldn't believe it
               was a separate species or that it showed such distinctive behavior. So 
              its discoverer, Arcadio Rodaniche, gave up and the species was never 
              formally described or named.</p>
              <p>Then in 2011, Caldwell got an email 
              from a high school student about his pet octopus, Charlie. It was the 
              same species discovered in the 1970s. Caldwell traced it to a dealer who
               sent him two dozen of the species from Panama, Nicaragua and Mexico to 
              study in captivity. The researchers note that this octopus species could
               act differently in the wild.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1439618006341_891">They included Rodaniche as a co-author after the retired researcher declined to let them name the octopus species after him.</p>
              <p>In
               the journal Nature, a different team of scientists on Wednesday 
              published the first map decoding octopus genes. They found the octopus's
               genetic code is only slightly smaller than humans, but twice as big as a
               bird's genetic instruction guide.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1439618006341_892">Octopuses
               are invertebrates, meaning they have no backbones. Invertebrates 
              generally have a less evolved nervous systems, but not the octopus. They
               found that it had many of the same genes as other invertebrates, 
              although mixed up as through a blender, said study author Clifton 
              Ragsdale at the University of Chicago.</p>
              <p>"There's a lot of weird creatures and these are the largest of the weird creatures," he said.</p>
