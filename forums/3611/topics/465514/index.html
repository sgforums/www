              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, SimSun; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px;">Most people would be afraid when seeing a snake, but not the boy A Zhe in Dongguan who is only 13 years old. Ever since he was a few months old, he’s been sleeping in the same bed with a python. The relationship he has with the python not only leave people amazed, but also inspired: Any animal in nature can be friends with humans.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://img.chinasmack.com/www/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/13-year-old-boy-live-together-with-python-for-13-Years-02-600x400.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></p>
              <p>T<span style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, SimSun; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px;">he snake egg was bought by A Zhe’s father, so the python came to A Zhe’s home before it was born, and by the time A Zhe was born, the python was already 6 years old, weighing more than 20kg. When A Zhe was 9 months old, his parents were busy making a living, going out during the day to work, so A Zhe would play with the python. In the hot summer, the python became A Zhe’s natural air conditioner. In the winter, A Zhe would worry the python might be cold, so he would warm the body of his “old pal”.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, SimSun; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px;">A Zhe’s father says his son and the python are with each other all day and all night, and it has never harmed A Zhe. It becomes very active especially when it is with A Zhe. Having this lively, adorable “good friend”, A Zhe has had no interest in other toys ever since he was small, and to this day has very rarely asked his parents to buy him any toys, with this python being the one thing that plays with him the most.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://img.chinasmack.com/www/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/13-year-old-boy-live-together-with-python-for-13-Years-04.jpg" alt="" width="433" height="650"></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, SimSun; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px;">When the weather is good, A Zhe takes his “old pal” for walks and to enjoy the sun. In 2012, after A Zhe started attending middle school, he could only sleep at home on Saturdays, and thus could no longer be with his “old pal” day and night, making A Zhe sad for a long time. A Zhe’s father says that A Zhe’s biggest dream is to become a zoologist when he grows up, to deal with animals every day, to make more animal friends. In A Zhe’s world, all animals have the right to live on this planet together with humans, and all animals are friends of humans. 2013 is the year of the snake according to the chinese zodiac</span><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, SimSun; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px;">, hope people who enjoy eating snake meat will have mercy, will respect every life-form in nature, and not indiscriminately catch and eat wild animals.</span></p>
