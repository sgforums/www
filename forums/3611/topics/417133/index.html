              <p class="articleabstract">Latvia and its Baltic neighbour Estonia are exchanging friendly jabs over the claim that each was home to the first-ever town Christmas tree some five centuries ago.</p>
              <p class="articleabstract"><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/6C/EB74327082713E2436C99CF313F5DF.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="173"></p>
              <p>As the Latvian capital Riga marks what it says is the 500th anniversary of its tree, its Estonian counterpart Tallinn has hit back.</p>
              <p>"I received a present from the mayor of Tallinn, Edgar Savisaar, a short Christmas tree," Riga's mayor Nils Usakovs told AFP.</p>
              <p>"He congratulated us on the 500th anniversary of the Riga Christmas tree and reminded us that Tallinn is celebrating the 569th anniversary," Usakovs said.</p>
              <p>"It's good that the sole topic of disagreement between Riga and Tallinn is who has the oldest Christmas tree," he joked.</p>
              <p>In the ongoing jousting, Latvia's tourist office rented billboard space in Tallinn inviting locals to see the home of the tree -- at Riga's festival.</p>
              <p>According to researchers who back the Latvian side, the first tree wasn't actually the classic evergreen known today.</p>
              <p>In 1510 a group of merchants built a pyramid-shaped wooden structure dubbed a "tree", decorated with dried flowers, fruit and vegetables, and even straw toys.</p>
              <p>They are thought to have paraded it around their meeting hall before burning it to signify the end of the old year and the beginning of the new.</p>
              <p>Estonians, meanwhile, insist that the world's first Christmas tree was erected in front of Tallinn town hall in 1441 as part of a winter ritual where merchants and single women danced around the tree and later set it on fire.</p>
              <p>"The Latvians' claim that the first public Christmas tree was put up in Riga is not correct," art historian Juri Kuuskemaa wrote in Estonian largest daily Postimees this week.</p>
              <p>Both Riga and Tallinn at the time were home to guilds of unmarried merchants, known as the Blackheads, who were traders from German statelets.</p>
              <p>Mike Johnson, a Riga-based American who has researched the history of the Christmas tree, said the origin debate was in any case fairly academic.</p>
              <p>"It is after all a legend, much like Santa Claus, and what right does Finland have to call itself Santa Claus's home?" he told AFP.</p>
