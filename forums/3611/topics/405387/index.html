              <p class="articleabstract">A tiny island surrounded by miles of empty ocean might not seem like the ideal terrain for an escaped prisoner on the run. But 24-year-old Alvone Maybury has evaded police in Bermuda for more than 36 hours -- and has still found time to update his Facebook page.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybury, who is still on the loose, has made at least 10 posts since he escaped on Tuesday morning.</p>
              <p>As armed police searched the holiday haven for the missing fugitive, Maybury boasted on the social networking site that he was relaxing, playing on his PlayStation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In his first posting at around midnight on the day he escaped, he wrote: "Just let me be, f(expletive) jail n all the people who run it."</p>
              <p>Five hours later he was back on the website, commenting: "I'm just chillin playin p.s3. Lol."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybury, whose brazen daylight escape was captured on camera by a local television station, added another post today saying: "I'm a tv star now."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Scores of friends have commented on his site offering words of support, telling him to stay safe and advising him to stop posting updates.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Wherever ya hiding be safe please," wrote one.</p>
              <p>Others congratulate him on his escape and offer advice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"DONT TRUST NOBODY! STAY SHARP! HEAD UP EYES OPEN! NO SLEEP!" offers another.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybury, who is apparently posting his updates from a cellular phone, was being escorted from court following an appearance on weapons charges when he made his escape yesterday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He was still wearing his handcuffs when he gave his guards the slip and bolted up a busy street.</p>
              <p>A prison officer gave chase but was unable to catch Maybury, who is dark skinned with his hair in braids and has a distinctive dollar-sign tattoo under his right eye.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Police conducted a series of raids on homes in the island's capital, Hamilton, on Wednesday, but came up empty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bermuda is just 22 square miles (57 square kilometers) with a population of 65,000 people. The United States is the nearest major country. New York is roughly 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) or a two-and-a-half hour flight away.</p>
