              <p>A goldfish named George underwent a life-saving operation last week to remove a tumor on its head.</p>
              <p>"The
               surgery went swimmingly and George has now returned home with his 
              loving owner," said a statement on the Facebook page of Lort Smith 
              Animal Hospital, a non-profit organization in Melbourne, Australia, 
              where the procedure took place.</p>
              <p>Dr. Tristan Rich, who performed 
              the 45-minute-long operation, said that prior to the surgery, the 
              10-year-old George was unable to swim and eat properly, and was starting
               to "really suffer," reported the Sidney Morning Herald.
               When Rich told the fish's owner that the only two options were either 
              surgically removing the tumor or putting George to sleep, she decided to
               do everything she could to save the fish, as she was "quite attached" 
              to him.</p>
              <p>The surgery cost about $200 -- the same a dog or cat owner would pay, the paper reported.</p>
              <p>Operating
               on a fish is "a very fiddly procedure, and you have to be very careful 
              about blood loss," Rich said. So how did the vet do it?</p>
              <p>First, he prepared three buckets: "one with a knock-out dose of 
              anaesthetic, one with a maintenance level of anaesthetic, and one with 
              clean water as the recovery unit," according to Lort Smith's Facebook 
              page.</p>
              <p>When the fish was asleep, Rich ran a tube from the 
              maintenance bucket, which was being oxygenated, into the "patient's" 
              mouth so that the water with the anesthetic washed over the animal's 
              gills.</p>
              <p>The doctor then removed the large tumor while using a 
              gelatine sponge to control the bleeding during surgery. To make sure the
               sizeable wound was sealed, the vet put in four sutures, sealing the 
              remaining part of the wound with tissue glue.</p>
              <p>George was then 
              transferred to a recovery unit and given oxygen. He also received 
              injections  with long-acting pain relievers and antibiotics.</p>
              <p>"Soon afterwards he took a couple of breaths on his own and started swimming around," the hospital reported.</p>
