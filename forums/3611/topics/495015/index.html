              <p>Lori Jones, who works at the gas station at Horsetooth Inn and RV Park 
                  in Stout, said she was on duty about three weeks ago when a doe 
                  fearlessly wandered into the store. Jones captured deers on  the sunglasses and junk food sections.</p>
              <p><img src="https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/1381513191583/2017/i/15131918241855/v1.5/Mama-deer-wanders-into-gas-station-comes-back-with-the-family.jpg?lg=5" alt="" width="860" height="576"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“I lured her outside with a peanut bar,” Jones said. Jones said it 
                  wouldn’t be the last time she saw the doe. Mama deer returned later in 
                  the day with her children in tow. OMG! What a blessing! I love deer and 
                  this story and photos were just too adorable!</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Jones said, “Later, I was in the office checking the store stock,” Jones
                   said. “I walked out and there she was with her twins and a lone buck 
                  that she nursed. I just used my phone to snap the pics. I laughed so 
                  hard!”</p>

              <p>Six species of deer exist in the wild in the UK: red and roe 
              deer are the only native species; though fallow deer are now normally 
              considered part of our natural heritage, having been introduced in the 
              11th Century and possibly before. Sika, muntjac, and Chinese water deer 
              were all introduced within the past 150 years. These six species differ 
              in their geographic distribution, abundance, population growth rate, 
              behaviour, and impacts.</p>
              <p>It is widely accepted by government agencies, NGOs, and 
              academics that deer are more abundant and widespread now than at any 
              time in the past 1000 years. Deer populations have increased rapidly in 
              recent decades due to several factors, including:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Milder winters;</li>
              <li>Changes to agriculture such as the planting of winter crops;</li>
              <li>Increased woodland cover;</li>
              <li>Escapes and releases from parks and farms; and</li>
              <li>Greater connectivity between green spaces in urban areas</li>
              </ul>
              <p>At present, there may be as many as 2 million deer in the UK. 
              However, accurate assessment of deer numbers is very difficult because 
              deer are secretive animals and are free to roam the landscape. Evidence 
              for increasing deer numbers is found in the expansion of their 
              geographic range and the increase in deer impacts. Deer occurrence is 
              not restricted to rural areas, and they  are increasingly found in 
              suburban and urban areas.</p>
              <p>With a lack of natural predators in the UK, the role of human 
              control becomes more important. An estimated 350,000 deer are culled 
              each year. Road accidents are the second biggest cause of deer 
              mortality. Despite this, deer are continuing to expand in range and have
               increased impacts, and it appears that current mortality rates are not 
              high enough to prevent the rise in deer populations.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I generally thought of deer as single creatures that weren't extremely intriguing. In any case, good lord, that was off-base. The huge eye-opener for me was that they're social. They have family gatherings. likewise, Though substantial groups of deer do much mischief to the area, yet the damage to the ethics of the general population is of more minute than the loss of their yields. </p></div>

              <p><span style="max-width: 360px; background-color: transparent;"><br style="max-width: 360px;">This Short Story </span><strong style="max-width: 360px; background-color: transparent;">The Iron Box </strong><span style="max-width: 360px; background-color: transparent;">is quite interesting to all the people. Enjoy reading this story. <br style="max-width: 360px;"><br style="max-width: 360px;">Mohan Das was the son of a rich businessman. When his father died, Mohan Das was left with an iron box with valuables in it. One day, Mohan Das had to go to the city on some work. So, he took the iron box and handed it over to his moneylender friend. His name was Ramasewak. <br style="max-width: 360px;"><br style="max-width: 360px;">“Please keep this box. My father gave it to me. I will return from city after few days and collect it from you," said Mohan Das to Ramasewak. <br style="max-width: 360px;"><br style="max-width: 360px;">“You do not have to worry. I will keep this box safely," said Ramasewak. <br style="max-width: 360px;"><br style="max-width: 360px;">Mohan Das started off his journey happily. He knew that his valuable iron box was safe with Ramasewak. A few days later he returned. He went to his friend Ramasewak and asked for the iron box. Ramasewak pretended to look a little surprised, “Oh, the iron box! The rats ate it up. I just could not stop them," he said. <br style="max-width: 360px;"><br style="max-width: 360px;">Mohan Das realized that his friend had become greedy and dishonest. Ramasewak was trying to cheat him. Being an intelligent man, he kept quite. “I must figure out a way to get my iron box back from Ramasewak," thought Mohan Das. <br style="max-width: 360px;"><br style="max-width: 360px;">Next day, Mohan Das went to Ramasewak and said, “Friend! Can you send your son with me? I need someone to look after my property." <br style="max-width: 360px;"><br style="max-width: 360px;">Ramasewak thought for a while. He brooded. “Mohan Das seems to be a fool. May be he will reward my son for looking after his property," thought Ramasewak. Then, immediately he agreed and sent his son with Mohan Das. <br style="max-width: 360px;"><br style="max-width: 360px;">Next morning, Mohan Das came running to Ramasewak and said, “Dear friend, a terrible thing has happened. A hawk has carried your son away." <br style="max-width: 360px;"><br style="max-width: 360px;">Ramasewak was furious and demanded, “How can a hawk carry off my son?" <br style="max-width: 360px;"><br style="max-width: 360px;">“In the same way as the rats can eat up the iron box," answered Mohan Das. <br style="max-width: 360px;"><br style="max-width: 360px;">“I am sorry, my friend. I realize my mistake," Ramasewak said with a bit of concern in his voice. He felt ashamed of having tried to cheat his friend. He gave the box back to his friend. Both of them were happy and remained good friends forever. </span></p>
