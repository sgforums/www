              <p class="story-body-text story-content">PANJWAI,
               Afghanistan —  At first glance, it is not much of a library: two 
              shelves of about 1,600 books and magazines in a basement room deep into a
               dusty alley of adobe homes in rural Panjwai District, in southern Afghanistan The mattresses and blankets stacked in the corner still give the vibe of the guest quarters the room once was.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">But
               the register shows how parts of the community here, particularly 
              younger residents, have come to value any chance to indulge their 
              curiosity, in a place that was at the heart of the original Taliban 
              uprising in the 1990s and became a watchword for the tragedy and 
              deprivation brought by war.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Hassanullah,
               18, checked out “General History.” Muhammad Rahim, 27, came for “The 
              Fires of Hell,” which he returned the next day; it was soon borrowed by a
               12-year-old named Nabi. Taher Agha, 15, preferred “Of Love and the 
              Beloved,” keeping it for 10 days. Another young man, about to marry, 
              called ahead to make sure there was a copy of “Homemaking.” He rode his 
              bicycle six miles to pick it up.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The
               library here in Panjwai is largely the work of Matiullah Wesa, a 
              22-year-old student from Kandahar who is in India finishing a degree in 
              political science. For about eight years, the Pen Path, the volunteer 
              organization that Mr. Wesa started as a teenager, has been working to 
              reopen schools closed because of violence and to bring books to some of 
              the worst-affected conflict areas.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">After
               opening in January, the Panjwai library had about 24 visitors in its 
              first month, said Muhammad Nasim Haidary, who looks after the library 
              and whose family houses it.</p>
              <div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"></div>
              <p id="story-continues-1" class="story-body-text story-content">But
               the interest of a couple of female readers, who approached women in the
               Haidary family about their interest in the books, has caused a small 
              dilemma in a society that frowns upon even sharing the names of women in
               public: How can the library keep track of who took the books out if it 
              cannot write the women’s names?</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">One proposal was to use pseudonyms for the women instead of writing 
              their real names in the register, but that would create another problem:
               How would poor Mr. Haidary remember which pseudonym belongs to whom?</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The fighting over the past 14 years has disproportionately affected the 
              southern and eastern parts of Afghanistan, and Kandahar Province, which 
              includes Panjwai, has been among the hardest hit. As district after 
              district changed hands back and forth between the Taliban and the Afghan
               government and its American allies, survival became the priority. 
              Education, which had always been scarce here, fell to the bottom of the 
              list, and in many places schools have remained closed even after the 
              insurgents were pushed out.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Pervasive corruption has also had an effect, with many of the schools that are listed on government budgets not actually function at all — “ghost school” set up to allow officials to gobble up development aid without delivering any services.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“The
               problem is that so much of the effort has focused on the cities,” Mr. 
              Wesa said during a visit to Panjwai last month. “We have to start from 
              the village. If this library was in the city, we would have 100 visitors
               a day. But to me, the five visitors in the village are more important 
              than the 100 in the city.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Mr.
               Wesa’s organization began a national book drive last year, collecting 
              about 20,000 books in a campaign that focused on social media. The 
              competition for social status runs deep in this country, and Mr. Wesa 
              banked on that to encourage contributions. Even the smallest donation of
               just a couple of books was celebrated online, with a picture of the 
              donor and a word of gratitude.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The
               books have helped establish seven modest libraries in provinces with a 
              reputation for some of the worst violence of the war: Helmand, Kandahar,
               Khost, Kunar and Wardak.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">To Westerners, Panjwai, about an hour’s drive from the city of Kandahar, is most closely associated with a gruesome atrocity<a title="Times article" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/world/asia/afghanistan-civilians-killed-american-soldier-held.html"></a>:
               the massacre of 16 civilians by an American Army sergeant who walked 
              off his base before dawn one morning in March 2012. But for the 
              residents, the place turned to hell years before that.</p>
              <div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"></div>
              <p id="story-continues-4" class="story-body-text story-content">“Panjwai
               was like a bakery oven: You burned if you entered,” Mr. Haidary said. 
              “If you said you were from Panjwai, people would get scared of you.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Recently,
               though, the district has been relatively quiet. Even as the Taliban 
              exert pressure in neighboring provinces, gobbling territory, the reach 
              of government has been maintained in Kandahar, though it has often been disapppointing or abusive.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“A
               few years ago, I don’t think I would have agreed to house a library 
              here,” said Hazrat-Wali Haidary, the eldest son of the family hosting 
              the library, who is training to be a doctor. “Everyone was suspicious of
               everything, and I wouldn’t have wanted to welcome trouble. But now, 
              relative to other places, it is peaceful here over the past three years,
               and there is an atmosphere for the people to turn to education and 
              books.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Mr.
               Wesa’s journey into education activism began in his home district, 
              Maruf, which is now contested by the Taliban. His father opened one of 
              the first schools there, before violence forced their family to relocate
               to Spinbaldak, a border commercial hub.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">But
               the seed had already been planted. Mr. Wesa, one of 11 children, 
              continued accumulating books for a family library they brought with them
               when they moved.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“Every
               time he got his hands on money, we would see him returning with more 
              books,” said his older brother, Wali Muhammad, an army officer.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The
               family library in Spinbaldak, which is now open to the public as part 
              of Mr. Wesa’s volunteer organization, has nearly 4,000 books organized 
              on neat metal shelves. In the middle of the carpeted room is a gas 
              heater for winter reading and an ashtray and a spittoon for those who 
              may need a smoke or a pinch of smokeless tobacco.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The
               circulation at the Spinbaldak library runs largely on an honor system. 
              Bookkeeping is minimal, partly because another brother of Mr. Wesa’s, 
              who is the library’s caretaker, Atta Muhammad, has only very basic 
              literacy.</p>
              <div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"></div>
              <p id="story-continues-5" class="story-body-text story-content">“If
               it is a person I know well, I just write down the number of books he 
              took, not the details of all the books,” Atta Muhammad said.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">When
               the books are not returned on time, Mr. Muhammad finds himself making 
              phone calls or visiting the borrowers’ homes. Despite his efforts, 
              several dozen books have been lost, most of them never returned after 
              being checked out.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Mr.
               Wesa plans to open several other small libraries in the coming year and
               to expand the book drive to a more organized network of volunteers 
              across the country. How far he is willing to go to promote reading was 
              best displayed in a recent conversation he had with a wealthy 
              businessman in eastern Afghanistan. The man made an offer: He would 
              donate 20,000 books to a library in his part of the country, on the 
              condition that it be named for his father.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">In
               his excitement, Mr. Wesa cared little about cultural taboos and what is
               socially acceptable in giving his answer: “I told him I would even name
               it after his mother — whatever it takes to get the books.”</p>
