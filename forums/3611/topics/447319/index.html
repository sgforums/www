              <p>Giraffe bread hits the shelves! Sainsbury's officially changes name of tiger variety after three-year-old's letter goes viral<br></p>
              <li><span>Little Lily Robinson said loaf markings looked more like a giraffe than tiger</span> </li>
              <li><span>Supermarket caves in to view after letter gets 150,000 'likes' on Facebook</span><br></li>
              <p><span>They say the customer is always right.</span></p>
              <p><span>But not many can claim to being so right they forced a supermarket to change one of its products.</span></p>
              <p><span>Little Lily Robinson can, however, after the three-year-old got Sainsbury's to rename its tiger bread after writing a letter saying it looked more like the markings of a giraffe.</span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption">Consumer power: Loaves of the newly-named giraffe bread went on sale in Sainsbury's yesterday</p>
              <p><br><span style="font-size: large;">Lily, who gave her age as '3½', fired off her comments to the company last May suggesting the name be altered.<br><br></span><span style="font-size: large;">She received a reply two weeks later from customer manager Chris King who wrote: ‘I think renaming tiger bread giraffe bread is a brilliant idea.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large;">‘It looks much more like the blotches on a giraffe than the stripes on a tiger, doesn’t it?’</span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption">Understanding: This witty and friendly reply from Customer Manager Chris King won him a lot of praise</p>

              <p class="imageCaption">Viral: Lily's mother posted her daughter's letter and the response on this Facebook campaign page which went on to get more than 140,000 'likes'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>He went on to explain that the bread had got its name because the first baker who made it a ‘looong time ago thought it looked stripey like a tiger.’</span></p>
              <p><span>'Maybe they were a bit silly,’ he added before signing off with his age ’27 1/3’, just as Lily did.</span></p>
              <p><span>The girl’s letter and the supermarket’s reply has now gone viral eight months later with over 150,000 ‘likes’ on Facebook after her mother posted them online.</span></p>
              <p><span>Sainsbury’s last night said it had given in to popular demand and started selling the new loaves from yesterday</span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption">What do you think? A look at these images makes it hard to disagree with Lily</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>A spokesman said: ‘In response to overwhelming customer feedback that our tiger bread has more resemblance to a giraffe, from today we will be changing our tiger bread to giraffe bread and seeing how that goes.’</span></p>
              <p><span>The supermarket said that Mr King, who has been widely praised by Twitter and Facebook users for his impressive reply, has left the company and is training as a primary school teacher. </span></p>
              <p><span>Tiger bread is typically made by brushing a rice paste onto the surface of a bloomer loaf prior to baking, with the pattern forming as the paste dries and cracks.</span></p>
