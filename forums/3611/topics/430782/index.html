              <p class="articleabstract">A young woman who insisted on noisily chatting on her cell phone throughout a marathon 15-hour train ride was forcibly removed by police following numerous passenger complaints.</p>
              <p class="articleabstract"><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/A0/8A1514FE86884B5E167F76D59D615.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="163"></p>
              <p>The woman was traveling on Amtrak's Coast Starlight, which runs between Los Angeles and Seattle, Washington, and was speaking loudly enough to annoy surrounding passengers, said Amtrak spokesman Vernay Graham.</p>
              <p>"I guess she got into some sort of confrontation with others passengers that were sitting around her," said Graham, adding that the train had almost reached its destination when the conductor decided to call local police after the train pulled into the station at Salem, Oregon.</p>
              <p>"We consider them unruly passengers when we've asked them to stop doing some kind of behavior and they continue on. Then it's up to the discretion of the service crew, in this case the conductor, to decide that they would be removed," said Graham.</p>
              <p>Amtrak, the national rail operator, is not following up with any charges, he said.</p>

              <p>Entirely possible. Newer planes have them, so I wouldn't be surprised to see new long-distance trains having them as well.</p>
              <p>I rode on a Boeing 777 recently, and it had both power points and USB ports on every seat (including Economy class). So I happily plugged my smartphone into the USB port to charge it up.</p>
