              <div class="article-body">
              <p>(LUDZIDZINI ROYAL VILLAGE, SWAZILAND) Thousands of 
              bare-breasted young Swazi women paraded in front of their king to 
              celebrate chastity and unity, dismissing criticism of the lavish 
              ceremony in one of Africa’s poorest countries for its last absolute 
              monarch.</p>
              <p>Clad in beaded mini-skirts and clutching machetes and mobile phones, 
              women and girls as young as five danced and sang tributes on Sunday and 
              Monday to the king and queen mother, also known as the Great 
              She-Elephant, in a traditional Umhlanga Reed Dance meant to celebrate 
              womanhood and virginity.</p>
              <p>“I’m proud to be Swazi and to be a virgin. We are here to show unity 
              with the king and with each other,” said 18-year-old Gcebine Dlamini, 
              bracing the cold of the southern hemisphere’s winter in her skimpy 
              outfit as scores of tourists had photos taken next to the topless women.</p>
              <p>King Mswati III, who has at least a dozen wives and a personal 
              fortune estimated at US$200 million (S$249 million), faced unprecedented
               protests last year when his appointed administration ran out of money 
              after a 2009 recession in neighbouring South Africa.</p>
              <p>Despite the straitened times, the royal household has shown few signs
               of wanting to tighten its belt. In July, South Africa’s Mail and 
              Guardian newspaper reported that three of Mswati’s wives joined a 
              66-strong royal entourage heading to Las Vegas on a shopping spree. 
              There was no comment from the palace.</p>
              <p>But women at the annual event gathered behind the monarch in the 
              week-long celebrations, even though police kept a close watch on what 
              they might tell journalists and tourists roaming the grounds of the 
              royal village, some 20km outside the capital.</p>
              <p>In the past, the king has used the ceremony to choose a new wife, and some girls still hoped to catch the king’s eye.</p>
              <p>“If chosen, I would be able to live a better life than what I have, 
              have a lot of money, live a queen's life and travel overseas,” said 
              Fakazile Dlamini, 14, who arrived on a lorry from her village 60km away 
              to attend the ceremony.</p>
              <p>New royal wives have often received a BMW and their own palace, 
              fuelling criticism in a country where more than two-thirds of its 1.4 
              million people live in abject poverty.</p>
              <p>Women’s groups and political opponents also say Mswati’s penchant for
               multiple young brides ill befits a country with the world’s highest 
              rate of HIV/AIDS, but the monarch says polygamy is part of Swazi 
              tradition and helps cement national unity.</p>
              <p>Maidens flocked in from across the country - some attend the ceremony
               every year until they marry - cut reeds from river beds, which they 
              then presented to the queen mother in a 1.6km-long singing and 
              foot-stamping procession.</p>
              <p>In the past, they would have been accommodated by families living 
              close to the royal household, but are now put up in camps and protected 
              by police from other men.</p>
              <p>Even though the girls refuse to criticise UK-educated Mswati who 
              arrived at the event dressed in beads and lion cloth, not everyone 
              supported his polygamous lifestyle.</p>
              <p>“I don’t want to be a queen, I don’t want to share my man. Polygamy 
              is not okay,” Siphesihle Mdluli, 20, who hopes to go on to study 
              medicine said while waving her bundle of reeds.</p>
