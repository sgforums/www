              <p class="imageCaption">Kira Goddard, 13, ushered six other children inside when she saw an out-of-control SUV coming toward them down the street. She was unable to get out of the way in time.</p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p id="paragraph1">A 13-year-old girl is being hailed a hero for saving six other children from being hit by an out-of-control SUV in Brooklyn before she was struck and killed by the vehicle.</p>
              <p id="paragraph2">Those who knew Kira Goddard described her as a protector, so it was no surprise to them that the teen sprang into action when the SUV came toward her, her sister and several friends.</p>
              <p id="paragraph3">"That was like her," said Diane Jordan, a relative. "She always looked out for others. I'm going to miss her."</p>
              <p id="paragraph4">The children had been at the entrance of their apartment building in Brownsville when, at about 10:15 p.m. Saturday, they noticed the driver of a Range Rover approaching erratically down Pacific Street.</p>
              <p id="paragraph5">Goddard managed to shepherd the others into the building. But everything happened so fast, witnesses said, that Goddard had no time to save herself.</p>
              <p id="paragraph6">The SUV struck and pinned her, and Goddard died.</p>
              <p id="paragraph7">The teen's mother said she was in a state of shock. "I don't know what to say," Joyce Lovelady told NBC New York. "There are tears. But I can't cry. I'm very hurt. I am very, very hurt."</p>
              <p id="paragraph8">A preliminary investigation showed that 44-year-old Sean Lewis of Brooklyn was driving the SUV when he struck three parked cars. He had reportedly been stabbed and was trying to get help.</p>
              <p id="paragraph9">Police say he backed up and hit another parked car, causing his SUV to flip toward the apartment building where the children were gathered.</p>
              <p id="paragraph10">Lewis suffered head injuries and was taken to the hospital, where medical staff discovered that he had been stabbed in the torso. He later died.</p>
              <p id="paragraph11">Friends said Goddard had been looking forward to starting seventh grade this fall. She turned 13 just a few months ago, but neighbors said she acted more like an adult, protecting everyone she knew.</p>
