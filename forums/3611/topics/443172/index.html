              <p>JERUSALEM (AP) — Mysterious stone carvings made thousands of years ago and 
              recently uncovered in an excavation underneath Jerusalem have archaeologists 
              stumped.</p>
              <p>Israeli diggers who uncovered a complex of rooms carved into the bedrock in 
              the oldest section of the city recently found the markings: Three "V'' shapes 
              cut next to each other into the limestone floor of one of the rooms, about 2 
              inches (5 centimeters) deep and 20 inches (50 centimeters) long. There were no 
              finds to offer any clues pointing to the identity of who made them or what 
              purpose they served.</p>
              <p>The archaeologists in charge of the dig know so little that they have been 
              unable even to posit a theory about their nature, said Eli Shukron, one of the 
              two directors of the dig.</p>
              <p>"The markings are very strange, and very intriguing. I've never seen anything 
              like them," Shukron said.</p>
              <p>The shapes were found in a dig known as the City of David, a politically 
              sensitive excavation conducted by Israeli government archaeologists and funded 
              by a nationalist Jewish group under the Palestinian neighborhood of Silwan in 
              east Jerusalem. The rooms were unearthed as part of the excavation of 
              fortifications around the ancient city's only natural water source, the Gihon 
              spring.</p>
              <p>It is possible, the dig's archaeologists say, that when the markings were 
              made at least 2,800 years ago the shapes might have accommodated some kind of 
              wooden structure that stood inside them, or they might have served some other 
              purpose on their own. They might have had a ritual function or one that was 
              entirely mundane. Archaeologists faced by a curious artifact can usually at 
              least venture a guess about its nature, but in this case no one, including 
              outside experts consulted by Shukron and the dig's co-director, archaeologists 
              with decades of experience between them, has any idea.</p>
              <p>There appears to be at least one other ancient marking of the same type at 
              the site. A century-old map of an expedition led by the British explorer 
              Montague Parker, who searched for the lost treasures of the Jewish Temple in 
              Jerusalem between 1909 and 1911, includes the shape of a "V'' drawn in an 
              underground channel not far away. Modern archaeologists haven't excavated that 
              area yet.</p>
              <p>Ceramic shards found in the rooms indicate they were last used around 800 
              B.C., with Jerusalem under the rule of Judean kings, the dig's archaeologists 
              say. At around that time, the rooms appear to have been filled with rubble to 
              support the construction of a defensive wall.</p>
              <p>It is unclear, however, whether they were built in the time of those kings or 
              centuries earlier by the Canaanite residents who predated them.</p>
              <p>The purpose of the complex is part of the riddle. The straight lines of its 
              walls and level floors are evidence of careful engineering, and it was located 
              close to the most important site in the city, the spring, suggesting it might 
              have had an important function.</p>
              <p>A unique find in a room beside the one with the markings — a stone like a 
              modern grave marker, which was left upright when the room was filled in — might 
              offer a clue. Such stones were used in the ancient Middle East as a focal point 
              for ritual or a memorial for dead ancestors, the archaeologists say, and it is 
              likely a remnant of the pagan religions which the city's Israelite prophets 
              tried to eradicate. It is the first such stone to be found intact in Jerusalem 
              excavations.</p>
              <p>But the ritual stone does not necessarily mean the whole complex was a 
              temple. It might simply have marked a corner devoted to religious practice in a 
              building whose purpose was commonplace.</p>
              <p>With the experts unable to come up with a theory about the markings, the City 
              of David dig posted a photo on its Facebook page and solicited suggestions. The 
              results ranged from the thought-provoking — "a system for wood panels that held 
              some other item," or molds into which molten metal would could have been poured 
              — to the fanciful: ancient Hebrew or Egyptian characters, or a "symbol for 
              water, particularly as it was near a spring."</p>
              <p>The City of David dig, where the carvings were found, is the most 
              high-profile and politically contentious excavation in the Holy Land. Named for 
              the biblical monarch thought to have ruled from the spot 3,000 years ago, the 
              dig is located in what today is east Jerusalem, which was captured by Israel in 
              1967. Palestinians claim that part of the city as the capital of a future 
              state.</p>
              <p>The dig is funded by Elad, an organization affiliated with the Israeli 
              settlement movement. The group also moves Jewish families into the neighborhood 
              and elsewhere in east Jerusalem in an attempt to render impossible any division 
              of the city in a future peace deal.</p>
              <p>Palestinians and some Israeli archaeologists have criticized the dig for what 
              they say is an excessive focus on Jewish remains. The dig's archaeologists, who 
              work under the auspices of the government's Israel Antiquities Authority, deny 
              that charge.</p>
