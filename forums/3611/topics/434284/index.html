              <p class="articleabstract">Robots may one day take over the world but, in the meantime, at least they'll bring us a beer…</p>
              <p>Robots look set to take over the world but, with the latest creations being more than happy to fetch you a beer, sing you a song or cook your breakfast, who's complaining?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h1>Asimo</h1>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/B8/763AB4313E4E5DE2F591284AF9CEF8.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="398"></p>
              <p>Widely regarded as the world's most advanced humanoid robot, Honda's legendary creation can walk, talk, ride a bicycle, recognise faces, identify the sources of sounds, distinguish between voices and other noises, and respond to questions with a nod, shake of the head or verbal answer. Additionally, a camera mounted on Asimo's head enables the robot to interpret the positioning and movements of objects, allowing it to respond to humans with a wave or handshake. We're still a way off the androids of science fiction, but Asimo is a step in that direction.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <h1>Tiro</h1>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/89/983BE55E846DAD014EA5FE15EA595.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="398"></p>
              <p>Developed by South Korea-based Hanool Robotics Corp and some of the country's top science universities, Tiro has been designed as a potential teacher of the future, and has already led several classes. Tiro, who speaks several languages, has also officiated at wedding ceremonies and led guided tours around South Korea's presidential residence. While Japan is considered the world leader in robotics, South Korea is quickly emerging as a close contender; government officials say every single home within the country will have a robot by 2013, with a $1billion robot theme park due to open in Seoul in the same year. We imagine Kim Jong Ji will be following developments closely...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h1>Nao</h1>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/26/4B0951B71545AC561F59251A79BE.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="398"></p>
              <p>Nao is the creation of French company Aldebaran Robotics and is a robot designed specifically for use in academic environments. There are currently 700 Naos being used by over 200 universities and schools around the world, making Nao the world's most popular academic robot. Just last year, the University of Tokyo purchased 30 Nao robots with a view to developing them into lab assistants. Nao can see, hear, speak and feel, and designers hope it will eventually be used within domestic environments and in care homes as a companion for the elderly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h1>BigDog</h1>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/D0/7DBA74386D13D0F41567FBBC76EE9.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="398"></p>
              <p>BigDog lacks the cuteness factor offered by other robotic mutts but, when it comes to agility, this electronic canine wins hands down. Designed to run, walk and climb over rough terrain, up steep inclines and through snow, mud and water while carrying heavy loads, BigDog's agility relies on a series of sensors which measure factors such as load weight, ground angle and joint position. BigDog's creator, American robotic design company Boston Dynamics, hopes this will eventually become a domestic robot and, while he's no match for man's best friend, he's unlikely to pee on the carpet either.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h1>PR2</h1>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/79/845F475DCC2A8D45449F171227664.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="398"></p>
              <p>PR2, a 'personal robot' capable of carrying out everyday tasks, is the creation of American firm Willow Garage. PR2 (which is actually for sale, to those with $400,000 to spare) was the company's first robot. To celebrate his creation, Willow Garage employees made a film showcasing his ability to carry out everyday tasks with ease - in this case, to fetch and deliver an ice-cold beer. Designers created an in-house web interface which enabled employees to choose their favourite beer, before clicking on a button imaginatively entitled 'beer me'. PR2 could then grab the appropriate cold one from the canteen fridge and deliver it to the thirsty recipient (after closing the fridge and opening the bottle, of course). Sounds like our kind of office.</p>

              <p>If a robot that fetches you beer sounds a great idea, how about one that cooks you a full English the morning after? Rosie - named after the robot maid character from the Jetsons - is the creation of the Technical University of Munich, and relies on a selection of high-tech appliances (including thermal and stereo cameras) to carry out complex tasks. In a match made in robot heaven, Rosie recently joined forces with PR2 to cook up a hearty Bavarian breakfast. After PR2 removed the various food items from the fridge, Rosie sliced the bread, cooked some sausages in a pan and placed the sausages on a plate for PR2 to serve. Gordon Ramsay should be very, very afraid.</p>

              <h1>Topio</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/6B/3D13512B68D771CAE1874FBE2DDE73.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="398"></p>
              <p>We imagine many robot inventors secretly dream of their creations one day taking over the world. But the creators of Topio have a more unusual dream - that their bipedal humanoid robot will one day beat a professional sportsman at a game of ping pong. The scarily Terminator-like Topio (he's even got the sunglasses and six-pack) was created in 2005 by Vietnamese robotics firm Tosy, with his unique feature being an ability to instantly recognise and respond to fast-moving objects. With his lightning-fast reflexes and impressive hand-eye coordination, we doubt it will be long before he achieves his goal. Until then, we'd pay good money to see him finish his game with the utterance, "I'll be back".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h1>ACM-R5 amphibious robot</h1>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/6A/F76121DBA975D31D1F717887749D2.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="398"></p>
              <p>Electronics and water don't tend to mix too well but ACM-R5 is a definite exception. Designed by Japan's Hirose Fukushima Lab, the robotic reptile is equally at home on terra firma or underwater. ACM-R5 is powered by a lithium battery and controlled by a remote operator, with sensors allowing for some seriously impressive underwater acrobatics and above-ground terrain negotiation. It's hoped ACM-R5 will be used in a humanitarian capacity - slithering into collapsed buildings or through earthquake rubble.</p>

              <h1>Stanley the robot car</h1>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/6B/722DFBB8AE1B282267FB98843AE3B0.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="398"></p>
              <p>Backseat drivers beware, Stanley is the world's first robotic car. Designed by the Stanford University Racing Team, Stanley's first achievement was to come first in the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) Grand Challenge, where he successfully navigated 175 miles of rough terrain in under 10 hours, with no human intervention. Stanley uses a hi-tech combination of sensors and custom-written, algorithm-based software to operate. It's hoped that future versions will eventually be used in dangerous military missions and warzones.</p>

              <h1>Toyota trumpeting robot</h1>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/96/76A277F0BC6EE9DF551442452C4C5.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="398"></p>
              <p>Toyota is famous for its motors, but one of its most impressive (and arguably pointless) creations is a trumpet-playing robot. The car company has been unusually tight-lipped about how long the unnamed 120cm robot took to create and has admitted there are no plans to sell or rent the creation. However, it has made several appearances around the world - as part of a robot band at the World Exposition in Japan in 2005 and regularly performing as a solo artist at various events. Its speciality is Wish Upon a Star.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h1>PaPeRo</h1>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/40/F02D9A999667F315653618DAB833C.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="398"></p>
              <p>The undisputed winner in the robot-cuteness stakes, PaPeRo (who stands 38.5 cm tall and weighs just five kilograms) was created by NEC as a personal robot which could provide companionship to the elderly or infirm. PaPeRo has five personalities. Leader PaPeRo has a cute voice and loves dancing and talking, Lazy PaPeRo becomes quiet when ignored. Dancing PaPeRo is active but also headstrong, Computer PaPeRo responds to praise and touch, while Knowledgeable PaPeRo can use the internet to provide certain information and is described as polite but "prone to sulking". Perhaps not exactly what you want from a home help, but there you go.</p>
