              <p>After being it a relationship for a while, there comes a point when many couples hit a rut, and things become a little stagnant and sloppy. Gone are the thrills and excitement that you get with a new relationship, and in comes routine. You don’t necessarily put as much effort into getting ready for a night out as you would before a date, or going to fancy new restaurants. Unless you like slobbing out together, then read on to find out how to make your relationship more glamorous.</p>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/E7/08285561BD5ACCDF641B3FFB7AB3.jpg" alt="" width="237" height="414"></p>
              <p><strong>No need for megabucks</strong></p>
              <p>You don’t need to have pots and pots of cash, just some enthusiasm, a dash of style and a little sprinkle of effort to put the spark and sparkle back into things. Being glamorous is all about creating an attractive and exciting illusion that you lead an envied life together.</p>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/E8/F18EBBE4FF7172B41B7AFDCADAA1B.jpg" alt="" width="411" height="286"></p>
              <p><strong>Dress up</strong></p>
              <p>Whatever the occasion, make an effort to look good. You don’t need to add a full face of makeup, but a small touch will make a difference. You also don’t need a cocktail dress. Just make sure you get out of your old tracksuit, as there are many options between slob and superstar.</p>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/21/CDBEB7A159E64DBCAEF731A674.jpg" alt="" width="411" height="273"></p>
              <p><strong>Be social</strong></p>
              <p>Make sure that you are out and about as a couple and get seen in all the chic places, even if you can afford it to shop or live there. Make sure that you network as well, and forget the dingy bars and head to somewhere more classy and chic.</p>

              <p><strong>Go to MMER this weekend</strong></p>
              <p>So what if Monaco F1 wasn’t in your budget this year. However, for RM5 the Merdeka Millennium Endurance Race this weekend is much more affordable. What could be more glamorous that than being on a race track surrounded by aspiring F1 drivers and cars such as Lamborghinis, Aston Martins and Porsches.</p>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/91/0879FED78D272FECD4F764729FCC.jpg" alt="" width="413" height="267"></p>
              <p><strong>Eating in</strong></p>
              <p>Firstly, make an effort to actually make the table and sit there to eat, instead of eating with a plate balanced on your knee in front of the TV. Even if you aren’t much of a cook and get delivery or take out, make sure that you decant the food onto a plate, than eat out of the container that it comes in. Presentation is everything, and it enhances an experience. </p>

              <p><strong>Dining out</strong></p>
              <p>Again, you don’t have to fork out a fortune to eat in a fancy place and you also don’t have to be embarrassed to ask restaurants and place about cheap deals.</p>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/A9/18D1FB8F62A6A7BBFCA3D686A68.jpg" alt="" width="276" height="410"></p>
              <p><strong>Travel</strong></p>
              <p>A glamorous life is full of travel, but if you are feeling grounded, due to lack of cash then why not browse the deals and holidays that are on offer as many airlines and agents offers discount packages and sales. At least once a year, get away with your other half to spend as long as possible alone together in a pleasant setting.</p>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/C7/1BB62F948DBC086931D99E5617F8D.jpg" alt="" width="274" height="411"></p>
              <p><strong>Have unique hobbies</strong></p>
              <p>You may not be able to travel the world together in your private jet just yet, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t be selective in the hobbies and activities that you have. Why not get into Polo and attend the events, or go to wine tastings. There are plenty of interesting and distinctive hobbies out there for you to indulge in.</p>

              <p><strong>Fancy pants</strong></p>
              <p>Instead of wearing your old and grey granny pants, why not invest a little in buying some new sexy and glamorous underwear. Not only will it make you feel confident, but it will certainly put the sparkle in your partner’s eye!</p>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/ED/6616CEAAED406D67B423803DF8966E.jpg" alt="" width="411" height="296"></p>
              <p><strong>Use imagination</strong></p>
              <p>If all of the above fail, then just imagine that you have a glamorous life and relationship. Make sure that you always behave in a way as though you were being watched or about to get papped! Just because you're creating an illusion doesn't mean you have to lie. It's better to be mysterious and vague than to get caught lying, which will look desperate, not glamorous.</p>
