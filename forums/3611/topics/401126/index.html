              <p><strong>Here are a few reminders....</strong></p>
              <p><strong>A Small Gesture<br></strong>A lonely person's pity meter is a finely tuned instrument. There is no greater kindness than <em>not</em> extending an overly magnanimous invitation that makes her feel like the neighborhood charity case. A small gesture—an offhand invitation to lunch—is often a better antidote.<br><br><strong>Dinner and A Movie<br></strong>Some people are so debilitated by loneliness that they can hardly discuss it (or anything else). Inviting a friend to a concert or movie will give you something to talk about over dinner.<br><br><strong>Prescription for Success<br></strong>Offer to accompany her to a medical appointment. One study found that doctors said they treat socially isolated people less well than patients with supportive families, and they've seen other health practitioners do the same.<br><br><strong>Try Not to Cancel<br></strong>Try not to reschedule plans or cancel at the last minute. Lonely people tend to see social engagements as life buoys in a long week; canceling can leave them feeling unmoored.<br><br><strong>Checking In<br></strong>Leave a message. A voicemail or e-mail can make her feel she hasn't been forgotten.<br><br><strong>Reality Check<br></strong>Since research shows that the lonely tend to remember more details about their social encounters and often interpret remarks and nonverbal messages negatively, you might give her a different interpretation of her officemates' behavior or be her reality check at a party.</p>
              <p><strong>She's Not Your Wingman<br></strong>Do not abandon her at the buffet! Dragging your friend to a party might seem like a good idea—she'll get out of the house and meet people—but throwing your friend into a clutch of cheese-straw-wielding revelers by herself while you catch up with other guests is almost guaranteed to leave her feeling worse than before.<br><br><strong>Help Her Find Her Place of Comfort<br></strong>Remind your friend that doing things alone—going to a movie, eating out—is hard for a lot of people, especially the first time. You might take her to the coffee shop that gives you a sense of community when you're on your own and volunteer to help find a place in her neighborhood.<br><br><strong>Invitation Is Welcome<br></strong>If you're part of a couple, don't let that stop you from inviting your single friend to join the two of you for dinner or a Saturday outing to Ikea. One <em>O</em> editor says that in her post-divorce despair, some of her happiest, least fraught times were with her married friends who just asked her to show up, plop down on the sofa, drink a little wine and stay for dinner.</p>
