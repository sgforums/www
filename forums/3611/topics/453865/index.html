              <p>A 23 year old man has been praised as a hero worldwide after footage of him saving a girl from falling off a building in China was released.<br><br>Clinging to the side of the building, Zhou Chong, seen here in yellow, reaches out and props up the toddler who had her head stuck in the railings of the fourth floor balcony. Saving the four year old from a fatal fall, he held her in place until rescue services arrived.<br><br>Speaking of the incident, which occurred on 3rd June, Zhou said,<br><br>"At that time, she might have been dangling up there for a few minutes already and a girl of three or four-years-old could not be that strong. She already had her head stuck in the railings and was already dangling there, so I thought that I could reach up my hand and let her stand on it, as she would have more strength with her feet, so then she would not be in danger."<br><br>The girl's family praised Zhou's quick-thinking attitude and courage.<br><br>"If you were the mother who encountered an accident like this, you would be very anxious. So we just thank him very much."<br><br>After the incident, Zhou left the scene before the grateful parents could thank him, but after being tracked down, he has finally received the recognition he deserves.</p>

              <p>"It was easy for me to do this".</p>
              <p>Those were the words of 23-year-old Zhou Chong, who scaled a building in  Guangzhou, in southern China, to stop a toddler falling 20 metres to the  ground.</p>
              <p>Zhou climbed out a window and along the building to prop up the toddler, who  appeared to have her head stuck in metal railings, for almost 10 minutes before  she was rescued by authorities, <strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9324294/Man-rescues-child-dangling-from-balcony-in-China.html">London's <em>Daily Telegraph</em> reported</a></strong>.</p>
              <p>After the dramatic rescue on June 3, Zhou, who was in the city to look for a  job, left before the girl's family could thank him.</p>
              <p>Local media tracked him down after CCTV footage of the rescue was  released.</p>
              <p>The <em>Telegraph</em> reported the rescue was made easier for Zhou because  he had a background in construction.</p>
              <p>"At that time I wasn't thinking much and I wasn't looking to gain anything.  It was easy for me to do this," he said.</p>
              <p>Zhou was given a $7900 reward and offered a job by the local government, <strong><a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-06/11/content_15493461.htm"><em>The  China Daily</em> reported</a></strong>.</p>
              <p>Shi Qizhu, head of Tianhe district in Guangzhou, said: "Zhou saved a girl's  life and the family's happiness regardless of his own safety.</p>
              <p>"As a local government, we must never forget this."</p>
