              <p>In Lebanon, everything constantly changes, from the color of your hair to the shape of your nose and the settings of your mobile phone. And pretty soon the location of one of the hottest restaurants to hit the nation! A floating restaurant is coming to town, allowing people to dine up to 50 meters in the air, wherever they want. It is called Dinner in the Sky, a concept that has taken the dining experience in over 38 countries to whole new heights. And now PR company Alf Events by young restaurateur Alfred Asseily of La Table D’Alfred is bringing it here. </p>

              <p>How on Earth does that happen, you may wonder! Well, it’s not exactly on Earth. The flying saucer, which totally comes in peace, is held by 16 steel cables and is pulled up by a mobile crane with an 80-ton lifting capacity. The six-ton heavy rectangular table was constructed in accordance with German TÜV (German association for technical inspection) and European DIN norms – translation: Some of the toughest security certifications in the world. The rectangular table can accommodate per takeoff 22 happy-go-lucky guests who are secured by shell-type seats and buckled up with four-point seatbelts. An additional five staff members, including the chef, waiters, and even entertainer huddle together in the central corridor. So if you’re looking to transform a dinner party, product presentation or launch, corporate lunch, or poker game into an event that will leave a lasting impression, it is good you’re reading this! After all, Forbes.com picked Dinner in the Sky as one of the 10 most unusual restaurants in the world. </p>

              <p>Available for sessions of eight hours, Dinner in the Sky can be rented for a day or weeks, and will be divided or personalized according to clients’ wishes, which ultimately determines the number of zeros on the tab. For now, La Table D’Alfred will be catering to diners in the sky. “We want to keep it a distinguished gastronomy experience like La Table D’Alfred,” explains Carmen Arthus, sales representative, Alf Events. However, clients can just lease the restaurant and select their own caterer, and the sooner they book it, the better. Dinner in the Sky can also provide for a business branding option, as clients can rent out the branding space on the lower face, the chairs, and the roof of the table to highlight their business or brand. The first Dinner in the Sky is taking off from Biel on June 10. So spread the word people! We don’t want anyone thinking of UFOs hovering over our skies again. </p>
