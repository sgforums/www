              <p>That life is not just all about getting good grades.</p>
              <p>Honestly, and as snobbish as it sounds, such people don't impress me much because they are usually deficient in other areas. </p>
              <p>Drive is important, but striving to achieve should be a means to an end and not merely the end.</p>
              <p>And yes.</p>
              <p>I strongly believe hard work cannot trump talent. For the simple reason that flexibilty is not something that can be perfected quickly.</p>
              <p>And no. I'm not talented. I just speak with the experience of 20 years in the dog-eat-dog world of the SG education system.</p>

              <p>If you work hard and use your talent well, you may succeed. Period, we see that everywhere.</p>
              <p>If you have no much talent and you work hard, you may still succeed.</p>
              <p>But what does success means if you only are doing it for yourslef to enjoy. If you dun use your talent to benefit others as well as yourself, what is the point of being talented and successful?  You may become very rich and powerful, but does it matters much? There are people who are famous and successful, so what? </p>
              <p>Supposing this talented hard working guy dies today and goes to haven, what do you think God will ask him? How much wealth have you make on earth Or what have you done to benefit others with the talents you got?</p>
              <p>They are people who are not born talented, but they still made an impart in humanity through their heart and kindness to others. These are the things you can bring with you when you die, all the talents and successes you will leave here on earth. </p>
              <p>So if you are really talented, use it wisely, not self centredly and you will find your happiness in life. </p>
