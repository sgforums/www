              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1426398878852_632" class="first">A blanket of fresh 
              snow has fallen on Mexico's highest summit, preserving the mystery 
              surrounding the discovery of two mummified bodies near the peak locked 
              in a cold embrace, frozen in time.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1426398878852_637">Could they be two of three 
              climbers buried by an avalanche 55 years ago? For now, the answer will 
              have to wait because fog conceals the top of Pico de Orizaba.</p>
              <p>The storm has delayed an expedition to recover the cadavers 
              discovered last week, raising concerns that the remains could be lost 
              again on the 5,610-meter (18,400-foot) volcano, also known as 
              Citlaltepetl.</p>
              <p>As rescue teams await better weather to begin their expedition, it is
               adding to the anxiety of friends and families of climbers who vanished 
              five decades ago</p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1426398878852_641">"We fear that the cadavers will be
               covered up again... and that they are forgotten again," Luis Espinosa, a
               veteran mountaineer who has searched for three friends missing since 
              1959, told AFP.</p>
              <p><img src="https://s1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/a7k9M3FazUGJbd3InaIq3g--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9aW5zZXQ7aD0zMzc7aWw9cGxhbmU7cT03NTt3PTUxMg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_sg/News/AFP/cf1c6d29ade33b56455437f03b3fa5e8cc957c8d.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="337"></p>
              <p>The slopes of the mountain, which straddles the states of Puebla and 
              Veracruz, were white with snow on Friday while the summit was walled off
               by dense fog.</p>
              <p>The snowfall forced the closure of the Mexico City-Puebla highway for several hours on Thursday.</p>
              <p>And the expedition to recover the bodies, initially planned for this 
              weekend, was indefinitely delayed as four meters (13 feet) of snow fell 
              on the mountain.</p>
              <p>"We know a lot of people are worried. There are many relatives who 
              could think that it's an easy task. But a rescue at an altitude of 5,000
               meters puts everybody's lives at risk," said Ricardo de la Cruz, the 
              federal civil protection director general.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1426398878852_642">The first body was discovered by 
              chance by climbers on March 1. After they reported seeing a head 
              protruding from the glacier, an official expedition was sent and 
              discovered the second cadaver embracing the first one.</p>
              <p>- The avalanche -</p>
              <p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/Lsu9YzA1LY9cxfvqEhwN7A--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9aW5zZXQ7aD0zNDE7aWw9cGxhbmU7cT03NTt3PTUxMg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_sg/News/AFP/df8f4c2e30e2aacca96b99d58fd692768b75c6e7.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="341"></p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1426398878852_1017">Luis Espinosa, 78, is convinced that the bodies belong to his missing friends and hopes the third one can also be found.</p>
              <p>"It's them, without a doubt," the chemical engineer said, showing a 
              newspaper he saved from November 4, 1959, which describes the "intense 
              search" for Alberto Rodriguez, Manuel Campos and expedition chief 
              Enrique Garcia following an avalanche.</p>
              <p>He said red cloth found on a body matches the color of Garcia's sweater, worn 55 years ago.</p>
              <p>The theory was backed up by Gerardo Reyes, who maintains a registry 
              of climbers on the north side of the volcano, where the bodies were 
              found.</p>
              <p>He showed yellowing pages in which mountaineers have written their names since the 1930s.</p>
              <p>"We don't know of anybody else who has remained lost on the mountain,
               neither foreigners nor Mexican nationals," Reyes told AFP in his refuge
               for climbers.</p>
              <p>But he acknowledged that some people go up the mountain without registering and could have vanished without anybody knowing.</p>
              <p>The mayor of nearby Chalchicomula, Juan Navarro, said he received 
              calls from people as far away as Spain and Germany asking for 
              information about the bodies.</p>
              <p>- Spirit of the mummies -</p>
              <p>The mystery has prompted the government to restrict access to the 
              volcano because some people have been caught trying to sneak up to see 
              the bodies.</p>
              <p>"We have caught some climbers trying to go up. They were going 
              directly toward the mummies," a Chalchicomula town official told AFP.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1426398878852_1103">Alberto Rangel, one of the 
              climbers who found the first body, said his group tried to keep their 
              discovery as quiet as possible because "we know how daring climbers can 
              be."</p>
              <p>They were 200 meters from the summit, climbing a 50-degree glacier, 
              when they decided to come back down because some in the six-person team 
              were injured.</p>
              <p>It was on the way back that they spotted something that looked like a
               coconut on the snow. They deviated from their route to investigate and 
              discovered that it was a mummified human head.</p>
              <p>After they took a picture, one of the climbers slipped and tumbled 
              300 meters down the slope. He escaped with slight injuries. Was it pure 
              luck to get away so lightly?</p>
              <p>"I'm not a believer or anything like that, but I don't know what to 
              think," Rangel said, chuckling at the "protection" provided by the 
              spirit of the mummies.</p>
