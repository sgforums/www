              <h1><strong>Alex, 26, psychic</strong></h1>
              <p><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01450/06141ab0-532_1450017a.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>FROM her glowing tan to her false eyelashes, Alex Thornhill is every inch the  glamorous Essex girl.</p>
              <p>But what you wouldn't predict is that Alex, from Hornchurch, is a crystal  ball-bothering psychic.</p>
              <p>She says: "I found it scary when I was growing up. I used to see a man  standing in my doorway at night. When I was four I predicted someone we knew  would go to prison.</p>
              <p>"As a teenager I knew a family friend was having an affair and I successfully  predicted her marriage would last ten years. At first I didn't think of  becoming a psychic. I went to dance college.</p>
              <p>"But I realised I had a talent I could put to good use.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes it's scary – I hear voices, I see objects thrown across rooms and I  see ghosts – but I have spirits to protect me.</p>
              <p>"I use a crystal ball, tarot cards and spirit guides. Otherwise I'm not like  your average psychic.</p>
              <p>"Everyone has this perception of what they look like – usually an old, fat,  hippyish woman and that's just not me. I love to dress up and go out.</p>
              <p>"My abilities can make it difficult with men. I predicted that my ex was  leading a double life. It turned out to be true – he had a family with  another woman.</p>
              <p>"When I introduce myself as a psychic to blokes they tend to go bright red.  I'm like, 'I can't read your dirty thoughts!' A lot of blokes back off  because they think it's a bit freaky. Perhaps that's why I'm currently  single.</p>
              <p>"I'm a big believer in psychic ordering. If you create a mood board with  things you want on it, they can start to happen. I put a boob job on mine  and my ex randomly offered to pay for me to get them done. So it really  works.</p>
              <p>"I have family who don't believe in all this. My dad doesn't. He calls me  Septic Peg.</p>
              <p>"But seeing is believing. Eventually, I think one day there will be solid  proof.</p>
              <p>"But until that day comes you can't get down on people for being sceptical.  I'm not out to convert anybody."</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <h1><strong>Mia, 50, psychic </strong></h1>
              <p><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01450/0613a3f7-532_1450019a.jpg" alt="Visionary ... Mia Dolan found out she was psychic over 20 years ago"><br><strong><br></strong></p>
              <p>MIA DOLAN claims she knew she was psychic from the age of 22 — and has even  helped the police on difficult cases.</p>
              <p>Mia from Kentish Town, north London, says: "I get these incredibly clear  visions, like a still photograph, in my mind.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes they are premonitions of the future. At other times they are events  that have already happened.</p>
              <p>"I had a perfectly normal childhood and my first psychic experience happened  when I was 22. It's so mundane, it makes me laugh.</p>
              <p>"I was in the living room with my children, having left the grill on in the  kitchen, when a man's voice next to me said, clear as day, 'The toast is  burning'.</p>
              <p>"I ran into the kitchen and sure enough, it was.</p>
              <p>"Then a few weeks later I was walking down the street towards a friend and the  same voice said, 'She is pregnant'.</p>
              <p>"She was — and she didn't even know yet.</p>
              <p>"Of course, this totally freaked me out. I now know this voice is what we  psychics call a guide. His name is Eric.</p>
              <p>At times, it is frightening. I have absolutely no control over it and I have  no idea why I have been chosen in this way.</p>
              <p>"I'm just an ordinary woman who grew up in a council house — my mum was a  secretary and my dad a salesman. I finally realised that this was a gift and  I had to embrace it.</p>
              <p>"I don't always predict good news. My husband and I were going through a bad  patch when I was in my early thirties and one evening, when we were having a  row, I suddenly had this psychic vision of him in bed with my friend.</p>
              <p>"It all turned out to be true and we divorced soon afterwards.</p>
              <p>"I began working with the public, doing face-to-face readings — I will never  do a telephone reading — and even working with the police on crime scenes.</p>
              <p>"In one case, a woman had gone missing and the police took me to the place  where she had last been seen.</p>
              <p>"I walked past a shop with whitened windows and I said we had to go in there.</p>
              <p>"The police kicked the door down and out the back we found a bin bag of  clothes covered in the woman's blood.</p>
              <p>"I spend my life now working with the depressed, the dying, the bereaved — people who desperately want to know what is going to happen, or trying to  make contact with a loved one who has died.</p>

              <p>"I am using my gift for a positive purpose.</p>
              <p>"Many people are sceptical but I welcome that. I'm sceptical myself, yet I can't deny what I see and hear.<br> <br>"All I do is pass on the messages I receive. <br><br>"Just think — how many of us haven't had a premonition, a sense of déjà vu? <br><br>"It's in us all, because we are part of the spirit world."</p>
