              <p id="story-continues-1" class="story-body-text story-content">WARRI,
               Nigeria —  Groups of children wandered inside, wide-eyed at the plenty.
               Teenagers and adults took selfies and group photos, raving about the 
              convenience, the security, the leisure and, not least, the 
              air-conditioning, so silent, omnipresent and soothing.</p>
              <p id="story-continues-2" class="story-body-text story-content">Some had stepped inside places like this during trips to the United States, Europe or even Nigeria’s biggest city, Lagos, which got its first one just a couple of years ago.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Others
               were “Johnny-Just-Come” first-time visitors, standing confused before 
              sensor-activated doors. They drew smiles from veterans who had already 
              been once or twice to the newest and biggest attraction in this Nigerian
               city in recent memory: a gleaming shopping mall.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“I’m
               very, very, very excited,” said John Monday, who had traveled nearly 
              200 miles to visit the mall here on a recent Saturday afternoon, as a 
              friend took a photo of him posing in front of a supermarket. “A 
              middle-class person can come into this mall and feel a sense of 
              belonging.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Delta
               Mall opened here last spring, bringing to about a dozen the number of 
              Western-style shopping malls catering to 180 million people in Nigeria, 
              Africa’s most populous nation. Many enclosed malls, anchored by 
              supermarkets and big box stores, with other tenants lining long 
              hallways, may be struggling in the United State.
               But in Nigeria, which has Africa’s biggest economy and is projected to 
              overtake the United States as the world’s third-most populous nation by 
              2050, malls are just taking off.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The
               emergence of malls — and mall culture — in Nigeria reflects broad 
              trends on the continent, including a growing middle class with spending 
              power and the rapid expansion of cities like Warri that are little known
               outside the region.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">As
               in America, malls in Nigeria have quickly become hangouts for the young
               and destinations for families. Their rarity also imbue a sense of 
              exclusivity.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Pushing
               a shopping cart full of food and the latest Chinese smartphone, Wealth 
              Mark, 22, strolled through Delta Mall with his younger sister, 
              Confidence, and her friend, Franca, all with wide smiles. Mr. Mark 
              stopped to take photos of the two young women with the smartphone, then a
               selfie of all three.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content"><img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2016/01/04/nigeriamap/32f2c5dc8327b106b02ab7de3b2603fd5c06dbd9/0105-web-NIGERIAmap-460.png" alt="" width="920" height="614"></p>
              <p id="story-continues-3" class="story-body-text story-content">“When
               I am meeting my friends here or in Lagos, we always go to the mall,” 
              said Mr. Mark, who does marketing for a bar-code company owned by an 
              older sister. “We can just spend a few hours at the mall and relax.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Even
               older Nigerians who were skeptical about paying premium prices over 
              traditional markets saw the mall’s value as a family outing.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“My
               kids enjoyed it,” said Victor Omunu, 53, adding that he would never 
              shop for himself at the mall. “I bought them ice cream. It’s not bad at 
              all, the mall. I was happy because I was with my family. I even met some
               old friends.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The
               malls, like the new cars that have replaced the beat-up tokunbos 
              (roughly, used cars) on Nigerian roads, provide visible confirmation 
              that, despite the country’s many problems, life has become materially 
              better for many in recent years. Besides shops, the malls have brought 
              leisure activities, like going to the movies and dining at food courts.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“These are things we are used to seeing outside Nigeria,” said Mr. 
              Monday, 28, a gas turbine operator, who first experienced mall culture 
              when he visited an aunt living in Scotland in his early 20s. Now, a mall
               is scheduled to open in his hometown, Uyo, late this year. “I will be 
              going there frequently,” he said.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">One of the main cities in Nigeria’s oil-producing region, Warri has 
              grown rapidly in recent years, like many other medium-size cities in the
               country. New housing developments are clustered on the outskirts.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content"><img src="http://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/05/world/05nigeria_web2/05nigeria_web2-articleLarge.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Nigeria’s
               population, which is growing and urbanizing at one of the fastest rates
               in the world, is expected to increase to 400 million from 180 million 
              by 2050,  . That would place Nigeria behind only India and China.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The
               size of Nigeria’s middle class, as well as Africa’s, varies according 
              to the definitions used. But many experts agree that Nigeria’s size and 
              population growth will drive the expansion of Africa’s middle class.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Standard
               Bank, a South African bank with branches across the continent, 
              estimated that Nigeria’s middle class grew by 600 percent from 2000 to 
              2014. While 4.1 million Nigerian households are now considered middle 
              class, or 11 percent of the total population, an additional 7.6 million 
              households would make it into that category by 2030, according to the 
              bank’s projections.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Resilient
               Africa, a South African joint venture that includes Shoprite, the 
              continent’s biggest food retailer, built the mall here. It is working on
               five other malls in other cities and looking to secure four more sites,
               said Eddie McDonald, who heads Resilient’s Nigerian operations.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“The retail trade in Nigeria is still in its infancy stage, but growing,” he said.</p>
              <p id="story-continues-6" class="story-body-text story-content">Informal
               shops, individually run, are still thriving. Street hawkers sell food, 
              clothes and home appliances on sidewalks, or wherever they can find a 
              captive audience, like Nigeria’s epic traffic jams, known as go-slows. 
              The hawkers often compete directly with the malls, selling their wares 
              to people driving into parking lots next to retailers like Game, a 
              discount superstore owned by Walmart.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content"><img src="http://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/05/world/05NIGERIA-web4/05NIGERIA-web4-articleLarge.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content"><span class="caption-text">Women in traditional outfits went to Delta Mall in Warri after a wedding.</span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“The informal Nigerian economic sector is very strong,” said Chimaraoke Izugbara, a Nigerian researcher at Nairobi, Kenya. “Even with these big shopping malls and the 
              complicated Walmart economy that has come to Nigeria, you see that some 
              upper-class people still go to the market and buy their fish from the 
              old woman on the road.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Here
               in Warri, people have traditionally bought clothes at the hundreds of 
              tiny shops in Igbo Market, named after the ethnic group that dominates 
              the business. Once a year, shop owners travel to southern China where, 
              with the help of locally based Nigerian middlemen, they buy goods and 
              ship them here.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Ebere Chukwu, 38, a shop owner since 1999, said he had been to Delta Mall with his family, but only “to feed my eyes.”</p>
              <p id="story-continues-7" class="story-body-text story-content">“That place looked like abroad, it looked like America,” he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p id="story-continues-8" class="story-body-text story-content">But Mr. Chukwu was confident that longtime customers would not desert Igbo Market for the mall. The market’s prices are cheaper.</p>
              <p id="story-continues-9" class="story-body-text story-content">Esther
               Ogbolu, who was shopping for shoes at Igbo Market, said she had found 
              the mall unaffordable, though she spoke approvingly of its 
              air-conditioning, smiling at the memory.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content"><img src="http://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/05/world/05NIGERIA-web5/05NIGERIA-web5-articleLarge.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">But
               to other businessmen, like Matthew Asegiemhe, the future lies in the 
              mall. Since opening a clothing store, Button Up, in the city five years 
              ago, he has seen sales rise 15 percent to 20 percent each year, and 
              decided to open a branch in the mall.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“Middle-class customers are increasing — that’s why,” Mr. Asegiemhe said.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Anderson
               Williams, 25, an employee at a road construction company, was on his 
              fourth trip to the mall — shopping for pants and arranging to buy a 
              leather sofa set on installment. He did not mind paying more.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“I love the mall, the whole environment entirely,” he said. “I love the AC especially.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">There
               were future consumers, too, like the seven young brothers and sisters 
              wandering through the supermarket aisles, often releasing squeals of 
              surprise and delight.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“There’s anything you want,” said Fatima Mohammed, 10. “There are shoes, medicine, there is cake, everything you want.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">At
               a ribbon-cutting ceremony at Aroma Foodland, the first restaurant to 
              open in the food court, the mall’s manager, Olushola Oni, led the group 
              in prayer, standing before a counter with meat pies, sandwiches, egusi 
              soup and pounded yam.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“This eatery will go to places in the name of Jesus,” he said to a resounding “amen.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Godwin
               Isemede and his son, Emmanuel, 7, were among the restaurant’s first 
              customers. An engineer at a cellphone company, Mr. Isemede said he would
               now buy his clothes here, not in the United States during his yearly 
              visits. He would no longer have to drive to Enugu, about 200 miles east 
              of here, to visit the mall there to please his son.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“People now have somewhere to go to in Warri,” Mr. Isemede said. “There was no life here before.”</p>
