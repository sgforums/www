              <p>An 18-year-old American boy who died on Christmas Day has garnered worldwide attention for a series of heart-breaking videos he recorded weeks before his death.</p>
                  <p>Ben Breedlove suffered from a life threatening heart condition which caused him to have multiple heart attacks in his short life.</p>
                  <p>Called ‘My story’, he recorded the video on December 18, 2011 to prepare his family and friends for his eventual passing. He uses a series of flash cards to explain why death no longer scares him.</p>
                  <p>He describes his first near death experience that happened when he was just four years old and talks about a bright light that brought him peace.</p>
                  <p><img src="http://l.yimg.com/ea/img/-/111228/benbreedlove281211_400youtube_17fllt4-17fllt5.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300"></p>
                  <p>In his most recent near death experience, he was in a room with his favourite rapper, Kid Cudi</p>
                  <p>"I couldn't stop smiling," he writes in the video, "I was proud of myself, of my entire life, everything I have done. It was the BEST feeling... I didn't want to leave that place. I wish I NEVER woke up."</p>
                  <p>His final words are: "Do you believe in Angels or God?... I Do."</p>
                  <p>On Christmas night, the young Austin school student died of a heart attack, the fourth in his short life.</p>
                  <p>His inspiring and heartbreaking story has now become a online hit, inspiring millions worldwide.</p>
                  <p>Rapper Kid Cudi wrote on his blog:</p>
                  <p><em>"Iam [sic] so sad about Ben Breedlove. I watched the video he left for the world to see, and him seeing me in detail, in his vision really warmed my heart. I broke down, Iam to tears because I hate how life is so unfair. This has really touched my heart in a way I cant describe, this is why I do what I do. Why I write my life, and why I love you all so much. Life is really fucked up sometimes, but I know Ben is at Peace, and I hope he gets a chance to sit and talk with my Dad. We love you Ben. Forever. Thank you for loving me. To Ben’s family, you raised a real hero, he’s definately [sic] mine. You have my love." — Scott Mescudi</em></p>

              <p>I believe in God. I find it strange that so many people don't believe in God. Perhaps they find it strange that there are people who believe in God becos so few people has seen Him or It. </p>
              <p>For me, God is very real becos I experienced His Presence in my life. I have seen things and felt things that are not ordinary. We came from God and we will return back to Him. We came to manifest Him on earth. This time of every year we say Happy New Year and/or  Peace on earth. What else is Peace if not God Himself. Peace is the highest achievement for humanity but it does not come easy.</p>
              <p>Cllimate change is teaching us something : Let Thy Will be done. Many think we can conquer the world with our might without sparing a thought for Mother Nature, now we know we are wrong. We have a higher Will to perform. Only then will we be truly happy. Those who do bad will never get away. It's all about timing. There is a time for everything to happen, just watch and see. </p>
              <p>Death is the beginning of life in spirit. Life is the end of death. When we are alive, we live in the living room. When we depart, we go and take rest in the bedroom. It's all in the same house. After some rest, we return to continue learning. We will come back again and again until we learn to overcome all our imperfections. The quicker we realise this and start cultivating, the earlier we complete these endless perilous journeys of rebirth, time and time again.  As I write, I just heard someone screaming outside. Life can be very painful if we dun learn the lessons fast. </p>
              <p>Bottomline is, there is God. We came to live for God, not just for ourself. We will never be happy living for our little self. We end up living a roller coster life of many ups and downs. I live for peace and I live in peace. I am not wasting my time anymore. </p>

              <p>To me, heaven is not somewhere high up in the air, it's already inside us the moment we think good and do good. Living hell is when we hate and do bad things to people and to other things around us. Like wise, God and devil are also inside us. It's our choice what we want to become. We create our own hell and heaven, it's all our own choices.  </p>
              <p>Why fear something when we know it is going to happen someday. Only those who do bad and those who dunno where they will end up, fear death. </p>
              <p>I try to live in heaven everyday, sometime i succeed, other times I failed. But those failure times are lesser and lesser now because I am more aware.  What about you?</p>
              <p>We came from Light and we shall return back to Light. Light is what we will see at departure, Light is also what I see when I meditate on peace. Light is heaven, Light is peace. We always think of Light as hope, while darkness as hopelessness. We all have light and darkness inside us. If we take the side of light, we create heaven, if we take the side of darkness, we create hell.  </p>
              <p>What is an illumined person, if not he who has totally transformed all the darkness into light? An illumined person  is a living heaven. Simple, yet not so easy to achieve because majority of us still love some darkness, in the forms of human desires. But our goal has always been Light because peace on earth is our highest aim.</p>

              <p>harmony.peace, neither am I a christian. But that does not stop me for believing in God. Peace and Light are different aspects of the formless God. God has form and God has no form and still, God is also beyond form and formlessness. When God comes as a form, He takes on a form of a Being. When God appears as formless, He comes as Light or Peace. We dun have to be a Christian( or religious) to believe in God. For God is beyond all religions.  God is just a Reality in this universe. He is just a Reality, beyond all our imagination and understanding. He is in everyone and in everything. He is everywhere and yet nowhere. You can talk to Him and He may respond to you. You can ask Him questions, and He may answer you someday or in the next moment in very mysterious ways. </p>
              <p>Just as we can't see the air we breathe, but we know air exists. Likewise, we can't deny the existence of God just because we have never seen Him. He appears to those who have faith in Him even though they have never seen Him. As for those who wants to believe only when they see Him, He will never appear to those people because He knows even if He appears, they will never believe, so why bother anyway. </p>
              <p>God is within us, He is also without us. He is everywhere, not just in the Christian church. I have encountered God because He let me do so for a reason. I am not alone in this conviction. </p>

              <p>Totally agreed with your view Urdhaytb. Very glad that there is 
              someone like you to share your insights with our dear fellow 
              Singaporeans. I have experienced the presence of God/Higher Power on 
              quite a few occasions too.</p>
              <p>Once, I was stranded when I was 
              overseas and in need of desperate help. When no help was available, I 
              prayed for help from the universe. A man drove by, stopped his car and 
              asked if I needed any assistance.</p>
              <p>Upon hearing my story (I did 
              not reveal to him that I had just prayed for help), he offered to give 
              me a lift and said "Where you want to go you let me know. God has sent 
              me to come and pick you up".</p>
              <p>When I heard what he said, I could not stop my tears<em><em> </em></em>from rolling down my cheeks. Because of what he said, I dared to hop into a total stranger's car.</p>
              <p>On
               another occasion years ago, someone very dear to me (in her teens then)
               lost a bunch of keys on her way to the market. She was reprimanded and 
              threatened not to return home if she could not find that bunch of keys. 
              She went downstairs in tears to search for the keys. I (was also in my teens then) went downstairs with her and asked if she knew where she lost it. 
              Her answer was of course in the negative. From the flat to the market is
               a long way. We went separate way to search. After some time with no 
              success, I decided to use a very sincere heart to pray for assistance 
              from a Higher Power. When I finished my prayer, I stepped upon something
               and there it is---the bunch of keys!!</p>

              <p>Love your story, harmony.peace, maybe we should be friends. Many people dun believe in God, but if the plane they are in is going to crash, you beg many of them will be paying to God like mad. </p>
              <p>God is actually very dear to us, more than our own parents. For human beings, if you do 100 things right, nobody bother to know. If you do 1 thing wrong, they want to condamn you to hell.</p>
              <p>With God, it is the opposite. If you commit 100 bad deeds and just do one good thing, He will bless you for that one good thing and forgive you for all the 100 wrong deeds.</p>
              <p>I feel God as peace during my meditation. Sometimes even with my eyes closed, I see Him as Light. He is my guiding light and always come and give my advices when I need them. Sometimes when I can't find anyone to help me with my social projects, I called God to help me and the next moment, I get many ideas what to do.  </p>
              <p> We really came from God and we are going back to Him. We came to manifest Him in on earth in the forms of kindness and goodness. We become Godlike when we are good. If only we can surrender our egos to Him and let Him use us as His divine instruments, then there will be no climate change and adverse flooding as we see today.  All these climate change is teaching humanity one lesson: we must not take Mother Earth for granted. Mother earth is none other than God. </p>

              <p>In many internet forums, the question about the existence God always seem to appear. People are so curious whether there is really a living Being called God. Endless upon endless quarreling over this question.</p>
              <p>I can only say one thing. First, you must have some faith that there is really a God. That is the first requirement. But that you can't see Him or It.  But somehow you feel inside your heart, there is really something out there. No matter what happen out there in the world, just believe everything has a reason beyond your understanding and just leave it as it is. </p>
              <p>And just pray to Him or It, for guidence. If you pray to see Him or It, that will never happen. He dun come to you just for your curiosity sake. He has more urgent things to do.</p>
              <p>And somehow someday, you will get your answers in very miraculous ways. God long for us more than we can ever understand. He long for us because we embody His dreams on earth. Peace on earth is not only our dream, it is also His. </p>
