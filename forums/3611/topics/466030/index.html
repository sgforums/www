              <p style="list-style: none; border: 0px; outline: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The 36-year-old mom, who now goes by the <em style="list-style: none; border: 0px; outline: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; box-sizing: border-box;">nom de guerre </em>“Guevara,” stalks Syria’s urban battlegrounds with a traditional scarf on her head and a Belgian FN sniper rifle in her hand.</p>
              <p style="list-style: none; border: 0px; outline: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">She has so far put bullets in at least four of Assad’s thugs, according to a new report.</p>
              <p style="list-style: none; border: 0px; outline: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“It makes you feel good. Whenever I hit one, I shout, ‘Yes!’ ” Guevara told The Telegraph of London.</p>
              <p style="list-style: none; border: 0px; outline: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">

              <p style="list-style: none; border: 0px; outline: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em;">“I said, ‘My boy, I promise that I am going to defend your future,’ ” Guevara said. “Now, I will not forget my children’s blood and I promise to take revenge.”</p>
              <p style="list-style: none; border: 0px; outline: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em;">With cold calculation, Guevara reportedly waits for government soldiers to pass into her sight line while hiding out in the ravaged buildings of Aleppo, Syria’s largest city.</p>
              <p style="list-style: none; border: 0px; outline: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em;">“I think I have killed soldiers,” she told the paper. “You can never be 100 percent sure that they are dead, but I have hit them at least four or five times.”</p>
              <p style="list-style: none; border: 0px; outline: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em;">Wearing a traditional hajib along with a camouflage jacket, Guevara is a rare female soldier in a conservative Muslim society.</p>
              <p style="list-style: none; border: 0px; outline: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em;">The rage-filled mom takes pleasure in extracting her vengeance by taking aim at the hated dictator’s henchmen.</p>
              <p style="list-style: none; border: 0px; outline: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em;">She has a history of activism. While attending Aleppo University, she helped create an underground newspaper, the Telegraph said.</p>
              <p style="list-style: none; border: 0px; outline: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em;">Originally from the Palestinian territories, Guevara reportedly learned how to use a weapon at a training facility in Lebanon run by the militant organization Hamas.</p>
              <p style="list-style: none; border: 0px; outline: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em;">She also helped organize a political party for Palestinians who sought the overthrow of Assad’s regime and took part in the Syrian protest during the Arab Spring movement that swept across the region.</p>
              <p style="list-style: none; border: 0px; outline: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em;">The warrior left her first husband because of his tepid support for the revolution.</p>
              <p style="list-style: none; border: 0px; outline: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em;">Her new husband, the commander of her rebel brigade, taught her how to be a sniper.</p>
              <p style="list-style: none; border: 0px; outline: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3em;">“I like fighting,” she said. “I have the strength to hold a gun, so why can’t I fight?”</p>

              <p>its a loop, and the problem sometimes is not who is the good guys who is the bad guy.  the people she killed. they have mothers also. and you sure those people  are evil in nature?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the people who fly the plane drop the bomb, maybe it stheir intel not accurate or orders given to just bomb the place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>killing 4 is nothing to be proud of, easpecially when 4 were taken down in different scenerio and its was a suprised attack.</p>

              <p>4 rounds, 4 kills, then hurray! who its okay, we know sniping is not an easy task.</p>

              <p>a life for a life? this is very extreme.</p>
              <p>its not just a religion, unless they want to make it that way. its a country and lives of many people. unless blood is all they crave, then in a moden day society many times religion has t be put aside or relook into to fit into a new modernize way of life.</p>

              That place in the middle east has been a war torn area or trouble part of the world eversince for over 2000 thousand years now because mainly of religion.
              
              As the existence of Syria or other countries in the middle east, it would not have existed if the British hadn't divided the middle east after WW1, after the fall of the Turkish Empire which was called the Ottoman Empire. This division happened because of the existence of oil in the middle east. The Arab leaders became greedy with their new found wealth and started to divide themselves....mistakes done by the Britishs and Americans, and others who were greedy for wealth in those countries in the middle east in the last century.

              What you say is also true because in the Arabs world, they have many tribes with tribe leaders. As Moslems, they were taught in the Islamic teaching that a Moslem shouldn't kill another Moslem. However, as you can see Money and Wealth can kill that Islamic Brotherhood Bond. The Arabs didn't know the worth of their land rich oil under the ground until the invention of the automobiles in early part of last century. Thencefore, they started to divide and the strongest Arab clan and family became the ruler, kings or dictators of their divided Arab world. Hence, as you can see now due to that reason, the common Arabs who are ruled by these so called dictators Arab leaders wanted for more freedom and changed within their countries....which I see is a good thing actually. About these Arab Moslem women, they are brought up in the Islamic teachings so as you can see now, there are also Jihad Moslem female suicide bombers now in those trouble Islamic countries in the middle east, Pakistan, Afghanistan etc...and will not be surprised too should Indonesia and Malaysia have such Moslem females with extreme ideas now or in the future. Many Islamic countries too are at war with each other just because of their Islamic sectorian belief differences like Sunis and Shites, killing each other for that reasons.
