              <p>New DelhiÂ  - It's early morning but already "Medicine Baba" 
              Omkarnath Sharma is pounding the pavement in one of New Delhi's upscale 
              neighbourhoods, collecting the wellheeled's leftover pills, capsules and
               syrups.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_861">Like a modern-day town crier, the
               79-year-old calls to residents to bring out their medicines, rather 
              than throw them away, to donate to the Indian capital's millions of 
              desperate poor.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1105">"All of us 
              have some medicines lying around in our houses but we end up throwing 
              them in the dustbin," said Sharma, whose affectionate title means wise 
              man.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1372">Sharma is hopeful his 
              unorthodox service is making a difference, albeit small, in a country 
              where 65 percent of the population lacks regular access to essential 
              medicines, according to the World Health Organisation.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1370">In
               his trademark bright orange smock, Sharma cuts a familiar figure in 
              Delhi's leafy neighbourhoods, and residents routinely carry out handfuls
               of medicines for him.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1374">"This 
              idea struck me a few years back when I saw how the poor struggled to buy
               medicines. When I first started, I was ridiculed and called a beggar 
              but now people respect what I am doing," he said.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1409">Medical treatment is free in 
              Indian government-funded hospitals, but drug supplies at their 
              dispensaries run out, forcing patients to fork out for medicines at 
              nearby chemists.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1407">Overburdened
               public hospitals blame a lack of resources, saying they can only budget
               a certain amount for medicines, with funding stretched across the 
              board.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1405">- Mothers clutch sick babies -</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1418">At his rundown Delhi home, 
              Sharma painstakingly checks and sorts his haul that includes everything 
              from calcium tablets to antibiotics, before the queues form outside.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1420">"Some
               medicines have to be stocked in the fridge, so I have to be very 
              careful," said Sharma, a retired blood bank technician. "All these 
              medicines lying here are worth more than two million rupees ($30,864)."</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1430">India spends just 1.3 percent of
               its gross domestic product (GDP) on health, according to a 2013 World 
              Bank report, lower than war-torn Afghanistan on 1.7 percent.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1447">"The
               health care costs have increased greatly over the years," said doctor 
              S.L. Jain, as he examined a newborn at his charity clinic that receives 
              some of Sharma's medicines.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1449">"So many people do not seek 
              treatment simply because they do not have the money to pay for 
              medicines," he said as mothers line up clutching their sick babies.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1486">More than 60 percent of the population's out of pocket expenses for health are for medicines, according to government estimates.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1484">With
               her carpenter husband earning just 5,000 rupees ($77) a month, 
              mother-of-four Pushpa Kamal fears for the future of her family as she 
              waits at the clinic for treatment.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1536">"My youngest son has asthma. He 
              needs regular medication. The other kids also fall sick. Tell me how can
               I afford to buy so many medicines each time?"</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1525">India's
               generic drugs industry is a major supplier to the world of cheap, 
              life-saving treatments for diabetes, hypertension, cancer and other 
              diseases.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1545">But experts say even these are 
              out of reach of many of the 363 million Indians living below the poverty
               line, who make up about 30 percent of the country's mammoth population.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1552">"There
               are hardly any checks and balances because health is unfortunately not a
               priority in our country," said Ajay Lekhi, president of the Delhi 
              Medical Association.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1550">"Consumers
               are highly vulnerable as their requirement is urgent and they are not 
              in a position to compare prices or bargain," he told AFP.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1554">- Universal health plan -</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1548">Prime
               Minister Narendra Modi, who swept to power at elections last May, 
              promised in his poll manifesto to introduce an ambitious universal 
              health care plan that assures free drugs and insurance for serious 
              ailments.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1556">But the plan, 
              pegged initially at $26 billion over the next four years and envisioned 
              to be fully operational by 2019, has been pushed back because of budget 
              constraints.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1595">A senior health ministry official said the scheme, with a planned roll out from April this year, was now on the back burner.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1593">"It
               (the plan) could have been a game-changer," he told AFP on the 
              condition of anonymity. "We are not sure now if it will see the light of
               the day."</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1591">Jagdish Prasad, 
              director general of health services, acknowledged the problem facing 
              those living on the margins, and that the government needed to do more.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1597">"People
               are spending 60 to 70 percent out of their pockets for purchasing 
              medicines which is a great burden for the poor," he told AFP.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1447237389778_1599">"(We) must make a policy so that essential medicines are made available to those who cannot afford it."</p>
