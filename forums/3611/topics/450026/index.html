              <p>Police in Maryland, US, spotted the caped crusader whizzing through traffic in his swish black 'Batmobile' Lamborghini Gallardo, which did not have any number plates.</p>
              <p>When they pulled him over, it turned out to be businessman Lenny Robinson, who moonlights as Batman, on his way to a charity gig at Georgetown University Hospital.</p>
              <p>In the footage, the officers are seen asking the iconic DC comics hero to pose for pictures beside his vehicle.</p>
              <p><img src="http://cinegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/batman_arrested1.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Station chiefs later posted the snaps on Facebook — along with a statement which read: "Yes, Batman was stopped by officers on Wednesday, March 21, on southbound Route 29 at Prelude Drive, Silver Springs, for no tags on Batmobile."</p>
              <p>More than 1300 people have so far "liked" the page, which has been shared by over 1200 people.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span>‘The car was registered, and the man explained that he goes to hospitals and does work with kids (while in costume),’ Capt. Stark explained.</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>But it would appear he was short for a changing room – the Lamborghini is usually the vehicle of choice for Batman’s alter-ego, Bruce Wayne.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>Capt. Stark said that Mr Robinson was not charged. ‘They had a discussion about the law, and he let him fly so to speak,’ he said.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span>‘The police officer and Batman had a discussion, and he said next time, get it right,’ Capt. Stark said.</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span>The precinct released pictures of the unusual event on both their </span><span>Facebook </span><span>and </span><span>Twitter </span><span>pages.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>As for the reason why he didn’t have plates in? Capt. Stark speculated that Mr Robinson didn’t want to ‘ruin the effect’ of being Batman – thus going completely method.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>A tipster told Jalopnik that the plate’s screws simply would not fit with the luxury car.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>The Montgomery police tweeted that the ‘batmobile was not towed.’</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>Mr Robinson, it seems, loves showing up in public dressed as the Dark Knight. </span></p>
              <p><span><br></span></p>
              <p><span>From the look of his Facebook page, the business owner often makes appearances, and especially loves brightening young children’s days.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>This isn’t the first issue the erstwhile Batman has faced. Last Halloween, his car got a flat tire as he was again driving to a Washington-area hospital to visit sick children.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>He posed with Howard County Police Department’s Brandon Stickles, one of the officers who responded to the call.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>Mr Robinson still managed to get to the hospital, thanks to a ride from a friend.</span></p>
