              <p>A friendly sulphur-crested cockatoo just reached a huge milestone — 
              his 100th birthday. Fred was the bird of honor over the weekend at his 
              home on a wildlife sanctuary in Tasmania where he was celebrated with a 
              party.     </p>
              <p>The species, native to Australia, is known to live a remarkerbly long time<a class="checked-link" href="http://www.smh.com.au/environment/animals/sydneys-old-crock-of-a-cockie-was-a-legend-at-120-20110831-1jkz2.html"></a> — but Fred is still going strong well past the 40-year life span these birds typically live in the wild.</p>
              <p>According to ABC, Fred was rescued by staff at the Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary
               outside of Hobart after the death of his owner two decades earlier. At 
              that point, the already-elderly bird had spent most of his life in 
              captivity, so it was decided that he’d live out his days under their 
              care.</p>
              <p>Since then, Fred has become something of a sanctuary celebrity — proofed by the adoring crowds that turned out for his party.</p>
              <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.rbl.ms/402534/980x.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="720"></p>
              <p>Sanctuary director Greg Irons told Daily Mail Australia that Fred’s age isn’t know for certain, but that chances are he actually became a centenarian a few years back.</p>
              <p>“We
               aren't 100 percent sure but we think that he is well past,” he said. 
              “He was 95-years-old when I started working, which was 10 years ago — we
               just waited a bit longer to make sure he is past 100.”</p>
              <p>But all the attention devoted to Fred on his birthday was for more than just a celebration. The sanctuary, whose focus is on rescuing, rehabilitating and releasing back to wildlife,
               also used the occasion to remind guests that they should give a second 
              thought to keeping sulphur-crested cockatoos as pets, as they require a 
              lifelong commitment.</p>
              <p>Fortunately for Fred, even after outliving his owner, he’s still surrounded by many folks who care.</p>
