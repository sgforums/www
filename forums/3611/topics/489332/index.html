              <p id="story-continues-1" class="story-body-text story-content">MARAJÓ
               ISLAND, Brazil —  Legends flourish about how the first Asian water 
              buffaloes made it to this colossal island in the Amazon River Delta.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">One
               tale holds that they originally came from the steamy rice fields of 
              French Indochina, but washed up here after the wreck of a ship bound for
               French Guiana. Another yarn contends that inmates escaping from a penal colony in French Guiana used the adroitly swimming buffaloes to help guide their makeshift barges all the way to freedom in Marajó’s mangroves.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">However
               they arrived, the invasive species multiplied on Marajó, and now 
              numbers about 450,000 on an island the size of Switzerland. So much of 
              daily life here revolves around the water buffaloes that islanders haul 
              garbage with them, race them during festivals and regularly savor 
              fillets of buffalo steak smothered in cheese made from, yes, buffalo 
              milk.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“The importance of the buffalo in Marajó got us thinking,” said Maj. 
              Francisco Nóbrega, 41, an official with the 8th Battalion of the 
              military police of Pará, the vast state in Brazil’s Amazon that encompasses Marajó. “Why not patrol on buffalo as well?”</p>
              <p id="story-continues-3" class="story-body-text story-content">Seizing on that idea, one of Brazils most unusual policing experiments came into existence. Water buffaloes have been domesticated elsewhere for thousand of years,
               called “the living tractor of the East” for their role in plowing 
              fields, but officers with the 8th Battalion here hatched a plan to make 
              their rounds atop the crescent-horned beasts.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Once
               a year, the battalion even places its buffaloes and police officers on a
               ship to Belém, the capital of Pará, where each Sept. 7 they strut down 
              avenues in parades commemorating Brazil’s declaration of independence 
              from Portugal.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The
               buffalo unit started in the 1990s, patrolling the sleepy outpost of 
              Soure, which has about 23,000 people, and breaking up the occasional bar
               fight.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Over the years, the mission has expanded to include pursuing suspects who flee into Marajó’s wilds and cracking down on buffalo rustling on the island’s far-reaching ranches.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“Water
               buffaloes are remarkable swimmers, better than dogs, and more agile 
              than horses when it comes to moving through mud,” said José Ribamar 
              Marques, an official on Marajó with Embrapa, the pin
               Brazilian research company that focuses on tropical ranching and 
              agriculture. “The animal is also docile, facilitating its contact with 
              human beings.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Indeed, the buffaloes of Marajó have certain advantages.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Their
               widely splayed hooves allow them to move with relative ease through 
              muddy swamps. They also seem to deal well with the punishing heat of 
              Marajó, which sits almost directly on the Equator.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Several
               breeds thrive on Marajó, like the Murrah, prized for its meat and milk,
               and the Carabao, known for its sickle-shaped horns. (Asian water 
              buffaloes differ from the American buffalo, which is a bison<a href="http://www.livescience.com/32115-bison-vs-buffalo-whats-the-difference.html">,</a> despite its name.)</p>
              <p id="story-continues-4" class="story-body-text story-content">And there is another benefit of using water buffaloes in police work, some officials say: It helps lower tensions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p id="story-continues-5" class="story-body-text story-content">“This
               is the kind of place where everybody knows everybody’s business,” said 
              Claudio Vitelli, 45, a police officer who regularly patrols on a 
              buffalo. “I’ve had to arrest an uncle of mine for a petty offense, and 
              before that, a cousin.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“Being the guy on the buffalo makes me more approachable, making my job a little bit easier,” he added.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Brazil’s
               military police are somewhat akin to state police in the United States,
               in the sense that they are controlled by state governments. But the 
              forces are imbued with militarized traditions, like wearing combat 
              fatigues, and their heavy-handed policing methods have produced an array
               of rights abuses, including forced disappearances and killing of people presumed to be innocent.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Despite
               its laid-back vibe, this island is no stranger to the ire produced by 
              such episodes. After a police officer fatally shot a man in 2011 in São 
              Sebastião da Boa Vista, a town on Marajó,furious residents<a href="http://www.orm.com.br/amazoniajornal/interna/default.asp?modulo=831&amp;codigo=552643"></a> freed the prisoners in the local jail, burned<a href="http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2011/09/973624-moradores-depredam-batalhao-da-pm-e-saqueiam-delegacia-no-para.shtml"></a> the police station to the ground and sent police officers fleeing to other parts of the island.</p>
              <p id="story-continues-6" class="story-body-text story-content">In
               the town of Soure, where the 8th Battalion operates from a small 
              station adjacent to a corral with about 10 buffaloes, police officers 
              claim that patrolling on the animals can assuage tension with residents 
              by bringing low-ranking personnel in the military police, commonly 
              called soldiers, into contact with people who use buffaloes for 
              transportation, farming or other work.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The policing experiment has drawn interest elsewhere in the country. Piaui, a highbrow magazine in Rio de Janeiro, called the unit Brazil’s “Buffalo Soldiers,” a riff on Bob Marley’s raggae class<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMUQMSXLlHM"></a> and the song’s inspiration, the African-American regiments of the American West in the 19th century. (The American soldiers rode horses, however, not buffaloes.)</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Some on Marajó appreciate the attention.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“Few
               people know how important our buffaloes truly are, but our police are 
              raising awareness,” said Antenor Penante, 30, the manager of a 
              family-owned tannery, who proudly described how his business uses the 
              dried penises of water buffaloes to make horse whips and riding crops.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“We
               don’t waste any part of the buffalo,” said Mr. Penante, pointing to a 
              collection of purses made from buffalo scrotums in his tannery’s store. 
              “Marajó should be proud of its herds.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Though
               water buffaloes can be found elsewhere in Brazil, other police forces 
              seem to have avoided using the animals for policing.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Still,
               officers in the 8th Battalion say they are prepared to lend their 
              buffalo expertise to interested parties, mentioning the Brazilian Army’s
               respected Jungle Warfare Instruction Centre,
               which sent instructors here to learn how to use Asian water buffaloes 
              to replace mules and horses for supplying troops in the rain forest.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“Brazil
               is a tropical country, and that means we have to find tropical 
              solutions for the challenges we face,” said Emerson Cassiano, 42, a 
              police officer in the buffalo unit.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“My
               friends tease me, saying a buffalo is only good for cutting up into 
              steaks, but that’s an ignorant point of view,” Mr. Cassiano added. “Look
               what people have accomplished since they started riding horses instead 
              of eating them. Our buffalo patrol could be the start of something 
              huge.”</p>
