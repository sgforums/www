              <h1>'I'm at peace with it': Bride-to-be paralysed in pool accident at her hen party to marry a year later in her wheelchair<br></h1>
              <ul style="font-weight: bold;">
              <li>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Friend who caused freak accident by shoving her into pool will still be her bridesmaid  </span></p>
              </li>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Her father will push her down the aisle to wed man who waited for her to heal<br></span></p>
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">A bride-to-be who was paralysed after her friend pushed her into a swimming pool at her hen party 14 months ago will finally get to say 'I do</span>'.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Rachelle Friedman, 25, from Knightdale, North Carolina, will wear the same gown she had chosen for the first ceremony, but her father will push her wheelchair down the aisle instead of walking her down it, arm-in-arm.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">And the friend who shoved her into the shallow pool, causing her to hit the concrete bottom and paralysing her, will still be at her side as a bridesmaid at the wedding on Friday.</span></p>
              <p><br><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/07/18/article-2016095-0D0EC78900000578-436_634x423.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="423"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Finally saying 'I do': Rachelle Friedman, seen here trying on her wedding dress, was paralysed after a freak accident that postponed her wedding plans</span></p>
              <p><br><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/07/18/article-2016095-0D0EC7BA00000578-470_634x421.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="421"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Steadfast friend: The 25-year-old has refused to reveal the identity of the bridesmaid that shoved her into a pool, an accident that left her in a wheelchair</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The 25-year-old has stuck by her friend and refused to reveal her identity even as newspapers, television and Internet sites carried the story around the world.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">As a tailor altered her strapless, simple wedding dress to fit her new, thinner body, Miss Friedman refused to blame her bridesmaid.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">She said: 'She was tragically hurt, mentally and emotionally. And I was tragically hurt, physically. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'It's harder to deal with when you're hurt emotionally sometimes than when you're hurt physically.'</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Miss Friedman was injured while celebrating with her friends in Virginia Beach, Virginia, on May 23, 2010</span>, <span style="font-size: x-small;">a month before she was supposed to be married.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">After being pushed into the pool, she awkwardly hit the cement bottom. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">She knew immediately something was wrong.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I instantly just stopped moving,' Miss Friedman said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">She floated to the top, face up. Her friends were already in the water to help. 'This isn't a joke,' she told them. 'Call 911.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The horseplay was no different from the way her friends had fooled around many times before, she said. Miss Friedman refuses to even call the act a prank because that would imply some devious intent.</span></p>
              <p><br><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/07/18/article-2016095-0D0EC80D00000578-739_634x423.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="423"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Adjusting to change: Miss Friedman has learned how to play wheelchair rugby and uses her knuckles instead of her fingers for texting and responding to email</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'People look at it like this is something that happened to me, but it happened to both of us,' she said of her friend.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Neither she nor her fiancé, Chris Chapman, ever considered deserting the other. They'd been together for almost five years when the accident happened.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'It was not, "What am I going to do?'" said Mr Chapman, 28, a middle school science teacher. 'It was, "What are we doing to do?" I just didn't know what to do next. It was one step at a time.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The two grew up in Virginia Beach, but didn't meet until they were both students at East Carolina University in Greenville, becoming close friends while each dated other people. Once they started dating, he fell in love with her energy and personality.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'She was always positive, always upbeat, always ready to do something,' he said. <br></span></p>
              <p><br><br><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/07/18/article-2016095-0D10470200000578-362_306x584.jpg" alt="" width="306" height="584"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Before the accident: Rachelle Friedman poses with fiancé Chris Chapman. The couple will be married on Friday<br></span></p>
              <p><br></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Now, Mr Chapman worries about keeping her active. He's learning to referee at wheelchair rugby, and she's trying to get a hand cycle so they can bicycle together. She also wants to learn wheelchair tennis.</span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Before she was injured, Miss Friedman was a programme co-ordinator at a senior centre in Raleigh. While the job didn't pay a lot, she felt blessed to be employed right out of college, to own a home with the man of her dreams and to be planning their wedding.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">She often visits the senior centre where she used to work and does whatever exercises she can at home. She has finished a round of rehab, but is considering more advanced treatment.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Beatles fan wants a tattoo of the peace sign drawn on the back of her neck, at the centre, marking her injury. Underneath will be inked, 'Let It Be.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'It symbolises that I'm at peace with it,' she said.</span></p>
