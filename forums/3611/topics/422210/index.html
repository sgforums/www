              <p>(CBS)  <em>If you're a cookie lover, you know there's something special about cookies baked by mom. It must be the love mothers put into them. <strong>CBS News correspondent Mark Strassmann </strong>reports the cookies baked by one Atlanta mom contain plenty of love - and one other special ingredient: hope. </em></p>
              <p>Laura Stachler and her daughter Susan have built a gourmet cookie business one sheet of gingersnaps at a time. They discovered their recipe for success quite by accident, during their family's darkest moments. Seven years ago, Laura's husband had cancer. Susan, then a college senior, was also diagnosed with cancer, the same cancer her aunt Susan had died from years earlier. <br><br>"I was going home to do chemo and radiation," Susan said. "It was definitely not the easiest thing to take in."</p>
              <p>Susan and her father even went through cancer treatment together. <br><br>"Now my husband, now it's my child," Laura said. "It's too much. I can't do it."</p>

              <p><strong>A bag of Susansnaps is delivered by Susan Stachler Robbins.</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>Rather than feel helpless, Laura baked gingersnaps. Ginger is known to soothe upset stomachs, often a side effect during chemotherapy. <br><br>What began as a mother's love became an inspiration for a family business. Today, they make more than cookies. They make some very special deliveries - of comfort and hope - to sick patients in hospitals.</p>
              <p>When we visited Laura and Susan, they were bringing cookies to St Joseph's Hospital<strong><span style="color: #1968b2;"> </span></strong>in Atlanta, where Susan went through her treatment. <br><br>Dave Fronk, a patient, said, "The ability to talk to them and share with them, to know this is going to be OK. We're going to get through it." <br><br>"Life does go on," Susan tells some of the patients. "One day it's all going to be different."</p>
              <p>Susan is now 29 and cancer-free. <br><br>"People don't expect cancer to look like Susan," Laura said. "So that in itself reminds them that if this young girl can do it, then I can too." <br><br>Some days, they bake up to 10,000 cookies a day and ship them nationwide. <br><br>"It's almost overwhelming," Susan said. "People will call and say 'It's the only thing I can eat'." <br><br>Their gingersnaps are aptly called Susansnaps  - honoring one Susan's recovery and another Susan's memory. <br><br>"She would be very proud," Susan said of her aunt. "Very, very proud of my mom." <br><br>Proud of the secret ingredient in every Susansnap: kindness.</p>
