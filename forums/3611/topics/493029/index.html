              <p>KANDHAMAL, India — Sampati Kahanra, a woman from the Kandha tribal 
              people of eastern India, has a deep connection with the forest. From as 
              long as she can remember, she has been walking in the dense greenery to 
              find food, firewood and leaves. It started when she was a child going 
              out with her mother, and now continues for her own home and three 
              children. Up at dawn, Kahanra, 48, quickly finishes her chores and then 
              with a few others, heads to the jungle. Together, the women forage for 
              bhalia seeds (an indigenous wheat), tamarind, nutritive mahua flowers 
              and, most important, huge siali leaves.</p>
              <p>Back by noon with her 
              collection, Kahanra sits down to stitch together homemade plates from 
              the leaves. It is time-consuming work, and she gets tired sitting for 
              long hours on the floor of her thatch-roof hut, binding the leaves 
              together. But Kahanra knows that this work brings in much-needed money 
              for her family.</p>
              <p>Making plates from siali leaves is a tradition in 
              India. Until last year, Kahanra made a pittance from the sale of plates 
              to local traders, but today, thanks to an Indian-German venture that 
              exports the biodegradable leaf plates internationally, Kahanra’s monthly
               income has grown 10 times, to the rupee equivalent of almost $45. As 
              export of the plates has grown in recent years, three federations of 
              self-help groups in the area are benefiting from this project, which has
               given a whole new meaning to this home-based work by tribal women.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.thebetterindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/INDp822c.jpg" alt="" width="4608" height="3072"></p>
              <p>“There
               was a time when we used to get 10 or 12 rupees [about 15 or 16 cents] 
              for a bundle of 80 plates,” Kahanra said. “The money was not 
              commensurate with the effort involved. But ever since I joined a 
              self-help group, I have been able to secure a better price from the 
              traders in the large market around five kilometers from here.”</p>
              <p>A 
              neighbor and fellow group member, Ashumati Kahanra, agreed, saying: 
              “Fact is, that before we formed the self-help group we had no bargaining
               powers. Most of us were forced to accept the poor rates that the 
              traders would offer us. Those days are well behind us.”</p>
              <p>What changed the rules of engagement with traders was an intervention
               initiated by Vasundhara, a nonprofit research and policy advocacy group
               in Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha, where the women live. The group 
              works on issues of environmental conservation and livelihood creation 
              for the rural poor.</p>
              <p>“We have been working to create awareness 
              around the Forest Rights Act [of] 2006, among communities that depend on
               the forest for their sustenance,” said Manmohan Barik, the Vasundhara 
              program officer in Kandhamal.</p>
              <p><img src="http://shibanisachdeva.org/images/Sal_Plate.png" alt="" width="315" height="225"></p>
              <p>“[The forest act] enables them to 
              set up and run enterprises using forest produce,” he said. “Tribal women
               like Sampati, Ashumati and many others have benefited immensely. Being 
              part of a group has not only improved their income but has also enabled 
              them to collect forest produce responsibly. They understand that if the 
              forests survive, then so do they.”</p>
              <p>The forest act puts the 
              ownership rights of small-scale forest produce in the hands of the 
              village and gives it the authority to issue permits that enable the 
              transit and sale of products by local people. This has opened up 
              possibilities for the tribal people to reach buyers directly. As a 
              result, with the assistance of Vasundhara, 33 women from eight villages 
              joined to set up a self-help group in 2015. “The forest is ours, and our
               livelihood is directly linked to the resources we can gather from it,” 
              the women say.</p>
              <p>“Siali is a vine that grows in abundance in a 
              forest of sal trees,” said Rashmita Bindhani, 22, secretary of the local
               group and one of the few tribal women in the area who is educated. She 
              handles the group’s accounts and negotiates with the traders.</p>
              <p>“Its
               lush leaves are large and durable, and for generations we have used 
              them to make plates and bowls for household use as well as to sell,” she
               said. “Earlier, we used go individually to the market to sell our 
              wares, but nowadays the traders have started coming to us. Through our 
              association with Vasundhara, we have learned a better technique of 
              stitching the leaf plates.”</p>
              <p>The partnership with the German 
              company, Leaf Republic, which retails biodegradable tableware across the
               world, appealing to environmentally conscious buyers, has been the big 
              game changer, said Chittaranjan Pani, the Vasundhara forest researcher 
              and program coordinator.</p>
              <p>“Leaf Republic’s India division, Bilotech
               Plant Materials Pvt. Ltd., was scouting for leaf-based biodegradable 
              products when they got in touch with us,” Pani continued. “After several
               rounds of discussions, an agreement was signed last September between 
              the women from the self-help groups in three districts and the Germans. 
              Thereafter, we organized training programs to teach them an improved 
              technique of stitching the plates so that they could deliver a quality 
              product. So far, collectively, the women have supplied nearly one lakh 
              [100,000] Siali leaf plates.”</p>
              <p>Collecting and processing the leaves
               remains the same. After leaves are gathered, they are left to dry in 
              the sun for around three days before the women sit down to sew. The one 
              big difference is the stitch they use. “The training has definitely 
              helped us,” Sampati Kahanra said. “We collect the better quality leaves 
              and then make sturdier stitches so that the end product is up to 
              standards.”</p>
              <p>For these industrious tribal women, however, their 
              relationship with the forest is not one-sided. They also believe in 
              giving back. Putting things in perspective, Rambhabati Kanhara, another 
              woman in the group, talks about the challenges they face.</p>
              <p>“Bad 
              weather conditions are playing havoc with our forest,” she said. “A few 
              months ago, during the summer season, a fire broke out in the siali 
              forests nearby, and we all suffered huge losses. The erratic rains, too,
               bring their own set of problems. For instance, the humidity is perfect 
              for caterpillars and other insects to thrive. They spoil the leaves. If 
              we have to continue to derive our livelihood from the trees, then we 
              have to find a way to protect them.”</p>
              <p>To save their forest, the 
              women’s group in the Kandhamal district, where Sampati Kahanra lives and
               works, has decided to take some important steps. “We are going to start
               planting more saplings in the forest and also keep an eye on who all 
              are accessing the forest produce, so that there is no indiscriminate 
              exploitation,” she said. The group plans to set up a warehouse where the
               women can come to make the products and store them safely.</p>
              <p>“In 
              this way,” she added, “we will ensure that there is minimal wastage, 
              which will positively impact the forest as we will not unnecessarily 
              keep going back for more leaves.”</p>
              <p>Pani of Vasundhara noted: “As 
              eco-friendly products gain ground nationally and internationally, it 
              creates a win-win situation for all. That’s because while this gives 
              forest dwellers a fighting chance at building a better life for 
              themselves, instinctively these communities are bound to defend their 
              habitat.”</p>
