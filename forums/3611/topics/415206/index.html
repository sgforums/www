              <p><strong>KEZI) Brother and sister Howard and Janice Partridge, 61, were found safely early Friday afternoon after spending two nights out in the cold, stuck in a snowbank off the road</strong>.</p>

              <p><strong>SWEET HOME, Ore</strong>. -- It was a happy ending after two Sweet Home siblings spent two nights stuck in a snow bank.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The two were found Friday after the 73-year-old man rode his motorized wheelchair three miles down the road until he found help.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Brother and sister Howard and Janice Partridge, 61, were found safely early Friday afternoon after spending two nights out in the cold, stuck in a snowbank off the road.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It happened near Chandler Mountain just east of Sweet Home where the two were out admiring the changing foliage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We weren't expecting snow, and we went a little too far before we realized how deep it was.  He let up on the gas a bit and it slid and that's all it took, and we ended up in a ditch," said Janice Partridge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the Partridges say they were never worried.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"A full tank of gas and food to eat and water to drink, we weren't in any danger any time, just stuck," said Howard Partridge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And they never lost faith.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We just did a lot of praying because we believe God handles everything, and I asked God for the weather to warm up and it went up to 35 (degrees) and stayed at 35 all the time we were there," Janice Partridge said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The two were rescued by a hunter after Howard rode his wheelchair three miles down the road to look for help.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"He had a big Ford pickup.  He hooked on us and pulled us out in, like, five minutes flat," Janice said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After two days of searching, family members say they're just happy to see the brother and sister alive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Really relieved and excited, I mean she's just like my mother, so it was really hard to go through it," said Emma Partridge, niece.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Linn County Sheriff's deputies say people should see this as a warning when heading out into wild areas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It's critical for people to let somebody know when they're going to depart and when they're going to return and exactly where they're going to go," said Joe Larsen, Linn County Search and Rescue Coordinator.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the Partridges say they've learned their lesson.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We will never go in the snow again," Janice said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sheriff's deputies say although the two were found safe, this is a perfect example of what could happen in Oregon's unexpected weather.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They recommend if you do go out in the woods, you should bring a cell phone and plenty of food and water just in case.</p>
