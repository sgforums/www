              <p><span>Father of three Dan Toombs always guaranteed his children a hot reception when they got home - because he fed his family curry every day for a YEAR.</span></p>
              <p><span>Dan, 47, began making his own Indian dishes after becoming fed up paying out for takeaways.</span></p>
              <p><span>The family even had turkey with spices and </span><span>Bombay potatoes on Christmas Day and now they love their Madras and korma treats.</span></p>

              <p><span>The festive recipe was one of the 365 the merchandising boss had challenged himself to cook. He even launched a blog of his progress and now has 30,000 followers on Twitter.</span></p>
              <p><span>Dan, who lives with his wife Caroline, 40, and their three children Katy, 15, Joe, 13, and Jennifer, nine, </span><span>claims his recipes are much healthier than takeaway versions and none of his family has put on any weight in the last year.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;"><span>He was born in California but moved to Britain 18 years ago and</span><span> developed a taste for curry while visiting takeaways and Indian restaurants near his home <br></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;"><span>Dan said: 'It started out as a hobby but then I got to a point where I wanted to learn more and become better at cooking Indian food.</span></p>

              <p><span>'My children took a while to get used to having Indian food every day but then they grew to love it.</span></p>
              <p><span>'It's a massive misconception that Indian food is unhealthy. When it is cooked in a restaurant with lots of oil and butter it is. But when cooked at home it is very good for you.'</span></p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p><span>Dan began to try and recreate the meals at home using curry cook books but was disappointed with the results.</span></p>
              <p><span>He soon realised the British takeaway food he loved was actually far removed from the traditional recipes he was following in cook books.</span></p>
              <p><span>Dan, who uses ingredients bought from local independent shops, launched his blog called 'The Curry Guy' and started cooking.</span></p>
              <p><span>Throughout his challenge he learned 500 recipes, based on meals he had eaten in takeaways and not on their traditional counterparts.</span></p>
              <p><span>He wrote them down and has now self-published 'How to make British Indian restaurant style meals'.</span></p>
              <p><span>Dan added: 'When I first came to Britain I tasted Indian food and loved it. You can't get it in California so I had been missing out.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I tried cooking at home but I had no idea there was a difference between traditional Indian recipes and the takeaway version.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I have learned a lot doing it. That was the whole idea. I have never been to India, I just love the food, but I would love to go one day.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Through my blog I have been given recipes from people all over the world and been invited to cook with chefs at a few restaurants, so I am very grateful.</span></p>
              <p><span>'My favourite dishes are rogan josh and the jalfrezi. They are very simple to make and very tasty. It's been a great experience for us and my kids have even begun to cook too.</span></p>
