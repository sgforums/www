              <div class="small bold"><strong>Clever canine ... George the Basset Hound dialled 999</strong></div>
              <div class="small bold">COPS who raced to a house after hearing desperate heavy breathing during an emergency call found a DOG had rung 999 while strangling itself with the telephone wire.</div>
              <div class="small bold">
              <p>George, the two-year-old Basset Hound, had knocked the phone to the floor and got entangled in the wire — winding it round his neck.</p>
              <p>And he panicked so much he incredibly managed to ring 999 as he pawed at the phone trying to free himself.</p>
              <p>The emergency operator alerted police who dashed to the empty home of driving instructor Steve Brown and his daughter Lydia, 18 on Saturday night.</p>
              <p>They were preparing to smash down the door when a family friend from a nearby house ran out with a key to let them in.</p>
              <p>Four officers sprinted through the house in South Hiendley, West Yorkshire, searching the rooms.</p>
              <p>And then neighbour Paul Walker walked into the living room and found terrified George choking — with the phone lead wound tightly round his neck.</p>
              <p>Paul, 41, ripped the phone apart to wrench the wire from George’s throat.</p>
              <p>He said: “The police split up and ran through the house thinking someone had either been attacked or was desperately ill.</p>
              <p>“I went to look round as well and walked into this room and saw George choking.</p>
              <p>“He was absolutely terrified and could not free himself.</p>
              <p>“I knew I had to get him free quickly so I just ripped the wire out.</p>
              <p>“Incredibly you could see where his paw print was on the phone to ring 999 — he literally saved his own life.</p>
              <p>“When the police came into the room and realised what had happened they burst out laughing.</p>
              <p>“They told me they had been sent out because of a 999 call in which the operator could only hear heavy breathing and gasping.</p>
              <p>“They thought someone had collapsed or been attacked.”</p>
              <p>Paul had been left a key by college student Lydia to feed George later in the evening while she went out to do an evening shift as a waitress.</p>
              <p>Lydia said: “By the time I got back the police had gone and George was looking a little sorry for himself.</p>
              <p>“It is just so lucky that his paw managed to ring 999 otherwise he would have died.</p>
              <p>“We still don’t know how he managed it.</p>
              <p>"It’s one of those old-fashioned phones with the dialling ring.</p>
              <p>“He’s not usually very smart.</p>
              <p>"He’s really dopey and just likes to chew socks.”</p>
