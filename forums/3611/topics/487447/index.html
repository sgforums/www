              white monocled cobra that briefly became a national celebrity after it 
              roamed a Southern California neighborhood for several days in September 
              now has a new name.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1420783425481_1177">The San 
              Diego Zoo tells the Los Angeles Times (http://lat.ms/1xEHdOj) that the 
              cobra will be called Adhira, which in Hindi means lightning.</p>
              <p>The 
              Times says Adhira came in first in an online poll to find a name for the
               venomous cobra that was captured in Thousand Oaks and, after a period 
              of quarantine, joined the zoo's Reptile House.</p>
              <p>Adhira received 
              4,612 votes, besting Sapheda (white), Krima (cream), Cini (Sugar), Moti 
              (pearl) and Sundara (beautiful). Selected by the cobra's keepers, the 
              names were meant to reflect the Southeast Asia region where cobras are 
              native.</p>

              <p><span id="WNStoryDateline">Thousand Oaks, CA - </span></p>
              <p><strong>From Hal Eisner:</strong></p>
              <p>It's all 
              over. The white cobra that surprised neighbors in the 1300 block of 
              Ranchero in Thousand Oaks has been caught. And, it's capture was just as
               dramatic as when it first reared it's albino-hooded-head.</p>
              <p>It was 
              just before 2:30pm Thursday afternoon. Davide Lucchina and Tanya Grey 
              both happened to be driving their kids from school up Rancho Lane when 
              slithering across the street in front of the cars… the cobra!</p>
              <p>Lucchina
               told me “... as soon as I come up this road its in the middle of the 
              road crossing the road from there to there.” “It was going quickly 
              across the road definitely trying to get away from the open area,” Grey 
              explained.</p>
              <p>Matthews Mills with a company called Nature-Cide that 
              deals with snakes was in the neighborhood. As soon as he heard the cobra
               was in motion so was he. “I jumped the fence, got in there and started 
              digging…” in a wood pile behind a wooden fence he says. Animal Control 
              officers moved in, got the cobra, put it in a wooden box and carried it 
              away. As they did you could hear neighbors say 'thank you' and applaud. 
              “No problem” said one Animal Control officer.</p>

              <p><strong>White Cobra on the loose...</strong></p>
              <p>Authorities warned parents to watch their children and keep them away 
              from dark holes after a cobra was seen slithering through a Southern 
              California suburban neighborhood this week. State wildlife officials and
               Los Angeles County animal control officers searched bushes and 
              woodpiles Wednesday for the albino monocle cobra, which has been loose 
              at least since Monday evening, when it bit a dog on Rancho Lane in this 
              Ventura County town just past Los Angeles County's northern border.</p>
              <p>The
               dog had a neck wound on Wednesday but appeared healthy, authorities 
              said. The monocle cobra can deliver a neurotoxic venom that can be 
              deadly. "Do not approach it, do not try to capture it, do not try to 
              kill it," said Brandon Dowling, a Los Angeles County spokesman. If the 
              snake does bite someone, antivenom will be flown in from the San Diego 
              Zoo, Dowling said.</p>
              <p>Authorities planned to resume the search on 
              Thursday morning. Authorities were concentrating on the cooler morning 
              and evening hours when the snake probably would be more active and more 
              likely to hunt for mice and other food.</p>
              <p>They urged residents to keep pets indoors, watch children and make sure they stay away from animal burrows, pipes and culverts.</p>
              <p>The
               cobra's native to southeast Asia, parts of India and China, and can 
              grow to 4 feet or more. Its name derives from a circle or ring on the 
              back of its hood.</p>
              <p>Cobras are illegal to own in California except for educational and scientific purposes, and a permit is required.</p>
              <p>While
               it isn't aggressive, the snake will defend itself if cornered and "to 
              it, a person is a great, big potential predator," Greg Pauly, curator of
               herpetology at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.</p>
              <p>The cobra apparently escaped from captivity, although authorities had not found the owner.</p>
              <p>Unless the snake is hungry, it may remain "tucked away in a corner somewhere" for several days, Pauly said.</p>
              <p>"It's
               not in its usual home (in captivity)," Pauly said. "It's probably 
              freaking out a little bit. It's probably quite anxious about this 
              situation — as I'm sure the neighbors are as well."</p>
              <p><strong>Update From Hal Eisner:</strong></p>
              <p>If
               you've never heard of an albino monocled cobra it's because they're not
               from around here. Experts say they're from Southeast Asia. So, the fact
               that one was seen crawling around a Thousand Oaks neighborhood had 
              locals freaked out. They talked about how "unsettling" it is to hear 
              such a creature is slithering around their neighborhood and how "nerve 
              wracking" it is that such a creature is on the loose.</p>
              <p>Monday night
               it bit a 7-year-old Whippet named "Tiko." That's one lucky dog. The 
              experts say that 17% of the bites from this type of snake are not 
              venomous. "Tiko" was in that 17% and now is jumping around and barking 
              like nothing happened.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Animal control officers searching the area for the snake think it may be from a local home but no one is fessing up.</p>
              <p>Jules
               Sylvester works with snakes for TV shows, movies and documentaries. He 
              says just like a bite from a rattlesnake "You go to the hospital real 
              fast.” He thinks the 4-footer is probably hiding under brush or logs. 
              Animal Control brought him in, he says, to help in the search. To 
              Sylvester, the snake should surface but it's color may work against it. 
              “It's got to eat," he says. "When it comes out to eat it gets spotted 
              either by humans or birds of prey or anything else like that.” What does
               it eat? Rats and mice and other snakes are what Thousand Oaks offers 
              for dinner.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, some neighbors like Rick Eddy are 
              philosophical saying “For me, snakes will let you know either stay away 
              or hello and you better have the brains to leave it alone."</p>
              <p>While 
              others won't rest until it's caught. “It's kind of nerve wracking," says
               neighbor Tyler Nunn, "...there's a snake going around… that could kill 
              us.”</p>
              <p>Animal Control officials say if you see the snake stay away and call 9-1-1</p>
