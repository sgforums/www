The world seems to glow with bright light and brilliant color, but just for an instant before the darkness sets in. And even though the sun setting is a commonplace event — it happens every day — it remains one of the finest natural wonders. The nine sunset spots on this list are diverse in their locales, from mountaintops to oceansides and everywhere in between. So come take a virtual ride into the sunset..</h2>

After all, northern Tanzania's Serengeti National Park has more than 5,700 square miles to share. And in this part of the world, silhouettes of elephants and giraffes will most likely accompany your panorama of the smoldering sunset. Book a safari and watch as day shifts into night: The sky, a canvas of orange and red, will make your heart soar. A safari is a great way to experience a Serengeti sunset, but if you want to view the breathtaking display from a higher altitude, sign up for a hot air balloon safari.</span></p>

              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px;">Cambodia</strong><br style="font-size: 14px;"><br style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Bright, neon pink hues striate the blue sky as the sun descends behind this 12th-century temple in Angkor, Cambodia. This ancient "wat" or temple was erected in the classical Khmer style to pay homage to the Hindu god Vishnu, but later it became a Buddhist temple. The carefully groomed grounds and lanky palm trees seem to glorify the ethereal temple, which is also a World Heritage site. For a good place to see the psychedelic sunset, find a spot at the nearby Phnom Bakheng temple. It might be a little congested with tourists, but the temple provides a clear vantage point. The exotic architecture makes a sunset even more beautiful.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 14px;">The Grand Canyon's cloud-skimming elevation makes it an interesting place to catch the sunset. The setting sun's rays illuminate parts of the canyon in bright oranges and yellows, while other parts fall into deep blue shadows. The contrasting effect is arresting. The Hopi and </span><a style="color: #5d4370; font-size: 14px;" href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/photos/best-places-to-watch-the-sunset-1371775767-slideshow/travel.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-2807412-maricopa_point_grand_canyon-i">Maricopa</a><span style="font-size: 14px;"> points on the South Rim are two of the most popular places to view the stunning light show, though the Yaki and </span><a style="color: #5d4370; font-size: 14px;" href="http://travel.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-2807416-yavapai_observation_station_grand_canyon-i">Yavapai</a><span style="font-size: 14px;"> points are just as beautiful — and less crowded. When the sun's rays radiate across the Grand Canyon's creases and folds, the already exotic landscape looks almost extraterrestrial. </span></p>
              <p><img src="http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/8gjGpdZ2RIHcEXhHi4czUA--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9aW5zZXQ7aD00MTM7cT04NTt3PTYyMA--/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/travel/2013-06-20/e71df749-b358-4ad5-8ee3-30c38d6af0af_Grand_Canyon.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="413"></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14px;">On a clear night, when the sun sets in Sydney, a rainbow of colors infuses the sky. The brilliant shades reflect off the city's harbor and glass skyscrapers, creating a kaleidoscopic display. When the sun finally does disappear below the horizon line, leaving the sky a royal blue hue, the city lights flicker and cast their glow on the placid harbor. Find a place on the Sydney Harbour Bridge to watch the light show or claim a spot on solid ground so you can see the sun sink behind the bridge. Take a quick ferry ride from Circular Quay to Watsons Bay for an awesome vantage point. With its impressive cache of architectural landmarks, from the bridge to the Sydney Opera House, it's an inspiring locale to watch the sun go dow</span></p>

              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px;">Greece</strong><br style="font-size: 14px;"><br style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">When the sun begins its daily descent on Oia, Santorini, you'll find tourists and locals scrambling to find a cliffside perch to "ooh" and "ahh." The sky's kaleidoscope of pinks, oranges and blues extend over the Aegean Sea while simultaneously casting a gorgeous orange tint over the island's whitewashed, blue-topped buildings. It's enough to make even the most jaded traveler sigh. Incidentally, Santorini's heart-stopping sunsets are one reason it rates so high on our list of the Best Honeymoon Destinations. Oia's swoon-worthy sunsets might actually take your breath away. As the sun dips below the horizon, the glittering waters of the Aegean Sea reflect the kaleidoscope colors of the sky.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/e483naWF8m7ffXATsvC69w--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9aW5zZXQ7aD00MTM7cT04NTt3PTYyMA--/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/travel/2013-06-20/b81d0f48-06bb-40bc-9e71-e43420177edf_Oia_Santorini.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="413"></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px;">Mallory Square</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Nearly every night, Mallory Square fills with tourists hoping to catch sight of one of Key West's legendary sunsets. This waterfront plaza is the perfect place to watch the day melt into night, but it's popular too. So if you want to enjoy an unhindered view, try to stake out a spot a few hours before nightfall. That way, you'll also enjoy perusing the arts and craft stalls and noshing on food-truck fare at the nightly Sunset Celebration on the Mallory Square dock. When it comes time to for the sun's plunge, you'll get a dazzling display of pastel colors streaking the sky. And if you pay close attention, you might just catch the fleeting "green flash" that occurs as the sun drops below the Gulf of Mexico. Key West's location — the southernmost Florida Key and just 18 feet above sea level — makes it a particularly stunning place to watch the sunset. It defies logic, as the sun seems to fall off the edge of the world. </span></p>
              <p><img src="http://l1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/T7JDtVHqT60B3KEPUK3B3Q--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9aW5zZXQ7aD00MTM7cT04NTt3PTYyMA--/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/travel/2013-06-20/077c9ae6-fd3d-41cc-8093-d09297b1a37f_Key_West.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="413"></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px;">Africa</strong><br style="font-size: 14px;"><br style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Except for the occasional camel, all you'll see stretching across miles and miles of the Sahara Desert  is rippling sand. The Sahara covers more than 3.5 million square miles of Africa — nearly 10 percent of the continent — but one great place to watch the sunset is at "the door of the desert" in </span><a style="color: #5d4370; font-size: 14px;" href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/photos/best-places-to-watch-the-sunset-1371775767-slideshow/travel.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-487062-ouarzazate_vacations-i">Ouarzazate, Morocco</a><span style="font-size: 14px;">. And if you've been out all day in this harsh climate, the sunset is a welcome change to the monotonous view. On a cloudless day, it looks like a slowly descending burning ball that casts its orange light throughout the barren landscape until gradually fading into blue. From any given place in Africa's massive desert, the beauty of sunset is so great that you might think you're looking at a mirage. Waves of sand lap at the heels of the sun until it's been fully engulfed and all that's left is a navy blue sky. </span></p>
              <p><img src="http://l1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/14X56_CS4Istz1mN18vhXQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9aW5zZXQ7aD00MTM7cT04NTt3PTYyMA--/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/travel/2013-06-20/11cf842a-6de8-4bbf-8dc7-298f0fdefb11_Sahara_Desert.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="413"></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Located along Switzerland's Italian border you'll find Zermatt, a picturesque village perched at the base of the remarkable Matterhorn mountain peak. When it comes time for the sun to go down, the sight of multicolored ribbons slashing the sky and illuminating the Matterhorn is nothing short of enchanting. You can catch this daily display at the foot of the mountain, but for a closer view, the Monte Rosa Hut is a good place to go. It is accessible via the Rotenboden station on the Gornergrat Bahn railway. The Matterhorn has become known as the symbol of the Alps, and it's certainly one of the most photographed parts of the range. It's at its most majestic when it's drenched in bright rays as the sun sets below the horizon.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/x5kYKcRtwt5xqryZkP1CMw--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9aW5zZXQ7aD00MTM7cT04NTt3PTYyMA--/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/travel/2013-06-20/d733e2df-4675-4af7-a438-2b38325e84e5_Zermatt_Switzerland.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="413"></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14px;">The best place to view a Venetian sunset is inside one of the romantic gondolas on the wide Grand Canal. That way, your view of the fleeting but glorious light display won't be blocked by the city's Venetian Gothic architecture. With the sun spilling multi-colored light on the clouds, water and surrounding buildings, you'll fall under Venice's spell — if you haven't already. There is something enchanting about a gondolier rowing the canal's quiet waters while the sun slowly disappears from sight. And even though you probably won't want to ride a gondola in the cold of winter, the sunsets in January and February are spectacular. Accademia Bridge is a sweet spot to watch the sun descend over the Grand Canal. </span></p>
