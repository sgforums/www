              <h1>Litter Kwitter</h1>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/71/CC7B179E986AB5C35843C3E3F2A78.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="398"></p>
              <p>Imagine being forced to use a sandpit as a toilet, in full view of your family - horrible, right? Yet cats are forced to suffer similar indignity every day by their human masters; their shame is so great they even bury the fruits of their labours afterwards. But kinder cat owners can now spare their kitty's blushes by purchasing the Litter Kwitter, a 3-step training system designed to help cats to use a human toilet. All that's needed now is a follow-up gadget to stop tomcats leaving the seat up once they've done their business.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h1>DTV Shredder</h1>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/3D/E78D38E20EA5033F138463044D81F.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="398"></p>
              <p>It might sound like a super-advanced machine for disposing of important documents, but the DTV Shredder is much cooler (and more daft) than a boring old office gadget. This extreme machine combines motocross bike, skateboard and Johnny Five in one all-terrain package. The rider stands sideways on a modified skateboard deck, barrelling over bumps and leaping from natural ramps at speeds of up to 30mph. Ice, snow, sand, mud - nothing can stop this over-the-top vehicle in its...well, tracks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h1>iCap MP3 player</h1>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/27/C38DAAD9502959C8C53FE793E16F.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="398"></p>
              <p>Now, until we saw the iCap we were under the impression that a regular MP3 player, earbuds and baseball cap combo worked just fine for most people. But apparently not. This gadget is completely wireless - the stereo sound from the built-in speakers takes the place of a set of headphones. The 2GB MP3 player sits under the brim of the baseball cap, and when worn backwards will, according to the creators, "fit under standard bicycle helmets, hard hats and shorty motorcycle helmets". A bonkers bit of tech.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h1>Treasure Seeker's Shoes</h1>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/80/AAB8664D436393D96AFA324EEC962D.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="398"></p>
              <p>Have you ever seen someone metal detecting? They're usually old, beardy and convinced they'll soon discover a hoard of priceless Roman coins. But their 'finds' are more likely to be a rusted coke can, a bottle cap, or, if they're lucky, a horse shoe. These Treasure Seeker's Shoes aim to make metal detecting less obviously nerdy - the pack on your leg beeps or vibrates every time your feet pass over something metal. Shame it'll look like you've stepped in something nasty whenever you stop to unearth a hidden treasure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h1>UNO III Streetbike</h1>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/14/7D9621291D33B3E47BAE5C5073E0.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="398"></p>
              <p>Zipping along on the UNO III Streetbike is the closest you can get to riding a transformer. This eye-poppingly odd machine can switch from a two-wheeled 'dicycle' (i.e. balanced on its rear two wheels) to a three-wheeled sports bike in next to no time, allowing you to squeeze into tight city spaces or speed along the motorway at will. Internal gyros help maintain stability when the bike is in dicycle mode; when you open up the throttle a third (front) wheel automatically folds out, and the rear wheels move backwards. A feat more than worthy of the robots in disguise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h1>Magnum Power Driver</h1>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/88/4E272E2969ACA28264F92DD2D98BC.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="398"></p>
              <p>If Dirty Harry needed to use a power drill he'd undoubtedly reach for the Magnum Power Driver (though possibly not the powder pink version). This cordless screwdriver looks as if it's been on a course of steroids, packing six different heads into one device. Its revolver design adds an extra dose of testosterone to the DIY process, and there's even a small on-board torch should you, erm, feel compelled to put up some shelves in the dark. You know, like 'real men' do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h1>Faceless Watch</h1>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/BC/F59DBF3C83B46074102BF9CD84CC4.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="398"></p>
              <p>A 'faceless watch' sounds like an oxymoron - at least until you've actually clapped eyes on one. This kooky but cool timepiece actually works just as well as a regular watch. Four LCD displays built into the stainless steel band itself illuminate at the touch of a button, forming digital numbers that tell the current time; a further press brings up the date. This gadget has an added bonus too - your non-watch-wearing friends will soon stop pestering you for the time once they realise you only wear a steel 'bracelet' on your wrist.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Motorised Monocycle</p>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/71/B1ED1090BBCE95D7D7146B2452.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="398"></p>
              <p>It looks like it shouldn't work, but the Motorised Monocycle is actually a precision piece of engineering, capable of travelling at speeds of up to 25mph. Although it seems rather sci-fi in nature the original monocycle design is almost 150 years old. The driver sits within the wheel itself, and steers by leaning to one side or the other. Sadly this modern version isn't road legal, though considering how many accidents would happen as a result of car drivers rubbing their eyes and staring in disbelief as a monocycle zooms past, that might actually be for the best.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h1>Self-Stirring Electric Pot</h1>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/A6/7AD9B851C14F9D4C96B9AD2F5FA19.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="398"></p>
              <p>After an hour on the tube or train, or sat in a traffic jam with only Simon Mayo for company, the last thing you want to do is stand by the hob stirring your dinner. But microwave meals and pot noodles can only sustain a person for so long (four years and counting in our case). The answer? A self-stirring pot of course. The ultimate kitchen gadget for the discerning non-chef, this device features an automated spatula that mixes ingredients and lifts bits of food that would otherwise stick and burn on the bottom of the pan. In fact, it's a better cook than we are.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>USB Aquarium</p>
              <p><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/F6/CFEB45652757F4B749244BC6859B66.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="398"></p>
              <p>When you first glanced at the photo, you probably thought, a USB fish tank filled with virtual fish - how is that over the top? But we've got news for you. This isn't your bog standard crappy office toy. Oh no. As far as USB peripherals are concerned, this crazy gadget takes things to a whole new level. Why? Because it's designed to provide "a comfortable habitat for real fish". Yes, you read that correctly - real, all-singing, all-dancing (well, perhaps not) fish. In a tank. On your desk. Plugged into your computer's USB port. It certainly puts our USB mug warmer to shame.</p>
