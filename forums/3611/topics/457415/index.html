              <p>A 10-year-old British boy is being hailed a hero after he rowed his 8-foot dinghy to the rescue of a couple whose boat had capsized and towed them to safety.</p>
              <p>Stuart Crang was fishing when he spotted Richard Brown and his partner, Sue Taffler, in the water last month near Brixham next to their Pico sailing boat, which had filled with water.</p>
              <p>Brown and Taffler, who both wore life jackets, had been in the water for about 45 minutes.</p>
              <hr class="excerptEnd">
              <p>Crang rowed out to them to see if they needed help before towing them for 30 minutes back to safety.</p>
              <p>"I was out in my little rowing boat, it's only 8 feet, and there were two people called Richard and Sue and they had capsized and had started to sink," Crang told the BBC. "I just went out to see if they were all right, but they said no, so I put them on a tow and brought them into the harbor."</p>
              <p>Brown and Taffler held on to their towed boat, not wanting to get into Stuart's boat in case that also capsized, the BBC said.</p>
              <p>"It took me half an hour to bring them in, it was just me rowing, I was struggling quite a bit, but my dad was coming out and he saw me," he said.</p>
              <p>"I was quite far in the harbor and he just said to me, 'Are you all right?' and I said, 'Yeah, I'll be all right in a minute,' and he said, 'Do you want me to take the boat off your hands?' So he took it off my hands and took them in.</p>
              <p>"They were far too cold and of course they weren't feeling great when they got out."</p>
              <p>Stuart's father, Nigel Crang, 47, is part of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution's lifeboat crew, while his 23-year-old brother, Jonathan, is part of the Torbay coastguard team.</p>
              <p>"So I'm used to it, really," Stuart said.</p>
              <p>Brown and Taffler, who live in Brixham, thanked Stuart with a card and boxes of sweets, the BBC said.</p>
              <p>Brown told the BBC their rescuer was an "absolute star."</p>
