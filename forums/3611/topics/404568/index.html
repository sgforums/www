              <p>Finland for the second year in a row took first place at the annual Wife-Carrying World Championships held in the central Finnish town of Sonkajaervi, organisers said Saturday.</p>
              <p>Taisto Miettinen, who was defending his champion title, raced through a 250-metre (273-yard) course with two hurdles and a pool in just over one minute four seconds, carrying Kristiina Haapanen on his back.</p>
              <p>The winners beat Estonia's Alar Voogla and Kristi Viltrop, who also took silver last year, by 0.4 seconds.</p>
              <p>The 45-year-old Miettinen, a commercial lawyer by day, attended the competition for 10 years before grabbing gold -- and putting an end to Estonia's 11-year reign -- last year.</p>
              <p>He told AFP by phone he did not beat his 2009 score of 62 seconds because of a bigger pool.</p>
              <p>"I love competing and I love winning. We practiced a lot, but the race was not as easy as last year because the pool was bigger," said the winner, who excels at a number of other sports.</p>
              <p>He added the best way for a racer to carry the "wife" -- in his case, a friend he has been racing with for four years -- was "Estonian style".</p>
              <p>"That means (for the racer) to dangle her upside down over his back."</p>
              <p>Finland also won the third place bronze with the team of Ilpo Haalisto and Satu Juurinen.</p>
              <p>Sonkajaervi village, located some 490 kilometres (302 miles) north of Helsinki, has in the past 15 years made its entertaining wife-carrying competition known around the world.</p>
              <p>This year, 51 teams from 13 countries including Australia, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates competed in front of a crowd of 4,000.</p>
              <p>The race was inspired by the legend of a local thug, Herkko Rosvo-Ronkainen, who lived in a forest in the late 1800s and is said to have snatched food and sometimes ladies from villages in the region.</p>
