              <h1>Could 'poo power' help heat the country?</h1>
              <p><strong>The UK is firmly in the grip of one of the coldest winters on 
              record and many households are seeing their fuel bills soar.</strong></p>
              <p>Although
               the government has dismissed fears over dwindling gas supplies during 
              the big freeze, the weather highlights the desirability of finding more 
              "green" fuel.</p>
              <p>One water firm thinks it may have the answer - and 
              it is not wind or hydro power. Thames Water has successfully been using 
              human toilet waste to make electricity for the past decade.</p>
              <p>Long 
              before you get to Beckton sewage treatment plant in east London the 
              smell tells you it is near.</p>
              <p>Not strange considering it is the 
              biggest sewage plant in Europe and treats a large majority of the waste 
              coming from London's toilets.</p>
              <p>Human waste has long been seen as a by-product, but Thames Water 
              claims it saved £15m last year, and generated 14% of its power, from 
              either burning sludge or methane derived from its 13 million customers' 
              toilets.</p>
              <p>In total the firm treats 2.8 billion litres of sewage 
              every day from people in London, Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Hertfordshire 
              and Surrey.</p>
              <p>Harjeet Singh is the plant manager for the 
              sludge-powered generator at Beckton.</p>
              <p>Before it, and its sister 
              plant Crossness on the other side of the River Thames, was built in 1998
               at the cost of £165m, the sludge was simply deposited in the sea.</p>
              <p>"It
               was taken on big barges out into the North Sea and dumped," Mr Singh 
              explained.</p>
              <p>"A tanker was leaving every two minutes. Now we only 
              have about four lorries of ash [the only by-product] a day."</p>
              <p>Mr Singh describes the process which every day turns tons of human 
              waste into electricity as "totally green".</p>
              <p>The raw sewage comes 
              into the plant and is filtered, with anything that is not excrement or 
              toilet paper removed, leaving a mix of 95% water and 5% solids which is 
              then pumped into industrial 50m (165ft) compressors where the water is 
              squeezed out, leaving solid "poo cakes".</p>
              <p>These cakes, which still
               contain a large amount of water but burn easily, are fed into a 
              gigantic hot furnace which produces steam that drives a large turbine, 
              creating electricity.</p>
              <p>"In the same way our domestic boilers 
              work," Mr Singh explained</p>
              <p>The electricity generated has the 
              capacity to power 10,000 homes but here it is fed back into Beckton's 
              own system to keep the sewage plant running.</p>
              <p><strong>Fat for lipsticks </strong></p>
              <p>Mr
               Singh said: "A computer monitors emissions so we don't emit any 
              nasties.</p>
              <p>"That's not happened in the past 12 years, we've not 
              exceeded [limits] since we opened.</p>
              <p>"At the end of the process 
              we're left with about 30% ash."</p>
              <p>He said the firm was looking into ways of using the ash in the 
              future.</p>
              <p>"We don't want it to go to landfill and one thing we are 
              looking at making with it is concrete", he said, showing a small test 
              block he "made earlier".</p>
              <p>He said they were also toying with the 
              idea of using the fat in the toilet sludge to make lipsticks and other 
              cosmetics.</p>
              <p>However a more likely use may be as fertiliser for 
              farmers and gardeners.</p>
              <p>"[The sludge] contains lots of nutrients 
              and has a high calorific content.</p>
              <p>"But you can see a difference 
              during the school holidays and Christmas; there's less waste coming into
               the plant because people are away from the city.</p>
              <p>"There is also a
               difference in the summer holidays in the calorific value of the sludge;
               it's lower because people eat more salads." </p>
