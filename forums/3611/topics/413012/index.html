              <p class="articleabstract">An iron used for a wedding suit, a rear-view mirror broken in a jealous fit and a lower leg prosthesis -- at first it's hard to find any link between the items on display at a new museum in Croatia.</p>
              <p class="articleabstract"><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/A2/28AC36F6CC2722BB1CF1A2BD2711.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="166"></p>
              <p>But every exhibit in the Museum of Broken Relationships has one thing in common -- it tells the story of a lost love.</p>
              <p>These material remnants of failed romances down the years are sometimes mundane, sometimes bizarre, sometimes funny, sad or even kinky.</p>
              <p>The prosthesis is laid out on a white pillar, tastefully lit. It belonged to a Croat war invalid who had an affair with a social worker.</p>
              <p>"The prosthesis lasted longer than our love. It was made of sturdier material," says the caption.</p>
              <p>Others exhibits include a tool used to axe an ex-girlfriend's furniture, a red wig from New York and garterbelts from Sarajevo.</p>
              <p>"I never put them on. The relationship might have lasted longer if I did," laments the donor.</p>
              <p>The idea for the museum came five years ago when artists Olinka Vistica and Drazen Grubisic, who broke up after four years together, discussed how to preserve the heritage of a broken emotional relationship.</p>
              <p>"Inspired by our own situation we discussed the idea that everything that was nice once and has changed should not be destroyed but rather preserved in a certain way," Vistica said.</p>
              <p>"So in 2006 we launched the project, calling it the Museum of Broken Relationships, in which people could kind of store their feelings.</p>
              <p>"The concept is that people have a sort of cathartic experience, getting rid of the burden of a failed relationship by donating items from their personal stories."</p>
              <p>Although some may baulk at revealing such personal details, Grubisic believes the main motive of donors, who remain anonymous, is to symbolically close a chapter in their life.</p>
              <p>"All major events in our lives, like weddings or funerals, are accompanied with a sort of a ritual while only in break-ups is one alone.</p>
              <p>"This in a way provides a kind of a ritual. Through a donation to the museum an object changes its context and becomes something else," the 41-year-old explained.</p>
              <p>The newly-opened exhibition in Zagreb has provoked lively interest in both Croatia and abroad.</p>
              <p>Over the past four years, it has toured around 20 locations in Europe, North A merica, Asia and Africa.</p>
              <p>"The original project actually outgrew us so as soon as a suitable location was found we moved to open it as a permanent exhibition," Vistica says.</p>
              <p>Exhibits are displayed in rooms with themes such as "Rage and Fury" and "Whims of Desire."</p>
              <p>Each is accompanied with a caption giving the length of the relationship, place of origin and donor's explanation.</p>
              <p>Other exhibits include the prayers said by a Filipino girl for her fiance after he was fatally injured in a car crash and a love letter written by a 13-year-old boy fleeing the Bosnian capital Sarajevo at the start of the 1990s war.</p>
              <p>Donors are mostly women, according to Vistica and Grubisic, except in Turkey where to their surprise most came from men.</p>
              <p>At the museum's website www.brokenships.com one can make a virtual donation, by sending an e-mail, a picture or an SMS text message, but Grubisic says that for the time being people seem to prefer to donate the actual objects.</p>
              <p>"It is a great concept. I like it since it puts in focus human stories in the form of an artistic exhibition. A true story that becomes and art," visitor Domagoj Blazevic, 31, told AFP while touring the museum.</p>
              <p>"It is at the same time funny and poetic, but I can also feel a painful tone," added singer Ivanka Mazurkijevic.</p>
