              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">To capture the perfect wildlife image, you usually have to be in exactly the right place at precisely the right time.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But in this instance, David Slater wasn’t there at all and he still got a result.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Visiting a national park in North Sulawesi, Indonesia, award-winning photographer Mr Slater left his camera unattended for a while.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">It soon attracted the attention of an inquisitive female from a local group of crested black macaque monkeys, known for their intelligence and dexterity.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Fascinated by her reflection in the lens, she then somehow managed to start the camera. The upshot: A splendid self-portrait.</span></p>
              <p><br><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/07/04/article-2011051-0CDC0F0900000578-739_634x894.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="894"></p>
              <p><br><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">The monkeys were intrigued by their reflection in the camera lens <br><br></span></strong><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/07/05/article-2011051-0CDC0DD000000578-718_634x435.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="435"></p>
              <div class="artSplitter">
              <p class="imageCaption"><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">You can be in this one too: The monkey even snapped a shot with photographer David Slater in the frame</span></strong></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'One of them must have accidentally knocked the camera and set it off because the sound caused a bit of a frenzy, said Slater, 46. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'At first there was a lot of grimacing with their teeth showing because it was probably the first time they had ever seen a reflection.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'They were quite mischievous jumping all over my equipment, and it looked like they were already posing for the camera when one hit the button.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'The sound got his attention and he kept pressing it</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'At first it scared the rest of them away but they soon came back - it was amazing to watch.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'He must have taken hundreds of pictures by the time I got my camera back, but not very many were in focus. He obviously hadn't worked that out yet.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I wish I could have stayed longer as he probably would have taken a full family album.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Slater, from Coleford, Gloucestershire, was on a trip to a small national park north of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi when he met the incredibly friendly bunch.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The crested black macaque is extremely rare and critically endangered. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">These were part of a study group near a science base in the region, home to researchers from Holland.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I teamed up with a local guide because I knew about the apes and wanted to photograph them,' said Slater.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Self-portrait: This critically endangered macaque monkey took his own photographs after grabbing a camera that had been left lying around <br><br></span></strong></p>
              <div class="artSplitter">
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I walked with them for about three days in a row. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'They befriended us and showed absolutely no aggression - they were just interested in the things I was carrying.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'They aren't known for being particularly clever like chimps, just inquisitive.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Despite probably never having any contact with humans before they didn't feel threatened by our presence, and that's why I could walk with them during the day.'</span></p>
