              <p class="articleabstract"><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/BB/E293F852DA063B8DE43823102D.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="146"></p>
              <p>The woman, who works with two male accomplices, targets shoppers standing in bank queues at a mall in Johannesburg's Soweto township and has struck at least twice recently, The New Age newspaper reported Friday.</p>
              <p>"I never suspected anything wicked about the old woman as she looked like a pensioner and had a walking stick," 18-year-old victim Kabelo Dube told the newspaper.</p>
              <p>He said he was waiting in line to deposit money at the bank when a young man approached and asked him for help unloading the old woman's bags.</p>
              <p>He went with the pair to the car and began to help with the bags, but then felt a gun pressed against his head and was ordered to get in the car, he said.</p>
              <p>The woman and her two accomplices then drove a short distance from the mall, took his money -- 1,200 rand ($173, 122 euros) -- and forced him out of the car, he said.</p>
              <p>"I went back to the mall and reported the incident to the security guards, who advised me to go to a police station and open a case," he said.</p>
              <p>"Before I could leave another man came into the security control room to report that he had also been robbed by two men and a granny."</p>
              <p>A police spokesman said a case had been opened and officers were searching for the suspects.</p>
