              <p>HAMILTON, Ont. -- A urinal shaped like a woman’s wide-open mouth has been flushed out of the men’s room of a Hamilton eatery following a nearly year-long public outcry.</p>
              <p>The glossy, red-lipped loo at The Honest Lawyer restaurant sparked a letter writing campaign that attracted almost 1,100 people, including Ontario’s NDP leader and Hamilton’s mayor.</p>
              <p>Some people argued the “Kisses! urinal” — manufactured by Bathroom Mania! in the Netherlands — was art or just a joke.</p>
              <p>The Woman Abuse Working Group, a coalition of 24 organizations, disagreed and led efforts to oust what it considered to be an offensive water closet.</p>
              <p>Lenore Lukasik-Foss, chairwoman of the group, said Monday she’s “shocked, excited and thrilled” that it’s gone.</p>
              <p>“It’s not a joke to pee into a woman’s mouth,” she said.</p>
              <p>The group was concerned about women’s safety and the message the urinal, which had been there since the restaurant opened in February 2007, sent to men in the bar.</p>
              <p>“They’re drinking and maybe hoping to connect with a special person and then they’re going to the bathroom and peeing into a woman’s mouth,” said Lukasik-Foss, who’s also director of the Sex Assault Centre.</p>
              <p>“Granted it’s sort of a cartoonish version, but still it’s clearly a woman’s mouth.”</p>
              <p>Ontario NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, who had sent a letter to owner Greg Sandwell asking him to consider the outcry from women’s groups, said she was pleased it had been removed.</p>
              <p>“It was something that was causing a great deal of concern around the Hamilton area,” said Horwath, who represents the riding in which the restaurant is located.</p>
              <p>“I’ve been to the Honest Lawyer with many different people, including men, and nobody ever gave me the heads up.”</p>
              <p>On its website, the manufacturer says “’Kisses!’ transforms a daily event into a blushing experience.”</p>
              <p>It also adds: “This is one target men will never miss.”</p>
              <p>While the designer defends the urinals as sensual art, a customer complaint led a McDonald’s outlet in Amsterdam to remove them in 2006. The fixtures were also removed from a public washroom near Austria’s national opera in Vienna in 2006 after complaints from politicians.</p>
              <p>Virgin Airways apologized and ditched plans to install a pair at its lounge at New York’s John F. Kennedy airport in 2004 after the National Organization for Women called them “degrading.”</p>
              <p>Meike van Schijndel said in an email from Holland that she devised the design for an art school project, and lots of men and women like the “cartoonish looking mouth.”</p>
              <p>“The thought that this urinal only represents a man peeing in a woman’s mouth never even occurred to me while making it,” said van Schijndel.</p>
              <p>“Luckily for all those women who feel offended, they will never run into a ‘Kisses’ at a restroom.”</p>
              <p>Sandwell could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
