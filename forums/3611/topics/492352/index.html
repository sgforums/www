              <p class="story-body__introduction">Adult illiteracy in Indonesia is 
              dropping, but one region has almost a million adults who cannot read. In
               central Java, the DAC NEWS meets one man and his horse who are helping 
              improve access to books.</p>
              <p>For a formerly wild horse that barely 
              reaches shoulder-height on an adult man, Luna is an unlikely figure to 
              help improve literacy rates in Indonesia.</p>
              <p>Luna is looked after by Ridwan Sururi, 42, in the village of Serang, in the Purbalingga region of Java island.</p>
              <p>It is a rural, tropical area, lying on the edge of one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes, Mount Slamet.</p>
              <p>In a region dotted by villages, Mr Sururi - and Luna - have become essential links between communities in recent months.</p>
              <p>In January, Mr Sururi started a mobile library called Kudapustaka - meaning 'horse library' in Indonesian.</p>
              <p>He travels between villages with books stored in boxes balanced on Luna's back.</p>
              <p>He
               visits schools three times a week - every Tuesday, Wednesday, and 
              Thursday. Sometimes he brings along his daughter, Indriani Fatmawati.</p>

              <p><img src="http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/82805000/jpg/_82805585_82805584.jpg" alt="" width="624" height="351"></p>
              <p><img src="http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/82805000/jpg/_82805678_82805677.jpg" alt="" width="624" height="351"></p>
              <p>Children and villagers do not have to pay anything to borrow the 
              books and Mr Sururi has not looked to make money from the scheme.</p>
              <p>"I love horses, and I want this hobby to bring benefit to people," he told BBC Indonesia.</p>
              <p>The
               idea for Kudapustaka came from Nirwan Arsuka a fellow horse enthusiast 
              and friend of Mr Sururi's. "He asked me: Can we help society through our
               hobby? I said I was interested, but I didn't know how."</p>
              <p>"Then, he
               had this idea to create a mobile library using horses. I liked the 
              idea, but sadly I didn't have any books. So, he sent me boxes of books."</p>
              <p>According to Unesco, Indonesia has made great strides in reducing adult illiteracy in recent years, bringing down adult illiteracy down from 15.4m in 2004 to 6.7m in 2011.</p>
              <p>However, Unesco says there are more than 977,000 illiterate adults in central Java, Ridwan's region.</p>
              <p>As a professional horse caretaker, Mr Sururi does not own any of his 
              own animals. So did he ask permission to use the horse as a mobile 
              library? "I haven't," he said, laughing.</p>
              <p>"The owner lives far away from this village and hasn't visited the horses for a long time. I am a bit sad about that."</p>
              <p><img src="http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/82805000/jpg/_82805589_82805588.jpg" alt="" width="624" height="351"></p>
              <p><img src="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/82805000/jpg/_82805593_82805592.jpg" alt="" width="624" height="351"></p>
              <p>Of the three horses he is paid to look after, Mr Sururi picked Luna as his companion.</p>
              <p>"It
               was a wild horse, but I tamed it. Luna has never kicked or bitten 
              anybody, and is very friendly when surrounded by children."</p>
              <p>He said he wished more people would donate books to his scheme. "Children here love comics and story books.</p>
              <p>"Adults, on the other hand, need inspirational and how-to books, like how to farm, that kind of thing."</p>
              <p><img src="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/82805000/jpg/_82805427_82805426.jpg" alt="" width="624" height="351"></p>
              <p>Mr Sururi dreams of one day owning his own Kudapustaka horse - and a real library too.</p>
              <p>"I hope I can have a small library in front of my house," he says. "But I know it is only a dream."</p>
