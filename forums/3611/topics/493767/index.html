              <p>SINGAPORE — They loiter around void decks at night, swooping
               in when they spot a prized catch. No, it is not Pokemons they are 
              hunting – these “collectors” are after pregnant queen ants to kickstart 
              their own ant colonies.</p>
              <p>Keeping ants as pets seems to be 
              slowly catching on among a small community here. Since last December, at
               least 30 local enthusiasts have banded together.</p>
              <p>Like in Pokemon Go, there are varieties to collect and “hot 
              spots” where more-prized species can be found. More than 50 ant species 
              can be found in Singapore, including a rarer one called the trap-jaw, 
              characterised by its ability to open its mouthpiece up to 180 degrees 
              wide and shut it in a snap.</p>
              <p>Jurong Bird Park assistant 
              curator Angelin Lim, like most local hobbyists, got intrigued after 
              stumbling in February upon a YouTube channel called AntsCanada, which 
              has been promoting the cultivation of pet ant colonies using queen ants 
              since 2009.</p>
              <p>The 32-year-old told TODAY: “In my workplace,
               we feed our baby birds with ant eggs, so I started out wanting to see 
              if I can cultivate them.”</p>
              <p>But her plans were soon scuppered as she fell in love with the six-legged critters.</p>
              <p>“The
               more I learnt, the more amazed I got at how they take care of one 
              other, how they take care of their queen, and the hive mindset. Their 
              world is not me, I and myself, but me for the entire colony,” she said.</p>
              <p>So whenever it rains or when there is increased swiftlet, 
              bat or lizard activity, Ms Lim gets excited – as these are harbingers of
               a queen ant flying out to mate – which increases her chances of nabbing
               one.</p>
              <p>Her biggest colony is made up of more than 10 worker ants, all of which were laid by one queen carpenter ant.</p>
              <p>Her
               newfound hobby, however, is not appreciated by many around her. “My 
              parents said: ‘What? You have nothing else to do, is it?’”</p>
              <p>The
               draw, said Ms Lim, her fiance and other hobbyists, is they can relive 
              their childhood adventures of catching spiders in the field and guppies 
              in the drain.</p>
              <p>There is also joy in being able to build a 
              colony big enough to observe how the castes work – workers tending to 
              hive’s daily needs and soldiers protecting the queen.</p>
              <p>Designing the formicarium (or ant’s homes) can also feel like playing the once-popular computer game SimCity.</p>

              <p>While ants might seem like hardy creatures, a whole colony 
              can be wiped out by one wrong move, as Mr Muhammad Iskandar Riza Bin 
              Noor Affandi found out.</p>
              <p>His six-month-old colony of seven
               workers and one carpenter queen died last Monday (March 27) for reasons
               unknown, devastating the 29-year-old lifeguard who started keeping ants
               eight months ago.</p>
              <p>At the peak, the founder of Facebook 
              group Ants Community Singapore had a colony of 20. He suspects they 
              might have suffocated because he used a cover that’s too thick to keep 
              them in the dark, which they prefer.</p>
              <p>Antkeepers who want 
              to get a head start without hunting can buy their queens from suppliers.
               Listed on AntsCanada’s website are seven ant “farmers” in Singapore, 
              offering 44 colonies for sale.</p>
              <p>The biggest and most 
              expensive at S$2,000 is a nest of over 1,000 yellow crazy workers with 
              four queens, kept in a 0.6m enclosure. A collection of 50 to 100 weavers
               is also going at a high price of S$800, as queen weavers are harder to 
              catch than trap-jaws since they mate high up in the air.</p>
              <p>Mr
               Chris Chan, a former shipping executive, started ant-keeping a year 
              ago. He supplies schoolboys starter carpenter ant colonies consisting a 
              queen with at least one worker for S$15 to S$30. His biggest ant sale to
               date is a trap-jaw queen with five workers in a small formicarium for 
              S$250.</p>
              <p>In what the 29-year-old said is a sign of the 
              growing trend here, he also managed to sell five formicariums he 
              designed in recent months for between S$40 and S$300.</p>
              <p>One
               room in his rental home is dedicated to housing his collection of at 
              least 10 formicariums – each built differently – and about 40 
              recently-caught queen ants, six of which are trap-jaws.</p>
              <p>His
               largest colony consists up to 1,000 red fire ants, known for their 
              stinging bites, housed in a large fish tank lined with a paste of talcum
               powder and alcohol at its mouth to prevent them from escaping.</p>
              <p>Mr
               Chan’s dream is to be the region’s go-to for all things ants-related, 
              as it is an “in-thing in the US and Taiwan” at the moment, but has yet 
              to catch on in as big a way locally.</p>
              <p>Even so, not all 
              ants are pets to Mr Chan. Pointing to pharaoh and ghost ants crawling 
              across his room furniture, he said: “Because of their size, they can 
              squeeze through tight spaces, steal all the goods and kill my whole 
              colony.”</p>
              <p>One reminder he has for beginners: “Keeping ants
               is as big a responsibility as keeping dogs and cats; if you release 
              captive ants back into the wild, it can affect the ecosystem. Give them a
               home, or don’t home them at all.”</p>
