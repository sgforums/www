              <p>PUERTO PRINCESA, PHILIPPINES // A poor Philippine fisherman 
              found what is thought to be the world’s largest pearl, but hid it under 
              his bed for a decade without knowing its worth, authorities claim.</p>
              <p>The
               man found the 34 kilogram pearl inside a giant clam that was snagged by
               his anchor as he waited out a storm at sea, according to local tourism 
              department chief Cynthia Amurao, who is also his aunt.</p>
              <p>Not knowing
               it could be worth tens of millions of dollars, he kept the 30cm by 60cm
               pearl in his thatch hut on the western Philippine island of Palawan, 
              tucked under a wooden bed as a good-luck charm, Ms Amurao added.</p>
              <p>In
               July, the nephew moved to a new address and took the object to his aunt
               in a tricycle, asking her to hide it for him, said Ms Amurao, the city 
              tourism officer for Puerto Princesa, the provincial capital.</p>
              <p>"I was awestruck when I saw it just sitting on the dinner table," she said.</p>
              <p>She
               described the fisherman as a member of the tiny Cuyonon 
              ethno-linguistic group who live in a few small islands off Palawan, the 
              biggest island in the south-west of the Philippines surrounded by the 
              South China Sea and the Sulu Sea.</p>
              <p>"I
               told him it would be pointless to hide it as we do not know its value. 
              Why don’t we put it on public display instead," she said.</p>
              <p>With his
               consent, the pearl was put on display at the city hall of Puerto 
              Princesa, the provincial capital, on Monday and photos were posted on 
              the government’s Facebook page.</p>
              <p>Officials are hoping gemmologists will visit the city to assess its quality and value.</p>
              <p>The
               14-kilogramme "Pearl of Allah", also known as the "Pearl of Lao Tzu", 
              is often referred to as the world’s largest. It was also found off 
              Palawan, in the 1930s, and has been appraised by gemmologists at tens of
               millions of dollars.</p>
              <p>Puerto
               Princesa city information officer Richard Ligad confirmed Ms Amurao’s 
              account and said the man who found it could be in for a massive change 
              in his life’s fortunes.</p>
              <p>"He has not signed any deed of donation [to the city] so it remains his property," Mr Ligad said.</p>
