              <p>BANG KHUN THIAN, Thailand: Revving
               up his engine as the monsoon clouds begin to open, Nopadol Choihirun 
              steers his weathered boat under a two-lane bridge to keep his pile of 
              envelopes and parcels dry.</p>
              <p>Dodging the downpour is a 
              regular challenge for the 55-year-old, one of Bangkok's last remaining 
              postmen to deliver mail by boat to waterfront homes in low-lying parts 
              of the capital.</p>
              <p>"I have to be really careful to watch the
               clouds," he said from beneath the shelter of the bridge, munching on a 
              banana as the droplets began to fall.</p>

              <p>The genial postman criss-crosses 
              the swampy canal in Bang Khun Thian district twice a week. Residents 
              know their mail has arrived by the sound of his rusty engine - and the 
              barking it provokes from the suburb's dogs.</p>
              <p>Drift wood and trash that often get stuck in the boat propeller make the job a daily adventure.</p>
              <br>
              <div class="pw-hidden-cp">
              <p>But Nopadal says the work is about more than just handing out goods.</p>
              <p>"This
               is better than sitting at the office or riding the bikes. I meet with 
              the people and interact with them more," he told AFP as he called out to
               waterfront residents while steering his boat.</p>

              <div class="pw-hidden-cp">
              <p>A veteran mailman who switched to 
              the boat service five years ago, Nopadol is taken with the languorous 
              charm of Thailand's canal life.</p>
              <p>"Some villagers invite me
               in for lunch or try to offer me a glass or a bottle of water. This is 
              the charm of my job and it makes me happy," he said.</p>
              <p>Yet 
              the profession is increasingly threatened by booming development in 
              Bangkok's sprawling metropolis, with canals paved over and waterfront 
              homes torn down.</p>

              <p><strong>VENICE OF THE EAST</strong></p>
              <p>With an extensive network of moats and man-made canals, Bangkok is often dubbed the "Venice of the East".</p>
              <p>The
               riverine landscape that snakes through the city and connects to the 
              mighty Chaophraya River was once home to thriving communities and trade 
              hubs, where boats played a vital role for transport and commuting.</p>

              <p>But rapid urbanisation has seen the capital's population explode and move into ever-higher skyscrapers and condos.</p>
              <p>"Former
               residents in Bang Khun Tian have either moved out of the canal side or 
              left the elders at home" said Kijja Phaukmoungsri, assistant director of
               the local post office that runs the service.</p>
              <p>The need for floating postmen has steadily diminished, with only seven post offices in Bangkok still carrying the service today.</p>
              <p>Costly fuel is another downside of boat deliveries, which are 10 times more expensive than distributing mail by road.</p>
              <p>But
               for those still living along the canals, the service is indispensable, 
              even if most of the snail mail consists of little more than water and 
              electricity bills.</p>
              <p>"We live along the canal and there's 
              no road access. For sure, a mail service like this one is much needed," 
              said Pacharee Kladpipoon, a waterfront villager.</p>
