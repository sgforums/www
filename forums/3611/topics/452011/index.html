              <h3>BEAUTIFUL twin sisters Vicki and Valerie Darger are so close they even share their HUSBAND.</h3>
              <p>The 42-year-old sisters are in a polygamous marriage with Joe, 43, who is also married to a third woman — their <strong>COUSIN</strong> Alina, 43.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/05/02/article-2138349-12E197A3000005DC-943_634x382.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="382"></p>
              <p>The Dargers, who are fundamentalist Mormons from Salt Lake City, Utah, live together in a large family home and have 24 children between them.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/05/02/article-2138349-12E19D78000005DC-127_634x403.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="403"></p>
              <p>Vicki, currently a stay-at-home mum, has been married to Joe for 22 years, while Valerie joined the family as his third wife in 2000.</p>
              <p>Valerie, who works in the family cleaning business with Alina, said: "The fact that Joe was married to Vicki didn't bother me at all. I took it as a sign he would be a good husband for me as well.</p>
              <p>"As teenagers, Vicki and I liked some of the same guys. I thought it might even be good if we married the same man."</p>
              <p>Vicki added: "I know that some people are uncomfortable at the thought of two sisters sharing a husband.</p>
              <p>"But there's a good chance if a husband is compatible with one sister, he'll be well matched with another."</p>
              <p>Brave Joe, who runs a construction business, was just 18 when he began dating Vicki and her cousin Alina at the <strong>SAME TIME</strong>, and married them in a joint wedding ceremony in 1990.</p>
              <p>"Even in our community joint courtships are rare," said Vicki. "We knew we were taking on a huge challenge and responsibility.</p>
              <p>"The accepted pattern in our culture is for a couple to prove themselves first in a monogamous marriage, before taking on the challenges of a second wife."</p>
              <p>Describing their joint dates, Joe said: "Since Alina and Vicki were close friends and were interested in pursuing me together, the best thing I could do was to nurture that combined friendship.</p>
              <p>"I was attracted to both girls and knew that individual relationships would develop in time."</p>
              <p>The three were married in a traditional religious service at home, followed by a civil register office ceremony where Alina became Joe's legal wife, while Vicki acted as a witness.</p>
              <p>But in the eyes of their fundamentalist Mormon religion, all three women are equally married to Joe.</p>
              <p>They each have their own bedroom, and Joe alternates between the three rooms each evening.</p>
              <p>Vicki and Alina had been married to Joe for ten years when they both encouraged him to start pursuing a relationship with Vicki's twin, Valerie</p>
              <p>Valerie had just gone through a divorce after her marriage – to a man with six wives – broke down due to his gambling and abusive treatment.</p>
              <p>One evening, while Valerie and her five children were staying with the Darger family, she felt a sudden spark of chemistry with Joe.</p>
              <p>Vicki said: "I noticed how they looked at each other. There was a spark, but I wasn't jealous.</p>
              <p>"I wanted her to join our family and have a happy marriage. In our culture it's not uncommon for siblings to share husbands."</p>
              <p>Joe admitted: "I had a connection with Valerie, but the fact she was Vicki's twin was weird – they both had the same mannerisms. But Vicki opened my mind to it."</p>
              <p>Joe and Valerie married in a service in their home, with Vicki and Alina standing beside them, and celebrated with a family meal.</p>
              <p>The three wives and their husband have co-written a book Love Times Three, and some of their adult children also contributed to the story.</p>
              <p>"We hope that by talking about our way of life, polygamy will step closer to being an accepted lifestyle and the laws that criminalise it might change," said Joe.</p>
