              <p>Stanley Thornton is 31, but his greatest pleasure comes from wearing a diaper, drinking his bottle and sucking on his pacifier.</p>
              <p>He knows he is overaged and oversized for such games, but since his early teens, Thornton has found comfort in his private obsession. He even has a crib -- 3 feet long and 6 feet wide.</p>
              <p>"I found a way to make it work," said Thornton, a former security expert from Redding, Calif. "It's a twin bed with four side rails."</p>
              <p>Thornton's obsession started when he was 13 and he began wetting the bed.</p>
              <p>"I wore diapers so I didn't have to change the sheets all the time," he said. "I got that childish feeling and decided to explore that. The next time, I got a bottle and pacifier and really enjoyed it. It gave me a safe feeling."</p>
              <p>He even has a "mommy," who enjoys nurturing and tending his every need. He met her online, and there are others in cyberspace who also enjoy the activity.</p>
              <p>Thornton's secret life as a baby will be revealed tonight in TLC's series, "My Crazy Obsession," which airs at 10 p.m. Already the television series has profiled a couple with  <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/crazy-obsession-couple-owns-5000-cabbage-patch-kids/story?id=15828541">500 Cabbage Patch dolls.</a></p>
              <p>Next week, TLC will feature Fred and Robert, who have a rare collection of vintage washing machines; Anthony, the airline memorabilia addict; and Melanie, a woman who is crazy about her pet capybara, a rodent-like creature, named Gari.</p>

              <p>Some are innocent collectors, but Thornton's obsession reaches deep into
                   his psyche. He was abused as a child and behaving like a baby seems to 
                  relieve the associated trauma and anxiety.</p>
              <p>He lived with both parents until he was 12, when they divorced, then moved in with his father until he was 16. "They had no idea [about the baby role-playing] or the bed wetting until I was 21," he said.</p>
              <p>"It wasn't too hard to keep secret," said Thornton. "Dad worked all the time and I had the house to myself."</p>
              <p>Later, he would go to the local park observatory and find a table in a secluded area to have his bottle. "I'd find a picnic table and watch the birds," said Thornton.</p>
              <p>In 2000, Thornton had a breakdown and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and has been on disability ever since. He sees a counselor weekly, who theorizes that his obsession with babyhood is a "good coping mechanism."</p>
              <p>His disorder is broadly classified as <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15990552">paraphilic infantilism</a>, which is considered within the spectrum of obsessive-compulsive conditions, which predominantly affects males. It is also associated with compulsive sexual, mood and personality disorders, according to psychiatric studies from the National Institutes of Health.</p>
              <p>But Thornton insists his fetish is not sexual, like many others in the online adult baby world.</p>
              <p>"For me, it's all about comfort," he said. "A few in the community find it sexual, but I think [that] taints it, it takes away the innocence."</p>
              <p>"I am not doing drugs or alcohol and it does not harm. I only do it a couple of hours a day, and soon I go back to my regular life," said Thornton.</p>
              <p>In 2002, he moved in with a friend – his baby mommy, Pam. "She loved being able to do all the nurturing," he explained. "She had lost two kids. Miscarriage played a role."</p>
              <p>With a play mother, "it was a lot more fun," he said. "It was more than just role-playing. She was like a second mom and was there to help me with different problems."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>His World is Half Adult, Half Baby</h3>
              <p>Today, he rents a 10-by-10-foot room by himself. Like his  personality, the room is split between the adult world and the baby world. His nursery side has a crib and a high chair. The other half is "more or less" a living room with a television, deep-freeze, lounge chair and his computer.</p>
              <p>His favorite pastimes are watching children's cable channels and listening to kid's music. He also likes to play with Lincoln Logs and Play-Doh. Last year he met another adult baby in his hometown and they have fun playing together.</p>
              <p>He has met others in online communities dedicated to the art of playing baby and baby mommy. The two most popular websites are <a href="http://www.dailydiapers.com/">Daily Diapers</a> and <a href="http://www.adisc.org/forum/">ADISC</a>, for those who love diapers and need support in their obsession.</p>

              <div id="quigo_ad" class="rel_container g_4"></div>
              <p>The biggest challenge for Thornton is the realization that others outside these communities think he is weird.</p>
              <p>"When I try to talk to someone about it who hasn't heard of it, my mind jumps around trying to explain what really is going on -- that it isn't a problem, like they think it is," he said.</p>
              <p>"I tell them I sit down and enjoy role-playing for an hour or two a day to relax," said Thornton. "I tell them it's basically coloring, playing with blocks and watching kids' movies."</p>
              <p>One neighbor who hadn't known about Thornton's life style was sympathetic when she learned about it while helping him move.</p>
              <p>"She took it pretty good," he said. "She was open-minded and we talked."</p>
              <p>They have been good friends ever since.</p>
              <p>"I am fine right now," he said. "Accepting it has made me a happier person than if I try to deny it."</p>
              <p>Stanley says he has never been in love, but he would love to find someone to marry.</p>
              <p>"I'd like to become a dad some day," he said wistfully. "I'd like to look for someone to settle down with and have a family."</p>
