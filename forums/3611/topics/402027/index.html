              <h1>Mobile phones responsible for disappearance of honey bee</h1>
              <div class="firstPar">
              <p>Their disappearance has caused alarm throughout
               Europe and North America where campaigners have blamed agricultural 
              pesticides, climate change and the advent of genetically modified crops 
              for what is now known as 'colony collapse disorder.' Britain has seen a 
              15 per cent decline in its bee population in the last two years and 
              shrinking numbers has led to a rise in thefts of hives.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>Now researchers from Chandigarh's Punjab 
              University claim they have found the cause which could be the first step
               in reversing the decline: They have established that radiation from 
              mobile telephones is a key factor in the phenomenon and say that it 
              probably interfering with the bee's navigation senses.</p>
              <p>They set up a controlled experiment in Punjab earlier this year 
              comparing the behaviour and productivity of bees in two hives – one 
              fitted with two mobile telephones which were powered on for two fifteen 
              minute sessions per day for three months. The other had dummy models 
              installed.</p>
              <p>After three months the researchers recorded a dramatic 
              decline in the size of the hive fitted with the mobile phon, a 
              significant reduction in the number of eggs laid by the queen bee. The 
              bees also stopped producing honey.</p>
              <p>The queen bee in the "mobile" 
              hive produced fewer than half of those created by her counterpart in the
               normal hive.</p>
              <p>They also found a dramatic decline in the number of 
              worker bees returning to the hive after collecting pollen. Because of 
              this the amount of nectar produced in the hive also shrank.</p>
              <p>Ved 
              Prakash Sharma and Neelima Kumar, the authors of the report in the 
              journal Current Science, wrote: "Increase in the usage of electronic 
              gadgets has led to electropollution of the environment. Honeybee 
              behaviour and biology has been affected by electrosmog since these 
              insects have magnetite in their bodies which helps them in navigation.</p>
              <p>"There
               are reports of sudden disappearance of bee populations from honeybee 
              colonies. The reason is still not clear. We have compared the 
              performance of honeybees in cellphone radiation exposed and unexposed 
              colonies.</p>
              <p>"A significant decline in colony strength and in the 
              egg laying rate of the queen was observed. The behaviour of exposed 
              foragers was negatively influenced by the exposure, there was neither 
              honey nor pollen in the colony at the end of the experiment."</p>
              <p>Tim 
              Lovett, of the British Beekeepers Association, said that hives have been
               successful in London where there was high mobile phone use.</p>
              <p>"Previous
               work in this area has indicated this [mobile phone use] is not a real 
              factor," he said. "If new data comes along we will look at it."</p>
              <p>He
               said: "At the moment we think is more likely to be a combination of 
              factors including disease, pesticides and habitat loss."</p>
              <p>The UK 
              Government has set aside £10 million for research into the decline of 
              pollinators like bees, but the BBKA claim much more money is needed for 
              research into the problem, including studies on pesticides, disease and 
              new technology like mobile phones.</p>
              <p>According to the University of 
              Durham, England's bees are vanishing faster than anywhere else in 
              Europe, with more than half of hives dying out over the last 20 
              years.</p>
              <p>The most recent statistics from last winter show that the 
              decline in honey bees in Britain is slowing, with just one in six hives 
              lost.</p>
              <p>This is still above the natural rate of ten per cent losses,
               but a vast improvement on previous years.</p>
              <p>There has been an 
              increase in the number of thefts of hives across the world and in 
              Germany beekeepers have started fitting GPS tracking devices to their 
              hives.</p>
