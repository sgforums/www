              <p>True blue flowers are a rarity in nature—they occur only in select 
              species like morning glories and delphiniums. Now, researchers have 
              created a genuinely blue chrysanthemum by adding two genes to the 
              normally pink or reddish flower. The advance could be applied to other 
              species—and it may mean that florists wanting to hawk blooms of blue 
              will no longer have to dye them.</p>
              <p>“This [advance] is of great impact,” says Toru Nakayama, a plant 
              biochemist at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan, who was not involved 
              with the work. There are several popular commercial species for which no
               true blue varieties exist, he notes.</p>
              <p>We all think we’ve seen blue flowers before. And in some cases, it’s 
              true. But according to the Royal Horticultural Society’s color scale—the
               gold standard for flowers—most “blues” are really violet or purple. 
              Florists and gardeners are forever on the lookout for new colors and 
              varieties of plants, however, but making popular ornamental and cut 
              flowers, like roses, vibrant blue has proved quite difficult. “We’ve all
               been trying to do this for a long time and it’s never worked 
              perfectly,” says Thomas Colquhoun, a plant biotechnologist at the 
              University of Florida in Gainesville who was not involved with the work.</p>
              <p>True blue requires complex chemistry. Anthocyanins—pigment molecules 
              in the petals, stem, and fruit—consist of rings that cause a flower to 
              turn red, purple, or blue, depending on what sugars or other groups of 
              atoms are attached. Conditions inside the plant cell also matter. So 
              just transplanting an anthocyanin from a blue flower like a delphinium 
              didn’t really work.</p>
              <p>Naonobu Noda, a plant biologist at the National Agriculture and Food 
              Research Organization in Tsukuba, Japan, tackled this problem by first 
              putting a gene from a bluish flower called the Canterbury bell into a 
              chrysanthemum. The gene’s protein modified the chrysanthemum’s 
              anthocyanin to make the bloom appear purple instead of reddish. To get 
              closer to blue, Noda and his colleagues then added a second gene, this 
              one from the blue-flowering butterfly pea. This gene’s protein adds a 
              sugar molecule to the anthocyanin. The scientists thought they would 
              need to add a third gene,</p>
              <p>“That allowed them to get the best blue they could obtain,” says Neil
               Anderson, a horticultural scientist at the University of Minnesota in 
              St. Paul who was not involved with the work.</p>
              <p>Chemical analyses showed that the blue color came about in just two 
              steps because the chrysanthemums already had a colorless component that 
              interacted with the modified anthocyanin to create the blue color. “It 
              was a stroke of luck,” Colquhoun says. Until now, researchers had 
              thought it would take many more genes to make a flower blue, Nakayama 
              adds.</p>
              <p>The next step for Noda and his colleagues is to make blue 
              chrysanthemums that can’t reproduce and spread into the environment, 
              making it possible to commercialize the transgenic flower. But that 
              approach could spell trouble
               in some parts of the world. “As long as GMO [genetically modified 
              organism] continues to be a problem in Europe, blue [flowers] face a 
              difficult economic future,” predicts Ronald Koes, a plant molecular 
              biologist at the University of Amsterdam who was not involved with the 
              work. But others think this new blue flower will prevail. “It’s 
              certainly an advance for the retail florist,” Anderson says. “It would 
              have a lot of market value worldwide.”</p>
              <p>As for Noda and other scientists, the blue blooms mean that at long 
              last, they understand the biochemistry of this remarkable color.</p>
