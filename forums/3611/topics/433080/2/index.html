              <p>The New Zealand <strong>lost baby emperor penguin</strong> has turned into a celebrity and captured hearts of millions around the globe. Its life was once in danger and on 27th June, the bird was given endoscopic surgery. Now that it has got over the critical state, the penguin is offered <strong>a free ticket home</strong> should it be able to survive.  </p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>The future of the emperor penguin is still unknown. The good news is that <strong>Gareth Morgan</strong>, a New Zealand investment adviser, has offered to transport the penguin back to Antarctica in February 2012 when he leads an expedition to the southern continent. Before the penguin is fit for travel, it is staying in <strong>Wellington Zoo</strong> where it was given a room at 46°F and a bed of ice to sleep on.</p>

              <p>Lost emperor penguin <strong>Happy Feet</strong> looks set to carry on in the manner in which he's become accustomed thanks to pledges of support from New Zealand companies.</p>
              <p>The by now world-famous penguin was found about 4000 kilometres from home on Peka Peka Beach on the Kapiti Coast last month and is being kept at Wellington Zoo while he recovers from emergency surgery. <br><br>He is still undergoing procedures after swallowing large amounts of sand and the zoo has asked for public help to pay for his ongoing treatment. <br><br>Happy Feet is eating solid food again, and is currently eating 2kg of salmon a day. His emperor sized appetite will be satisfied for a while with a donation from Marlborough based company <strong>New Zealand King Salmon</strong>, which has given 100kg of salmon smolt (juvenile fish) to the zoo. <br><br>"We usually supply the Wellington Zoo with salmon smolt when it is available and knowing that our salmon is a treat for penguins we did double our supply," marketing manager <strong>Stephen Gibson</strong> said. <br><br>Snack-food company <strong>Bluebird</strong> - which uses penguins in its marketing of chips - is also chipping in. Five cents from every 150g bag of its <strong>Kiwi As</strong> chippies sold before November will go towards Happy Feet's upkeep. <br><br>"Penguins are close to our heart so naturally we've been following this story closely," managing director <strong>Gerard Smith</strong> said. <br><br>"We're happy we can do our part in helping Happy Feet return to the ocean and also support treatment for other penguins at Wellington Zoo." <br><br>Between now and November, Bluebird expects to sell around 400,000 packets of Kiwi As chips - based on sales figures to date - which could raise at least $20,000.</p>

              <p>Happy Feet may be leaving New Zealand shores as early as next month.</p>
              <p>The emperor penguin has been cared for at the Wellington Zoo since it was found on Peka Peka Beach last month.</p>
              <p>Zoo spokeswoman Kate Baker told the Herald last night that Happy Feet could be returned to the Southern Ocean as early as next month.</p>
              <p>"It's looking like it will be about mid to late August. Right now we're just figuring out how we will release him," she said.</p>
              <p>Ms Baker said the penguin was doing better and better each day and had gained 1.6kg when he was weighed on Friday.</p>
              <p>He is about 24kg now, she said.</p>
              <p>"At this stage, we're still taking care of him, obviously. He's continuing to gain weight and is looking good."</p>
              <p>More than 600 broad-billed prion birds are being cared for at the zoo.</p>
              <p>The injured birds are among hundreds found on the country's beaches after a massive storm last week.</p>
              <p>Therefore Happy Feet was no longer the only bird in the spotlight, Ms Baker said.</p>
              <p>"He's still a favourite with staff, though."</p>
              <p>The zoo is still receiving donations from the public for the Happy Feet appeal.</p>

              <h1 class="singlePageTitle">NZ’s lost penguin to hitch home on research ship</h1>
              <p>WELLINGTON, New Zealand – A wayward Emperor penguin that washed up in New Zealand will be shipped back to sub-antarctic waters later this month on a scientific research vessel, Wellington Zoo said Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The adult male penguin, nicknamed “Happy Feet”, was found wandering on a beach near the capital in June and taken to the zoo to recuperate when he became ill after eating sand and sticks.</p>
              <p>With the bird, only the second Emperor penguin ever recorded in New Zealand, restored to full health, zoo chief executive Karen Fifield said plans had been finalised to ship him back to the Southern Ocean.</p>
              <p>Fifield said the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) ship Tangaroa would set sail from Wellington on August 29 with the penguin aboard.</p>
              <p>The ship, which will carry out research into Southern Ocean fisheries, will release the bird four days into the voyage near Campbell Island, which is within the normal feeding range of Emperor penguins.</p>
              <p>“This is an excellent result for everyone involved, and for the penguin, and is a great example of organisations working together for the best outcome,” Fifield said.</p>
              <p>The hope is that Happy Feet will swim home to Antarctica, where Emperor penguins live in colonies ranging in size from a few hundred to more than 20,000 pairs.</p>
              <p>“The NIWA team are looking forward to having this extra special guest onboard the vessel with us for the journey,” research manager Rob Murdoch said.</p>
              <p>“Happy Feet has captured the hearts of New Zealanders and people across the world, and we’re pleased to be able to help safely return him to the Southern Ocean.”</p>
              <p>While aboard the ship, Happy Feet will be housed in a specially designed crate that Fifield said would keep him “cold and comfortable”, with a vet and two NIWA staff to look after him.</p>
              <p>The penguin will be fitted with a satellite tracking device before he is released, so scienctist and the public can track his progress on the zoo’s website.</p>
              <p>It is thought the bird fell ill on the beach after mistaking sand for snow and eating it in a bid to lower his temperature, clogging his gut and leading to a series of operations to clear his stomach.</p>
              <p>A diet of “fish milkshakes” at the zoo has seen Happy Feet’s weight increase four kilograms (nine pounds) to 26 kilograms, giving him sufficient reserves for what will still be an arduous 2,000 kilometre (1,250 mile) swim home.</p>
              <p>The Emperor penguin is the largest species of the distinctive waddling creature and can grow up to 1.15 metres (3ft 9in) tall.</p>
              <p>The reason for Happy Feet’s appearance in New Zealand remains a mystery, although experts say Emperor penguins take to the open sea during the Antarctic summer and this one may have simply wandered further than most.</p>

              <p><img src="http://wfie.images.worldnow.com/images/15348258_BG1.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><span id="WNStoryDateline">Wellington, New Zealand (NBC) - </span></p>
              <p>Hundreds of people lined up at the Wellington Zoo on Sunday to say goodbye to a stray emperor penguin nicknamed Happy Feet.<br><br>Zoo staff gave Happy Feet one last check up before his trip back to Antarctica.</p>
              <p>The penguin washed up on a New Zealand beach 2,500 miles from his home and became an overnight star. <br><br>Veterinarians removed 6.6 pounds of sand from his stomach. Experts said Happy Feet probably ate the sand thinking it was snow. <br><br>On Monday, Happy Feet will start his long trip home on board a national institute for water and atmospheric research vessel. <br><br>Zookeepers have attached a GPS tracker to him. <br><br>He will be released about four days out to sea from the research vessel's final destination.</p>

              <p>The beloved emperor penguin is finally on his way home after a three-month detour to New Zealand.</p>
              <p>Sent off Sunday morning in the Southern Ocean, Happy Feet needed “some gentle encouragement” to leave the comfort of his handlers. He slid backwards down a makeshift slide that dropped him into the ocean just 2,000 km (1240 miles) from his Antarctic home. "Once he hit the water he spared no time in diving off away from the boat," veterinarian Lisa Argilla said.</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">But now, healthy and – most assuredly – happy, he's en route to his homeland. We hope his penguin brethren have quite a homecoming party planned.<br></div>
