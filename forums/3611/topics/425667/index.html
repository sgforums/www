              <p>BOULDER - Abby Toll cried as she told a judge she was sorry for taping an 11-pound Shiba Inu to a boyfriend's refrigerator.</p>
              <p>Minutes later, a Boulder judge sentenced 21-year-old Toll to 30 days in jail and three years of probation.</p>
              <p>It was less than the 90 days prosecutors had sought, but more than her defense attorney felt was appropriate.</p>
              <p>Judge Maria Berkenkotter called Toll's actions "bizarre, senseless and cruel" before sentencing the former University of Colorado student to jail.</p>
              <p>"This wasn't an act that occurred in a flash," she said. "Ms. Toll had to have thought it through."</p>
              <p>Boulder investigators believe Toll bound the little dog's snout and legs before using packing tape to tie "Rex" upside down on her then-boyfriend's fridge in April of last year. Earlier this year, a Boulder jury found Toll guilty of aggravated animal cruelty.</p>
              <p>Technically Toll faced up to 18 months in jail, but the judge decided that wasn't appropriate considering, at least in part, that Toll had no previous criminal history.</p>
              <p>Prosecutors had sought to bring "Rex" into the courtroom for Friday's sentencing hearing. The judge denied the request.</p>
              <p>Toll's defense argued at Friday's sentencing hearing that Toll was the victim of an abusive relationship.</p>
              <p>Joshua Maximon told the judge that Toll's boyfriend had been "predatory" and involved in "stalking" like behavior.</p>
              <p>"This night was completely out of character [for Toll]," Maximon said. "She's a good person."</p>
              <p>Prosecutors countered saying that Toll's boyfriend could not have led her to tape the dog the way she did.</p>
              <p>"I think that it's very unfortunate that [Toll] continues to minimize her responsibility," Boulder prosecutor Lisa Pearson said. "She just does not grasp the gravity of what she did."</p>
              <p>Toll appeared shaken in front of the judge.</p>
              <p>"There has not been one day that I haven't thought of Rex and the pain he went though," Toll</p>

              <p>"There has not been one day that I haven't thought of Rex and the pain he went though," Toll explained to the judge. "It's now my duty to prove to society that I am not the monster they claim me to be." explained to the judge. "It's now my duty to prove to society that I am not the monster they claim me to be."</p>
              <p>Toll's mother explained that her daughter actually grew up loving animals.</p>
              <p>"Her history with animals is extraordinary," Sherry Toll said. "Her real true love are dogs," she added as she held up a collage of images of Abby Toll and various animals.</p>
              <p>Rex is now known as "Yoshi." Yoshi's new owner attended Friday's sentencing hearing as well.</p>
              <p>"Sadness is what I feel for [Toll]. What she did was reprehensible. It's terrible and to think that she chose to do this, that she did this to herself, it's depressing," Shannon Park said.</p>
              <p>Toll was quiet when she was led away from the courtroom in handcuffs. She now lives in Chicago and will serve her probation there.</p>
