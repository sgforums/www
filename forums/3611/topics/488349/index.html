              girls will exchange bracelets and gifts with their closest friends, but 
              one eight-year-old has been receiving trinkets from a more unusual 
              source - the birds in her garden.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Gabi Mann, from Seattle, Washington, feeds the crows that visit her home with peanuts and they bring her gifts in exchange.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>The
               youngster has built up collection of more than 70 shiny beads, buttons,
               pieces of metal, brightly coloured plastic and foam - all left for her 
              by her corvid companions.</span></p>

              <div style="overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;"><span>Perhaps the most touching is a metal 
              fragment with the word 'best' written on it - one half of a pendant that
               would be completed by the word 'friend' if reunited with the other 
              part.</span>
              <div style="overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;"><br>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Among her most prized presents from the neighbourhood crows is a pearl-coloured heart.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>'It's showing me how much they love me,' Gabi told the podcast The bittersweet life and the BBc<a style="font-weight: bold;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-31604026"></a>.Â 'They give me all the special stuff you could ever find.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>'We
               know these are from the crows that sometimes they are rusted and dirty 
              and nothing like what a person would carry around. Sometimes we find 
              them on the bird feeder.'</span></p>

              <div style="overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;">Gabi and her mother leave nuts for the crows on a bird feeder (above) along with fresh water in a water bath
              <div style="overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;"><br>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Her strange relationship with the birds began in 2011 when as a four-year-old she would accidentally drop food.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Groups
               of crows began loitering around the family house hoping to pick up the 
              scraps Gabi left behind. When she started going to school, Gabi began 
              feeding them her lunch.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>The birds then started lining up to wait for the youngster to get off her bus at the end of the school day.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Two
               years later Gabi and her mother Lisa began leaving food outside in 
              their garden on a daily basis - filling the bird bath with water and 
              leaving peanuts on feeders.</span></p>
              <div style="overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;"><br>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>As Gabi throws the food for the birds, crowds of crows - known as a murder - gather on telephone lines and the nearby fence.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>In
               return the crows now leave trinkets on the empty bird feeder - 
              including a broken light bulb, earrings, pieces of Lego, rusted screws, 
              polished rocks and glass beads.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Gabi keeps all of the bits in carefully labelled pots and ranks them according to her favourite.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>She said: 'I think they know my favourite colour - blue. They know that I like Lego and shiny things. They are my type.'</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Crows are known to be highly intelligent creatures - capable of solving complex puzzles and problems to obtain food.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Experts
               say they can often form strong bonds with people that feed them, but 
              equally can mark out those that they consider a threat.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>People
               who have thrown stones at crows or tried to help an injured chick can 
              find themselves mobbed by the creatures for weeks or even years 
              afterwards.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>In
               perhaps the most astonishing story, however, Gabi's mother Lisa 
              describes how the crows in their neighbourhood appear to keep watch over
               the family.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/03/03/2627735600000578-2977278-Lisa_Mann_and_her_daughter_Gabi_above_have_formed_a_unique_bond_-a-30_1425382670470.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="386"></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>She said 
              that on one occassion she had been out taking photographs of an eagle 
              when she dropped her lens cap on the floor and forgot to pick it up 
              before walking home.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>She
               said: 'About an hour later I went back outside to see if I could find 
              it and a crow had put it on the side of one of the bird baths.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>'I
               looked at the surveillence video to find out if it was a crow and you 
              can see it bring it into the yard, walk it to the bird bath and spends 
              time rinsing the lens cap and puts it on the side of the bird bath. It 
              was pretty impressive.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>'I'm sure it was intentional. They watch us all the time.'</span></p>

              <div style="overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;">Gabi Mann keeps her collection of gifts from the birds carefully arranged in bags and pots shown above
              <div style="overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;">
              <p class="mol-para-with-font">Â </p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Gabi herself
               believes her relationship with the crows has given her a special bond 
              with the natural world and calls herself Nature Girl.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>She is highly protective of the gifts she has received from the birds, not allowing anyone to touch the trinkets.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Her mother said: 'For the most part the common denominator is that they are shiney and small enough to fit in their mouth.'</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Professor
               John Marzluff, an expert on avian social ecology at the University of 
              Washington, said he believes the crows may be offering up the gifts as 
              they would to a potential mate.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Speaking
               to The BitterSweet Life podcast, he said: 'I have seen an awful lot of 
              things crows bring people. They do bring gifts whether it is always 
              going to happen, I don't think so.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/03/03/2627734300000578-2977278-The_crows_regularly_carry_gifts_like_above_to_the_water_bath_and-a-26_1425382670140.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="427"></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>'Certain 
              individual crows the bond they form with that person might be more of a 
              courtship bond where they are bringing presents like they would for 
              their mates.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>'For some people they are dead baby birds and other people they get shiny pendants or beautiful glass.'</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>For anyone hoping to form a bond with some corvids, he has some advice.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>'The
               best thing you can do if you want to form a bond with a crow is to be 
              consistent in rewarding them for whatever the action is with a few 
              peanuts in the shell,' he said.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>'They
               like that food as it is a high fat high energy food and it makes noise 
              when you throw it on the ground.They quickly habituate to your routine. 
              They will follow you.'</span></p>
