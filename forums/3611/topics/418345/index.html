              <p class="articleabstract">What began as an innocent legacy from an elderly aunt has turned into an obsession with all things Christmas which has won retired Canadian teacher Jean-Guy Laquerre a place in the record books.</p>
              <p class="articleabstract"><img src="http://sgstb.msn.com/i/12/6571F3A1CF6093814FB9E91EC54F2C.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="178"></p>
              <p>That gift, an early 20th Century Santa figurine, "awakened the child in me," said Laquerre, with a twinkle in his eye looking around at his collection, describing his unusual yuletide fixation as "Santaphilia," a term he coined himself.</p>
              <p>"I started my collection in 1988. Over the past 22 years, I've accumulated 25,139 Santa baubles," he said proudly, with a chuckle.</p>
              <p>Every year as yuletide approaches he methodically unpacks his figurines and collections from their boxes to deck his modest home in eastern Ontario province in Canada.</p>
              <p>"I can't stop myself entirely, but I do restrain my urges. I surprise myself when I go into a store and I don't buy any new ones," confessed Laquerre, who bears more than just a passing resemblance to his Number One hero, with his white moustache, round cheeks and red Christmas hat.</p>
              <p>But then he added with a regretful air, "it's because I just don't have any more room for more figurines."</p>
              <p>Santa Claus figures whirl from the ceiling, others poke out red-cheeked and jolly-faced from the back of sofas; there are Santa tableclothes, cushions and blankets; dancing Santas, and Santa albums and from an earlier era, 1940s posters advertising Santa smoking cigarettes.</p>
              <p>Every room, every nook and cranny is plastered with the decorations, even the bathroom, which is resplendent with a Father Christmas toilet-seat cover, and boxes of Santa tissues.</p>
              <p>"It's just a small obsession," Laquerre said coyly, before breaking into a deep belly laugh as he surveyed his treasures.</p>
              <p>Still, he takes great pleasure in meticulously classifying them, including old Christmas albums and Christmas cards. Chocolate Santa Claus and other holiday treats -- most too old to eat -- are displayed separately on shelves in the living room.</p>
              <p>Other items in the collection are staggering: more than 1,300 table napkins bearing pictures of Santa Claus, all carefully catalogued and stored in plastic sleeves to keep them in pristine condition.</p>
              <p>As a child, Laquerre collected stamps, then labels from wine bottles before turning to Santa memorabilia.</p>
              <p>He broke the world record for owning the most Santa keepsakes in 2004, but it was not until 2009 that his name was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.</p>
              <p>"A Texas woman held the record for 30 years. She had 1,039 items. It was time that I came along and broke the record," he said.</p>
              <p>As his reputation has grown so has his collection. Laquerre now boasts Christmas bric-a-brac from around the world, such as a hand-made reproduction of Santa's workshop that took a French-Moroccan friend some 600 hours to build.</p>
              <p>Laquerre says he hopes the entire collection will some day be displayed in a museum.</p>
              <p>But some might argue that his home is already a shrine dedicated to Old Saint Nick and ablaze with the spirit of Christmas.</p>
