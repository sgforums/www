              <p>(Morocco) The doors are blue, sidewalks are blue, stairs are blue, it seems like 
              everything is blue, welcome to Chefchaouen, the blue village!</p>
              <p>Besides being well known for its bright blue buildings, Chefchaouen is full of vast history expanding hundreds of years.</p>
              <p>The village might be old but it’s a comfortable place to travel, with delicious restaurants and comfortable accommodations.</p>
              <p>And if blue is your favorite color, you might as well just move here.</p>
              <p>Located
               in the Rif mountains of Morocco, all of the buildings in this village 
              were once white, but as history unfolded so did the colors of the 
              community.</p>
              <p>Chefchaouen was originally established way back in 1471, back when 
              Moorish and Jewish refugees came here after fleeing from the Reconquista
               of Spain.</p>
              <p><img src="http://cdn.earthporm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/blue-streets-of-chefchaouen-morocco-3.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="585"></p>
              <p>When Hitler’s growing power drove Jews from their homes in the 1930s, 
              many refugees once again fled to safety in Chefchaouen. It was these 
              people that painted the town the vivid shade of blue it is known for 
              today</p>
              <p><img src="http://cdn.earthporm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/blue-streets-of-chefchaouen-morocco-4.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="586"></p>
              <p>In Judaism, blue represents the sky as well as the heavens, reminding 
              everyone to live a life full of spiritual awareness.  Back in the late 
              1400’s Jews that fled to Sfed also painted their homes blue as a source 
              of inspiration.</p>

              <p>It’s rumored that the buildings might also be painted blue because it helps to keep away the mosquitos.</p>
              <p><img src="http://cdn.earthporm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/blue-streets-of-chefchaouen-morocco-6.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="582"></p>
              <p>While mosquitoes swarm near water, they actually don’t like clear 
              flowing water, which is exactly what Chefchaouen buildings look like. 
              It’s easier to get confused than you might think, walking down some of 
              the tight blue allies that lead place to place, it can start to feel 
              like you are swimming.</p>

              <p>When the blue ground becomes wet it seriously starts to look like a wondrous water world</p>

              <p>Until 1948, most of the Jewish families remained living here happily 
              amongst their neighbors, Muslim and native Berber families. But in 1948,
               most of the Jewish families left for Israel.</p>

              <p>Despite their absence, the bright blue color remains a staple of the 
              village. In fact, every spring villagers apply a new coat of blue paint.
               The local government supplies special paintbrushes to assist in efforts
               to keep Chefchaouen’s history alive.</p>

              <p>While blue is clearly the most popular color in town, displays of pink, 
              green, and yellow can also be found throughout the village. No matter 
              what, there is never enough blue around here for the locals. Local women
               even wear kaftans in shades of electric blue to match their 
              surroundings.</p>

              <p>There are approximately 40,000 people that call Chefchaouen home, all of
               which take pride in keeping the blue buildings looking good, especially
               the women.</p>

              <p>Not only do locals enjoy the symbolism behind the blue, but they also 
              say that it helps keep their homes cooler. Tourists are welcomed with 
              open arms, as locals love to show off their amazing village and all that
               it has to offer.</p>

              <p>Some visitors don’t necessarily come for the blue buildings though, 
              lured here instead by the availability of marijuana, or kif, which is 
              grown in the surrounding mountains.</p>

              <p>If the bright colors of the blue village aren’t enough to draw you in for a visit, the locals are extremely friendly.</p>

              <p>At the heart of the median is the Main Square; here locals and tourists 
              enjoy an array of delicious restaurants, cafes, shops and easily 
              socialization.</p>

              <p>With such a light-hearted and happy atmosphere, you’d have to be a
