              <p class="story-body-text story-content">PHNOM
               PENH, Cambodia — Ouch Leng, an environmental activist who operates 
              undercover to fight illegal logging, has had some close scrapes in what 
              is by all accounts a hazardous line of work — 14 Cambodian land and 
              environmental defenders were killed between 2005 and 2014, the 
              London-based advocacy group Global Witness has reported.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">For
               a few hours a couple of years ago, Mr. Leng feared he was going to be 
              next. He and some other activists had stopped inside Virachey National 
              Park, near the Vietnamese border, to ask some loggers for directions to a
               nearby timber concession.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">But
               the loggers, their suspicions aroused, summoned a cadre of Cambodian 
              soldiers, who searched the activists and then ordered them at gunpoint 
              to drive to a ranger station about four hours away. “We were all 
              panicked,” Mr. Leng said.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">They
               escaped by alertly veering onto a dirt path that was too narrow for the
               soldiers’ trucks and driving all night to safety. “It was worth the 
              risk,” Mr. Leng said, noting that he had managed to conceal from the 
              soldiers two cameras he was carrying that were loaded with photos and 
              videos of illegal logging.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">For
               Mr. Leng, mortal danger is an acceptable occupational hazard in a 
              country where powerful tycoons operate vast illegal timber concessions 
              inside protected forests — some of Southeast Asia’s best, and last, 
              reservoirs of biodiversity.</p>
              <div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"></div>
              <p id="story-continues-1" class="story-body-text story-content">In
               dozens of trips since 2011, he has gone undercover, posing as a manual 
              laborer in the logging industry, to film and photograph illegal logging 
              and track timber from Cambodia’s
               forests to its seaports. He has also carved out a profile in the 
              capital, Phnom Penh, as a prominent critic of logging companies and the 
              government’s forestry policies.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“Many
               people from local and international N.G.O.s are not willing to work 
              with me because they don’t want to deal with sensitive issues,” Mr. Leng
               said, referring to nongovernmental organizations.</p>
              <p id="story-continues-3" class="story-body-text story-content">He added with a chuckle, “They don’t even want to join me for a meal or a drink.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Mr.
               Leng’s supporters say he has an unusually broad range of assets, 
              including a national network of contacts, a law degree, broad knowledge 
              of the forests and an insatiable urge to document illegal logging in 
              Cambodia’s rugged borderlands.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">But they worry that those assets could also make him a target of violence as his prominence grows.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“Sooner
               or later, he has to decide if he wants to be public or undercover,” 
              said Marcus Hardtke, a veteran environmental activist in Phnom Penh. “He
               cannot be both forever.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Cambodia’s
               national forest cover has fallen to between 55 and 60 percent from 73 
              percent in 1993, Forest Trends, a research group in Washington, said in a
               2015 <a href="http://forest-trends.org/releases/uploads/Cambodia%2520Concessions%2520Report%2520small%2520size.pdf?version=meter+at+3&amp;module=meter-Links&amp;pgtype=article&amp;contentId=&amp;mediaId=&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com.sg&amp;priority=true&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=meter-links-click">report</a>.
               Much of the deforestation since 2005 has been a result of illegal 
              logging in and around protected forests that are included in land 
              concessions under Cambodia’s opaque forestry rules, the report said.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Mr.
               Leng said that he had visited 50 or 60 such concessions, often in 
              tandem with local volunteer activists, and that one of his primary 
              targets had been Try Pheap, a prominent Cambodian businessman with 
              logging operations throughout the country.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">In
               January, Cambodia said it had canceled 26 land concessions, including 
              two held by Mr. Pheap. Those were spread over nearly 50,000 acres inside
               Virachey National Park that had been scrutinized in a 2013 report by Mr. Leng’s one-man advocacy group, the Cambodia Human Rights Tusk Groups.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“The
               corruptive ties that he was able to expose between timber magnates and 
              the government really helped, I think, raise a lot of awareness both 
              within Cambodia and outside” about the downsides of land concessions, 
              said David Gordon, executive director of the Goldman Environmental 
              Foundation, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that awarded Mr. Leng a 
              $175,000 prize on Monday for his work.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Other
               supporters said Mr. Leng’s investigative reports had put more public 
              pressure on Cambodia’s government and timber industry than well-funded 
              international donors and conservation nonprofits were able — or willing —
               to exert.</p>
              <div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"></div>
              <p id="story-continues-4" class="story-body-text story-content">Mr.
               Leng is “fearless in his willingness to expose the big guys,” said 
              Sarah Milne, a lecturer at Australian National University in Canberra 
              who studies Cambodia’s forests. “It’s much easier to look the other 
              way.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The Try Pheap Group did not respond to a list of emailed questions.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Sao
               Sopheap, a spokesman for the Environment Ministry, said the government 
              was working with international conservation groups to eliminate illegal 
              logging inside land concessions. But he added that land-reform measures,
               including a 2012 moratorium on new concessions, were not a response to 
              pressure from activists.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“Those
               activists concentrating on advocacy are probably not very helpful,” Mr.
               Sopheap said in a telephone interview, without mentioning Mr. Leng. 
              “They probably are working on propelling their own interests.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Mr.
               Leng was born in 1975, just as the Khmer Rouge began a four-year reign 
              of terror in Cambodia that left an estimated 1.7 million people dead. 
              His family was forcibly relocated from Takeo Province, near Phnom Penh, 
              to the northern province of Preah Vihear, on the border with Thailand.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">In
               the early 1980s, the family survived by selling rattan it harvested in 
              nearby forests and eating wild fish and game. “I fell in love with the 
              forest and the land because they were our only way to survive,” Mr. 
              Leng, who has a boyish face and speaks with a rapid-fire delivery, said 
              during an interview at his home on the dusty outskirts of Phnom Penh.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">After
               graduating from law school in 1997, Mr. Leng said, he worked for more 
              than a decade as an investigator for two Cambodian human rights groups 
              and later on a forest-mapping project funded by the United States Agency
               for International Development. But he said his work had often prevented
               him from doing what he was determined to do: aggressively fight illegal
               logging.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">He
               began working independently about five years ago and has spent months 
              posing as a cook or a logger and hanging out with company employees to 
              gain access to forests and logging camps within timber concessions. His 
              reports are based on his covert photos and videos, along with documents 
              from local journalists, civil servants and other informers that he 
              analyzes at his home office, he said.</p>
              <div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"></div>
              <p id="story-continues-5" class="story-body-text story-content">A
               primary goal, he added, is to determine how the illegal logging that he
               witnesses is linked to the global timber supply chain and the Chinese, 
              Vietnamese and Cambodian investors behind the logging projects.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Mr.
               Hardtke, the environmental activist, said Mr. Leng’s advocacy work was 
              broadly similar to that of Chut Wutty, a high-profile Cambodian activist
               who was shot dead in April 2012 in a logging camp. But Mr. Hardtke said
               Mr. Leng took a more analytical approach.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Winning
               the Goldman Environmental Prize could raise Mr. Leng’s profile and make
               it harder for the Cambodian authorities to bring defamation cases 
              against him, but the award could also make him more of a target when he 
              works in remote areas, Mr. Hardtke added.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Mr.
               Leng’s wife, Chan Vorn, said the family home had been monitored by 
              plainclothes men on motorbikes with police license plates. She became 
              more concerned for his safety, she added, after reading that a previous 
              Goldman prize winner, the activist Berta Cáceres, was killed in Honduras in March.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“I’m
               so worried about my husband because our children are still very young” 
              and should not grow up fatherless, she said in a jittery voice.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">But Mr. Leng said he was unfazed by security concerns and planned to continue his undercover investigations and public advocacy.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“If I don’t do this,” he said, “who will?”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content"> </p>
