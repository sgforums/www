              <p>World's most pierced woman gets married to balding civil servant.</p>
              <h2>The world's most pierced woman got married in Britain on Wednesday, to a balding retired civil servant who has no metal attached to his body.</h2>

              <p><span class="caption">Elaine Davidson, who holds the record for World's Most Pierced Woman with 6,925 piercings, outside Edinburgh Registry Office following her wedding to Douglas Watson.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span class="caption">
              </span></p><div class="firstPar">
              <p>Elaine Davidson, who has almost 7000 piercings covering her body, married Douglas Watson, at a low-key wedding reception in Edinburgh.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>Brazilian-born Miss Davidson, 46, made a bizarre sight in a flowing white wedding gown and floral tiara with only her face visible, which was painted green and covered in 192 piercings.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>It contrasted markedly from her older husband, who is aged in his 60s, who was more conservatively-dressed in a simple navy suit, a sky-blue shirt and Marks and Spencer tie. The two bridesmaids were dressed in pink.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>Bespectacled Mr Watson, who has no piercings or tattoos, clutched his bride's hand as they walked out of the central Register Office in front of stunned onlookers.</p>
              </div>
              <p></p>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>The couple, who live in Edinburgh, where she operates an aromatherapy shop called Tropical Rainbow, happily posed for photographs before heading off for a reception at a local city cafe.</p>
              <p>"Elaine looked astonishing," he said after the 35 minute ceremony.</p>
              <p>"People see the piercings but I see the amazing personality underneath. We have known each other for a long time.</p>
              <p>"We met in a coffee shop in Glasgow 15 years ago and got chatting."</p>
              <p>He added: "We connected straight away and have been together ever since.</p>
              <p>"I am always amazed by the effect her piercings have on people. She's an incredible woman.</p>
              <p>"People think its unconventional but that is the woman she is and people love her for it."</p>
              <p>She added: "If he [Douglas] did not like tattoos and piercings he would not be the one for me. I feel very happy."</p>
              <p>One of the guests, Gavin, who runs a comic shop near hershop, added: ''Elaine came in and invited me to her wedding reception.</p>
              <p>''She looked incredibly happy and in love. We don't know too much about her groom but he'll have his hands full with her.''</p>
              <p>When first accredited by a Guinness World Record official in 2000, Miss Davidson had 462 piercings, with 192 in her face alone.</p>
              <p>The former nurse now has 6,925 including more than 1,500 that are "internal" that are said to weigh almost seven pounds.</p>
              <p>She "never removes the rings and studs". Her family have said they don't like her piercings.</p>
