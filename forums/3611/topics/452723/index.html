              <p><span>Meet the world's biggest Easter bunny, Darius the enormous Continental Giant, who </span><span>weighs a whopping three-and-a-half stone and is 4ft 4in.</span></p>
              <p><span>Darius, aged three, munches through an incredible 12 carrots a day to keep up his </span><span>strength and fuel his amazing growth spurt.</span></p>
              <p><span>He already held the title of world's biggest rabbit but has now smashed his own </span><span>record after vets measured him a month ago and realised he had had grown another inch</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/04/07/article-2126477-12804526000005DC-209_634x955.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="955"></p>
              <p><span>It is a double celebration for Darius who shares his birthday, on Easter Sunday, with his beloved owner Annette Edwards.  <br></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>Ms Edwards, from Worcester, has bred big bunnies before but Darius is the largest </span><span>in the history of rabbit-kind.</span></p>
              <p><span>The 60-year-old, who also holds the Guinness World Record for Oldest Page Three Model, said: 'He is from a dynasty of giant rabbits and now he's smashed his own record and fittingly his birthday falls on April 8 - so he really is the Beast-er Bunny.</span></p>
              <p><span>'He was officially measured by the vets last month and it's now been confirmed he's </span><span>even bigger than before.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/04/07/article-2126477-1280410F000005DC-778_306x423.jpg" alt="" width="306" height="423"></p>
              <p><span>'We actually share the same birthday and that falls on April 8 which this year is </span><span>really nice because that's Easter Sunday.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Darius enjoys two daily meals which includes rabbit mix, three apples and a cabbage. </span></p>
              <p><span>And if that is not enough, he gorges himself on hay throughout the day. <br></span></p>
              <p><br><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/04/07/article-2126477-1280411A000005DC-974_634x423.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="423"></p>
              <p><span>Ms </span><span>Edwards said: 'Sometimes I do feel like I own the Were-Rabbit from the Wallace Gromit films but actually he has a lovely nature to him.</span></p>
              <p><span>'He is so gentle and I wonder if this has helped him grow bigger than the rest.</span></p>
              <p><span>'He does run around all the time, so I guess the combination of food and exercise has </span><span>worked out for him.</span></p>
              <p><span>'He really is a handsome beast though, there's always a bit of a glint in his eye </span><span>when you go near him.'</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/04/07/article-2126477-12804103000005DC-298_634x422.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="422"></p>
              <p><span>Darius is the son of former record holder Alice and the grandson of earlier owner of </span><span>the crown, Amy.</span></p>
              <p><span>Ms Edwards, who splashed out £10k on surgery and diets to turn herself into a real-life Jessica Rabbit, said she was stunned by Darius who just kept growing.  <br></span></p>
              <p><span>She said: 'I think it's nice that the record is being kept in the family.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Obviously his mum Amy died a couple of years ago and that was upsetting, but I think </span><span>she would like to know her son had taken the record.</span></p>
              <p><span>'People ask me what my secret is, but there really isn't one other than just treating </span><span>them well and really looking after them.</span></p>
              <p><span>A spokesman from Guinness World Records said: 'This is the biggest bunny in the </span><span>world.  <br></span></p>
              <p><span>'Darius is bigger than all the previous record holding rabbits.</span></p>
              <p><span>'It's unbelievable that a rabbit could grow to over 4ft long.'</span></p>
