              <p class="story-body-text story-content">KABUL, Afghanistan —  When the Wall of Kindness finally reached Kabul, it was an idea whose time had not quite come.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The
               concept itself is simple: Paint an outdoor wall in a bright color, 
              usually sky blue, decorate it with slogans about how giving to the poor 
              enriches the giver as much as the receiver, then provision the wall with
               nails so passers-by can hang up clothing to donate.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The
               messages on the walls have varied — peace, kindness, poetry — but they 
              have all included this command: “If you don’t need it, leave it; if you 
              need it, take it.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Late last year, the first reported Wall of Kindness went up in Mashhad ,Iran and in the ensuing three months the idea spread to other Iranian cities, then to Pakistan and as far as Xiamen<a title="XinhuaNet article" href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-03/08/c_135168211.htm"></a>, in southern China.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Once the idea reached Afghanistan month ago, it spread quickly. Donor walls appeared all over — in the 
              cities of Mazar-i-Sharif, Lashkar Gah and Herat, and in Faryab, Takhar 
              and Baghlan Provinces. Kunduz, the northern city still trying to recover
               from its devastation during the Taliban takeover<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/world/asia/taliban-afghanistan-kunduz.html"></a> last year, had four of them.</p>
              <p id="story-continues-1" class="story-body-text story-content">But
               in Kabul no one seemed interested until a 16-year-old named Halima 
              Behroz was watching a televised report about an Iranian wall. She turned
               to her brother, Abdul Latif, 17, and said, “Let’s do it.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Abdul
               had some experience painting walls, as a graffiti artist who roams town
               with a group spray-painting peace slogans and scrawling murals. He 
              rounded up his crew, about 20 high schoolers ages 14 to 17, and with 
              Halima started the Lantern Charity Group.</p>
              <p id="story-continues-3" class="story-body-text story-content">Being
               well-brought-up, they also got their parents’ permission for the 
              project. They come from middle-class families whose parents support 
              education for boys and girls — and more than half are girls. They 
              include Sakina Saidi, 14, who has two older brothers (“They don’t tell 
              me what to do”) in Kabul and a father who runs a food stall in Kuwait 
              and sends money home to pay the tuition for her private school.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CcNrMixWEAAmqh6.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="338"></p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Sakina’s
               father told the members of the group that he would match whatever funds
               they raised to get started, she said, so they pooled their pocket money
               and savings and soon had 7,000 afghanis, or about $100. That would be 
              enough for spray paint and nails, plus bus fare to transport group 
              members to the future wall.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“My father’s cool,” she said.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Money
               proved to be the least of their problems. The owner of a building in 
              the busy downtown area of Shar-e Naw, which had an invitingly blank wall
               on a busy street, refused to let them use it, on the grounds that 
              crowds might gather and attract a suicide bomber. They were turned away 
              from Kabul University, told it would be defacing government property.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">In
               a jittery capital, they heard the security objection a lot. But here 
              they were, a bunch of high schoolers, comparatively unafraid. What was 
              the adults’ problem? The last suicide bombing, after all, was three 
              weeks earlier; it’s not like they happen every day, and Kabul is a city 
              of five million.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Finally,
               way out on Darulaman Road, the principal of Habibia High School allowed
               them to use a patch of the compound wall around his institution, a 
              public school but an elite one, where President Ashraf Ghani once 
              studied. They painted their wall salmon, with blue inscriptions, 
              including one, “Humanity is my dream,” a famous line by the poet Afghans
               know as Maulana, but the rest of the world knows as Rumi. He was a 
              13th-century Persian, but he was born in Balkh, in what is now Afghanistan<a class="meta-loc" title="More news and information about Afghanistan." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/afghanistan/index.html?inline=nyt-geo"></a>.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The high school principal, Sayed Shah Bakabuli, was not entirely 
              persuaded. “I gave them my permission because I know it is for a good 
              cause, but I still have my concerns that, God forbid, it should be taken
               advantage of by the bad guys,” he said.</p>
              <p id="story-continues-4" class="story-body-text story-content">The
               youths had other problems. After they pounded their nails in, they 
              returned the next morning to find that someone had stolen them all.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“I guess they needed nails,” Abdul said, but quickly recovered his composure. “It’s O.K. We have more.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Then,
               for frustratingly long periods, they had a Wall of Kindness, but not 
              much kindness. Hardly anyone was leaving garments. Young men would 
              stroll by and mock them.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“They
               were bullies, looking for a fight,” said another member of their group,
               Ali Roman, 16, an 11th grader who said his goal in life is to go into 
              business and get rich — so he can have more money to give to the poor.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“We
               just told them we’re here to promote peace, not to fight anyone,” Abdul
               said. “I myself have lost two of my friends to suicide bombers in 
              Kabul. I know how it feels, and I don’t want to lose more friends.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">A few religious conservatives complained, too, that the Facebook page they set up to promote the wall had pictures of the girls involved, fraternizing with boys.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“What did they expect?” Sakina said. “A lot of us are girls.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“We
               faced so many problems,” said Halima, who like her friends insisted on 
              being interviewed in English — although she added that she could use 
              Chinese, if preferred. “Street harassment, many people who are against 
              girls even to go to schools, let alone make a new thing like this.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">One
               day this month, the group was finding few clients, either givers or 
              takers, at the wall on Darulaman Road, which begins in a squalid slum 
              next to the fetid Kabul River, and ends at the old royal palace, a 
              bullet-and-bomb-riddled monument to the civil war years. The new array 
              of nails sported two T-shirts, another shirt and a pair of camo 
              trousers, plus a jacket.</p>

              <p id="story-continues-5" class="story-body-text story-content">Along
               came a janitor from the school, Muhammad Hashem, 50, who picked up the 
              shirt for one of his four children. “I don’t know who did this, but it’s
               great,” he said, explaining that his salary was only 6,000 afghanis 
              ($85) a month, so he wasn’t buying a lot of clothing most months.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Walls
               of Kindness elsewhere have been much more heavily patronized. 
              Afghanistan’s first one, in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, is 
              constantly full, with celebrities and government officials jostling to 
              be seen hanging up donations. Tahir Qadiry, a local television executive who started it<a href="http://www.aopnews.com/everyday-life/wall-of-kindness-emerges-in-afghanistan-to-help-those-in-need/"></a>, has added racks for shoes, and plans to put up bookshelves as well.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Kabul’s
               young humanitarians were conferring recently about their Wall of 
              Kindness conundrum and came up with a new idea. They would go en masse 
              to the homes of rich Kabulis.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“We’ll ask them to give us their clothes,” Sakina said.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Then they could seed the wall, and maybe get things going for real.</p>
