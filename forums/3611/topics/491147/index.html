              <p id="story-continues-1" class="story-body-text story-content">DESNA,
               Czech Republic —  When the January issue of National Geographic landed 
              in his mailbox last year, Petr Pus nearly fell to the floor. There on the cover
               and throughout the issue were members of the Kayapo tribe, living far 
              up the Amazon in conditions more Stone Age than information age, all of 
              them adorned with face paint and a glittering assortment of beads.</p>
              <p id="story-continues-2" class="story-body-text story-content">“I couldn’t believe it,” said Mr. Pus, the marketing director for Preciosa Ornela<a href="http://www.preciosa-ornela.cz/en/"></a>, which claims to be the world’s largest producer of high-end glass beads. “They were literally wearing our beads.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Venture
               up the Amazon or into a Masai Mara village in Kenya, explore a jungle 
              bazaar in southern India or even a roadside shop in Arizona selling 
              Navajo knockoffs, and the chances are excellent that most of the beads 
              you will see were produced in this unlikely mountain village a stone’s 
              throw from the Polish frontier and a short drive to Germany.</p>
              <p id="story-continues-3" class="story-body-text story-content">For four and a half centuries, since Czech artisans brought back the secrets of glassmaking from the Venetian island of Murano,
               the narrow and tree-choked valleys of northern Bohemia have been 
              producing a dizzying array of glass beads in all manner of colors, 
              sizes, shapes and decorative flourishes.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content"><img src="http://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/13/world/13desna_web2/13desna_web2-master675.jpg" alt="" width="675" height="450"></p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content"><strong><span class="caption-text">A worker scooped molten glass out of a furnace at the Preciosa Ornela glass-bead factory in Desna.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">And despite passing through history’s threshing machine with a series of conquring rulers, including kings, emperors, freedom fighters, Gestapo thugs and communist dictators, the artisans are still at it.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The
               Preciosa factory, which produces the beads using a mixture of 
              traditional processes and modern industrial techniques, remains, with 
              900 workers, the chief employer in this small village of 3,000 people.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">And
               while a flood of cheaper Chinese beads has poured out of Asia over the 
              last five or six years, putting many of Bohemia’s traditional 
              mom-and-pop beadmakers out of business, producers of the higher-end 
              products — known as seeds bead and made here by Preciosa and in Japan by a few operations — are experiencing one of their periodic bursts of prosperity.</p>
              <p id="story-continues-4" class="story-body-text story-content">“It’s
               a good job, with good pay and you get to say you are helping to make 
              products that are the best in the world,” said Zdenek Gyalog, 29. He 
              oversees the sorting department, whose workers, in many cases, have been
               at Preciosa for 15 or 20 years, and their parents before them.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“If
               my son, someday, comes to me and says he wants to go into this 
              business,” Mr. Gyalog said, “I certainly would not oppose it.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content"> </p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content"><img src="http://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/13/world/13desna_web3/13desna_web2-articleLarge.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content"><strong><span class="caption-text">The Preciosa factory, which produces beads 
              using a mixture of traditional processes and modern industrial 
              techniques, employs 900 workers.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Desna
               became a center of Bohemian bead production a little over 150 years ago
               when Josef Riedel, the descendant of generations of glass traders and 
              manufacturers, built a factory astride a chattering river with the 
              ragged Jizera Mountains looming on all sides. Some of his original 
              buildings are now part of the Preciosa complex.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The
               Riedel family tomb dominates a steep hillside across the road from the 
              factory, and the white mansion of the man once known as the glass king 
              of the Jizera Mountains is down the road, now a museum.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">For
               centuries, beads and glass vessels were made here in small workshops, 
              or in literal cottage industries run by families, often as a second 
              source of income.</p>
              <div id="MiddleRight1" class="ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"></div>
              <p id="story-continues-5" class="story-body-text story-content">The
               houses are still easily identifiable in the surrounding countryside, 
              notable for their two chimneys, indicating that a glass furnace anchored
               one part of the property.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Today,
               nearly all of those mom-and-pop operations have fallen by the wayside, 
              said Josef Nagy, 48, who runs a small beadmaking operation in the 
              village of Pencin, not far from the Preciosa complex in Desna.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Since
               only Preciosa has the technology capable of making the higher-quality 
              seed beads, smaller manufacturers — like Mr. Nagy’s company, Fipobex — 
              target smaller and more specialized markets. But the Chinese competition
               does not make it easy.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“Everybody is struggling,” Mr. Nagy said.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">A
               decade ago, he had 120 employees. Now there are only 15, and much of 
              the equipment in his aging factory sits idle. To make up for the lost 
              revenue, the company started giving tours, opened a goat farm, a museum 
              of agriculture, and a craft shop where people can experiment with making
               their own beaded jewelry. “We could see the writing on the wall,” Mr. 
              Nagy said.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">But as the smaller operations have struggled, Preciosa’s bead factory in Desna has only flourished, as has the town.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“As
               we say, beads are a cheap joy for poor people,” Mr. Pus said, leading 
              the way late last year across a water-slick floor in an old, traditional
               furnace room.</p>
              <p id="story-continues-6" class="story-body-text story-content">Through
               eight gaping gates, workers scoop molten glass out of red-hot pots in 
              the brick furnace. The glowing ingots sink with an angry hiss into 
              wooden tubs of water large enough to swallow an easy chair.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The
               seed beads that are the basis of Preciosa’s current prosperity are more
               difficult to produce than ordinary glass beads — in which molten glass 
              is pressed into a mold — but allow artisans a wider array of treatments,
               flourishes and colors.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Glass rods are melted in a furnace, then, while still pliable, pulled through a machine that shapes them into a strawlike tube.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The
               end result looks a bit like a cocktail straw, although there are 20 
              sizes, each creating its own size of bead, and 20 basic colors that can 
              be mixed into an almost endless selection of tones and shades, some 
              opaque, some transparent.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The
               holes in the straw can be round, triangular, star-shaped, even 
              double-barreled, and a second color can be used to accent the hole or 
              create baked-in glass patterns on the bead’s face.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content"><img src="http://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/13/world/13DESNA-web5/13DESNA-web5-articleLarge.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content"><strong><span class="caption-text">Pouring beads into a rounding machine last week. The Preciosa factory employs 900 people in a village of just 3,000.</span></strong></p>
              <p id="story-continues-7" class="story-body-text story-content">The
               glass straws are sent through a slicing machine that bites off 
              bead-size lengths, which are then reheated gently and put into a 
              spinning machine that shapes the pliable glass into perfectly round 
              beads that are then sorted and polished.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“And at the end of all that, all you have is one measly glass bead,” Mr. Pus said.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Leos Adler, Preciosa’s bead production manager, set some sample boards on a conference room table.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“Our
               No. 1 market at the moment is India,” he said. Beads are used there in 
              Hindu ceremonial garb, but also in everyday products like the mangalsutra necklaces worn to signal that a woman is married.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Preciosa
               sells directly to 70 countries and, through regional distributors, to 
              40 more. In Africa, the company sells to the Masai and Samburu tribes in
               Kenya and Tanzania, and to the Zulus, Xhosas, Ndebele and other tribes 
              of southern Africa.</p>

              </div>
              <p id="story-continues-8" class="story-body-text story-content">“You
               go to the Masai Mara and a lot of the beads you will see in the tourist
               markets are cheap Chinese products,” Mr. Adler said. “But the Masai 
              themselves will only use our beads for their personal use.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">In
               North America, the largest market is for home hobbyists, but several 
              Native American tribes also purchase the beads for higher-end pieces 
              aimed at collectors and flush tourists.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Southern
               Sudan has also become a big market, Mr. Adler said. In South America, 
              there are ceremonial garments for religious occasions, like childbirth 
              ceremonies, as well as costumes for Carnival and an assortment of belts,
               napkin rings and jewelry for everyday use.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The
               biggest surprise of recent years was an explosion of interest in Czech 
              beads in Ukraine and Russia, where they were suddenly being used to 
              adorn religious icons and paintings.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“It has become a huge market,” Mr. Adler said. “And it just happened.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">One place the beads are not sold in large numbers is the  Czech  Republic<a title="More news and information about Czech Republic." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/czechrepublic/index.html?inline=nyt-geo"></a>. “I only have one thing made out of beads at home,” said Mr. Gyalog, the Preciosa supervisor. “It’s a bracelet.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Katerina
               Hruskova, assistant chief curator at the Museum of Glass and Jewelry in
               the nearby city of Jablonec nad Nisou, where an exhibition of Czech 
              beadwork since 1700 had recently opened, said that was understandable.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“It
               is just a job for the people who live here,” she said. “If you are 
              working eight hours or more every day with beads, you don’t really want 
              to go home and see beads.”</p>
