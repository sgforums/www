              <h1>Boy dies for 40 minutes before doctor brings him back to life by massaging his heart with his BARE HANDS<br></h1>
              <p><br></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">A little boy whose heart stopped beating for 40minutes made a miracle recovery after a doctor opened up his chest and pumped the organ by hand.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Joshua Baker, 5, suffered a huge cardiac arrest just a few days after undergoing a risky operation to correct a rare heart condition.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Luckily one of his surgeons, Mr Giles Peek, was passing the room at the time and rushed in.</span></p>
              <p><br><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/07/06/article-2011761-0CE2886000000578-0_634x410.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="410"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><strong><span style="color: #808000;">Joshua was admitted to hospital in November after a check-up revealed that the one functioning side of his heart was working so hard it was likely to explode</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">His mother Rebecca, said: 'Straight away, he just opened up Josh's chest and started massaging his heart.</span></p>
              <p>'<span style="font-size: x-small;">Josh was down for 40 minutes altogether - we were so relieved when he came back.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">However, doctors warned his parents that even if he survived the night, Joshua would probably suffer brain damage because his brain had been without oxygen for so long.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But just a few months after coming back from the dead, Joshua is now a happy and healthy little boy.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He is enjoying being back home in Birmingham, with his parents, Rebecca, 31, and Lee, 29, a gardener, and sisters, Chloe, 6, and Mia 3.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Mrs Baker said: 'We are absolutely blown away by Josh's recovery.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'He has been very ill since he was little, and we have thought so many times that we were going to lose him.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Sitting in a hospital and seeing my little boy's heart stop beating is the most terrifying thing that has ever happened to me.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'We cannot explain how grateful we are to the surgeon who saved his life - he is a wonderful man.<br></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'The whole family is so grateful to have Joshua back home.</span> <span style="font-size: x-small;">It's amazing to see him running around and playing with his sisters. I feel so lucky.'<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Joshua was diagnosed with a complex congenital heart disease just two weeks after he was born.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/07/06/article-2011761-0CE2880000000578-704_634x436.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="436"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><strong><span style="color: #808000;">Criticall: Joshua, pictured in hospital last November, had four major operations and seven minor procedures by the time he was two</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">His parents were devastated when they were told their son had a hole in his heart - as well the right side of his heart failing to function, and pumping blood around his body the wrong way.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He had four major heart operations and seven minor procedures before he turned two - but in November 2010, a check up revealed that the one functioning side of Josh's heart was working so hard it was likely to explode unless he had a major operation.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">However, the surgery to strengthen his ventricles was so risky that medics warned his parents there was only a 20 per cent chance he would survive.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Mrs Baker said: 'We were left to make an impossible decision. The operation was so dangerous, and there was so little chance that he would pull through, that I almost couldn't bring myself to consent to it.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'But I knew that without help, his heart would give up. I couldn't let him slip away from us.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Joshua's a fighter and I know we had to give him a chance to fight.</span> <span style="font-size: x-small;">The operation lasted an agonising 15 hours, and Josh was critically ill afterwards. It was one of the worst times of my life.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'His heart was swollen and bruised from the surgery, and as a mum, all I wanted to do was pick him up and cuddle him, but I couldn't.'<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Joshua survived the operation, but was kept on the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester for two weeks.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">His condition suddenly deteriorated after his heart developed a bleed - and he suffered a massive cardiac arrest.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The full-time mother added: 'We had been by Joshua's bedside constantly since the operation. He was hooked up to dozens of machines, when suddenly nurses and doctors started rushing in.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'We were terrified. Everything happened so quickly we had no idea what was going on, but obviously, we knew it wasn't good news.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/07/06/article-2011761-0CE2798E00000578-310_634x630.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="630"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><span style="color: #808000;"><strong>Magic medicine: Joshua (centre) with his parents Rebecca and Lee and sisters, Chloe and Mia. His sisters managed to rouse him in hospital by singing a Christmas song</strong></span></p>
              <p><br></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Luckily, Joshua's surgeon had been passing his room when his heart failed and came rushing in.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Straight away, he just opened up Josh's chest and started massaging his heart.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Josh was down for 40 minutes altogether - we were so relieved when he came back.</span>'</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">His family then faced an anxious wait to see if he would recover.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'We brought Josh all his favourite toys and hoped he would recognise them, but there was nothing,' Mrs Baker said.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'He was too ill for his sisters to visit him, but I let them speak down the phone to Josh.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'It was just before Christmas, and the girls sang Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer over the phone to him. Suddenly, his eyes flickered and a huge grin spread over his face.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'It was the best moment of my life. My husband and I burst out crying, and so did all the nurses on the ward.<br></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'His sisters were his magic medicine, and he's been getting stronger and stronger ever since.</span>'</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Joshua had problems walking when he came out of hospital and still gets tired easily but is gaining strengths and enjoys playing football with his father.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'We are just so grateful to Dr Peek and everyone who looked after Josh at Glenfield Hospital,' Mrs Baker said.<br></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Carmel Hunt, matron for the East Midlands Congenital Heart Centre, said: 'Joshua spent three weeks with us at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester and spent his fifth birthday with us.</span><span><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'We are delighted that he is now back home with his family and is making a fully recovery.'</span></p>
