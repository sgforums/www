              <p>Ruth Flowers or Mommy Rock was known as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">world oldest DJ</span>. 69-year-old Ruth Flowers is a living example that age shouldn’t get in the way of things you’re passionate about. Like Bette Calman, the Yoga super-granny, Ruth does extraordinary things, for her age. before this we got another weird and bizarre grandma. she was Zhang Ruifang a unicorn ladyfrom china<a href="http://worldmustbecrazy.blogspot.com/2010/03/zhang-ruifang-old-chinese-woman-with.html"><span style="color: #5588aa;">.</span></a> but Ruth Flower has another uniqueness. she might be old but she still got the skills to be a DJ! yeah go for it Grand Mother...</p>
              <p>Known as “Mammy Rock“, around the European club scene, Ruth Flowers is probably the oldest professional DJ in the world. The British granny wears bling-bling headphones, trendy clothes and sports an electrifying hear-do as she works the turntables in popular clubs, in France.<br><br>Mammy Rock’s career began when she was 65. Her grandson was celebrating his birthday in a London nightclub, and asked Ruth to join him and his friends. There were a few problems with the bouncers, who didn’t feel right letting a senior citizen inside such an establishment, but as soon as she stepped in, Mammy Rock was bewitched by the lively atmosphere that made her feel so much younger.<br><br>She talked to her grandson about becoming a DJ herself, and although he thought she was mad, he agreed to introduce her to a young music producer. After learning the basics of electro music, Mammy Rock developed her very own style, and one of today’s most in-demand DJs.<br><br>Ruth had had a pretty interesting youth, going to balls all the time, but with the coming of old age, she became bored out of her mind. She says she’d much rather “sign a contract with a record company than to sign up for the nursing home.”<br><br><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_6I27LgG9bck/S5jnU8wRlRI/AAAAAAAARXQ/FAbA7s777Qo/s400/Ruth-Flowers-Mammy-Rock.jpg" alt="" width="266" height="400"></p>
