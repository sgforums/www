              <p>
              </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 6px; padding-bottom: 6px; color: #292929; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px; text-align: justify;">Alona, 40, immigrated to Israel with her parents from Ukraine in the early 1990s. Her circumstances quickly degenerated from working in a casino to a life derailed by debts, drugs and prostitution. When she was not in prison, the squalid streets around the bus station became her home.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 6px; padding-bottom: 6px; color: #292929; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px; text-align: justify;">“In the streets there was no toilet, no toilet paper,” Alona said. “I forgot a lot of things, like how to look after myself, to love myself. I learned to survive.”</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 6px; padding-bottom: 6px; color: #292929; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px; text-align: justify;">Now, in an endeavor as far removed from their former lives as the gleaming banks and trendy boutiques of Tel Aviv are from the city’s sleazy subculture, the two, who asked to be identified only by their first names, recently completed a free course in styling and the retail clothing business. Along with other former prostitutes who have received similar training in dress design and sewing, they are now aiming to find a place in the world of fashion. There is always demand for sales staff in Tel Aviv’s bustling stores, and one talented graduate even went on to a professional design school on a scholarship.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 6px; padding-bottom: 6px; color: #292929; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px; text-align: justify;">“The course gave me a lot of self-confidence and knowledge,” Aviva said. “Maybe one day I’ll be able to start something of my own. When they gave me the certificate — the first in my life — I was proud of myself. I’d done something positive.”</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 6px; padding-bottom: 6px; color: #292929; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px; text-align: justify;">The idea for the program grew up from the underside of Tel Aviv.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 6px; padding-bottom: 6px; color: #292929; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px; text-align: justify;">The program’s initiator, Lilach Tzur Ben-Moshe, was working as a fashion writer and editor at a leading Hebrew news Web site and volunteering at the city’s rape crisis center when, four years ago, she moved to the dilapidated Shapira Quarter near the bus station. Her squalid new neighborhood exposed her to the full misery of the sex trade, and she determined to help women to leave it.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 6px; padding-bottom: 6px; color: #292929; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px; text-align: justify;">“I didn’t want just to answer the phone in the help center,” she said. “I wanted to offer something more optimistic, more beautiful, the opposite of that awful world of prostitution.”</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 6px; padding-bottom: 6px; color: #292929; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px; text-align: justify;">With an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 prostitutes in Israel, a country of about eight million people, antiprostitution campaigners say the industry has an annual turnover of more than half a billion dollars. While it is illegal to pimp or to run a brothel, prostitution is not a criminal offense in Israel. There are efforts to promote new legislation that would impose criminal penalties on people who are clients of prostitutes.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 6px; padding-bottom: 6px; color: #292929; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px; text-align: justify;">Up until a few years ago Israel was a prime destination for traffickers of women. An estimated 3,000 women per year were smuggled in, mostly from Eastern Europe, to work in the sex industry. That number has declined since Israel passed an antitrafficking law in 2006, according to the United States State Department Trafficking in Persons report of 2012, and most of the prostitutes here are now said to be Israelis.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 6px; padding-bottom: 6px; color: #292929; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px; text-align: justify;">At around the same time as Ms. Tzur Ben-Moshe’s move to the Shapira Quarter, Israel’s first hostel for women trying to get out of prostitution and undergoing rehabilitation, Saleet, opened nearby. Ms. Tzur Ben-Moshe built the first course with Ido Recanati, a local fashion designer, offering women from the hostel training in sketching, fabrics and stitching. She then teamed with Iris Stern Levi, who had worked for 20 years at the rape crisis center. They founded an association, called Turning the Tables, and now are directors of the program, whose weekly sessions take place over a period of several months. Some students come from the hostel; some via Elem, an Israeli organization for youths in distress; and some are from a shelter for women straight out of prison.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 6px; padding-bottom: 6px; color: #292929; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px; text-align: justify;">Financing has come from the National Council of Jewish Women, an American organization of volunteers and advocates of social justice, as well as local companies and private individuals. Many Israelis connected with the fashion industry — designers, fabric suppliers and the Gertrude fashion house among others — have donated time and materials.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 6px; padding-bottom: 6px; color: #292929; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px; text-align: justify;">The efforts, Ms. Tzur Ben-Moshe said, are “our little bit, to show there’s a way out.”</p>
