              <p>Two best friends who have known each other 16 years have made an amazing discovery: they are sisters.</p>
              <p>Alison Slavin, 41, and Sam Davies, 43, found they share the same father after adopted child Alison tracked down her biological mother.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The pair from Bristol never suspected they were related despite living remarkably similar lives - they look alike, have similar taste in clothes, both work as childminders, have two children and live less than a mile apart.</p>
              <p>Alison made the discovery when a friend helped her trace her birth mother, who revealed her natural father was called Terry Cox.</p>
              <p>She immediately recognised it as the name of Sam's father - and DNA tests later confirmed the pair are half sisters.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/05/10/article-1385521-0BFBA86200000578-108_468x329.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="329"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><strong>Sister act: Best friends for 16 years, the women from Bristol made the surprise discovery they are half-sisters after Alison, right, tracked down her birth mother</strong></p>
              <p><strong><br></strong></p>
              <p>Alison - who was a bridesmaid at Sam's wedding - said: 'We had joked in the past we were sisters as people used to always ask us if we were, saying we looked alike.</p>
              <p>'But I was shocked to find out we were actually half sisters. I could not get hold of Sam by phone so I texted her the words "Hello Sis".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'An hour later I phoned and explained everything and she was so excited.</p>
              <p>'I was adopted from birth and never looked into my natural parents because I had a lovely and fantastic childhood so I didn't feel the need.'</p>
              <p>The pair met in 1993 through a mutual friend and soon became best friends, going to a karaoke night twice a week. </p>
              <p>Having had a happy upbringing with her adoptive parents, Alison felt no need to trace her birth family - until she got talking to a friend in February this year who said she may know how to trace her birth mother.</p>
              <p>A few weeks later the friend supplied a phone number and Alison boldly got in touch in March before being reunited days later.</p>
              <p>Alison said she nervously met her mother - who she does not want to name - after getting in touch by telephone, but never expected this second twist in the tale.</p>
              <p>She said: 'She told me she was 19 when she put me up for adoption and gave me the news that my biological father was Terry Cox.</p>
              <p>Alison says she recognised the name instantly as being the same as Sam's father's, but only let herself believe that it must be pure coincidence.</p>
              <p>'I felt the colour drain from my face: that was Sam's biological father's name. In all of Bristol, what were the chances of this being the same chap as Sam's father  - but he was. </p>
              <p>Sam was as shocked as Alison, but immediately contacted her father to share the news.</p>
              <p>'Sam accepted the news straight away and even got in touch with Terry on Facebook to tell him. He lives in Spain but he requested me as a friend on Facebook.</p>
              <p>'Two weeks ago we had DNA tests back which confirmed we are related. Both of us have had happy childhoods so I suppose this is just the icing on the cake.'</p>
              <p>Sam's surprise at the news quickly turned to elation.</p>
              <p>She said: 'When Alison texted me telling me we were sisters a tiny part of me thought she was joking but a bigger part of me thought, "Oh my God".</p>
              <p>'After the initial shock I spoke to Alison and she explained everything I just thought, "Wow."</p>
              <p>'I had always wanted a sister, and what better sister could I have than my best friend?</p>
              <p>'Second to getting married and giving birth to my children, it was the most exciting thing I have ever been told.</p>
              <p>'It's sad we didn't find out sooner but you can't change what's happened. We're just absolutely thrilled we have found out now.'</p>
              <p>The sisters have now bought a charm bracelet each from Links of London to commemorate their discovery.</p>
              <p>Sam said: "Alison had one and I loved it so I got one and recently we went out and bought matching charms to signify us finding out we are sisters.</p>
