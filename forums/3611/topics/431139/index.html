              <div><span style="color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">Family fun: Charley Craig is trained by her 20-year-old brother Daniel (L) and her mother Amanda, 37, also lifts weights</span></div>
              <div></div>
              <div><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;">
              <div>This is one schoolgirl you wouldn't want to challenge to an arm wrestle. <br><br>At four feet, seven inches and weighing just over five stone, Charley Craig is Britain's strongest girl. <br><br>Miss Craig, from Glasgow, can lift almost her own body weight - equivalent to 28 bags of sugar - above her head. <br><br>She dreams of winning gold at the Commonwealth Youth Game and has already out-lifted every other child at the Gladiator gym in Glasgow where she trains.</div>
              <div><br>She is steadily improving thanks to the tough fitness regime she follows - spending 12 hours training in the gym each week.</div>
              <div> <br>Charley said: 'It is really hard work and I'm sore most of the time. But then I look back and I'm happy with what I've done. <br><br>'My coach says I've got the potential to do well and go really far.</div>
              <div><br>'The adults in the gym give me loads of support. When I can't do it they say ''up, up, up'' and they encourage me so I can concentrate and do it.</div>
              <div><br>'I like the gym because it's a really friendly atmosphere. If anyone gets hurt we're always there for each other.' <br><br>But like many girls of her age, Charley's bedroom is wall-to-wall pink and she likes nothing better than hanging out with her friends, doing her make-up and reading fashion magazines.</div>
              <div><br>Her favourite film star is Natalie Portman and she listens to Katy Perry and hip-hop artist, N-Dubz.<img src="http://www.whatsonningbo.com/news_images/0521300064e32001_3.jpg" alt=""></div>
              <div>Inspiring: Charley Craig was encouraged to take up the sport by her mother Amanda</div>
              <div></div>
              <div>
              <div>She dreams of a career like Zoe Smith, who won gold at the age of 16 at the Commonwealth Youth Games in 2008, and will represent the UK in the 2012 London Olympics. </div>
              <div><br>Charley's family are committed to helping her realise her dream. <br><br>Her mother, Amanda Black, 37, drives her to the gym every day and ensures she sticks to a strict diet of pasta, fruit and vegetables. </div>
              <div><br>The schoolgirl was introduced to the sport by her mother who has weightlifted for 20 years. <br><br>Charley's brother, Daniel, 20, who is also a competing weightlifter, has become his sister's coach. <br><br>When she first started at the age of nine, Charley could lift 13 kilograms. <br><br>At this rate, her brother predicts that she will be lifting her own body weight - 32 kg - before the year is out.</div>
              <div> <br>Her brother said: 'When Charley first started weightlifting it was to join in with me and mum. <br><br>'Then she got serious and I couldn't be more pleased with her progress. <br><br>'Her small size is actually an advantage because she has less of her own bulk to heave up. <br><br>'All she needs to do is use the techniques I've taught her to get that weight off the ground.</div>
              <div>  </div>
              <div>
              <div>'She competed and won in her first competition a few months ago where she set a personal best of 28.5 kg. We're all really proud of her.'</div>
              <div><br>But despite all her hours spent in the gym, Charley takes school just as seriously. <br><br>She said: 'I love going out to see my friends in school. I like getting an education because I want to do well later in life. All the subjects are good except maths, which is really hard.</div>
              <div><br>'If I train hard enough, I would like to have the opportunity to represent Britain in the Olympics one day. <br><br>'My two aspirations in life are two things. I will always like to weightlift but I'd also like to be a doctor so I can help people.' <br><br></div>
