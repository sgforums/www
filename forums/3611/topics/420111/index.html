              <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) â€“ A would-be suicide jumper in New York was alive on Monday after leaping from a ninth-floor window but landing in a giant heap of garbage uncollected since the city's massive snowstorm a week ago.</p>
              <p>Vangelis Kapatos, 26, was hospitalized in critical but stable condition after jumping from his apartment on West 45th Street on Sunday afternoon, authorities said.</p>
              <p>Sanitation workers have not collected trash since the December 26 storm dumped more than a foot and a half of snow on the city. Mounds of garbage several feet high line many sidewalks.</p>
              <p>"Everybody is complaining that the trash hasn't been picked up," Kapatos' aunt said on Monday. "But me, I'm thankful that it was never picked up."</p>
              <p>Police said the trash bags below broke Kapatos' fall and that he left no suicide note before jumping.</p>
              <p>The Department of Sanitation, which was only resuming garbage collecting on Monday, estimates 77,000 tons of trash have been left uncollected since the storm.</p>
              <p>Mayor Michael Bloomberg said he expects workers to be caught up with trash collection by Friday.</p>
              <p>"It will take a few days to catch up," Bloomberg said. "But they're out there today and hopefully in the next three to four days, we'll be done with it."</p>
              <p>Katharina Capatos, who spells her surname differently from her nephew, told Reuters he was severely depressed and had spent a month in the psychiatric ward at Bellevue Hospital before being released last week.</p>
              <p>He also was worried about the possibility of being evicted from his $572-a-month rent-stabilized apartment, she said.</p>
              <p>Kapatos' eviction hearing was scheduled to proceed on Tuesday, according to the New York City Housing Court.</p>
