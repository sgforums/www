              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1430456394521_1055">CARACAS  -
               A woman who bashed President Nicolas Maduro on the head with a mango 
              has been promised a new house for her troubles in a surreal tropical 
              tale that has gone viral in Venezuela.</p>
              <p>The 52-year-old president was driving a bus through a 
              crowd last weekend in the central state of Aragua when someone in the 
              crowd tossed the fruit at him.</p>
              <p>"It says: 'If you can, call me'," the former bus driver
               said later during the week, as he displayed the fruit with a name and 
              phone number scrawled on it on television.</p>
              <p>"Marleny Olivo had a problem with her house. 
              (Officials) called her. She was scared. She couldn't believe it was 
              true. ... I've approved an apartment for you, Marleny, as part of the 
              'Grand Venezuelan Housing Mission'," he added, vowing to eat the mango.</p>
              <p>Venezuela's ever ebullient cybersphere did not miss a 
              beat, with the president's populist gesture drawing admiration and 
              derision, plus plenty of jokes.</p>
              <p>"If for a mango they give you apartments, then you know
               what to do: throw him a pineapple!" quipped Dolar Today, a website that
               quotes the black market for dollars and is hated by Maduro.</p>
              <p>Like his predecessor Hugo Chavez, who died in 2013, 
              Maduro collects heaps of petitions during trips, although most are 
              scribbled on paper rather than hurled at him on fruit.</p>
              <p>In a habit that delights many poor supporters but 
              irritates critics, Maduro - like Chavez - often personally gives away 
              homes, appliances or pensions to low-income Venezuelans.</p>
              <p>However, lacking Chavez's charm and good fortune with 
              high oil prices, Maduro's popularity has plummeted since he took office.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1430456394521_1060">Roughly 28.2 
              percent of Venezuelans approved of his management of the country in 
              April, according to pollster Datanalisis. That was up from March's 24.7 
              percent, likely due to his campaign against U.S. sanctions on seven 
              government officials, but still nearly half the level when he became 
              president.</p>
              <p>The survey also said 45.8 percent plan to vote for 
              opposition candidates in this year's parliamentary election, while only 
              25 percent support the ruling Socialists.</p>
              <p>Shortages of food and medicine caused by strict 
              currency controls have taken a heavy toll, particularly the poor, who 
              traditionally have supported "Chavismo."</p>
              <p>"A mango shortage is coming, let's line up to throw them at Maduro and get a new house!" one Twitter user joked.</p>
