              <p class="story-body-text story-content">VERONA,
               Italy —  In a country famed for its fine leather products and fashion 
              sense, shining shoes was never a particularly exalted profession.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The
               practice was imported during World War II, when American and British 
              soldiers paid young boys on the street to buff up their boots, sometimes
               in return for chocolate and cigarettes.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Even one of the ways to call it — “ssiucia,”
               as described in Vittorio De Sica’s 1946 movie of the same name — comes 
              from the Neapolitan dialect that imitates the sound of the English 
              “shoeshine.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">And it was certainly never a woman’s job.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">But
               don’t tell any of that to Eleonora Lovo. She is the latest example of 
              how women have moved into the decidedly out-of-fashion trade, once 
              exclusively the domain of men, and even made it hip.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Today
               the 43-year-old Ms. Lovo walks around Verona in black men’s shoes, a 
              stretchy below-the knee skirt, a white shirt and ample, black oval 
              eyeglasses. From her forearm hangs a rectangular brown leather bag full 
              of attentively polished shoes, which she picks up and returns to clients
               herself.</p>
              <div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"><a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/world/europe/women-try-to-make-italys-shoe-shining-as-chic-as-its-shoes.html?_r=0#story-continues-1"></a></div>
              <p id="story-continues-1" class="story-body-text story-content">Ms.
               Lovo’s laboratory is a corner of her family’s living room. Sitting on a
               wooden chair on a recent day, surrounded by art books, beeswax, colored
               cream polishes, all sorts of brushes and a cuckoo clock, she started 
              brushing off the dust and dirt from one of her “babies,” and described 
              the work that is her passion.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“I
               don’t think it’s a job for men only,” Ms. Lovo said. “I have always 
              loved men’s shoes. They have a history, for the models, the ways they 
              are sewed together. Women’s shoes simply don’t.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The second woman in Italy
               to gain renown for choosing the job in recent years, Ms. Lovo began her
               business out of her home, and at several business congresses, hotels 
              and shoe fairs, in 2014. From there her reputation spread.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">But
               before she started, she learned the art and craft of treating leather 
              from books and at a local tannery, and started polishing shoes for her 
              family and friends.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/04/world/xxshoeshine-web2/xxshoeshine-web2-master675.jpg" alt="" width="675" height="450"></p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“While I was learning, I once ruined a friend’s fine shoes,” she recalled with anguish. “I couldn’t sleep that night.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“My
               challenge is to give them a new life,” she added, smiling, while 
              cleaning a pair of decade-old brown American shoes with a blue 
              microfiber cloth soaked in a delicate liquid detergent. “My favorite 
              thing about my job is to see my customers’ faces when they unpack their 
              polished shoes.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">While she polishes mostly men’s shoes, Ms. Lovo owes her success mostly to women, she conceded.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">On
               one hand, she has taken the place of the traditional Italian housewife,
               whose chores included cleaning shoes. Now most women work outside the 
              home and no longer have the time for the task.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">On the other hand, her very first promoters were her fellow soccer moms.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“Some
               moms first asked me to clean their leather bags, and then they spread 
              the word,” she said, explaining that women are also her principal 
              promoters on social media. “Men, in turn, trust women for these kinds of
               jobs. For them, it’s like entrusting their shoes to their mothers or 
              girlfriends.”</p>
              <div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"><a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/world/europe/women-try-to-make-italys-shoe-shining-as-chic-as-its-shoes.html?_r=0#story-continues-2"></a></div>
              <p id="story-continues-2" class="story-body-text story-content">Ms.
               Lovo is not Italy’s first shoeshine woman. In 2000, another female 
              entrepreneur, Rosalina Dallago, 51, opened a shoeshine shop in Rome’s 
              city center.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">A former model and later a restaurateur, Ms. Dallago has gently brushed the shoes of Italy’s elites, including the actor Alberto Sordi and assorted politicians.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Her
               tiny, narrow shop, she likes to say, is nested between the “sacred” — 
              the San Lorenzo in Lucina church — and the “profane” — the lower house 
              of Parliament.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“You
               know, when I took over his shop, the 72-year-old owner gave me his 
              brushes,” Ms. Dallago said, gently passing wooden brushes made of 
              horsehair. “It was a real baton passing. I felt like crying.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">In
               16 years, Ms. Dallago’s career rapidly expanded. She has run a 
              shoeshine corner inside Fiumicino airport, and another in a Roman club; 
              had a 12-minute national television program; and held entrepreneurship 
              courses for women. She collaborates with a female cobbler. All of her 
              enterprises are managed by women.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Her
               business, portrayed as a glamorous and sexy new way of shoe-shining, 
              made headlines in publications all over the world, from Germany to 
              Japan.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/04/world/xxshoeshine-web3/xxshoeshine-web3-master675.jpg" alt="" width="675" height="450"></p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span class="caption-text">Eleonora Lovo, is the second woman in Italy 
              to gain notoriety for choosing the job in recent years. “I don’t think 
              it’s a job for men only,” Ms. Lovo said. “I have always loved men’s

              together. Women’s shoes simply don’t.”</span></span></p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Her
               fame, however, still did not generate much competition until Ms. Lovo 
              came along, 500 kilometers, or about 310 miles, to the north.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“It’s
               a job that makes your hands dirty, and stay bent all day long,” Ms. 
              Dallago said with a smirk. “Not many women, and people in general, like 
              it.”</p>
              <div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"><a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/world/europe/women-try-to-make-italys-shoe-shining-as-chic-as-its-shoes.html?_r=0#story-continues-3"></a></div>
              <p id="story-continues-3" class="story-body-text story-content">Traditionally,
               shoe-shining is considered a humble job in Italy, one not in demand for
               decades. Its ranks grew even thinner in recent years.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">While
               it is common to see shoe-shiners at international airports or in 
              shopping areas in the United States or Britain, a city like Rome had 
              fewer than 10 shoe-shiners even in the golden era of the 1950s. And all 
              of them were men.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“It
               was a historically men-dominated job — only now things are changing a 
              bit,” said Tommaso Cancellara, the chief executive at Micam, Italy’s 
              main shoe fair.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Mr.
               Cancellara said that although shoe-shining was still considered a 
              humble job and clients could be somewhat haughty in Italy, the use of 
              professional shoe cream polishes was on the rise. Stores offering a 
              barbershop, shoe-shining service and shirt shopping all together have 
              opened since 2014 in cities around Italy.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“That
               to me suggests that Italians are fed up with the crisis, and at least 
              enjoy a moment of personal joy,” he said, adding that men no longer 
              spend much money on holidays or clothing, but they do treat themselves a
               bit.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“They
               have their shoes professionally shined and go to the barber’s shop,” 
              Mr. Cancellara explained. “I doubt any man complains it’s a woman 
              attending his shoes.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Being
               a woman in the profession, Ms. Lovo and Ms. Dallago agree, can indeed 
              be an advantage. The latter recounted flowers or Cartier boxes she had 
              rejected through the years, but she said none ever made her feel like 
              the “Mata Hari of the year 2000.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Ms. Lovo has a different attitude.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“I
               am a gentleman woman,” Ms. Lovo said, smiling under her salt-and-pepper
               disheveled bob. “I can’t see well-dressed men walking in dirty shoes. 
              That’s simply why I started polishing shoes.”</p>
