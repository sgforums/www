              <p><strong><span>He let woman jump queue, then won S$22.18 million lottery<br></span></strong><br>AFP<br>10 Dec 2010<br><br>MANILA, PHILIPPINES - An act of gallantry paid huge dividends for a 
              "humble gentleman" who won S$22.18 million in a Philippine lottery after
               letting a woman jump a queue and buy what would have been his losing 
              ticket.</p>
              <p>The 63-year-old winner's elation when collecting his 741 million 
              pesos (S$22.18 million) this week was tinged with empathy for the 
              excited lady who pushed in front of him, the lottery said Friday.</p>
              <p>"The woman cut in. He was being very gentlemanly so he just stepped 
              back and allowed her," Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office chair 
              Margie Juico told AFP.<br><br>"When he won, he kept thinking: how sad for that woman. She could have won the big prize if she had just been patient."</p>
              <p>Nobody had won the lottery since May 15, ratcheting up the prize 
              money because it accumulates every time someone fails to pick the lucky 
              numbers.</p>
              <p>The potential for a huge win prompted millions of people in this 
              impoverished country to form huge lines outside lottery outlets.</p>
              <p>Juico said the winner in the November 29 draw was "unassuming and 
              humble", and had told her that he had not even bothered to see if he 
              held the winning ticket for a week.</p>
              <p>A Filipino living in the United States, he had bought the ticket 
              while on a holiday to his homeland. He will return to the United States,
               where he works and has three children.</p>
              <p>The lottery agency has a policy of keeping the names of the winners secret, partly to protect them from kidnappers, Juico said.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>reminds me of NTUC. everytime i got buy grocery sure got people 1 to queue behind me. the problem is its early i the morning when the place just open so theres no much customer. if you queue probably you will use common sense and go for a counter with no people waiting there or less people waitiung there to pay. if you see in front the person got lots of things (that's me) then will you look for the next counter with less or only 1 2 items? if they like to cluster-fuck probably they want to see inside your wallet when you paying got how much. usually i will not open my wallet and have the money in my hand1. those want to stalk me 1 should know my style yet they still make believe and like to see me do paymets. silly. some will go to the extend of only buy a copy of newspaper and like to queue behind ou and wait. until to the extend that the saher at the next counter tell them to look for another place tto pay instead of cluster-fuck.</p></div>

              <p>my oroblem is even i let them pay frist they also say no thnaks. the aim is they want to see youopen wallet. if they see money they probably will orgasm. if they see only left 50 dollars they will say hahano money already and laff. but the problem is who in the modern world like a silly fuck will keep all tghe money in wallet? silly. the reason to my money money isi very thrifty. but they still believe i got online business lah, got strike 4d lah this and that. instead of spedning the time working and earnning money they like to immitate and fantasisze on why i no need to work. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
