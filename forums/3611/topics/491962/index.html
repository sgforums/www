              <p class="story-body-text story-content">MILAN —  The waiters glided through the crowded dining room of Ingalera,
               a restaurant that opened recently to rave reviews. Dinner reservations 
              are almost fully booked for March, and the Milanese elite have taken 
              note. A former bank president came a few weeks ago. So did a former Miss
               Italy. Families come on weekends.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">For
               Silvia Polleri, the restaurant’s manager and visionary, InGalera is a 
              dizzying triumph, if more because of the locale than because of the 
              food.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">It
               is inside the Bollate penitentiary, a medium-security prison with 1,100
               inmates on the outskirts of Milan. The waiters, dishwashers and cooks 
              have been convicted of homicide, armed robbery, drug trafficking and 
              other crimes.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“May
               I take your plate, sir?” asked a waiter, Carlos, an inmate dressed in a
               tie, white shirt and black vest as he cleared a table on a recent 
              night.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">It
               is hard to imagine a less likely culinary success story than InGalera, 
              or a more intriguing experiment in rehabilitating inmates — and 
              confronting public attitudes about them.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/06/world/PRISON4/PRISON4-master675.jpg" alt="" width="675" height="450"></p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Few
               people think of prisons as a place for a nice night out, yet the 
              novelty of going to the prison grounds for food and drink has resonated,
               and even become something of a marketing tool.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Ms.
               Polleri decided that the best way to reassure patrons was to take a 
              wink-wink approach. The name, InGalera, is Italian slang for “In 
              Prison.”</p>
              <p id="story-continues-1" class="story-body-text story-content">The
               restaurant’s design is sleek, airy and modern, but the walls are 
              decorated with posters from famous prison movies, including "Escape From Alcatraz" with Clint Eastwood.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div id="supplemental-1" class="supplemental first"></div>
              <div id="story-continues-2" class="story-interrupter"></div>
              <p id="story-continues-3" class="story-body-text story-content">Curiosity
               about a forbidden and feared world has turned a night at InGalera into a
               daring adventure, with a fine meal as a bonus. (It has a rating of 4.5 
              out of 5 stars on Tripadvisor.)</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“We
               wanted to see the reality here,” said Carla Borghi, who came with a 
              group of couples from the nearby town of Paderno Dugnano. “It is not the
               classic restaurant. But it is a classic restaurant. The food is 
              excellent.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/06/world/PRISON3/PRISON3-master675.jpg" alt="" width="675" height="450"></p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">For
               years, Italy has struggled with its prison system, as well as how to 
              balance punishment with rehabilitation. Overcrowding had become such a 
              problem that in January 2013 </p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Italian
               lawmakers responded with more alternative measures for minor crimes. In
               2014, Italy also repealed harsh drug sentencing laws enacted during the
               1990s, similar to the “three strikes” laws in the United States. In 
              2014, Italy began releasing 10,000 inmates (of roughly 60,000) who had 
              been convicted of minor offenses.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">But
               the issue of how best to rehabilitate offenders — and lower the 
              recidivism rate — remained difficult. Italy has long allowed inmates in 
              medium-security prisons to move around the facilities during the day.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“The
               main problem has been that they do little during the day, which doesn’t
               help them at the present, nor for their future outside prisons,” said 
              Alessio Scandurra, who works for Antigone, a nonprofit group focused on the rights of detainees.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The Bollate prison was at the vanguard of experimentation even before 
              opening the restaurant. Under the director, Massimo Parisi, the prison 
              offers an array of programs. Companies have work programs on prison 
              grounds. Volunteers teach theater and painting. Carpentry skills are 
              taught in workshops equipped with power drills and saws. Inmates 
              maintain a stable of horses in the prison yard.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/06/world/PRISON2/PRISON2-master675.jpg" alt="" width="675" height="450"></p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">There
               is also an initiative involving a carefully vetted group of 200 inmates
               who are allowed to leave each day for jobs with an outside firm. 
              Inmates travel without supervision on public transportation; they must 
              check in upon arrival at work, and at other points during the day.</p>
              <div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"><a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/world/europe/in-milan-diners-go-to-prison-to-get-a-good-meal.html?_r=0#story-continues-4"></a></div>
              <p id="story-continues-4" class="story-body-text story-content">Mr. Parisi said only one inmate had failed to return at the appointed time, and he showed up a few days later.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">But sending out inmates is different from asking law-abiding citizens to come in for a meal.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“Our
               first worry was: Who would come?” Mr. Parisi said. “But many people are
               coming. People are curious about prisons. It is an unknown world to 
              many people. That creates interest.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The
               force behind the project is Ms. Polleri, who spent 22 years teaching 
              kindergarten before becoming a caterer and later founding a social co-op
               in 2004 to help inmates. She hired select inmates from Bollate for 
              catering jobs outside the prison. Once, she took a convicted bank robber
               to wait on tables at a reception in a bank.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">But the idea of starting a restaurant was an altogether different challenge.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“People
               looked at me like I was crazy,” she said. “They also thought I was 
              crazy when I said I wanted to name it InGalera. But I wanted to stop 
              talking about this in a sweet way.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/06/world/JP-PRISON/JP-PRISON-master675.jpg" alt="" width="675" height="450"></p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">She
               solicited grants from sponsors, including PricewaterhouseCoopers, the 
              accounting firm, and a local architect designed the restaurant’s 
              interior for free. It is on the ground floor of the dormitory for prison
               guards; inmates are housed in a different part of the prison. She hired
               a maître d’ — who seats guests and handles the money — and a 
              professional chef, Ivan Manzo, who was unfazed by working with convicts.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“I’ve seen a lot of crazy people working in kitchens outside of here!” Mr. Manzo said.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">In
               the kitchen, inmates were busily preparing dishes as one, Mirko, was 
              showing another how to make tarts. Inmates are paid up to 1,000 euros a 
              month to work in the restaurant, and share tips.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“It
               is a matter of pride, a way to make people happy and show them that 
              even inmates can change and evolve,” said Mirko, who like the other 
              inmates wanted to be identified only by his first name.</p>
              <div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"><a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/world/europe/in-milan-diners-go-to-prison-to-get-a-good-meal.html?_r=0#story-continues-5"></a></div>
              <p id="story-continues-5" class="story-body-text story-content">Ms.
               Polleri says that she realizes the restaurant may bother some people 
              and that she does not want to offend victims of crime. But she argued 
              that prisons must train inmates to become responsible citizens capable 
              of re-entering society, and noted that the recidivism rate of inmates in
               similar programs is far lower than average.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Before
               the dinner crowd arrived on a recent night, Ms. Polleri hovered over 
              the waiters, reminding Carlos to “walk straight.” Her most nerve-racking
               moment came in early December when she learned that a food critic for 
              one of the country’s most important newspapers, Della Sera, had secretly come for dinner one night and was preparing a review.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“I
               couldn’t sleep for a week,” Ms. Polleri said. The critic praised the 
              food, the waiters and the “convivial atmosphere.” He even praised the 
              prices, which are more reasonable than most Milanese restaurants. “To 
              have honest prices,” he wrote, “you have to come to jail.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Looking
               across the dining room, Ms. Polleri pointed to the guests enjoying 
              their meals. “This is the revolution,” she said. “A lot of these people 
              before didn’t know where the prison was.”</p>
