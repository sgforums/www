              <p>Most
               kids who set up lemonade stands hope to earn enough for an ice cream or
               maybe a new bike. But young Tristan has a loftier goal: He wants to get
               adopted.</p>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph">From his front yard 
              in Springfield, Missouri, the 9-year-old spent last weekend selling cups
               of lemonade and cookies by the hundreds. Every cent will go to legal 
              fees so his guardian, Donnie Davis, can adopt him.</div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><br></div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Davis
               and her husband, Jimmy Davis, had expected to raise a few hundred bucks
               with the lemonade stand and a yard sale -- far short of the $5,000 to 
              $10,000 in fees it will take to adopt the boy. But then the local media 
              got wind of her story, word got around, and people began flocking to her
               yard.</div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><br></div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"It just spread," she told CNN. "We had people driving two-and-a-half hours just to meet Tristan."</div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><br></div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph">On
               Saturday alone, more than 600 people came to donate and share their own
               adoption stories, Davis said. "We were constantly running for more ice,
               water, cookies," she said. "There was one point in time, we put water 
              in the cooler and sold out before it was even cold."</div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><br></div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph">The family has now raised more than $18,000 from in-person sales and donations through an online cloudfunding page<a href="https://www.youcaring.com/tristan-jacobson-quill-davis-552049"></a>. Davis says the additional money will go into an education fund for Tristan.</div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph">It's welcome news for a boy whose life has been full of struggles.</div>

              <h3>A difficult past</h3>
              </div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph">On Tristan's you care page <a href="https://www.youcaring.com/tristan-jacobson-quill-davis-552049"></a>, Donnie Davis offers a sobering account of the boy's childhood:</div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><br></div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Ten years ago Donnie Davis' former husband impregnated a 15-year-old girl, who then gave birth to Tristan.</div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><br></div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph">When
               Tristan was 3 months old, his biological father was sentenced to prison
               for 22 years on a federal gun conviction. Davis divorced the father and
               agreed to help the struggling young mother by taking temporary custody 
              of Tristan.</div>
              </div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><br></div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><img src="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160426104528-05-tristan-davis-lemonade-stand-medium-plus-169.jpg" alt="" width="307" height="173"></div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><br></div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph">
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Donnie Davis then married Jimmy Davis 
              and the couple raised Tristan as their own. When Tristan was 
              two-and-a-half, his biological mother seemed to have gotten her life 
              together and he went back to live with her, Davis said. Davis still kept
               in close contact with Tristan, taking him for weekends and speaking on 
              the phone with him a few times a week.</div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><br></div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph">By
               the time Tristan turned 4,  Davis said she began to notice differences 
              in his appearance. His clothes were dirty and too small. His mother 
              allegedly was using drugs, Davis said, claiming the little boy was often
               left to fend for himself<a href="https://www.youcaring.com/tristan-jacobson-quill-davis-552049">.</a></div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><br></div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Davis
               said she repeatedly contacted child welfare agencies but no action was 
              taken. She asked the school nurse to report Tristan's abuse and begged 
              neighbors to keep an eye out for Tristan.</div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><img src="http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Lifestyle/HT_Tristan_Lemonade_02_jrl_160425_4x3_992.jpg" alt="" width="992" height="744"></div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><br></div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Months
               and many desperate phone calls later, two officers knocked on Davis' 
              door late at night to ask if she could take Tristan into her care. He 
              had been left at a local homeless shelter after his biological mother 
              left him with a friend for days, she said.</div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><br></div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph">The
               Davises have spent the last four years trying to help Tristan overcome 
              years of abuse and neglect. It wasn't easy, and Davis took a medical 
              leave from work to avoid losing her job. Tristan has suffered from PTSD 
              and is prone to emotional outbursts.</div>
              </div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><br></div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Once he was hospitalized for 
              threatening to kill himself at school.  Tristan also was diagnosed with a
               sensory processing disorder, Donnie Davis said, which doctors 
              attributed to the second-hand meth smoke he ingested during his 
              developmental years.</div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><br></div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph">
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph">
              <h3>A brighter future</h3>
              </div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Today,
               Tristan is on medication and has a support system of doctors and 
              teachers to help him navigate through life.  Davis says he is getting 
              straight As in school and is slowly learning how to make friends and 
              have healthy relationships.</div>
              </div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><br></div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph">
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph">After the adoption is complete, the 
              family hopes to take a vacation to Oklahoma City to see NBA star Kevin 
              Durant -- Tristan's favorite player -- play a game. Tristan always tells
               his mom, "Kevin Durant is my bro."</div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><br></div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph">To
               mark a new start with his adoptive family, Tristan also wants to change
               his name. His first choice was Star-Lord after Chris Pratt's character 
              in his favorite movie, "Guardians of the Galaxy."</div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><br></div>
              <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"It's
               a good laugh, but Star-Lord is not going to be his new name," said 
              Davis, who reminded Tristan that Star-Lord's real name in the movie is 
              Peter Quill. "We weren't crazy about Peter but he loves Quill. He 
              proudly tells his teachers and everyone to now call him Quill Tristan 
              Davis."</div>

              This is exactly why I do not like the Western culture. They use the term "special needs" as an excuse for so many things. :(
                  
              I am sorry to hear about the abuse the boy suffered in the past. Nonetheless, I feel that what they are doing with the boy now may not be good for him.
