              <div class="text combinedtext parbase section">
              <p>( Canada)When Mark Landry woke up Tuesday morning, part of him was missing.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="text combinedtext parbase section">
              <p>The Montreal man doesn’t have much in terms of
               material things. He lives on the streets, but he brightens many 
              commuters’ days with his violin, which he’s been playing since he was 17
               years old, in Metro stations around the city. That small piece of 
              hardwood and taut strings also kept him fed, as he used it to busk 
              during rush hour.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="text combinedtext parbase section">
              <p>Tuesday morning, though, he awoke after a 
              night during which temperatures dipped into the 30s to find the violin 
              that served as his livelihood and his joy had been stolen in the night.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="text combinedtext parbase section">
              <p>Landry immediately made a sign informing his 
              morning fans of what occurred and outstretched a red Solo cup to 
              passersby in the Joliette station in hopes of raising enough to buy a 
              new one.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="text combinedtext parbase section">
              <p>Marie-Philippe Mercier Lambert saw the sign 
              and snapped a photo, posting it to Facebook with a message that 
              explained, in French, why she shared it: “in the hope that a good 
              Samaritan has a violin to give.”</p>
              </div>
              <div class="text combinedtext parbase section">
              <p>That’s when staff at the Orchestre 
              Métropolitain, which is “dedicated to bringing classical music from here
               and abroad to the entire community of Metropolitan Montréal,” according
               to its wedsite, found the post and showed it to the orchestra’s CEO Jean R. Dupré.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="text combinedtext parbase section">
              <p>“We were really, really touched by this 
              posting,” Dupré told The Washington Post via telephone on Tuesday night.
               “We said, ‘Oh my God, this poor man lost his only way of communicating 
              his passion to others.’”</p>
              </div>
              <div class="text combinedtext parbase section">
              <p>He didn’t waste any time in calling his 
              friends at Maison du Violon, a local violin shop, to ask if they would 
              like to help him replace Landry’s instrument. According to Dupré, they 
              said, “that’s a great idea.”</p>
              </div>
              <div class="text combinedtext parbase section">
              <p>They offered to help Dupré give Landry a brand new violin, case and bow by selling it at cost, CBC reported.</p>
              <div class="text combinedtext parbase section">
              <p>“We found a solution to help him out,” Dupré 
              said. “We had to realize this person was not just a nobody. We knew this
               person, because he had been playing in the subway for the last six or 
              seven years. This person was a person who played music.”</p>
              </div>
              <div class="text combinedtext parbase section">
              <p>Francis Lapointe of the Maison du Violon said they wanted to “put music back in his life,” according to CBCnews.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="text combinedtext parbase section">
              <p>Dupré’s motivation was simple.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="text combinedtext parbase section">
              <p>“This is what the orchestra is all about,” he said.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="text combinedtext parbase section">
              <p>Meanwhile, Landry prayed, convinced in his faith that God would deliver him a new instrument.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="text combinedtext parbase section">
              <p>“God’s gonna give me a new one,” Landry said. 
              Otherwise, he would “go through a lower level of poverty, which is to 
              live without my violin.”</p>
              </div>
              <div class="text combinedtext parbase section">
              <p>He told Dupré he was lost without his instrument.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="text combinedtext parbase section">
              <p>“I talked to God this morning and said I cannot live without my violin,” Landry told him.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="text combinedtext parbase section">
              <p>As the head of the city’s orchestra and a music lover, it’s a feeling Dupré understands.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="text combinedtext parbase section">
              <p>“If you know music, the musicians actually connect with their instruments,” he said.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="text combinedtext parbase section">
              <p>Tuesday afternoon, Dupré, joined by a CBC news
               crew, delivered the violin to Landry. The resulting video shows the 
              bearded man’s eyes light up as he rips off his red-and-black checkered 
              jacket to free his arms and begin playing.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="text combinedtext parbase section">
              <p>“Immediately when I gave him the violin, he 
              opened the case and said, ‘God listened to me,’” Dupré said. “He just 
              grabbed the instrument right at that exact moment and began playing.”</p>
              </div>
              <div class="text combinedtext parbase section">
              <p>“It was really a special moment for us and for
               music as a whole,” Dupré said, adding that he hopes the experience will
               encourage others to help those in need.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="text combinedtext parbase section">
              <p>“I hope it was actually inspiring for other 
              people,” Dupré said. “It was a small gesture, but I hope it inspires 
              other people. That’s what the takeaway should be.”</p>
              <p>Happy Ending;</p>
