              <p class="first"><strong>The Manila Film Center, Philippines </strong><br>When the Manila Film Center was being built in the early ‘80s, the scaffolding collapsed and several workmen fell to their deaths in the orchestra pit. Rumour has it that instead of retrieving the bodies and giving the workmen proper burials, the First Lady at the time, Imelda Marcos, ordered that cement be poured onto the pit. Now visitors report hearing voices and poltergeist activity.<br><br><strong>The Tower of London, England</strong><br>Having witnessed numerous tortures, murders and executions over the course of 1,000 years, it’s no wonder this infamous tower is home to dozens of ghosts: among them famous historical figures like Lady Jane Grey and Ann Boleyn, who were both beheaded in the tower; as were Thomas Becket, Sir Walter Raleigh and the Countess of Salisbury, who was hacked to death by the executioner when she tried to escape the noose and scaffold. <br><br><strong>Aradale Mental Hospital, Australia</strong><br>In the rural city of Ararat in Victoria lies the abandoned Aradale hospital. Opened in 1867, Aradale is Australia’s biggest abandoned lunatic asylum, and its conditions were one of the most appalling at the time, with many patients suffering from cruel treatment. More than 13,000 people died within its walls, and their ghosts can sometimes be felt or seen by those brave enough to explore its cells, rooms and morgue.<br><br><strong>Tambun Inn, Malaysia</strong><br>Tambun Inn in Ipoh has a slew of ghost stories. Some guests have reported lights in their rooms being mysteriously turned on and off, while others say they’ve been awakened by eerie whispers in their ears in the middle of the night. Many have seen the ghost of an old woman passing through the corridors. <br><br><strong>Diplomat Hotel, Philippines</strong><br>On top of Dominican Hill in Baguio City is the now abandoned Diplomat Hotel. Before it was developed into a hotel, the building was a seminary founded in 1911; and during World War II, many nuns and priests were beheaded there. Guests and employees often saw headless apparitions in the hotel; and even when it closed in 1987 after the death of its owner, the sightings still persist.<br><br><strong>Okiku’s Well, Japan</strong><br>Himeji Castle in Japan’s Hyogo Prefecture is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most visited castles in Japan. It is also home to one of the most haunted sites in the country – Okiku’s Well. Legend has it that a samurai named Aoyama lived in the castle and had a maid who refused to give in to his advances. To preserve her honour, she threw herself into the castle’s well and drowned. Her ghost supposedly rises from the well every night and sobs eerily. Trivia: The legend of Okiku’s Well was what inspired the Japanese horror film <em>Ringu</em>.<br><br><strong>The Savoy Hotel, India</strong><br>Located in the hill station Mussoorie in the state of Uttarakhand in northern India, The Savoy Hotel was where a spiritualist named Lady Orme died from poisoning. It is said that her spectre can be seen meandering through its halls. Fun fact: The Savoy was also the inspiration for Agatha Christie’s 1920 novel <em>The Mysterious Affair at The Styles</em>.<br><br><strong>Tuen Mun Road, Hong Kong</strong><br>Because of the many road accidents that have occurred here over the years, many claim that Tuen Mun Road in Hong Kong is haunted. The superstitious even believe that some of the more recent deaths may have been a result of drivers swerving off to avoid hitting phantom figures popping up unexpectedly in the middle of the road.<br><br><strong>The Normandie Apartment, Shanghai</strong><br>Designed by famous Hungarian architect Ladislav Hudec, this French Renaissance-style apartment block was built in 1924, and was home to numerous Chinese film stars. A young actress who killed herself jumping out the window supposedly haunts the unit on the seventh floor. <br><br><strong>Waverly Hills Sanatorium, USA</strong><br>One of the most notorious haunted places in America, Waverly Hills in Kentucky was a sanatorium in the early 20th century for those suffering from tuberculosis. Many spooky apparitions have been seen here: among them an old woman with heavy shackles around her arms and legs, a little girl on the third floor with no eyes playing with a ball, and a pregnant nurse who hung herself in Room 502. Some people have also reported hearing sounds of children chanting, “Ring a ring a roses” coming from the empty rooftop.<br><br><strong>Bhangarh Fort, India</strong><br>Legend has it that there was an evil magician spurned by a beautiful princess living in the town of Bhangarh in Rajasthan. He placed a curse on the town and its fort, and war and disaster ensued for centuries. Since then, locals claim that the place has been shrouded in darkness. The site is even said to be so famously haunted that the Indian government has put up a sign restricting visitors from entering after sunset. <br><br><strong>The Catacombs, France</strong><br>To the south of Paris are the famous Catacombs, an underground 18th century ossuary that is home to the bones and skulls of more than six million Parisians. As if being surrounded by a wall of skeletons in a dimly lit subterranean cemetery isn’t scary enough, people have reported hearing ghostly cries and being touched by dark shadows while walking along its somber tunnels. <br><br><strong>The Stanley Hotel, Colorado</strong><br>Made famous by the Stanley Kubrick movie based on Stephen King’s book <em>The Shining</em>, The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park Colorado is supposedly haunted by the man who built it, F.O. Stanley. He and his wife Flora can sometimes be seen playing the piano in the ballroom. But the fourth floor is said to be the most haunted place in the hotel: The ghosts of children have been seen in Room 418, while Room 407 has a spirit who supposedly likes to turn the lights on and off.</p>
