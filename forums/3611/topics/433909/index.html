              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hangzhou: </span>A two-year-old Chinese girl left unattended fell 10 stories from her family's apartment window and survived after being caught by a woman passing by, state media reported Sunday.</p>
              <p>The toddler was in critical condition Sunday with internal bleeding and other unspecified injuries while the woman who saved her suffered a broken arm, China Central Television and the Xinhua News Agency said.</p>
              <p>The girl, named Zhang Fangyu but known by the nickname Niu Niu, was in the care of her grandmother Saturday afternoon when the older woman left the 10th-floor apartment outside the eastern city of Hangzhou to run an errand, CCTV said.</p>
              <p>Neighbors saw Niu Niu dangling from the apartment window for several minutes, Xinhua said, and when the girl fell, Wu Juping "kicked off her high-heeled shoes" and ran to catch the child.</p>
              <p>"It was so urgent. I saw her when she was about to fall and rushed there, and after tens of seconds she fell off," CCTV quoted Wu as saying.</p>
              <p>A 31-year-old mother, Wu told CCTV that when she saw the hanging girl she thought of her own seven-month-old son who had once fallen from a high chair and cut his mouth: "I thought to myself 'I should stretch my arms to her. Because I am right here, I must get her.' Then I made it. I caught her in my arms."</p>
              <p>The impact knocked Wu out and sent her crumbling to the ground along with breaking her left arm, the reports said.</p>
              <p>CCTV quoted an unidentified doctor at the Children's Hospital of Zhejiang Hospital as saying that a scan showed no damage to Niu Niu's brain but that the girl's abdomen was swollen in a sign of possible injury to organs.</p>
