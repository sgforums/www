              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1449816840146_602" class="first">NEWRY, Maine — Santa and his helpers hit the ski slopes to spread some holiday cheer on Sunday.</p>
              <p>All
               told, a mob of 150 right jolly ol' elves hopped on skis and snowboards 
              for the 16th annual Skiing Santas event at Sunday River ski resort.</p>
              <p>The event serves as a festive kickoff to the holiday season.</p>
              <p>"It's
               really fun because everyone is a little wild and crazy," said Catherine
               Bolender, 53, of Waterboro, who's been participating for about a dozen 
              years. "It's a fun, festive event."</p>
              <p>Thom Bureau, a snowboarder, agreed that it's chaotic — and unforgettable.</p>
              <p>"When
               you're on the chairlift, you look back as you're getting off, and the 
              whole chairlift is full of Santas. It's kind of freaky, actually," he 
              said.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1449816840146_608">The event has become so popular that it's difficult to get a ticket.</p>
              <p>Brad
               and Heather Cope of Newton Falls, Ohio, said the online registration 
              filled up in 4 minutes on Nov. 30. They said they were lucky to make the
               cut.</p>
              <p>"We were both on our computers at noon to make sure we got 
              it," said Brad Cope, a former ski instructor who installs swimming 
              pools. Heather is a Maine native and nurse practitioner.</p>
              <p>Resort officials say the event raised a little more than $3,000 for the Sunday River Community Fund, a local charity.</p>
              <p>Participants
               were required to donate at least $15 to the fund. In exchange, they 
              were allowed to ski for free and to receive another lift ticket good 
              through Dec. 18.</p>

              <p>Santa's best present: compassion.</p>
              <p>A Santa Claus in Ohio pretended to sleep Sunday while a tired 
              2-year-old boy who has battled seizures all his life sat in his lap.</p>
              <p>Little Ryland Wade had suffered a seizure just before his mother took him to the Belden Village Mall in Canton to see Santa.</p>
              <p>When Santa saw that Ryland was asleep, he played along. The adorable photo was posted on social media.</p>
              <p>"I was pleasantly surprised that he did that," mom Samantha Wade told the Daily News on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Ryland was diagnosed with ith epilepsy and spastic quadriplegia 
              cerebral palsy after a complicated birth. He often has multiple seizures
               in one day, including 42 on Thanksgiving last year, his mom said.</p>
              <p>He is on three different medications, but his mother is hoping for the 
              legalization of medical marijuana, which could improve his conditon</p>
              <p>Despite the seizures, his mother tries to let him experience as much as
               possible. Loud noises can trigger the seizures, so the family tries to 
              avoid those.</p>
              <p>When his mother heard about the Santa event for children with special 
              needs, she signed up Ryland. Even though Ryland had the seizure that 
              morning, she took him anyway.</p>
              <p>"He probably won't wake up for you," Samantha Wade told Santa.</p>
              <p>As a result, Santa gave the Wades a pretty cool present.</p>
