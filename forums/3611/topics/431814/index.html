              <p>Ever wonder why a girl freaks out for no discernible reason after what you say? If you want to say something to impress a girl, make sure it's a good one. What may be an innocuous, harmless statements to you can be completely anger-provoking and hurtful to her. You probably need to strike these words off your vocabulary -- for good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"How many guys have you slept with?"</strong><br>This would be a single phrase that shuts a woman's attraction switch off forever. A question like this from a boyfriend shows that he probably isn't ready for a serious relationship. If you're curious, there are more subtle ways to ask this. So, be creative. She's probably not going to tell you the answer anyway.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"Relax."</strong><br>We know your intentions may be totally innocent. But saying that to a girl who's already freaking out implies that you're brushing it off by telling her to chill out. Also, it simply means that you're denying any reason for her to be upset. Short but not so sweet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"It must be that time of the month."</strong><br>If you think this is funny, you might want to rethink your sense of humour. Try this and you'll run the risk sticking your foot in the mouth and that probably isn't the body part you would want to press your lips against.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"Why are you being so emotional?"</strong><br>Likewise, this often stokes the fire rather than defuse the tension. Playing the blame game makes her feel helpless, which puts her on the defensive. Refrain from asking this if you don't want her to get worked up even more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"You sound like my ex-girlfriend."</strong><br>Sure, honesty is the best policy. But you wouldn't want to be that blunt in this case. Keep it to yourself -- your girlfriend certainly doesn't want to hear about it. Worse still, it will put her on the defensive and might even lead to a dramatic breakup.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"My ex used to...."</strong><br>The first thing that pops into her mind when you compare her with your ex is that you are not over your old flame yet. Being clueless as ever is acceptable but not when you mention about your ex. It shows that you don't value your present relationship.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"You're becoming like your mother."</strong><br>Most women dread being compared to their mothers. Comments like that never impress a girl. You're just one sentence away from creating an argument that would seem to come out of nowhere. Find something else to say.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"When are you due?"</strong><br>Asking for a woman's age is not the worst question. But asking if one is pregnant or when she is due would probably land you in hot water. Never assume a woman is pregnant unless her belly is really huge. If she's not, you wouldn't want to get that mean stare from her after that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"You look good for your age."</strong><br>Anything with a remark like this is not a compliment. It is likely to be offensive to some. What she hears is "You look great -- compared with other old people." You're better off not mentioning age at all.</p>
