              <p><strong>A TEENAGER is set to be nominated for a heroism award after swimming 800m in freezing water to save a middle-aged mate from certain drowning. </strong></p>
              <p>The 17-year-old youth Daniel Hobbson used a child's plastic blow-up swim ring to rescue a 43-year-old man who had fallen out of a tinny in the middle of Lake Lonsdale in Stawell in the state's west. </p>
              <p><img src="http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2012/01/09/1226240/084750-daniel-hobson-rescuer.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><span class="caption-text"><strong>Daniel Hobbson is set to be nominated for heroism after swimming 800m in the freezing waters of Lake Lonsdale to save his mate. Adrian Pearce who managed to swim to shore, congratulates his friend. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span class="caption-text"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span class="caption-text">
              </span></p><p>It took nearly 40 minutes for Daniel to tow his friend back to shore, authorities said.</p>
              <p>Three men had been in the boat in the middle of the lake when it overturned about 7.30pm last night.</p>
              <p>Ararat Sgt Brad Bennett described Daniel as a hero.</p>
              <p>"He did put himself at risk. He ended up suffering hypothermia himself just by rescuing this guy, and without him this guy would have drowned without doubt,'' Sgt Bennett said.</p>
              <p>"The guy said when he came in that he'd given up and he was prepared to go under but he saw the young kid swimming out and wasn't far, so he tried to hang on for another minute or two and that saved his life.</p>
              <div class="story-promo story-promo-middle">
              <p>"He was really struggling, and he said, 'I'd given up but I just saw the little rubber tube coming towards me', so he decided to try and hang on for a little bit longer.''</p>
              <p>Sgt Bennett said Mr Hobbson was camping with the men and other friends at a house nearby.</p>
              <p>Mr Hobbson had stayed on the shore while the three men went out in the boat, which capsized after one of the men leaned over the side.</p>
              <p>Sgt Bennett said Mr Hobbson swam out to the man when he saw him struggling</p>
              <p>"He's probably swum at least 800m in freezing water to go out there and drag this guy back.</p>
              <p>"And it took a long time for them to get back because the guy is quite large, just a 17-year-old kid dragging him back with a rubber tube.''</p>
              <p>He said the pair took at least 30-40 minutes to get back to shore.</p>
              <p>"I don't think I could have done it, I'm not physically fit enough to have done it, he's done an amazing job.''</p>
              <p>Mr Hobbson, the 43-year-old man and another two men aged 20 and 33 were all treated for hypothermia and released from hospital last night.</p>
              <p>All four men were from Sebastopol, outside Ballarat.</p>
              <p>Sgt Bennett said he would ensure the boy was recognised for his efforts and would recommend him for a heroism award.</p>
