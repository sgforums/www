              in so many delightful ways, these streets offer a myriad of attractions 
              that continue to delight locals as well as visitors from around the 
              world. </p>

              <h2>1. Champs Elysees, Paris, France</h2>
              <p><img src="http://cdn.womanitely.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Champs-Elysees-Paris.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="329"></p>
              <p>Embodying all the celebrated beauty of Paris, <strong>the Champs-Elysees</strong> is generally regarded as the grandest street on the planet.  Moreover, 
              it is also known as the most beautiful street in the world.  Home to 
              illustrious monuments like the Arc de Triomphe, the thoroughfare is also
               strewn with luxury shops, cafes, hotels, and boutique hotels.  No visit
               to Paris would be complete without a stroll along the Champs-Elysees</p>
              <h2>2. La Rambla, Barcelona, Spain</h2>
              <p><img src="http://cdn.womanitely.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/La-Rambla-Barcelona.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="324"></p>
              <p>Connecting Plaça de Catalunya with Port Vell’s Christopher Columbus 
              Monument, this central Barcelona street is like a party that never 
              sleeps.  Frequented by tourists and locals alike, <strong>La Rambla</strong> has its own energy and symbolic beauty.  Filled with cafes, bars, 
              restaurants, shops, and street performers, it is one of the best-loved 
              stretches in all of Europe. People who have walked the street have often
               lamented that it had an end as they wished it would go on and on.</p>
              <h2>3. Las Vegas Strip, Nevada, US</h2>
              <p><img src="http://cdn.womanitely.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Las-Vegas-Strip-Nevada.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="332"></p>
              <p>Perhaps the best lit street on the planet, <strong>the Las Vegas Strip</strong> is known world-wide for its magnificent displays of illuminated signs, 
              luxury hotels, and, of course, casinos. Tourists come from all over the 
              world to shop, attend shows, and people watch along this strip that has 
              become synonymous with gambling, risk-taking, and thrill-seeking!</p>
              <h2>4. Nanjing Road, Shanghai, China</h2>
              <p><img src="http://cdn.womanitely.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Nanjing-Road-Shanghai.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333"></p>
              <p>Once known as Nanking Road, today’s <strong>Nanjing Road</strong> still 
              continues as the most famous shop and market-strewn street in all of 
              China – perhaps even all of Asia! As the world’s longest shopping 
              street, Nanking Road is six kilometers (nearly four miles) long and 
              filled with everything from antiques to foodstuffs. It is also home to a
               staggering array of hotels and restaurants. The street is said to be 
              visited by as many as one million people each day.</p>
              <h2>5. Via Dolorosa, Jerusalem</h2>
              <p><img src="http://cdn.womanitely.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Via-Dolorosa-Jerusalem.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333"></p>
              <p>Known as the ‘way of sorrows,’ <strong>Via Dolorosa</strong> traces the 
              route walked by Christ toward the cross where he was crucified. People 
              come to this road from around the world to pay homage to Christ in this 
              city that is filled with religious monuments and sites. Marked by Nine 
              Stations of the Cross, Via Dolorosa is the site of weekly symbolic 
              processions that lead from the Fortress of Antonia all along a route 
              that twists and turns.</p>

              <h2>6. Nevsky Prospekt, St. Petersburg, Russia</h2>
              <p><img src="http://cdn.womanitely.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Nevsky-Prospekt-St.-Petersburg.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333"></p>
              <p>Illustriously planned by Peter the Great, this grand avenue is 
              celebrated for its historic importance as well as its literary 
              connections.  Famously depicted in Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment, 
              the thoroughfare has captivated people from all over the world as it 
              embodies Russia’s mystery and, of course, royal grandeur so evident in 
              this remarkable city, the one-time home of the tsars.  Cathedrals, 
              palaces, and other major architectural attractions stud this celebrated 
              street.</p>
              <h2>7. Broadway, New York City, US</h2>
              <p><img src="http://cdn.womanitely.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Broadway-New-York-City.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="313"></p>
              <p>The oldest north-south street in the city, <strong>Broadway</strong> is 
              best known as the most important theatre district in the entire nation. 
               Moreover, the street runs along famous New York City sections like 
              Central Park and is studded with important buildings like the Woolworth 
              Building, Alexander Hamilton US Custom House, Morgan Stanley Building, 
              Grand Central Hotel, and Trinity Church.  No visit to this city is 
              complete without a stroll down Broadway!</p>
              <h2>8. Via Appia, Rome, Italy</h2>
              <p><img src="http://cdn.womanitely.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Via-Appia-Rome.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="331"></p>
              <p>Among the earliest Roman roads, it remains one of the most famous roads today.  There is a section of the <strong>Via Appia</strong> used in Rome today for busy traffic, yet much of this road that leads 
              out of the city is in ruins.  Even so, these ruins and the archeological
               sites along the road attract people from all over the world.  To walk 
              part of the Via Appia or Appian Way as it is often called is a memorable
               event one is never likely to forget.  Moreover, the quality of Roman 
              construction is evident in this road’s classical design</p>
              <h2>9. Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City, Mexico</h2>
              <p><img src="http://cdn.womanitely.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Paseo-de-la-Reforma-Mexico-City-Mexico.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375"></p>
              <p>One of the most famous streets in the western hemisphere, <strong>Paseo de la Reforma</strong> is well-known throughout the world.  Modeled after Europe’s grand 
              boulevards, Mexico City’s major thoroughfare is home to the nation’s 
              National Palace as well as renowned landmarks like El Angel de la 
              Independencia and others that honor heroes of Mexico and the Americas.  
              Studded with luxury hotels and tourist attractions, this is a must-visit
               street when traveling to Mexico City</p>
              <h2>10. Piccadilly Circus, London, UK</h2>
              <p><img src="http://cdn.womanitely.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Piccadilly-Circus-London.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="331"></p>
              <p>This stretch of road, better described as a junction, is one of the 
              most well-known places in London. Popular among visitors to the UK, <strong>Piccadilly Circus</strong> is home to nightclubs, theatres, and memorials that are known 
              throughout the world.  Filled with illuminated signs and throngs of 
              people, this thoroughfare is one of the most recognized stretches of 
              asphalt world-wide.  With so many attractions, it’s easy to see why 
              visitors can’t wait to board London’s double-decker buses to visit this 
              part of town!</p>
              <p>A trip down any one of these streets would be magnificent, but if you
               are lucky enough to see them all so much the better! Each one is 
              wonderful in its own unique way.</p>
