              <p class="articleabstract">The Chilean Church has given its blessing to the World Cup with an advert showing home international Fabian Orellana booting a ball skywards which comes back down and ends up in the hands of ... Jesus Christ.</p>
              <p>"Thank you, Lord, for football," is the message in the campaign which the church has launched on its website, www.iglesia.cl.</p>
              <p>The Church recognises, it says, that God and football can co-exist.</p>
              <p>"Millions of people go to mass in the morning and off to the football in the evening. Because we are a church with a mission we live out the best of our values alongside the hopes of an entire nation" around the Chilean colours, the campaign suggests.</p>
              <p>The campaign also juxtaposes a dozen aspects of religion and football to show how they can be seen as intertwined, including "the kick off (motivation)" and "the best moves (suggestions for communities)."</p>
              <p>In the same vein the church calls for a spirit of fair play at the World Cup as for society as a whole while suggesting that international football "speaks to us about the lives of peoples."</p>
              <p>And adding to the religious spirit of the game Chilean clergy have highlighted two special World Cup-themed prayers, one based on an idea drawn up by their South African counterparts calling on God to grant that "fairness, justice and peace prevail amongst players and participants".</p>
              <p>The other, composed by Chilean bishops, asks God "always to grant fair play in football and life as a whole so that we may, with His grace, reach the eternal goal" not, of necessarily winning the World Cup - which Chile have never managed - but of of "eternal life in Him."</p>
              <p>"It's a good initiative," said Isaldo Bettin, of the parish of Our Lady of Pompeya, in Santiago.</p>
              <p>Father Bettin, being Brazilian, is needless to say a big fan of the game himself - though he perhaps tactfully avoided mention of whether his personal prayers were with Chile or his homeland.</p>
              <p>Father Bettin did, however, say that "we decided last year to leave the whole World Cup month free of church events" so that the people "can watch it without problems."</p>
