              <p>I LOVE BACK TO THE FUTURE.. it'll be great if i can alter/prevent some mistakes in my life..  but without these mistakes, i wont be where i am today. Mistakes are my teacher in life. but anyway, our lives are intertwined, if anyone i'm close to, went back to the past and change something, wont it affect my present life too? Time's a subjective space, very hard to define the exact location, time, date and space that you want to go back to. Our technology must be really sophisticated and accurate to have the ability to transport us back. Maybe 300 years later?</p>
              <p>In the near future, however, man will be able to teleport themselves from place to place. I watched a documentary somwhere about teleporting and in recent years, physicists has successfully teleport atoms.. i think teleporting are more useful than travelling back to the past.. ^^</p>

              <p>TELEPORTING is another form of time transport.it shifts time..like a deck of cards....u get the entire card and take it out n place it in a certain place in a deck of cards.</p>
              <p>would u shift the card by cutting it into its atomic state???n piecing it together later on????</p>
              <p>i think its all done whole n not piecing stuff atom by atom.</p>

              <p>Maybe this will help..</p>
              <p>The actual teleportation is a big scanner that people go in and every one of their <span id="IL_AD8" class="IL_AD">atoms</span> is scanned, type (H², C, O², O³), and their exact position. A modern 
                  computer sends the info to the destiny computer and it makes <span id="IL_AD7" class="IL_AD">a person</span> from a <span id="IL_AD5" class="IL_AD">barrel</span> of oil by changing its atoms form and position. <br>Scientists can only teleport a few atoms
                   these days, and anyway, there would be a problem. The person that goes 
                  into the scanner has to be scanned and disintegrated very quickly, 
                  otherwise the person would die in the middle of the process. And even if
                   it is quick, after the disintegration, the person is dead, and another 
                  person exactly like the one that died appears in the destiny with the 
                  exact same memories, but it still wouldn’t be the same person, she 
                  wouldn’t be able to tell if it’s her or not.</p>

              <div style="overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;">Yeah, i agree the idea of travelling back to the past/future is too far-fetched. Teleportation will only be possible in 300 years. if that's the case, travelling back to the past may be possible in about 500 years time? but i'm worried that the earth will be void of living things by then.. what with the global warming and unpredictable climate change..<br></div>

              <p>Because <a rel="nofollow" href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/astronaut.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #005288;">astronauts</span></span></a> like the ones on the International <a rel="nofollow" href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/space-station.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #005288;">Space Station</span></span></a> (ISS) are moving so quickly, they're also aging a bit more slowly than the rest of us. Due to a principle of physics known as <strong>time</strong> <strong>dilation</strong>, after a six-month stint on the ISS, returning astronauts are just a tiny bit younger than the rest of us. But before you book a ticket that'll take you literally out of this world, understand this isn't exactly a fountain of youth we're talking about. Your six-month effort at age reduction will only garner you about 0.007 seconds of extra life, according to the calculations of one ISS astronaut [source: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://howstuffworks.com/framed.htm?parent=humans-age-in-space.htm&amp;amp;url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/crew/exp7/luletters/lu_letter13.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #005288;">Lu</span></span></a>].</p>
              <p>But that's not really the issue we're talking about when we discuss how humans age in space. Let's start with a rundown of how the aging process typically proceeds on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/earth.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #005288;">Earth</span></span></a>. Until scientists muster up a way to make us all immortal, most of us will go through the process of aging. This typically involves metamorphoses like bones becoming brittle, blood vessels hardening, muscles wasting away, joints stiffening up, bowels turning irritable, bladders becoming unpredictable, teeth decaying, vision growing dim, skin wrinkling up, and so on.</p>
              <p>While for most people, it takes decades to really start to feel the effects of the aging process, humans stationed in space experience some of them in fast-forward. They're often reversible once an astronaut returns home, although sometimes a few of the changes can be permanent.</p>

              <p>A lack of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/question232.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #005288;">gravity</span></span></a> is the main cause for these intense alterations. Gravity is one of the most important forces at work on Earth, and it plays an immense role in the majority of our bodily systems. Take the muscles, for example. Older peoples' muscles tend to shrink and atrophy as they age and become less mobile. Astronauts' muscles react in a similar way because they are barely used. That's why astronauts in space for extended periods of time use special exercise machines to help mitigate this effect.</p>
              <p>A similar process takes place in the bones. After a certain age, people on Earth start to lose mass in their bones, typically at a rate of about 1-to-2 percent a year. But in space, those people lose bone mass at a greatly accelerated rate: as much as 1-to-2 percent a month. Because the astronauts' skeletal systems don't need to support their weight, the bones begin to decrease production of new bone material and increase the amount of old bone absorption. Luckily, their skeletal systems usually return to normal once they've spent some time back on terra firma [source: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://howstuffworks.com/framed.htm?parent=humans-age-in-space.htm&amp;amp;url=http://spaceresearch.nasa.gov/research_projects/shaken.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #005288;">NASA</span></span></a>].</p>
              <p>Even though they're saving 0.007 seconds, astronauts still experience some of the symptoms of a drawn-out aging process. Researchers are working to figure out the mechanics of why these changes occur, as well as what can be done to prevent them. This information could not only to help make spaceflight easier on the human body, but to help improve life on Earth as well.</p>
