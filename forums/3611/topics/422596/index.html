Like how in the movie, Marty McFly goes back to the past and intervenes with his parents fate and cause a big difference in the future.

              <p>According to Fringe (my favourite TV show), there is an episode on traveling back time :-D I believe it's achievable, but not in the near 200 years. Our technology can be improved :-D</p>
              <p>Anyway, other than travelling back time, we can actually also travel to the parallel universal. :) If you're a science guy like me, do read up on parallel universe k?</p>

              <p>Believe it or not, those who are spiritually advanced can already access the past and the future. There are things in this world which are much more advance than our modern science. But our world is not yet ready for them, so they remain very low profile. Science, in fact, is too slow because they are dealing mainly only on the physical demension, even at the metaphysical demension, it is still not that advance. The spiritual demension is many light years more advance. But there are just too many hoax stories to know which were the true genuine stories of the spiritual demension.</p>
              <p>Those who have access to the spiritual demension are very pure and they normally don't use that power for personal gain. If they do, those power will be taken away from them.   </p>
              <p>Someone who have such powers had already came and left this world just few years ago. Not many people have the chance to know him as he remained very low profile.</p>
              <p>Years ago, one communist leader was rescued by something very spiritual when he was captured by some bad guys. The elite troop could not trace where he was kidnapped, but one day, out of no where, he returned to society unharmed. Something unusual happened during the crucial hours when that leader's life was endangered, and he was rescued by something or someone very powerful. Till this day, this good communist leader, who has since stepped down, is still alive. </p>

              <p>There is nothing we have on Earth that can even approach 1/10th the speed of light. Also, the speed of light unachievable for particles with mass. (You and I are particles with mass.)</p>
              <p>Formula for mass particles that travel close to speed of light. </p>
              <p>m = m_0/sqrt(1-(v^2/c^2)), v is your velocity, c is speed of light. m_0 is initial mass. If you just try it out, as your velocity increases, your mass increases to infinity. Hence for a massive particle travelling at the speed of light, the kinetic energy would also be infinity, which is impossible. Also, going back into time means you need MORE than infinite energy, which is just nonsensical. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are of course hypothetical particles that can possibly travelling back in time. Like tachyons, where the supposed rest mass is an imaginary number (meaning something x sqrt(-1), not pulled out from thin air. ). However, look also at word "hypothetical". </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is also hypothetical physics for an Alcubierre drive (doing on principles similar to what the warpdrive can do on Star Trek) which, due making the space around the "vehicle" move instead of the vehicle and hence locally does not travel towards light speed. However, (if I'm not mistaken, it's rather hypothetical) while in external space it may seem that the time doesn't warp in the same way as normal relativistic time dilation does. Which just means you won't go back in time. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, just for travelling through time alone, there are also the theoretical idea of wormholes, tunnels through spacetime. But then you have to find one, hold it up, keep it stable, and know what is on the other side. Which also supposedly requires an infinite amount of energy. </p>

              time dont exist physically.
              
              its just something people use to measure things like speed la, duration la etc.

              <p>suppose we stop water being splashed on us by putting a pail in the direction as it goes...the water will ripple back n splashes will appear meaning water or time has been lost.suppose we used a method to collect the water or time which would be easiest if u could centrifyuge it or freeze time or water in space reducing the elements.....thats counterproductive to acquiring that target.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>come to think of it...its quite possible if u could freeze time and reduce the elements and reducing it backwards of somesort.</p>

              <p>to stop time many elements must be eliminated .planet earth with its rotation might not be good for stopping time.</p>
              <p>Let us imagine that twins, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ann</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Betty</span>, are both astronauts. Ann travels to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Alpha Centauri</span>, the nearest star to the Sun, and comes back. Ann’s speed during her trip to Alpha Centauri is 90% of the speed of light. Betty stays at home on Earth while Ann visits Alpha Centauri. When Ann comes back in 9.8 years, she has got only 4.3 years older. Due to time dilation time goes slower in Ann’s space craft than on Earth. Ann has got 5.5 years younger. This is peculiar, but not a paradox.</p>
              <p>In her space craft, Ann can see Betty getting further and then closer. If only the relative speed is taken into account, time dilation should work also other way round, and Ann should notice that Betty is younger. Anyhow, the situation with the twins is not symmetric. Betty stayed all the time in same inertial frame of reference, while Ann switched from one inertial frame of reference to another when she left, turned around and landed back on Earth. Because of this Betty is older than Ann.</p>

              <p>Because <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/astronaut.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #005288;">astronauts</span></span></a> like the ones on the International <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/space-station.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #005288;">Space Station</span></span></a> (ISS) are moving so quickly, they're also aging a bit more slowly than the rest of us. Due to a principle of physics known as <strong>time</strong> <strong>dilation</strong>, after a six-month stint on the ISS, returning astronauts are just a tiny bit younger than the rest of us. But before you book a ticket that'll take you literally out of this world, understand this isn't exactly a fountain of youth we're talking about. Your six-month effort at age reduction will only garner you about 0.007 seconds of extra life, according to the calculations of one ISS astronaut [source: <a href="http://howstuffworks.com/framed.htm?parent=humans-age-in-space.htm&amp;url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/crew/exp7/luletters/lu_letter13.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #005288;">Lu</span></span></a>].</p>
              <p>But that's not really the issue we're talking about when we discuss how humans age in space. Let's start with a rundown of how the aging process typically proceeds on <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/earth.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #005288;">Earth</span></span></a>. Until scientists muster up a way to make us all immortal, most of us will go through the process of aging. This typically involves metamorphoses like bones becoming brittle, blood vessels hardening, muscles wasting away, joints stiffening up, bowels turning irritable, bladders becoming unpredictable, teeth decaying, vision growing dim, skin wrinkling up, and so on.</p>
              <p>While for most people, it takes decades to really start to feel the effects of the aging process, humans stationed in space experience some of them in fast-forward. They're often reversible once an astronaut returns home, although sometimes a few of the changes can be permanent.</p>

              <p>A lack of <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/question232.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #005288;">gravity</span></span></a> is the main cause for these intense alterations. Gravity is one of the most important forces at work on Earth, and it plays an immense role in the majority of our bodily systems. Take the muscles, for example. Older peoples' muscles tend to shrink and atrophy as they age and become less mobile. Astronauts' muscles react in a similar way because they are barely used. That's why astronauts in space for extended periods of time use special exercise machines to help mitigate this effect.</p>
              <p>A similar process takes place in the bones. After a certain age, people on Earth start to lose mass in their bones, typically at a rate of about 1-to-2 percent a year. But in space, those people lose bone mass at a greatly accelerated rate: as much as 1-to-2 percent a month. Because the astronauts' skeletal systems don't need to support their weight, the bones begin to decrease production of new bone material and increase the amount of old bone absorption. Luckily, their skeletal systems usually return to normal once they've spent some time back on terra firma [source: <a href="http://howstuffworks.com/framed.htm?parent=humans-age-in-space.htm&amp;url=http://spaceresearch.nasa.gov/research_projects/shaken.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #005288;">NASA</span></span></a>].</p>
              <p>Even though they're saving 0.007 seconds, astronauts still experience some of the symptoms of a drawn-out aging process. Researchers are working to figure out the mechanics of why these changes occur, as well as what can be done to prevent them. This information could not only to help make spaceflight easier on the human body, but to help improve life on Earth as well.</p>
