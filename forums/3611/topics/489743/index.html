              <p class="first">SYRACUSE, N.Y. — Plums, peaches, nectarines and 
              cherries all grow on just one of Sam Van Aken's fruit trees. The trees 
              blossom in a riot of red, white and pink each spring.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1440397607465_589">The
               artist calls his creations the Tree of 40 Fruit. And the tree at 
              Syracuse University, and others like it, really does bear 40 or more 
              varieties of stone fruit, thanks to carefully planned grafts.</p>
              <p>The 
              hybrid trees provide both juicy fruit and food for thought about 
              preserving agricultural heritage. But most of all, Van Aken wants to 
              provoke a response.</p>
              <p>"When somebody happens upon it and they see it
               blossom in these different colors and they see it growing all these 
              different fruit ... there's this rethinking, there's this sort of moment
               that sort of interrupts the everyday," said Van Aken, who teaches art 
              at the university.</p>
              <p><img src="https://s1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/I4gAycXpBVCbzYgCu39MZA--/Zmk9ZmlsbDtweW9mZj0wO3c9NjQwO2g9MzYwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.associatedpressfree.com/3ee2d049658e47bb04858877b8e7a9a8" alt="" width="640" height="360"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Van Aken's first 40-fruit tree has been located
               for the past four years on the edge of a campus green. On a recent 
              broiling summer day, Van Aken plucked a few yellow plums the size of 
              golf balls and ducked under a low branch to give a trunk-to-leaf tour. 
              Starting with a plum root stock, he has over the years grafted on a 
              cornucopia of fruit.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1440397607465_596">"Right here is a nectarine. It 
              comes out on a plum base, but it continues to grow up here, until you 
              have peaches on the end," he said. "There's a couple of apricots that 
              have been grafted on, and this out on the end is a red-leaf plum 
              variety."</p>
              <p>The tree project is an outgrowth of Van Aken's work as a
               sculptor — one used to working with nontraditional materials. Early on,
               he considered arranging different trees that blossomed at different 
              times before realizing he could "collapse the entire orchard on to one 
              tree." He decided to work with stone fruit — that is, fruit with pits.</p>
              <p>"It actually started with a Tree of 100 Fruit," he said with a laugh. "I was sort of ambitious."</p>
              <p>He
               eventually settled on 40, a number rich with biblical allusions, such 
              as the 40 days and 40 nights of rain when Noah built an ark and the 
              amount of time Jesus fasted. Van Aken was inspired to include 
              harder-to-find fruits after reading a century-old book, "The Plums of 
              New York," that listed hundreds upon hundreds of varieties. The 
              abundance was strikingly different from the few types of purple plums 
              found in modern supermarkets.</p>
              <p><img src="http://mediaassets.gosanangelo.com/photo/2015/08/19/Tree%20of%2040%20Fruit_Robe%20_OP_3_CP__1440020394856_22939888_ver1.0_640_480.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="480"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1440397607465_605">He
               stocked the campus nursery where he works with antique and heirloom 
              varieties, including some from a now-defunct research orchard. Over 
              time, he has collected more than 40 varieties of plums, peaches, 
              nectarines, apricots, cherries and almonds that he can graft to his 
              trees.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1440397607465_665">The trees can turn heads in the 
              spring, when the multicolored blossoms signal something unusual. But 
              people who walked by the Syracuse University tree on a recent day barely
               looked up from their phones to notice the subtle differences in fruit 
              from branch to branch. University employee Karen Davis said she had 
              heard of Van Aken's tree, but walked by it at least twice a day without 
              realizing it.</p>
              <p>"I heard about the tree but I didn't know it was right here," said Davis, who called it "fantastic."</p>
              <p>Van
               Aken said there are 16 trees sited around the nation, mostly in the 
              Northeast. More are being grown and grafted in the nursery, including 
              eight that will be planted in downtown Syracuse next year.</p>
              <p>Several
               of the trees have been donated. The cost of the others depends on his 
              travel expenses. Each tree is planted with 20 varieties grafted to it. 
              He returns twice a year for three years after each planting to graft the
               rest of the varieties.</p>
              <p>The trees keep him busy April through 
              September, but he likes the fact that this is a unique type of sculpture
               that keeps on evolving.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1440397607465_800">"Every
               year it's something different. It appears different. It's radically 
              different than it was six months previous," he said. "And that part has 
              been the most rewarding part."</p>
