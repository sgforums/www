              <p><strong>Jakarta, Nov 29:</strong> A 22-year-old student  Charmian Chen, who also works as a model, was visiting the Sacred Monkey Forest Ubud in bali last month, when two monkey  began pulling down her dress, The Daily Mail reported. <br><br>Charmian Chen from Taiwan was on holiday on the tropical Indonesian island feeding long-tailed macaques when she was singled out.<br><br>The two macaques apparently spotted a piece of corn that had fallen down  Chen's top and decided they wanted it back.<br><br><img src="http://www.indiatvnews.com/upload/news/NEWEDITOR/Image/entertainmentmasala/Nov2011/Monkey.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="882"></p>
              <p>Despite her valiant effors to fend it off, one monkey managed to pull down her top leaving the red-faced model to cover herself as best she could, with her hands.<br><br>But what should have been an amusing holiday wardrobe malfunction has ended up catapulting  Chen to internet superstardom.<br><br>Pictures of the incident have made headline news in her native Taiwan, with TV stations asking her to appear and talk about it.<br><br>The images have also spread around the globe, appearing on blog sites and forums in the U.S. and Britain.<br><br><img src="http://www.indiatvnews.com/upload/news/NEWEDITOR/Image/entertainmentmasala/Nov2011/Monkey-1.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="641"></p>
              <p>She said: 'I was on holiday and at first the pictures were just funny, but when I got back to Taiwan I had all these people trying to add me as friends on Facebook.<br><br>'I thought "that's a bit strange", and then one of them said they'd seen the pictures and I was really surprised, the next thing I knew I had TV stations ringing me.<br><br>'I was on vacation then in Bali so I didn't mind it, but back in Taiwan I was still studying so I didn't want to become famous just for my boobs.<br><br>'But actually it has been fun, people do come up to me and say "you're the monkey girl" and it does make me laugh.'<br><br><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01415/BoobBoon_01_1415098a.jpg" alt="" width="682" height="450"></p>
              <p>Chen said the macaques, as well as being hungry, were also attracted to bikinis worn by many visitors.<br><br>She added: 'I think when they took my top down it was because of the corn but the park staff warn visitors that bright bikinis worn under dresses do attract the monkeys.<br><br>'I think it's the bright colours which they think might be fruit, well I don't know about that but it was very strange at the time.'</p>
