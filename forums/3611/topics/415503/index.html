              <h1>Men redundant? Now we don't need women either</h1>
              <p id="stand-first" class="stand-first-alone">Scientists have developed an artificial womb that allows embryos to grow outside the body</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div id="content">
              <ul class="article-attributes">
              <div id="article-wrapper">Doctors are developing artificial wombs in which embryos can grow 
              outside a woman's body. The work has been hailed as a breakthrough in 
              treating the childless.
              <p>Scientists have created prototypes made out 
              of cells extracted from women's bodies. Embryos successfully attached 
              themselves to the walls of these laboratory wombs and began to grow. 
              However, experiments had to be terminated after a few days to comply 
              with in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) regulations.</p>
              <p>'We hope to 
              create complete artificial wombs using these techniques in a few years,'
               said Dr Hung-Ching Liu of Cornell University's Centre for Reproductive 
              Medicine and Infertility. 'Women with damaged uteruses and wombs will be
               able to have babies for the first time.'</p>
              <p>The pace of progress 
              in the field has startled experts. Artificial wombs could end many 
              women's childbirth problems - but they also raise major ethical 
              headaches which will be debated at a major international conference 
              titled 'The End of Natural Motherhood?' in Oklahoma next week.</p>
              <p>'There
               are going to be real problems,' said organiser Dr Scott Gelfand, of 
              Oklahoma State University. 'Some feminists even say artificial wombs 
              mean men could eliminate women from the planet and still perpetuate our 
              species. That's a bit alarmist. Nevertheless, this subject clearly 
              raises strong feelings.'</p>
              <p>Liu's work involves removing cells from
               the endometrium, the lining of the womb. 'We have learnt how to grow 
              these cells in the laboratory using hormones and growth factors,' she 
              said.</p>
              <p>After this Liu and her colleagues grew layers of these 
              cells on scaffolds of biodegradable material which had been modelled 
              into shapes mirroring the interior of the uterus. The cells grew into 
              tissue and the scaffold dissolved. Then nutrients and hormones such as 
              oestrogen were added to the tissue.</p>
              <p>'Finally, we took embryos 
              left over from IVF programmes and put these into our laboratory 
              engineered tissue. The embryos attached themselves to the walls of our 
              prototype wombs and began to settle there.'</p>
              <p>The experiments were
               halted after six days. However, Liu now plans to continue with this 
              research and allow embryos to grow in the artificial wombs for 14 days, 
              the maximum permitted by IVF legislation. 'We will then see if the 
              embryos put down roots and veins into our artificial wombs' walls, and 
              see if their cells differentiate into primitive organs and develop a 
              primitive placenta.'</p>
              <p>The immediate aim of this work is to help 
              women whose damaged wombs prevent them from conceiving. An artificial 
              womb would be made from their own endometrium cells, an embryo placed 
              inside it, and allowed to settle and grow before the whole package is 
              placed back in her body.</p>
              <p>'The new womb would be made of the woman's own cells. so there would be no danger of organ rejection,' Liu added.</p>
              <p>However,
               her research is currently limited by IVF legislation. 'The next stage 
              will involve experiments with mice or dogs. If that works, we shall ask 
              to take our work beyond the 14-day limit now imposed on such research.'</p>
              <p>A different approach has been taken by Yoshinori Kuwabara at 
              Juntendo University in Tokyo. His team has removed foetuses from goats 
              and placed them in clear plastic tanks filled with amniotic fluid 
              stabilised at body temperature. In this way, Kuwabara has kept goat 
              foetuses alive and growing for up to 10 days by connecting their 
              umbilical cords to machines that pump in nutrients and dispose of waste.</p>
              <p>While Liu's work is aimed at helping those having difficulty 
              conceiving, Kuwabara's is designed to help women who suffer miscarriages
               or very premature births. In this way Liu is extending the time an 
              embryo can exist in a laboratory before being placed in a woman's body; 
              Kuwabara is trying to give a foetus a safe home if expelled too early 
              from its natural womb.</p>
              <p>Crucially, both believe artificial wombs capable of sustaining a child for nine months will become reality in a few years.</p>
              <p>'Essentially
               research is moving towards the same goal but from opposite directions,'
               UK fertility expert Dr Simon Fishel, of Park Hospital, Nottingham, 
              said. 'Getting them to meet in the middle will not be easy, however. 
              There are so many critical stages of pregnancy, and so many factors to 
              get right. Nevertheless, this work is very exciting.'</p>
              <p>It also 
              has serious ethical implications, as Gelfand pointed out. 'For a start, 
              there is the issue of abortion. A woman is usually allowed to have one 
              on the grounds she wants to get rid of something alien inside her own 
              body.</p>
              <p>'At present, this means killing the foetus. But if 
              artificial wombs are developed, the foetus could be placed in one, and 
              the woman told she has to look after it once it has developed into a 
              child.'</p>
              <p>In addition, if combined with cloning technology, 
              artificial wombs raise the prospect that gay couples could give 'birth' 
              to their own children. 'This would no doubt horrify right-wingers, while
               the implications for abortion law might well please them,' he added.</p>
              <p>Gelfand
               also warned that artificial wombs could have unexpected consequences 
              for working women and health insurance. 'They would mean that women 
              would no longer need maternity leave - which employers could become 
              increasingly reluctant to give.</p>
              <p>'It may also turn out that 
              artificial wombs provide safer environments than natural wombs which can
               be invaded by drugs and alcohol from a mother's body. Health insurance 
              companies could actually insist that women opt for the artificial way.</p>
              <p>'Certainly, this is going to raise a lot of tricky problems.'</p>
