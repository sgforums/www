              <p>In a dense and dusty neighborhood in the southern Pakistani city of 
              Karachi, eight young girls lined up against a cement wall, touching 
              their hands to their faces in prayer before boxing practice began.</p>
              <p>For
               the past six months, these athletes-in-the-making have been training at
               the Pak Shaheen Boxing Club. During the week, a dozen girls, ages 8 to 
              17, go to the club after school to practice their jabs, hooks and upper 
              cuts for hours in the hope of one day bringing a medal home to Pakistan.</p>
              <p>“I have been training since I was a child,” said Urooj Qambrani, 15. 
              “[If Allah wishes it], I will become an international boxer. . . . I 
              will make Pakistan’s name famous.”</p>
              <p>Pakistani women have been 
              training as boxers in small numbers and competed in the South Asian 
              Games last year, said Younis Qambrani, the coach who founded the club in
               1992.</p>
              <p>The growth of the sport for both men and women in Pakistan
               has been held back by a lack of equipment and adequate facilities, but 
              the situation is slowly improving, he said.</p>
              <p>In Pakistan, a conservative Muslim society, women and girls face 
              additional obstacles — both from Taliban threats for going to school and
               also violence from family members.</p>
              <p>In October, the Sindh Boxing 
              Association organized a camp for female boxers in Karachi, the first 
              time that a government-supported event for women in the sport was held 
              in the country, according to media reports.</p>
              <p>Some of the girls in 
              Qambrani’s family, who had taken up practicing at home, participated in 
              the camp and came to Qambrani afterward to ask why they couldn’t train 
              at his club as well.</p>
              <p>“A number of girls were keen on training, but due to social pressures, I had been avoiding the issue,” Qambrani said.</p>
              <p>“Last year a girl came to me, asking why girls couldn’t train. I was 
              moved when she said, ‘No one teaches us how to defend ourselves,’â€Š” he 
              said.</p>
              <p>Since then, some of the girls have begun to participate in 
              tournaments, at home in the ring in white track suits, head scarves and 
              boxing gloves.</p>
              <p>For Anum Qambrani, the coach’s 17-year-old 
              daughter, getting the chance to train formally in the club was perhaps 
              following her destiny.</p>
              <p>“My two uncles are international boxers, and my father is a coach,” she said. “Boxing is in our blood.”</p>
