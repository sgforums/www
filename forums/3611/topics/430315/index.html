              <h1 class="singlePageTitle">Ugandan police use water cannon to spray protesters with PINK dye</h1>
              <p><span>Colourful protests are usually borne out via creative placards or cheeky chants – not by demonstrators covered in pink liquid sprayed on them by police.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>That is how hardline Ugandan authorities deal with protesters however. Yesterday hundreds of anti-government marchers were splashed with the gaudy hue by special water cannons.</span></p>
              <p><span>The scenes of men and women being showered with water mixed with pink dye in capital Kampala came as month-long protests over soaring prices and a disputed election turned ugly.</span></p>
              <p><span><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/05/11/article-0-0BFD682D00000578-641_634x416.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="416"></span></p>
              <p><span>Splash of anger: Police spray Ugandan protesters with coloured water during demonstrations in the capital Kampala </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>On Monday, at least nine unarmed people are believed to have been killed – including three shot in the back as they fled.</span></p>
              <p><span>The tactic of spraying paint at protesters fairly common in Uganda and elsewhere in the continent.</span></p>
              <p><span>It was used during the Apartheid era in South Africa, most famously in the 1989 Purple Rain Protest in Cape Town.</span></p>
              <p><span>Spraying protesters a distinctive colour is carried out by such regimes because difficult for people to escape the police’s clutches while out of the demonstration zone.</span></p>
              <p><span>Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni’s crackdown on protesters has become increasingly desperate in recent days.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Yesterday he said would change the law to deny bail to people accused of riots and economic sabotage.</span></p>
              <p><span><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/05/11/article-0-0BFE1FB400000578-679_634x424.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="424"></span></p>
              <p><span>Overcome with emulsion: Spraying tactics are the latest desperate tactic of disputed President Yoweri Museveni </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>The east African country’s capital five other towns have been rocked by violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces during protests against soaring prices of food and fuel.</span></p>
              <p><span>Mr Museveni, in power for 25 years, accused the opposition of trying to spread chaos to avenge their defeat in February’s disputed presidential elections which he won with a 68 per cent majority.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘People think it’s a game playing with the economy of Uganda, scaring away people who come to do business and invest,’ he said.</span></p>
              <p><span>The violence has threatened to overshadow his $1.3million inauguration ceremony to launch Mr Museveni’s fourth term on Thursday.</span></p>
