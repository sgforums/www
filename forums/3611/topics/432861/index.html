              <p><strong>JAKARTA</strong> - Many efforts can be made to save the earth from global warming by doing a certain activity as a Canadian woman making a tour by roller skating from Merak, Banten,to Kuta, Bali.</p>
              <p>Sacha Stevenson, in Canada 29 years ago, said she wanted to do the action to inspire people to reduce carbon emissions from motor vehicles from the atmosphere.</p>
              <p>"I do this because I care for the earth, your earth, our earth. I am not rich and have no money for creating such program. I only have my body to care and preserve planet," Sacha said firmly and clearly.</p>
              <p>Judging from her way of speaking, she looked very optimistic with the action that she was called Bule on Blades. Bule was an informal call for white people, foreigners in general, staying in Indonesia. And since she had been living in Jakarta for the last ten years, she felt as part of this country.</p>
              <p>"I do love this country and this is my way to fight for a greener Indonesia. Moreover I hope other Indonesians would be inspired by me and follow my action in their own way," she said.</p>
              <p>She would be roller skating along 1.420 kilometers in Java Island with a challenging road condition on May 3, 20110 . She realized that she would face bumpy streets and rocky hills.</p>
              <p>"I’m going to skate every 50 kilometers and then take a rest to regain my strength to continue my journey. Furthermore, I know that I will not find smooth roads like toll roads. Therefore if my roller-blades can’t pas trough such smooth roads, I walk," she added. <strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Planting seedlings at halts</strong></p>
              <p>To support her action in making Indonesia greener, she would plant seedlings in every stop for taking a rest. It was aimed to symbolize her effort in going through the cities with her roller-blades. For that reason, she really appreciated people who wanted to donate seedlings to be planted.</p>
              <p>"The seedlings that I plant will be the witnesses of my history. Therefore, I will be very grateful that there are people who want to make a contribution by providing the seeds, because the seedlings would die if I carry them from my starting place," she said.</p>
              <p>She again firmed that her concern was not in creating new land as for planting trees, she just wanted to make a healthy lifestyle by inspiring people to follow her ways in reducing carbon emissions.</p>
              <p>"I just want people to make the earth greener in life. It’s not only skating, but they can have biking on walking rather than using motor vehicles. I want to inspire those in positions of power to do something good with the power you have," she explained.</p>
              <p>Sacha was not doing the project for takings. She now was looking for a sponsor to unleash the journey until she got around in Kuta, Bali, as the last destination. Nevertheless, if she would not have a until her departure on May 3, she would make use of her savings of about 1.732 US dollars.</p>
              <p>"I’m not begging for money. I wish there are people who support my action such as giving me to a place to stay overnight or the seedlings. Otherwise I will use my savings to make my journey which may take 30 to 40 days," she said.</p>
