              <p>Every year, would-be immigrants steal across the US-Mexican border -- 
              and over the years, thousands have died in the baking, snake-infested 
              desert on either side.</p>
              <p>A group of activists is now working to keep the desperate migrants alive.</p>
              <p>The
               so-called "Border Angels" hide bottles of water in the desert along the
               border, where temperatures can top 113 degrees Fahrenheit (45 degrees 
              Celsius).</p>
              <p>"Lots of them die of thirst while crossing," said 
              Enrique Morones, his arms full of water bottles near the fence in 
              California's Imperial Valley designed to stem the tide of migrants from 
              central America.</p>
              <p><img src="http://sdlrla.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Border-Angels-logo-sm.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="290"></p>
              <p>"The lack of water is the primary cause of death 
              for the 10,000 people who have died while illegally crossing these 
              desert regions," said Morones, a Mexican-American from San Diego who 
              founded Border Angels 20 years ago.</p>
              <p>Staff members leave the large 
              water bottles under shrubs on both sides of the border, from Sonora and 
              Baja California in Mexico to Arizona and California.</p>
              <p>"You have to put the bottles underneath foliage," says Nelly, a Peruvian who has worked for the group since June.</p>
              <p>That
               was when a genuine crisis erupted as a huge tide of migrants began 
              sweeping across the border, many of them unaccompanied minors, leaving 
              police and immigration centers struggling to cope.</p>
              <p>Since October, nearly 65,000 children have arrived, most of them fleeing poverty and violence in central America.</p>
              <p>- Unfriendly locals -</p>
              <p>Border
               guards patrol the frontier in vehicles, watching every movement, helped
               by hundreds of cameras, sensors and airborne drones invisible to the 
              naked eye.</p>
              <p>They know that migrants will take advantage of the slightest distraction to try to climb over the steel border fence.</p>
              <p>But the guards do not touch the water bottles, in part because US authorities have "no official position" on them, said Morones.</p>
              <p>A few bottles end up with holes in them, mostly due to coyotes, but also because of local residents.</p>
              <p>"Look at that bottle! Someone broke it!" Morones said. </p>
              <p>"It's difficult to understand why someone would do that. Water can save lives."</p>
              <p>For
               Juan Hernandez, another Mexican-American who works with pro-immigrant 
              groups, the Imperial Valley "does not distinguish itself by its 
              solidarity" with those coming across the border.</p>
              <p>The rural region 
              "is inhabited by white people looking for cheap labor," he added. And 
              those residents don't want people on their land once harvest season is 
              over.</p>
              <p>- Dying in the heat -</p>
              <p><img src="http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2003c/091903/photos/p14pha.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></p>
              <p>Activists regularly find corpses in the desert -- migrants who have succumbed to the heat, exhaustion or dehydration.</p>
              <p>More
               than 600 unidentified victims have been laid to rest in a cemetery near
               the small town of Holtville, at the very gates of the "American Dream" 
              they fought so hard to reach.</p>
              <p>It is known as "The cemetery of 
              those who will not be forgotten." On their modest graves, crosses bear 
              the message, "You are not alone."</p>
              <p>Morones claims that, faced with 
              the recent surge in undocumented migrants across the border, US 
              authorities have decided to incinerate the remains and "sprinkle the 
              ashes in the sea off the coast of San Diego."</p>
              <p>The number of 
              migrants making the trek has begun to drop in the last two months, as 
              Mexico and Central American countries have stepped up vigilance -- under
               immense US pressure.</p>
              <p>But "this flow will never stop," said Hernandez. </p>
              <p>"We have to change the way we do things to live more peacefully. We Mexicans, we are a majority in the border region," he said.</p>
              <p>US
               President Barack Obama, whose immigration reform bill is blocked in 
              Congress, has postponed any executive action until after November 
              mid-term elections, seeking to shield lawmakers crucial to his 
              Democratic party's hopes of maintaining control of the Senate.</p>
