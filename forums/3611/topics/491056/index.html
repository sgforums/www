              <p>Amsterdam is the most bicycle friendly city
               in the world, with 40% to 60% of all trips within the city made on 
              bikes. Some estimate that there are between 880,000 to a million 
              bicycles in the city, which is more than the city’s permanent 
              population, by as much as 20%. Amsterdam also has lots of canals —165, 
              with a combined length of 100 kilometers. Unavoidably, some of the 
              bicycles end up getting wet. Did I say some? How about 15,000? That’s 
              how many bicycles are retrieved from Amsterdam’s canals every year. In 
              fact, fishing for bicycles is a full-time occupation for the city.</p>
              <p>Waternet,
               the agency responsible keeping the canals clean, employs a huge 
              hydraulic claw, to fish out bicycles from the canal bed. The claw is 
              connected to a crane that sits on the front of a barge. The company has 
              been bike fishing since the 1960s, and they do this every day.</p>

              <p>Nobody has a clear answer to why Amsterdam’s residents throw away so 
              many bikes into the canals, but this habit of throwing things into the 
              canals goes back a long way. In the old days, the canals used to be an 
              open sewer. There was no sewer system in Amsterdam, so the canals were 
              like an open toilet and trash-can for the people of Amsterdam.</p>
              <p>In
               1860, Amsterdam started to see the problem and began cleaning up the 
              canals. But many Amsterdammers still hasn't totally kicked the habit of 
              tossing things into the drink, especially when they are drunk. It’s 
              believed that most bicycles fished out from the canals are either stolen
               or victims of vandalism. Amsterdam Police estimate that between 50,000 
              and 80,000 bikes are stolen each year, yet very few report bike theft to
               the police because they think that the police won’t do anything about 
              it.</p>
              <p>Most of the bikes dredged up from the canals end up as scrap 
              metal. Though bikes aren’t the only thing that gets caught in the huge 
              metal claws. Occasionally workers would bring up other items, such as 
              fridges and even cars. Between 35 to 50 cars fall into the canals each 
              year. In most cases they are the result of an accident, but sometimes 
              vandalism comes into play. Amsterdam has a special diving team of the 
              Fire Brigade to fish out cars, when such an accident is reported.</p>
              <p>Bike fishing has become one of Amsterdam’s unique tourist attraction.</p>
