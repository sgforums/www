              <p>Whether it's the rising sea levels, desertification, torrential monsoons
               or melting glaciers, climatic change is rapidly altering the landscape 
              of our planet. Here are a few of the world’s most scenic places that

              <p>The largest barrier reef in the Northern 
              Hemisphere, the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System is also a UNSECO 
              world heritage site. The spectacular coastal lagoons, clear water and 
              the intriguing ‘Great Blue Hole’ make it a perfect adventure 
              destination. But in 2009, the UNESCO included it in the ‘danger list’ 
              feeling that there needs to be a stricter control on the abated 
              construction on the site to save it for future.</p>

              <p>Cerro Rico or the Rich Hill is one of the
               World Heritage sites. Located in Bolivia’s Potosi city, the 
              mountain was once an important source of silver for the Spanish Empire. 
              However, over 500 years of unabated mining has left the mountain porous 
              and highly unstable. In 2011, the famed peak of the mountain caved in, 
              which left a sinkhole 50 feet across with an uncharted depth. Once 
              called the ‘mountain that eats men', Cerro Rico is dying a slow death.</p>

               past 125 years, with its southern edge retreating nearly a mile in that
               timeframe. Experts believe the glacier is now shrinking at its fastest

              <h2>The Dead Sea</h2>
              <p>The ancient and salty Dead Sea is the 
              site of both history and healing. Yet in the last 40 years, the lake has
               shrunk by a third and sunk 25 metres. Experts believe it could 
              disappear in as little as 50 years, due to neighbouring countries 
              drawing water from the River Jordan</p>

              <h2>Venice, Italy</h2>
              <p>The Italian city, considered as one of 
              the most romantic cities in the world, is facing ruin. The city of 
              canals has long been sinking, but an uptick in the number of 
              increasingly severe floods each year could leave Venice uninhabitable by
               this century’s end.</p>

              <h2>Great Barrier Reef, Australia</h2>
              <p>The largest coral reef in the world, 
              which covers more than 344,400 square kilometre, has long been an 
              attraction Down Under. Yet increasing environmental challenges have been
               steadily eroding the structure for years now. From rising ocean 
              temperatures to an influx of pollution, experts estimate that about 60 
              per cent of the reef may be lost by 2030.</p>

              spared the fate met by many others in the Solomon Islands archipelago, 
              which "are being ravaged by rampant logging," according to Conservation 
              International amphibian expert Robin Moore</p>

              <h2>Atlantic Forest, South America</h2>
              <p>Shown abutting the Brazilian city of Belo
               Horizonte in 2004, the species-rich Atlantic Forest originally spanned 
              1.35 million square kilometres in Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina and 
              Uruguay. But due to an expansion of logging and agriculture, the forest 
              is now less than seven per cent its original size, and exists mainly as 
              isolated patches, some less than 24 hectares.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.s-msn.com/tenant/amp/entityid/BBdxBSR.img?h=373&amp;w=624&amp;m=6&amp;q=60&amp;o=f&amp;l=f" alt="" width="582" height="373"></p>
              <h2>Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, Africa</h2>
              <p>They've been around for at least 10,000 
              years, but Mount Kilimanjaro's glaciers have shrunk by 80 per cent in 
              roughly the past century, according to the UN. The combined impact of 
              global warming and changes in land use have likely contributed to 
              glacial decline. In 2009, scientists predicted that the glaciers will be
               gone completely by 2022</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.s-msn.com/tenant/amp/entityid/BBdxwSa.img?h=373&amp;w=624&amp;m=6&amp;q=60&amp;o=f&amp;l=f" alt="" width="497" height="373"></p>
              <h2>The Everglades, Florida, USA</h2>
              <p>The Everglades has had its share of 
              troubles, from invasive pythons and polluted waters to damaging 
              recreation practices. But the low-lying ecosystem of saw grass and 
              mangroves could be permanently altered if it's inundated with salt water
               due to the rise in sea level in the coming decades, according to the US
               National Park Service. Core samples, tide-gauge readings and satellite 
              measurements show that over the past century, the global mean sea level 
              has risen by four to eight inches, according to the US Global Change 
              Research Programme.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.s-msn.com/tenant/amp/entityid/BBdxkM2.img?h=373&amp;w=624&amp;m=6&amp;q=60&amp;o=f&amp;l=f" alt="" width="560" height="373"></p>
              <h2>Madagascar</h2>
              <p>As the fourth largest island in the 
              world, Madagascar is home to some of the richest tropical rainforests 
              and most diverse wildlife, like lemurs and mongoose. However, the dense 
              ecosystem has been continually destroyed by poaching, logging and 
              burning. If actions are not taken to save the island, it is expected 
              that its rainforests and unique inhabitants will vanish in 35 years.</p>

              <h2>Patagonian Ice Fields, Chile</h2>
              <p>As the largest ice fields in the world 
              after those on Antarctica and Greenland, the Patagonian ice fields in 
              Chile are feeling the effects of global warming and receding at a 
              shockingly fast speed. Scientists have found that up to 90 per cent of 
              the mountain glaciers are melting 100 times faster than at any other 
              time in the past three centuries. In just the last five years, dozens of
               glacier lakes have already virtually disappeared.</p>
