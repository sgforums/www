              <p>The smile that defies the Taliban: Afghan teenager whose mutilated face shocked the world unveils her new image</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">An Afghan teenager who was horribly mutilated by her husband under Taliban rule was all smiles as she unveiled her new prosthetic nose for the first time.</span></p>
              <p><span><span class="style131">Aisha</span>, 19, shocked the world when she appeared on the cover of Time Magazine to lift the veil on the plight of many women in Afghanistan.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Yesterday, she bravely faced the public wearing a prosthetic nose - one that gives her some idea of how she will look after having reconstructive surgery.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/10/12/article-1319804-0B952A16000005DC-450_306x423.jpg" alt="" width="306" height="423"></p>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/10/12/article-1319804-0B952C9F000005DC-161_306x423.jpg" alt="" width="306" height="423"></p>
              <p>Brave: Aisha, 19, pictured wearing a type of prosthetic nose often used by film actors. Her nose and ears were hacked off by brutal in-laws after she was promised in marriage aged 12<br></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">She went before the TV cameras to receive the Enduring Heart award at a benefit for the Grossman Burn Foundation - the Los Angeles-based organisation that paid for her surgery.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">She was given the award by California first lady Maria Shriver.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Arnold Schwarzenegger's wife told the audience: 'This is the first Enduring Heart award given to a woman whose heart endures and who shows us all what it means to have love and to be the enduring heart.'<br></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Aisha, whose surname has not been revealed, replied: 'Thank you so much.'</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">When Aisha was 12, her father promised her in marriage to a Taliban fighter to pay a debt. She was handed over to his family who abused her and forced her to sleep in the stable with the animals.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">When she attempted to flee, she was caught and her nose and ears were hacked off by her husband as punishment.<br></span></p>
              <p><br><br><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/10/12/article-1319804-0B952D3A000005DC-91_306x327.jpg" alt="" width="306" height="327"></p>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/10/12/article-1319804-0B952C7B000005DC-294_306x327.jpg" alt="" width="306" height="327"></p>
              <p><br>New beginning: Aisha has a prosthetic nose fitted using a special adhesive. She will eventually have reconstructive surgery<br></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'When they cut off my nose and ears, I passed out. In the middle of the night it felt like there was cold water in my nose. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I opened my eyes and I couldn't even see because of all the blood,' she told CNN reporter Atia Abawi<em></em>.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Left for dead in the mountains, she crawled to her grandfather's house and her father managed to get her to an American medical facility, where medics cared for her for ten weeks. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">They then transported Aisha to a secret shelter in Kabul and in August she was flown to the U.S. by the Grossman Burn Foundation to stay with a host family.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">This month, she had a prosthetic nose fitted at the non-profit humanitarian Grossman Burn Center at West Hills Hospital in California</span> <span style="font-size: x-small;">as part of her eight-month rehabilitation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Dr Peter H Grossman said they hoped to give Aisha a more 'permanent solution'. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">This could mean reconstructing her nose and ears using bone, tissue and cartilage from other parts of her body.</span><strong></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Dr Grossman's wife Rebecca, the chair of the Grossman Burn Foundation, said Aisha was just one of the thousands of women who are treated with appalling harshness.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">She said: 'Aisha is reminded of that enslavement every time she looks in the mirror. But there are still times she can laugh. And at that moment you see her teenage spirit escaping a body that has seen a lifetime of injustice.'</span></p>
              <p><br><br><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/10/12/article-1319804-0B952BE5000005DC-974_634x465.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="465"></p>
              <p>Recovering: Aisha has received counselling following her traumatic experiences<br></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The UN estimates that nearly 90 per cent of Afghanistan's women suffer from some sort of domestic abuse. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">However, the Taliban have released a statement rejecting this.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan rejects this fabrication by the Americans, who are publishing these lies to divert attention of the people from their clear and disgraceful defeat,' said a spokesman.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'In sacred Islamic law, cutting off human ears and noses whether the human is alive or dead is illegal and prohibited.'</span></p>
