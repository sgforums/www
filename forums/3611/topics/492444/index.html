              <h2>A Swedish police officer was sunbathing in her bikini when she and 
              another woman pulled a suspected thief to the ground and she arrested 
              him.</h2>
              <p>The event occurred in Stockholm, Sweden and the photo of Mikaela 
              Kellner in her bikini and her female friend pinning the man to the 
              ground has gone viral.</p>
              <p>She said she would do it again if she had to. Kellner said she did 
              not hesitate at all to make the arrest while she was in a bikini.</p>
              <p>Kellner added, “If I had been naked I would have intervened as well.”</p>
              <p>“My first intervention while wearing a bikini during my 11 years as a police officer,” she posted on Instagram</p>
              <p>As reported<a href="http://abc13.com/news/bikini-clad-cop-makes-arrest-while-sunbathing/1448304/"></a> by the AP, Kellner and three of her friends were sunbathing in a park 
              in the Swedish city when a homeless man approached them. He was selling 
              newspapers.</p>
              <p>One of Kellner’s friends noticed that her phone was missing after the man left, according to the <em>Aftonbladet</em>, a newspaper in Sweden.</p>
              <p>David Klinger posted on Kellner’s Facebook page about competing with 
              her in the 2015 World Police and Fire Games and said she is an “amazing 
              athlete. He said she came in first place in the “Toughest Competitor 
              Alive” event.</p>
              <p><img src="https://fbcdn-photos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpl1/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/13892082_1734872980104066_8146559671023119816_n.jpg?oh=a828f3953aa775df30889b452030edb5&amp;oe=581CEB4E&amp;__gda__=1478048491_aaa3ebf2d10fbbf9c3848e0d84063613" alt="" width="526" height="526"></p>
              <p>( Facebook) I had the pleasure and honor of sharing the field with Mikaela
               at the World Police and Fire Games last year and know her to be an 
              amazing athlete (she placed first in the Toughest Competitor Alive 
              event). Turns out she's an awesome police officer as well.  She was 
              hanging out at a park in Stockholm last week enjoying the day when a guy
               stole her friend's cell phone and tried to run off.  He didn't get far 
              before Mikaela ran him down and held him for the on duty police to deal 
              with.  She's gained superhero status now that someone has made a cartoon
               version of her as bikini cop.</p>
              <p>Mikaela has also appeared on “Ninja Warrior Sweden,”
               described as a show where “[t]he very best and most physically fit 
              people take on the world’s toughest obstacle course.” The show follows 
              “125 of Sweden’s most well-trained and versatile athletes as they take 
              on the Ninja Warrior course in search of glory and a half million 
              Swedish Crownes.”</p>
