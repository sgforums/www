              <p>You need a willing grandmother, a pair of shades and a bunch of grandchildren posing behind her like a thousand-armed Avalokitesvara.</p>
              <p>Not every grandma will be able to pull it off though, like Madam Lee Kim Noi, 81, did.</p>
              <p>This photo of the Singaporean grandmother and her grandchildren, uploaded onto Facebook by a family member on Jan 25, had, at press time, garnered 5,620 'Likes' and been shared more than 1,360 times, and has even travelled to a Facebook page from Taiwan and popular comedy site 9Gag.</p>
