              </p><div class="firstPar" style="color: #282828; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.7em; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.48em;">The owner of his local newspaper kiosk was amazed to receive a telephone call from Jorge Mario Bergoglio, who was archbishop of Buenos Aires until being elected pontiff last week.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar" style="color: #282828; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.7em; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.48em;">At first Daniel Del Regno thought it was a prank call, perhaps made by a friend trying to pull his leg.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar" style="color: #282828; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.7em; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.48em;">The Pope, calling from the Vatican just five days after his surprise election, had to insist that it was really him.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar" style="color: #282828; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.7em; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.48em;">"Seriously, it's Jorge Bergoglio, I'm calling you from Rome," he said during the call earlier this week.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar" style="color: #282828; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.7em; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.48em;">Francis, the first Pope from the Americas and the first Jesuit pontiff, asked Mr Del Regno to cancel the delivery of his daily newspaper as he would not be returning to Argentina any time soon.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="body" style="color: #282828; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.7em; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.48em;">"I was in shock, I broke down in tears and didn't know what to say," Mr Del Regno told La Nacion, an Argentinean daily. "He thanked me for delivering the paper all this time and sent best wishes to my family." The kiosk owner said that he had asked the then Cardinal Bergoglio, on the eve of his departure for Rome to take part in the secret conclave process that has elected Popes for centuries, how he rated his chances of being chosen as the successor to Benedict XVI.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.7em; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.48em;">"He answered me, 'That is too hot to touch. See you in 20 days, keep delivering the paper.' "And the rest is, well, history," he said.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.7em; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.48em;">The Argentine cardinal had so little expectation of being chosen Pope by his 114 fellow cardinals that he had booked a return ticket from Rome to Buenos Aires and was expecting to lead Easter services in the city.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.7em; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.48em;">"I told him to take care and that I would miss him," said Mr Del Regno. "I asked him if there would ever be the chance to see him here again. He said that for the time being that would be very difficult, but that he would always be with us." Mr Del Regno said that he or his father would deliver a newspaper each morning to the cardinal's modest apartment in Buenos Aires and that on Sundays he would drop by the kiosk to buy La Nacion.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.7em; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.48em;">Mr Del Regno's father, Luis, said the future pope was well known for his parsimonious ways. Every newspaper that was delivered to him had a rubber band around it to stop it flapping in the wind. "At the end of the month, he always brought them back to me. All 30 of them!" the kiosk owner said.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.7em; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.48em;">On Friday the Pope addressed foreign ambassadors and diplomats accredited to the Holy See, explaining that he had taken the name Francis in honour of St Francis of Assisi, who loved the poor.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.7em; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.48em;">He appealed for rich countries to do more to help the poor and marginalised. "How many poor people there still are in the world! And what great suffering they have to endure!" he said during his address, delivered in Italian.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.7em; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.48em;">He said the fact that he comes from South America but has Italian origins – his parents left the country in the 1920s - will help him build bridges in the world. He said he wanted to forge better dialogue with Islam.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.7em; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.48em;">"One of the titles of the Bishop of Rome is Pontiff, that is, a builder of bridges with God and between people. My wish is that the dialogue between us should help to build bridges connecting all people, in such a way that everyone can see in the other not an enemy, not a rival, but a brother or sister to be welcomed and embraced," he told the diplomats in the Vatican's frescoed Sala Regia or Regal Room.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.7em; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.48em;">Francis also repeated calls for greater protection of the environment, "which all too often, instead of using for the good, we exploit greedily, to one another's detriment."</p>
