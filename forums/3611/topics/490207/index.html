              <p>When former chef Adam Smith opened a small cafe in Britain's 
              post-industrial North two years ago, serving up dishes with food 
              destined for the scrap heap, he had big aspirations -- to fight global 
              food waste.</p>
              <p>"From day one I set out to feed the world and I intend to do that," 
              the Yorkshireman said ambitiously, as he charted the growth of his 
              ethical empire -- the Real Junk Food Project (RJFP).</p>
              <p>From its humble roots in a community centre in the deprived Armley 
              district of Leeds, northern England, the project now has around 120 
              affiliated cafes worldwide, including Australia, France, South Korea, 
              the United States and, most recently, Nigeria.</p>
              <p>"People are beginning to realise we are a serious organisation," said 
              Smith, having just returned from an awareness-raising event feeding MPs 
              at Britain's parliament with food saved from garbage bins.</p>
              <p>The simple concept involves collecting food that would otherwise have
               been thrown away -- usually because it is "out-of-date" and unsellable 
              under trading rules -- and turning it into perfectly edible meals.</p>
              <p>Since the project began in December 2013, almost 200 tonnes of food has been "intercepted", Smith said.</p>
              <p>Roughly one third of the food produced in the world for human 
              consumption every year -- approximately 1.3 billion tonnes -- gets lost 
              or wasted, according to the UN.</p>
              <p>By offering meals on a "pay-as-you-feel" basis RJFP cafes sidestep food 
              regulations since it is against the law in Britain to actually "sell" 
              food past its use-by date.  Smith's formulation is tantamount to a 
              voluntary donation, with the amount up to the customer, which keeps all 
              on the legal side of matters, he said.</p>
              <p>The team is discriminating. Not all food is accepted. "We make our 
              own judgement, by tasting and smelling, as to whether food is fit for 
              consumption."</p>
              <p>Smith is clear that his vision was not about feeding poor people, but
               for many communities it is a way of reaching those on low incomes or 
              none.</p>
              <p>Helped by around 90 volunteers, retiree Shena Cooper runs "Elsie's" 
              cafe in the town of Northampton, central England, as part of the RJFP 
              network.</p>
              <p>"We want to create a mixed society within the cafe," she said. "Some 
              people come in for coffee and cake and give a few pounds. But there are 
              people who cannot give anything."</p>
              <p>- Tasty dishes -</p>
              <p>Volunteers face the challenge of creating tasty dishes from whatever 
              food is available, but this is "part of the joy for them", said Cooper.</p>
              <p>At Elsie's "binner" event this month, a guest chef transformed 
              discarded local produce into a three-course feast of gourmet crostini 
              with pear salsa, sausage plait with polenta cake, and a chocolate fig 
              dessert.</p>
              <p>"You can actually have a conscience about eating cake," joked Heike Mapstone, a call centre worker, after the dinner.</p>
              <p>"I think it is a great idea. Why should we waste all this food?"</p>
              <p>Cooper knows her cafe is only "scraping the tip of the iceberg" but 
              hopes collective efforts will "expose the food system for what it is".</p>
              <p>"There is so much wrong with it," she said. "The fact that we can fly
               bananas half way around the world and then throw them into landfill is 
              ridiculous."</p>
              <p>Adam Buckingham feeds about 200 people a week at a church-based RJFP 
              cafe in Brighton, where food donations have included legs of cured 
              serrano ham and huge stockpiles of chocolate.</p>
              <p>"It shocks people that all this food would have gone in the bin," he 
              said, adding that a change in attitudes and legislation is needed.</p>
              <p>"Unfortunately we have got to a point where we think it is OK to throw away food and buy more. We're blinded by convenience."</p>
              <p>In north London, a pair of entrepreneurs have harnessed what they believe is a growing aversion to this mindset.</p>
              <p>Tessa Cook and her American business partner Saasha Celestial-One 
              launched a new app -- "Olio" -- to connect consumers with sources of 
              surplus food.</p>
              <p>The app allows donors to upload pictures of items that may be nearing
               their sell-by-date and users can browse for food and arrange a pick-up 
              via private messaging.</p>
              <p>"We did some market research and found that
               one-third of people were 'physically pained' throwing away food. To me 
              that was mind blowing," said Cook.</p>
              <p>So far the pair have signed up 15 "founding merchants" -- individuals
               and businesses willing to share produce. Although currently focused on 
              London, Cook hopes the app will eventually go global.</p>
              <p>"The more we looked into it the more we were overwhelmed by the sheer
               enormity of the food being wasted. It seems totally wasteful, 
              irresponsible and immoral," she said.</p>
