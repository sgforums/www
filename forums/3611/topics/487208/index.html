              <p>He steals food from the dog’s bowls, tries to sneak in the house to watch TV and loves cuddles from his owner,  Anna Burton.</p>
              <p>The
               19-year-old Harrogate College student adopted Keith as a little lamb 
              when he was born on the family’s Nidderdale farm earlier this year.</p>
              <p>She
               said: “We thought the mother was having twins and saw the other two 
              lambs, then a few hours later we found him hidden amongst the hay.</p>
              <p>“He was very, very small, he was so little couldn’t stand up so I made him a sling in a cardboard box to keep him on his feet.”</p>
              <p>Anna
               said it was not the first time the family had brought a lamb into the 
              house to take care of it, though none made themselves at home quite as 
              much as Keith.</p>
              <p>Anna said: “We’ve got six dogs, but he fit right in
               with them. They are actually still very protective of him even though 
              he is much bigger than them  now.</p>
              <p>“We’ve got collies and it must 
              be confusing for them because Keith just thinks he is one of them. The 
              other sheep don’t like him very much though.”</p>
              <p>After a few months 
              Keith grew too big to live in the family home and he moved into a barn 
              where he lives with his girlfriend Ruby and best pal, Stevie the blind 
              sheep.</p>
              <p>Anna grew up at Knoll Top Farm and is now considering working with animals in the future.</p>
              <p>She said: “I didn’t really think about it, but I have always looked after any of the poorly animals on the farm.”</p>
              <p>The family have decided  it is now time to look for a new home for Keith.</p>
              <p>Anna said: “He would love to live on a petting farm, he loves people and he would love to get all the attention.”</p>
