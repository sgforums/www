              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He may not be able to compete in the Kentucky Derby, but he is surely as popular as the winner.<br></span></p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">And with appearances on Oprah and across the U.S. it has certainly been an eventful first year for Einstein, the world's smallest stallion, as he approaches his birthday.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Standing just 20inches tall, the horse attracted huge media interest when he was born in April last year.</span></p>
              <p><br><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/03/25/article-1369859-0B55741300000578-157_634x549.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="549"></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Now his quest to find buddies and his life at home with owners Charlie Cantrell and Rachel Wagner in Gilmanton, New Hampshire, will be published in a new a book to celebrate his birthday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'This has been a remarkable year for us and for Einstein,' said Mr Cantrell, 44, who bought Einstein for their small farm along with his wife Rachel.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'We are both horse enthusiasts and we decided to get ourselves a miniature horse from the renowned breeder Judy Smith at a Miniature Horse Farm in New Hampshire.</span></p>
              <p><br><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/03/25/article-1369859-0B5469F200000578-14_634x562.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="562"></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Einstein is the smallest horse on record ever to survive and when the news got out to the media the level of interest was incredible.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'The average weight of a newborn miniature horse is 18lb. The average height at birth is 21 inches.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Einstein is all the remarkable because he shows no dwarf characteristics and is simply a very small miniature horse.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">His mother Finesse stands a relatively tall 32 inches and his dad Painted Feather measures 30 inches</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/03/25/article-1369859-0B546A0200000578-505_634x348.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="348"></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Guinness approached us straight after the original press that surrounded Einstein,' said Mr Cantrell.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'He can't be officially recognised as the smallest stallion until he is four, but we are both relatively sure that he has stopped growing.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">With the press surrounding him, it wasn't long before Einstein did make friends - of all shapes and sizes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He now spends his time mingling with his giant friend Playboy - a full sized stallion - and messing around with Charlie and Rachel's dog Lilly.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Playboy is owned by a young lady who lives next to our farm and Einstein sometimes meets him to have a head sniff and a simple hello,' explained Charlie<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'You see the adorable thing about Einstein is that he doesn't seem to be too aware of his height at all.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'He approaches Lilly and Playboy just like he was a fully grown stallion. He rears up and huffs and gallops around.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'However, due to his extraordinary size he can't mingle around with other horses because it would be dangerous and he might get trampled underfoot.</span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/03/25/article-1369859-0B5468E600000578-947_634x394.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="394"></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'So him and Lilly kiss and say hello, he knows a particularly friendly St Bernard at the farm he was born at and we have a couple of Nigerian Dwarf Goats that he spends time with here in New Hampshire.'<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Living peacefully in his own pen on his owners land, Einstein's first birthday is something that GP Rachel and Charlie can't wait to share.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'He loves children and they of course love him,' said Charlie.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'They get wide eyed because they have never seen a horse this size before and they want to smother him.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'However, he is so small, so hopefully the book will satisfy everyone's desire to see Einstein and his cute and unusual life.</span></p>
