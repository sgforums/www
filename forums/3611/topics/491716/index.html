              <p>There’s nothing more heart-warming than a love story, but when that love
               story involves animals – well, it’s enough to make even the coldest 
              heart melt! Animals lovers were really touched by a recent news story spotted in The Times about a long, laborious journey of love undertaken by a wild elephant in the depths of Africa.</p>
              <p><img src="https://noahsarkzoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/c17275ac-e60e-11e5_1074912c.jpg?w=507&amp;h=338" alt="" width="507" height="338"></p>
              <p>The bull elephant named Morgan has stunned the science community by 
              undertaking an epic journey from Kenya to Somalia in the scorching heat.
               He marched for more than 215km along the coast – traversing some of the
               most dangerous landscapes imaginable for these large beasts – before 
              entering Somalia nearly three weeks later.</p>
              <p>But it’s not only the length of the journey that is of significance; 
              this also marks the first time an elephant has been confirmed inside 
              Somalia for more than 20 years. This gives hope to the wildlife 
              community that if security measures are improved, elephants could be 
              introduced back into the country.</p>
              <p>Scientists have been able to track Morgan’s progress thanks to a 
              radio collar fitted to his neck in 2015. At 30 years old, it seems he 
              was finally ready to seek out his true love in what charity Save the 
              Elephants has called “one of the most exceptional elephant movements 
              recorded.”</p>
              <p><img src="https://noahsarkzoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/morganamaleb.jpg?w=640" alt="" width="512" height="377"></p>
              <p>Morgan, clearly a highly intelligent animal, was discovered to be 
              making his journey under the cover of darkness. Researchers believe that
               he was potentially aware of the dangers he faced during the day – 
              specifically from poachers – and so chose to make his way at night, 
              covering between 19km and 24km every evening before taking shelter in 
              thickets and forests during daylight hours.</p>
              <p>Elephant poaching is a major problem in this area of the world. 
              Statistics show that in the early 1970s there were over 20,000 elephants
               to be found along Morgan’s path, but now that figure has dropped to as 
              few as 300. This could be the catalyst behind Morgan’s mission: to find a
               mate against all odds. And when it comes to the ancient route he took, 
              it just goes to show that an elephant never forgets!</p>
              <p>Iain Douglas-Hamilton, the founder of Save the Elephants, said it was
               likely that Morgan was “ranging across the country trying to pick up 
              the scent of the tracks of a female.”</p>
              <p>We really hope Morgan finds love and manages to stay out of danger. 
              It’s a sad fact that so many of these magnificent creatures are killed 
              for their ivory and other reasons – which is why we’re fully supportive 
              of Save the Elephants and many other charities working to protect these 
              animals.</p>
              <p>At Noah’s Ark we’ve created an Elephant Eden
               for Janu and M’Changa, our two African elephants. The enclosure offers 
              all the stimulation and space our wonderful elephants deserve and also 
              acts as an important resource for scientists looking to better 
              understand the social interactions of elephants and their behaviour.</p>
