              <p>Firefighter Patrick Hardison describes how his life has been "renewed" a year after his historic 26-hour operation.</p>
              <p class="sky-component-story-article__intro">An American firefighter given a face transplant one year ago has described how he now feels like "a normal guy".</p>
              <p>Patrick Hardison, 42, from Senatobia, Mississippi, 
              was badly injured when he ran into a burning house to rescue a woman in 
              2001. </p>
              <p>His face was burned beyond recognition when the roof of the house collapsed on top of him.</p>
              <p>In
               August 2015 Mr Hardison received a historic operation which saw his 
              burned face peeled off and replaced with that of 26-year-old New York 
              cyclist David Rodebaugh</p>
              <p><img src="http://e3.365dm.com/16/08/750x563/6dc757ee641fc81fb1f89b97a539baf9dd609e98c6e63e5b17dd00e2fd0765f5_3771798.jpg?20160825074618" alt="" width="750" height="563"></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Hardison described how his life has been 'renewed'</strong></p>
              <p>Speaking at a news conference to mark the first anniversary of the 
              26-hour operation, Mr Hardison said: "I'm here today because I want 
              others to see that there is hope beyond the injury. </p>
              <p>"I'm especially proud to share my story with other injured firefighters, first responders and US military.</p>
              <p>"If sharing my story helps just one person explore the possibility of face transplants, then it's worth it."  </p>
              <p>Mr
               Hardison, surrounded by his wife and children, went on: "I guess you 
              all want to know how I am doing. Well, I'm happy to tell you I'm doing 
              great.</p>
              <p>"I like to say that I'm the same old Pat, but that would 
              not give enough credit to the amazing journey that I have gone through 
              over the past year.</p>
              <p>"The road to recovery has been long and hard, but if I had the opportunity to do it again, I would in a heartbeat."</p>
              <p>He said how he can now enjoy activities with his family again. </p>
              <p>"My
               family and I took a trip to Disney World this past June and I swam in 
              the pool with my children for the first time in 15 years," he said.</p>
              <p><img src="http://e3.365dm.com/16/08/750x563/7e314f31ec89f6471eeb235239f45a3553613cbb02da2c4755f20c67a9f2aeb2_3771875.jpg?20160825090220" alt="" width="750" height="563"></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Rodebaugh's mother gave permission for her son's face to be donated</strong></p>
              <p>He told how his new eyelids and ability to blink meant his sight had 
              improved and he could drive a car once more. He said he was sleeping 
              more soundly as well.</p>
              <p>"It's just great," he said.</p>
              <p>"No more stares from strangers. I'm pretty much back to being a normal guy, doing normal activities.</p>
              <p>"My life has changed and it has been renewed." <br> <br>He
               thanked his medical team of more than 100 doctors, nurses and support 
              staff who were involved in the transplant at the NYU Langone Medical 
              Centre in New York City and where he has had several follow-up 
              procedures.</p>
              <p>He continues to have monthly check-ups and will remain on immune suppressants for the rest of his life.</p>
              <p><img src="http://e3.365dm.com/16/07/992x558/cegrab-20151117-124623-139-1_3502737.jpg?20160704103651" alt="" width="991" height="558"></p>
              <p>Surgeon Dr Eduardo Rodriquez, who was in charge of the procedure, 
              said he was amazed by his patient's recovery and that it had "surpassed 
              all of our expectations".</p>
              <p>Mr Rodebaugh was identified as a 
              potential donor after he died when he hit his head during a bicycle 
              collision with a pedestrian.</p>
              <p>His mother gave permission for his face to be donated to Mr Hardiman, noting her son always wanted to be a firefighter.</p>

              <p>Mr Hardison is going to meet Mr Rodebaugh's family later this year.</p>
              <p>The
               first partial face transplant was carried out by doctors in France in 
              2005 to restore the face of a woman who had been mauled by her dog. </p>
