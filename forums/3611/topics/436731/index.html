              <p class="headline"><em></em></p>
              <p>A freakishly large lobster destined for the pot has instead found a new home in - where else? - Coney Island.</p>
              <p>The colossal crustacean went on exhibit this week at the New York Aquarium, thanks to a seafood company worker who decided it was too big for dinner.</p>
              <p>The lobster was caught weeks ago off the coast of Canada and sent in a 2-ton shipment to the New England Lobster Co. in San Francisco.</p>
              <p>The firm's bookkeeper, Jennifer Vargas, set out to save its life when it weighed in at 18 pounds and was estimated to be 75 years old.</p>
              <p>"This seemed like a [lousy] way to go," Vargas said. "A lot of the customers were interested in him - the problem was they didn't have a pot big enough."</p>
              <p>Her boss said she could find him a home, and the New York Aquarium, run by the Wildlife Conservation Society, responded to an online posting.</p>
              <p>Visitors have been amazed. "Look at the claws on him. It's like something out of a science fiction movie," said Patrick Moffa, 52, of Astoria, Queens.</p>
              <p>Aquarium Director Jon Dohlin said the still-growing lobster is a crowd-pleaser.</p>
              <p>"He radiates a certain charisma," he said proudly, "a crustacean charisma."</p>
