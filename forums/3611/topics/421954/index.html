              <p>I imagine that as a little kid, I was lucky. Heck, it wasn't about having the toys, or the good grades, but rather, I did not have to fight with siblings over dolls or toy cars, or to do better than my sibling at school. When I had my sister, I imagined again that she was upset because she missed such things which I cared nothing for.</p>
              <p>Still, seeing myself in the mirror, I reckon that I was fair.</p>
              <p>When kiddy rides cost 20cents, and I learnt that my mother had no money, I just played twice. 40 cents. When toys were not a given, I did not really remember asking for any. They just, came when I needed them. I had lego sets, toy figurines, and still, my favourite pasttime was playing with coins rather than expensive toys.</p>
              <p>Cheap make belief toys were fun. With my entire collection of 10 cent coins, I imagined my kitchen table to be a battlefield, and each coin was a soldier. I marched soldiers through bridges which were represented with long rulers, obstacles which were represented by bowls, cups, and what you've got, and every day was a huge mission.</p>
              <p>I had dolls even, as a guy. My sexual orientation has always been in doubt. I loved my first snoopy, and while I ended up with a football team of cuddlies, I later learned that they are important to children. There were reports of earthquakes when kids were buried under debris, and those who survived, coincidentally had a doll of some sort to hug and talk with until the rescuers came.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, my world collapsed since day 1 I was born. Perhaps, many people in my generation can empathise, no reason found and stated.</p>
              <p>Still, it was weird, I had soft toys and they were male. Snoopies, Garfield, Odie, I only recall having one female bunny whom I playpretend weddings with my favourite Snoopy. It was somehow in my genes that monogamy is permissible. Polygamy is a sin. Still, when I look at society nowadays...</p>
              <p>Let's go back to the toys.</p>
              <p>As I grew, I played perverted things with my toys, I guess knowing too much led to a delusional mindset. I wouLD NO longer conduct warfare based on fairness and integrity, but based on all-out-attacks. I would no longer play marriage with dolls, but instead bullying each other instead. Somehow or rather, I saw this as growth.</p>
              <p>It did not seem healthy, still, it happened. I would argue with my parents, the classmates are playig soccer! That's violent! I am just.. pretending to kill people!</p>
              <p>In a whisker's time, more than 20 years have passed, few weeks back a nice VCD appeared on my desk through a mail from a friend, it was a Thai film titled &lt;a href="<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_Chan%22&gt;My">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_Chan"&gt;My</a> Girl &lt;/a&gt;and the dejavu that fills my empty heart as I watched the movie was impeccable.</p>
