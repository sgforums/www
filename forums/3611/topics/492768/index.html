              <p><span class="m_first-letter">A</span> British man has managed to catch the world's largest carp.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tim Webb, 57, landed the 222lb giant Siamese carp after an exhausting 90-minute battle at a lake in Ban Pong, Thailand.</p>
              <p>Mr Webb, from Crawley, West Sussex, owns his own fishery in Thailand and is a keen angler.</p>
              <p>All it took to lure the greedy fish onto his line was a simple bait of bread and bran rice.</p>
              <p>The angler almost lost the beast, and during the grueling battle he thought a couple of times that he had lost.</p>
              <div class="articleBodyText section">
              <div class="article-body-text component  ">
              <div class="component-content">
              <p><span class="m_first-letter">H</span>owever, patience and perseverance meant he managed to land the beast.</p>
              <p>The hard work paid off - when weighed, the carp was found to be almost 16 stone.</p>
              <p>This easily beat the previous record for a Siamese carp - the previous record-holder was a comparatively puny 150lbs.</p>
              <p>In order to get a picture with his prize, he had to enlist the help of two fellow anglers to hold up the fish.</p>
              <p>Because he was so enamoured with the large fish, he bought it from the lake and released it into his own fishery 25 miles away.</p>
              <p>He had to ask six people to help him lift the carp into the back of his truck.</p>
              <p>Tim said: "It's an amazing feeling to reel in a fish that is well over the world record.</p>
              <p>"As soon as I felt it on the end of my line I knew I had something special.</p>
              <p>"I had to fight it hard for a long time because in effect I was reeling in a small car.</p>
              <p>"There were one or two hairy moments but I managed to bring it to the bank. I was elated but shattered afterwards."</p>
              <p><span class="m_first-letter">H</span>e added: "It was amazing to actually take it away with me and put it in my own lake.</p>
              <p>"Having a fish of that size generates a lot of interest, people will want to come and have a go at trying to catch it."</p>
              <p>Siamese cap, found in river basins in Asia, are the biggest species in the world.</p>
              <p>The previous Siamese carp record-holder was also caught by a Brit - Andy Harman - in Thailand earlier this year</p>
