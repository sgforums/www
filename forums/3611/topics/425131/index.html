              <p>It is perhaps no surprise that a book titled "What Every Man Thinks About Apart From Sex" is a best seller.<br> <br> It is also perhaps no surprise that such a book has recently outsold a Harry Potter title and "The Da Vinci Code" on Amazon.com.</p>
              <p>But what about the fact that the book contains only blank pages?</p>
              <p>"I am fiercely proud that I can now call myself a best-selling author," said comedian and entrepreneur Sheridan Simove, the book's "writer."<br> <br> "What is wonderful about it is that people want to laugh."</p>
              <p>"What Every Man Thinks About Apart From Sex" has sold out
              its first print run, hitting No. 744 on Amazon's list, ahead of Dan
              Brown's "The Da Vinci Code" at No. 2,910 and JK Rowling's "Harry Potter
              and the Order of the Phoenix" at No. 2,406.</p>
              <p><br> Simove told AOL News that the idea for the book came after an earlier
              publishing venture, a self-help book called "Ideas Man," which was a
              comparative flop.<br> <br> "It was about my life and success and failures," he said of "Ideas
              Man." "It took me five years to [write], it was out for two years, and
              it got to number 5,000 on the Amazon charts."<br> <br> Simove's other ideas have been more successful, including a Martin Loofah King bath product, the Inotepad and the Designer Beaver, an adult novelty gift, which he claims have sold over a million units.<br> <br> "I like to do things where people say it can't be done and no one puts barriers in front of my goal," Simove said.<br> <br> The latest winning idea was turning a joke into a book.<br> <br> A <em>blank</em> book.<br> <br> "From the day of conception to having a book in my hand took nine days. I became gripped by the idea."<br> <br> Although "What Every Man Thinks About Apart From Sex" was given an <a href="http://www.isbn.org/standards/home/about/index.html">ISBN number</a>,
              crucial for any serious publishing venture, British authorities refused
              to grant the publication the tax-free status it usually does for books.<br> <br> "The question now is when is a book not a book?" Simove said. "This is the first surrealist book ever made.</p>
              <p><br> Simove is no stranger to controversy. He previously attempted to change
              his name to "God" but was blocked when his bank refused to acknowledge
              the change.<br> <br> "My bank was very angry with me," he said. "They said that they couldn't put me in the system with only one name.<br> <br> "I said put me down as 'Almighty God.' It went all the way to the top
              of HSBC. They said they would close all my accounts. In the end, I
              changed my name back again."<br> <br> Flushed by the success of "What Every Man Thinks About Apart From Sex," Simove is already working on a sequel.<br> <br> "I am thinking about a follow-up called 'Reasons to Trust Politicians,'" he said.</p>
