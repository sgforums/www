              <p>How does these animals group and animal lover - got interest in animals and fall in love with animals in the first place ?</p>
              <p>I am sure they don't take a look at photo and that it. They must have visited a zoo , aquairum or even have pets before - that how the love boom !!<br><br>Yet strangely - here they are trying - "release the animals" denying other of that experience - maybe that why they say love is selfish  -who want to deny the future generations and others from meeting the animals up close and  falling in love with animals or have the great experience to meet wild animals face to face.  - seem like the chinese saying "cross the river, break the bridge"</p>
              <p>They want to make it a world where you can only watch in tv or photo.Only the rich can enjoy animals- yeap you must be rich enough to fly 1/2 way around the world to see a zebra or dolphine face to face !!!</p>
              <p>I think that the dumbest way !!! How can you expect people to related to animals and protect nature - when never let a person encounter a real animal itself ? The impact is not there.</p>
              <p>Sad to say institutions like zoo, aquraiums and RWS is not perfect but ptition will do more harm for the animals - as you are denying people access to animals , to learn more, related to them .  You are cutting the best link of human to animals. </p>

              <p><br>.....actually you got a valid point, asking RWS to free the dolphines is as good as asking pet lovers to release their pets. Its ironic, if pets can be treated well at home so do the dolphines in RWS. So why kick up a big fuss? How many pets have been abused by those so called animals lovers? I smelt self-contradictory, the very person who champion the right to free the dolphines might be keeping some dogs and cats in their own surroundings.</p>

              <p>"The Cove" is just a hour long film, basically  the director choose all the scenes which is all from an angle which is his point of view.  Thus is it a totally fair view = no.
