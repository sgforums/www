              <p>The existence of Area 51, the US airbase rumoured to house UFOs, along 
              with details of some of the strange activities that went on there have 
              been officially acknowledged in newly released CIA documents.</p>
              <p></p>
              <div class="authoring">17 August</div>
              <p>WASHINGTON — Its existence has been a badly kept secret for 
              decades and it has fuelled the imaginations of conspiracy theorists and 
              UFO hunters around the world.</p>
              <p>Now the existence of Area 51 has 
              been officially acknowledged by the Central Intelligence Agency and its 
              exact location revealed in Nevada.</p>
              <div class="left"></div>
              <p>Documents released by the CIA also reveal that there really 
              have been some strange occurrences at the secret airbase – however, they
               are not quite as exciting as UFO hunters would like, reported the Daily
               Telegraph.</p>
              <p>Among the jobs that staff at the site had to perform 
              during the 1960s was a routine of vacuuming the runway to allow 
              experimental aircraft to take off without damaging their engines.</p>
              <p>Previously
               the US government has provided minimal information about Area 51 and 
              most mentions of it are redacted in documents that are declassified.</p>
              <p>Official
               maps usually only show a disused mine at the site or a large area of 
              restricted airspace, however it does feature on Google Maps and in 
              satellite images.</p>
              <p>However, in a set of documents released to a 
              researcher studying the history of the U-2 spy plane program, the secret
               base is officially revealed.</p>
              <p>A line drawn map contained within 
              the reports show the location of Area 51 and Groom Lake, the salt flat 
              the base is built upon, in relation to the Mojave Desert.</p>
              <p>They also provide details on how the site was first established as part of a wider Atomic Energy Commission test site.</p>
              <p>However, the documents make no mention of UFOs nor the secret weapons that many believe are being developed there.</p>
              <p>Jeffrey
               Richelson, a senior fellow at the George Washington University’s 
              National Security Archive who obtained the records, said the new 
              documents seemed to suggest the CIA were becoming less secretive about 
              Area 51’s existence.</p>
              <p>The documents were released in response to a 
              Freedom of Information Request made in 2005. An earlier 2002 request 
              resulted in documents that were heavily redacted.</p>
              <p>In a blog posted
               on the research organisation’s website, Mr Richelson said: “What the 
              CIA released in response to a 2005 Freedom of Information Act request is
               a substantially less redacted version of a history of two key aerial 
              reconnaissance programs.</p>
              <p>“The latest release is notable for the 
              significant amount of newly declassified material with respect to the 
              U-2 — with regard to names of pilots, codenames and cryptonyms, 
              locations, funding and cover arrangements, electronic countermeasures 
              equipment, organisation, cooperation with foreign governments, and 
              operations, particularly in Asia.”</p>
              <p>The mentions of Area 51 were 
              contained in documents detailing the history of the U-2 and Oxcart spy 
              plane programs were written in 1992 by Gregory Pedlow and Donald 
              Welzenbach, who were historians at the CIA.</p>
              <p>A heavily redacted 
              version of the history was published in 1998 with a more detailed 
              version released under the Freedom of Information Act in 2002.</p>
              <p>The latest version to be released shows that Area 51 is mentioned on at least 12 pages, including a map.</p>
              <p>One
               of the first mentions describe how two senior project staff on the U-2 
              had been flying over Nevada when they spotted an old airstrip near Groom
               Lake.</p>
              <p>It describes how the facility had been used during World War Two as an aerial gunnery for the Army Air Corp pilots.</p>
              <p>President
               Dwight Eisenhower later approved “this strip of wasteland, known by its
               map designation as Area 51, to the Atomic Energy Commissions Nevada 
              test site and training range.</p>
              <p>It also states that to make the facility more attractive to workers there, it was named Paradise Ranch, or sometimes the Ranch.</p>
              <p>A poor quality photograph of “The Ranch” is also included.</p>
              <p>The documents also mention how a Military Air Transport Service flight crashed in 1955 at Area 51 killing 14 people.</p>
              <p>They
               also provide detailed history about tests and missions of the U-2 plane
               from Area 51, along with information about the aircrafts use in other 
              parts of the world.</p>
              <p>Radar tests of what would later become the 
              SR71 Blackbird were also carried out with a mock up of the plane placed 
              on top of tall pylons.</p>
              <p>Area 51 was later upgraded to assist testing of this aircraft under the Oxcart program.</p>
              <p>Road
               signs had to be removed, road banks were levelled and trees trimmed to 
              help transport the plane safely – possibly providing an explanation for 
              some of the phenomena attributed to UFOs in the area.</p>
              <p>There are 
              some amusing mentions of life at the secret US base. During testing of 
              Oxcart in 1963, Area 51 personnel had to “sweep and vacuum the runway” 
              before the aircraft took off to prevent damage to the engine.</p>
              <p>There
               are, however, some mentions of Area 51 that remain blanked out and this
               will doubtless provide more than enough fuel to conspiracy theorists.
