              son’s final wish and plant two million trees in the desert of Inner

              <p id="ext-gen80" class="mol-para-with-font"><span>In
               2000, 67-year-old Yi Jiefang from Shanghai lost her son Yang Ruizhe in a
               tragic accident when he was on his way to university in Japan. Before 
              he died, he told her his lifelong dream was to plant the trees.</span></p>
              <p><span>Yi
               plans to plant two million trees and so far she has successfully 
              planted 1.1 million  that stretch for miles on the Kulun Qi Horqin sandy
               desert plain.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Determination: 67-year-old Yi promised to grant her son's dying wish planting two million trees in Mongolia</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Incredible: In 2004 she sold her home in China and with the help of her 
              husband they began to plant the trees. Above, she is in one of the 
              established forests</strong></p>
              <p><span>in
               order to complete her son’s wish, in 2004 Yi quit her job and sold the 
              family home. She and her husband also sold the clinic they owned to 
              raise funds.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>The
               couple started up the ‘Green Life’ organisation with the money raised 
              from the house, her son’s insurance pay out, and the help of the local 
              government. It didn’t take long before they started planting the trees.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Their
               plan was to plant two million trees in 20 years. After more than ten 
              years, they are already over half way. Once the trees have all fully 
              grown, they will be donated to the local villages.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>In
               addition, Green Life were affiliated with the China Women's Development
               Foundation and the Inner Mongolia Youth Development Foundation. 
              Together the organisations raised donations that are used to purchase 
              seedlings and plant the trees.</span></p>

              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Difficulties: She has faced some problems including including mad winds and lack of water in the desert</strong></p>

              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Strong-minded: She set up the organisation Green Life and has so far planted more than 1.1 million trees</strong></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>In a recent interview with the Youth Daily, Yi said she did not think they would have achieved so much by now.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>She
               said: ‘I did not expect to stick at this more than ten years, I hope 
              that through our actions we can get hundreds of millions of people 
              planting millions of trees.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>'I think I have granted my son’s wish.’</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Yi
               said after her son died it was very painful. It wasn’t until a year 
              later that she buried him on December 1 2001, his birthday.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>She
               explained: ‘Planting a tree is like planting and giving hope. You watch
               a tree grow and you get comfort. It is just like when a family plants 
              flowers, you watch the flowers grow and it makes you very happy.’</span></p>

              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Final wish: Yi and her husband raised the money together to make their son's lifelong dream come true</strong></p>

              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Courageous: Their plan was to plant two million trees, after more than ten years they are already over half way</strong></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>When she 
              first began planting the trees, Yi faced some difficulties, including 
              crazy winds that would blow the trees away, and a lack of water in the 
              desert. But she said it will always rain eventually, which is very 
              lucky.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Over the years she has had many volunteers coming out to Inner Mongolia to help her plant the trees.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Money is tight for Yi and her husband but they manage to survive and continue pursuing their son’s dream.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>She said: ‘We eat very lightly and I basically do not buy any clothes for myself.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>'However,
               I must emphasize that all contributions to Green Life go into the 
              plating of the trees and we do not retain any of it.’</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>In the future Yi said that Green Life plans to cover over 23,000 square miles of desert with trees.</span></p>
