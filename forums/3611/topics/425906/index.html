              <p><span>At 132lbs, Lu Hao is already five times the size of a normal child his age.</span></p>
              <p><span>The three-year-old toddler from China eats a staggering THREE bowls of rice when he sits down for a family meal. </span></p>
              <p><span>When
               Lu Hao was born he weighed just 2.6kg (5.7 lbs), however, from the time
               he was three months old he began to gain weight rapidly.</span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span>'His appetite is so good that 
              for a meal he can eat 3 big bowls of rice, even larger than I and his 
              mother,' said Hao's father Lu Yuncheng.</span></p>
              <p><span>Since Hao was one-year-old his parents have tried to keep a careful eye on his diet.</span></p>
              <p><span>However, Hao's mother Chen Yuan comments: 'We have to let him be as if we don't feed him he will cry non-stop'.</span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="artSplitter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/03/22/article-1368772-0B480CDE00000578-770_634x433.jpg" alt="Big eater: 'His appetite is so good that for a meal he can eat 3 big bowls of rice', said his father" width="634" height="433">

              </div>
              <p><span>No matter how hard the family 
              restricts Hao's diet and pushes him to move more the toddler has still 
              managed to put on 10kg (22 lbs) in the past year.</span></p>
              <p><span>Now Chen Yuan is unable to pick her son up.</span></p>
              <p><span>'In both of our families, there was no such giant person,' said father Yuncheng.</span></p>

              <p><span>Hao hates walking and each day his mother takes him to kindergarten on a motorcycle.</span></p>
              <p><span>'He is quite happy that I could ride him to kindergarten instead of walking him there,' said Yuan.</span></p>
              <p><span>Hao has many toys at home but his favourite is Superman because, he says, 'Superman can fly and beat bad men!'</span></p>
              <p><span>When asked is he would like to fly like Superman Hao giggles and replies: 'No. I am too fat'.</span></p>
              <p><span>To push Hao to do more sports, the family installed a basketball hoop in the yard and often take him to swim in a local river.</span></p>
              <p><span>But the exercise just make him hungrier and results in him putting on more weight.</span></p>
              <p><span>'We
               took him to three hospitals and one said he has a tumor in the head, 
              while the other two said there is no tumour in the head,' said Yuncheng.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Doctors said his hormones are at a normal level. It's hard to know why he could be so big.'</span></p>
              <p><span>'We now worry the most about his health. As if he continues to grow at this rate his heart could fail,' said Yuan.</span></p>
              <p><span>They also worry that when he gets older and more aware of his weight Hao will be bullied.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Our biggest hope is one day Hao could get slim,' said Chen.</span></p>
