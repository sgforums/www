The Delaware County sheriff's office says deputies responded to a call about a domestic dispute early Saturday, and a man told them his wife was drinking at a wedding and hit him before locking herself in a car.</p>
              <p>The sheriff says deputies found the woman in a car and tried to talk with her, but she didn't cooperate. He says when deputies tried to remove her, she said she was a breast-feeding mother, then exposed part of her chest and sprayed them with breast milk.</p>
              <p>Authorities say 30-year-old Stephanie Robinette of Westerville faces charges including domestic violence, assault, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.</p>
              <p>Jail officials didn't know whether she has an attorney.</p>

              <p>if you read journalism tactics before, the way to catch attention for news is to purposely relate a person's education level to the acts one does.  actually is "<strong>A</strong> does <strong>B</strong>. Therefore <strong>B</strong> is very unlike <strong>A</strong>" which is a kind of fallacy which prey's on people's common assumption that educated people must act in a certain "correct" way.  A person's act does not have direct correlation with a person's educational status.  Singapore newspaper is also very guilty of this journalism tactic, especially Shin Ming.</p>
