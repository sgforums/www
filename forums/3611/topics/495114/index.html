              <p>A dedicated Georgia doctor was not about to let snowy conditions stop him as he walked a mile to get to his patients at a local hospital last week.</p>
              <p>Dr. Dean McKenzie, the chief of cardiothoracic surgery at Children's Hospital of Atlanta, made the trek after roads in the area were inundated with snow and ice.</p>
              <p>"When I heard that he walked, I immediately was like, ‘Of course he did,’” said Laura Beckwith, whose son is one of Dr. McKenzie's patients. “It exemplifies the type of person he is.”</p>
              <p><img height="793" width="526" src="https://scontent-sin6-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/26733648_10155911370303186_8940041735017709741_n.jpg?oh=ec1159112b05d9bd66afe756a77a6359&amp;oe=5B24FAC6" alt=""></p>
              <p>When icy roads prevented Dr. McKenzie, our Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery, from driving to work yesterday, he walked a mile through snow and ice to get to the hospital. Thank you to the men and women on our staff who made it possible to continue with surgeries, procedures and exams as winter weather swirled outside this week!</p>
              <p>The highly unusual snowfall in the region left roadways tough to navigate. In addition, local schools and non-essential government offices were shut down, but not hospitals.</p>
              <p>Beckwith’s son, Madden, has congenital heart disease and Dr. McKenzie performed open heart surgery on him in December. Beckwith said she met the doctor at 28 weeks and something about him made her choose him as their physician.</p>
              <p>“Something about his presence made us trust him with our son’s life,” Beckwith said. </p>
              <p>Beckwith posted a photo of Madden and Dr. McKenzie after hearing about his journey to work.</p>
              <p>“When everyone else is calling out, he walked to work. It spoke volumes about his character,” Beckwith added.<strong></strong><em></em></p>

              <h3>by <a href="https://americanliterature.com/author/o-henry">O. Henry</a></h3>
              <hr>
              <p>Montague
                   Silver, the finest street man and art grafter in the West, says to me 
                  once in Little Rock: "If you ever lose your mind, Billy, and get too old
                   to do honest swindling among grown men, go to New York. In the West a 
                  sucker is born every minute; but in New York they appear in chunks of 
                  roe - you can't count 'em!"</p>
              <p>Two years afterward I found that I 
                  couldn't remember the names of the Russian admirals, and I noticed some 
                  gray hairs over my left ear; so I knew the time had arrived for me to 
                  take Silver's advice.</p>
              <p>I struck New York about noon one day, and 
                  took a walk up Broadway. And I run against Silver himself, all 
                  encompassed up in a spacious kind of haberdashery, leaning against a 
                  hotel and rubbing the half-moons on his nails with a silk handkerchief.</p>
              <p>"Paresis or superannuated?" I asks him.</p>
              <p>"Hello,
                   Billy," says Silver; "I'm glad to see you. Yes, it seemed to me that 
                  the West was accumulating a little too much wiseness. I've been saving 
                  New York for dessert. I know it's a low-down trick to take things from 
                  these people. They only know this and that and pass to and fro and think
                   ever and anon. I'd hate for my mother to know I was skinning these 
                  weak-minded ones. She raised me better."</p>
              <p>"Is there a crush already in the waiting rooms of the old doctor that does skin grafting?" I asks.</p>
              <p>"Well,
                   no," says Silver; "you needn't back Epidermis to win today. I've only 
                  been here a month. But I'm ready to begin; and the members of Willie 
                  Manhattan's Sunday School class, each of whom has volunteered to 
                  contribute a portion of cuticle toward this rehabilitation, may as well 
                  send their photos to the Evening Daily.</p>
              <p>"I've been studying the 
                  town," says Giorson, "and reading the papers every day, and I know it as 
                  well as the cat in the City Hall knows an O'Sullivan. People here lie 
                  down on the floor and scream and kick when you are the least bit slow 
                  about taking money from them. Come up in my room and I'll tell you. 
                  We'll work the town together, Billy, for the sake of old times."</p>
              <p>Silver takes me up in a hotel. He has a quantity of irrelevant objects lying about.</p>
              <p>"There's
                   more ways of getting money from these metropolitan hayseeds," says 
                  Silver, "than there is of cooking rice in Charleston, S. C. They'll bite
                   at anything. The brains of most of 'em commute. The wiser they are in 
                  intelligence the less perception of cognizance they have. Why, didin't a
                   man the other day sell J. P. Morgan an oil portrait of Rockefeller, 
                  Jr., for Andrea del Sarto's celebrated painting of the young Saint John!</p>
              <p>"You
                   see that bundle of printed stuff in the corner, Billy? That's gold 
                  mining stock. I started out one day to sell that, but I quit it in two 
                  hours. Why? Got arrested for blocking the street. People fought to buy 
                  it. I sold the policeman a block of it on the way to the station-house, 
                  and then I took it off the market. I don't want people to give me their 
                  money. I want some little consideration connected with the transaction 
                  to keep my pride from being hurt. I want 'em to guess the missing letter
                   in Chic-go, or draw to a pair of nines before they pay me a cent of 
                  money.</p>
              <p>"Now there's another little scheme that worked so easy I 
                  had to quit it. You see that bottle of blue ink on the table? I tattooed
                   an anchor on the back of my hand and went to a bank and told 'em I was 
                  Admiral Dewey's nephew. They offered to cash my draft on him for a 
                  thousand, but I didn't know my uncle's first name. It shows, though, 
                  what an easy town it is. As for burglars, they won't go in a house now 
                  unless there's a hot supper ready and a few college students to wait on 
                  'em. They're slugging citizens all over the upper part of the city and I
                   guess, taking the town from end to end, it's a plain case of assault 
                  and Battery."</p>
              <p>"Monty," says I, when Silver had slacked, up, "you 
                  may have Manhattan correctly discriminated in your perorative, but I 
                  doubt it. I've only been in town two hours, but it don't dawn upon me 
                  that it's ours with a cherry in it. There ain't enough rus in urbe about
                   it to suit me. I'd be a good deal much better satisfied if the citizens
                   had a straw or more in their hair, and run more to velveteen vests and 
                  buckeye watch charms. They don't look easy to me."</p>
              <p>"You've got it,
                   Billy," says Silver. "All emigrants have it. New York's bigger than 
                  Little Rock or Europe, and it frightens a foreigner. You'll be all 
                  right. I tell you I feel like slapping the people here because they 
                  don't send me all their money in laundry baskets, with germicide 
                  sprinkled over it. I hate to go down on the street to get it. Who wears 
                  the diamonds in this town? Why, Winnie, the Wiretapper's wife, and 
                  Bella, the Buncosteerer's bride. New Yorkers can be worked easier than a
                   blue rose on a tidy. The only thing that bothers me is I know I'll 
                  break the cigars in my vest pocket when I get my clothes all full of 
                  twenties."</p>
              <p>"I hope you are right, Monty," says I; "but I wish all 
                  the same I had been satisfied with a small business in Little Rock. The 
                  crop of farmers is never so short out there but what you can get a few 
                  of 'em to sign a petition for a new post office that you can discount 
                  for $200 at the county bank. The people here appear to possess instincts
                   of self-preservation and illiberality. I fear me that we are not 
                  cultured enough to tackle this game."</p>
              <p>"Don't worry," says Silver. 
                  "I've got this Jayville-near-Tarrytown correctly estimated as sure as 
                  North River is the Hudson and East River ain't a river. Why, there are 
                  people living in four blocks of Broadway who never saw any kind of a 
                  building except a skyscraper in their lives! A good, live hustling 
                  Western man ought to get conspicuous enough here inside of three months 
                  to incur either Jerome's clemency or Lawson's displeasure."</p>
              <p>"Hyperbole
                   aside," says I, "do you know of any immediate system of buncoing the 
                  community out of a dollar or two except by applying to the Salvation 
                  Army or having a fit on Miss Helen Gould's doorsteps?"</p>
              <p>"Dozens of 'em," says Silver. "How much capital have you got, Billy?"</p>
              <p>"A thousand," I told him.</p>
              <p>"I've
                   got $1,200," says he. "We'll pool and do a big piece of business. 
                  There's so many ways we can make a million that I don't know how to 
                  begin."</p>
              <p>The next morning Silver meets me at the hotel and he is all sonorous and stirred with a kind of silent joy.</p>
              <p>"We're
                   to meet J. P. Morgan this afternoon," says he. "A man I know in the 
                  hotel wants to introduce us. He's a friend of his. He says he likes to 
                  meet people from the West."</p>
              <p>"That sounds nice and plausible," says I. "I'd like to know Mr. Morgan."</p>
              <p>"It
                   won't hurt us a bit," says Silver, "to get acquainted with a few 
                  finance kings. I kind of like the social way New York has with 
                  strangers."</p>
              <p>The man Silver knew was named Klein. At three o'clock 
                  Klein brought his Wall Street friend to see us in Silver's room. "Mr. 
                  Morgan" looked some like his pictures, and he had a Turkish towel 
                  wrapped around his left foot, and he walked with a cane.</p>
              <p>"Mr. Silver and Mr. Pescud," says Klein. "It sounds superfluous," says he, "to mention the name of the greatest financial -"</p>
              <p>"Cut
                   it out, Klein," says Mr. Morgan. "I'm glad to know you gents; I take 
                  great interest in the West. Klein tells me you're from Little Rock. I 
                  think I've a railroad or two out there somewhere. If either of you guys 
                  would like to deal a hand or two of stud poker I -"</p>
              <p>"Now, Pierpont," cuts in Klein, "you forget!"</p>
              <p>"Excuse
                   me, gents!" says Morgan; "since I've had the gout so bad I sometimes 
                  play a social game of cards at my house. Neither of you never knew 
                  One-eyed Peters, did you, while you was around Little Rock? He lived in 
                  Seattle, New Mexico."</p>
              <p>Before we could answer, Mr. Morgan hammers 
                  on the floor with his cane and begins to walk up and down, swearing in a
                   loud tone of voice.</p>
              <p>"They have been pounding your stocks to-day on the Street, Pierpont?" asks Klein, smiling.</p>
              <p>"Stocks!
                   No!" roars Mr. Morgan. "It's that picture I sent an agent to Europe to 
                  buy. I just thought about it. He cabled me to-day that it ain't to be 
                  found in all Italy. I'd pay $50,000 to-morrow for that picture - yes, 
                  $75,000. I give the agent a la carte in purchasing it. I cannot 
                  understand why the art galleries will allow a De Vinchy to -"</p>
              <p>"Why, Mr. Morgan," says klein; "I thought you owned all of the De Vinchy paintings."</p>
              <p>"What is the picture like, Mr. Morgan?" asks Silver. "It must be as big as the side of the Flatiron Building."</p>
              <p>"I'm
                   afraid your art education is on the bum, Mr. Silver," says Morgan. "The
                   picture is 27 inches by 42; and it is called 'Love's Idle Hour.' It 
                  represents a number of cloak models doing the two-step on the bank of a 
                  purple river. The cablegram said it might have been brought to this 
                  country. My collection will never be complete without that picture. 
                  Well, so long, gents; us financiers must keep early hours."</p>
              <p>Mr. 
                  Morgan and Klein went away together in a cab. Me and Silver talked about
                   how simple and unsuspecting great people was; and Silver said what a 
                  shame it would be to try to rob a man like Mr. Morgan; and I said I 
                  thought it would be rather imprudent, myself. Klein proposes a stroll 
                  after dinner; and me and him and Silver walks down toward Seventh Avenue
                   to see the sights. Klein sees a pair of cuff links that instigate his 
                  admiration in a pawnshop window, and we all go in while he buys 'em.</p>
              <p>After we got back to the hotel and Klein had gone, Silver jumps at me and waves his hands.</p>
              <p>"Did you see it?" says he. "Did you see it, Billy?"</p>
              <p>"What?" I asks.</p>
              <p>"Why,
                   that picture that Morgan wants. It's hanging in that pawnshop, behind 
                  the desk. I didn't say anything because Klein was there. It's the 
                  article sure as you live. The girls are as natural as paint can make 
                  them, all measuring 36 and 25 and 42 skirts, if they had any skirts, and
                   they're doing a buck-and-wing on the bank of a river with the blues. 
                  What did Mr. Morgan say he'd give for it? Oh, don't make me tell you. 
                  They can't know what it is in that pawnshop."</p>
              <p>When the pawnshop 
                  opened the next morning me and Silver was standing there as anxious as 
                  if we wanted to soak our Sunday suit to buy a drink. We sauntered 
                  inside, and began to look at watch-chains.</p>
              <p>"That's a violent 
                  specimen of a chromo you've got up there," remarked Silver, casual, to 
                  the pawnbroker. "But I kind of enthuse over the girl with the 
                  shoulderblades and red bunting. Would an offer of $2.25 for it cause you
                   to knock over any fragile articles of your stock in hurrying it off the
                   nail?"</p>
              <p>The pawnbroker smiles and goes on showing us plate watch-chains.</p>
              <p>"That
                   picture," says he, "was pledged a year ago by an Italian gentleman. I 
                  loaned him $500 on it. It is called 'Love's Idle Hour,' and it is by 
                  Leonardo de Vinchy. Two days ago the legal time expired, and it became 
                  an unredeemed pledge. Here is a style of chain that is worn a great deal
                   now."</p>
              <p>At the end of half an hour me and Silver paid the 
                  pawnbroker $2,000 and walked out with the picture. Silver got into a cab
                   with it and started for Morgan's office. I goes to the hotel and waits 
                  for him. In two hours Silver comes back.</p>
              <p>"Did you see Mr. Morgan?" I asks. "How much did he pay you for it?"</p>
              <p>Silver sits down and fools with a tassel on the table cover.</p>
              <p>"I
                   never exactly saw Mr. Morgan," he says, "because Mr. Morgan's been in 
                  Europe for a month. But what's worrying me, Billy, is this: The 
                  department stores have all got that same picture on sale, framed, for 
                  $3.48. And they charge $3.50 for the frame alone - that's what I can't 
                  understand."</p>
