              <div>
              <p>Living in the slum does not automatically entitle its residents 
              the opportunities to get a formal education, but with the birth of a 
              floating school, the chances of being formally educated are limitless.<br>The
               Makoko Floating School has been described by the London Design Museum 
              as a “prototype floating structure, built for the historic water 
              community of Makoko”.<br>Makoko, is a slum neighbourhood located in the 
              Makokoâ€�Iwaya community of Lagos, Nigeria’s largest city, and has a 
              population of more than 100,000 residents.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Fishermen from the Egun-speaking populace settled in the slum more than 100 years ago.<br>Established
               in the 18th Century primarily as a fishing village, the area was not 
              officially counted as part of the 2007 census and the population today 
              is estimated to be much higher.</p>
              <p>It is a community that houses thousands of Ijaws, Ilaje’s and 
              Egun speaking populace, who are predominately fish farmers and who also 
              engage in trading activities. They lack basic amenities, lack clean 
              water, power supply, and are alien to anything called development.</p>
              <div>
              <p>Not enough<br>Although Makoko has make shift 
              schools, including French schools built by individuals and foreign 
              nationals to cater for the educational needs of the children in the 
              community, they are yet largely insufficient to cater for the increasing
               number of children in the area.  <br>The near existence of formal 
              educational institutions in the area has been attributed as one of the 
              causes of teenage pregnancy and other forms of vices rampant in the 
              area.<br>In 2012, however, Nigerian architect Kunle Adeyemi, with 
              support from Heinrich Boll Foundation and the United Nations, created a 
              threeâ€�storey wooden floating structure to accommodate 100 elementary 
              school children per time, who will find their way to the school by 
              boats.</p>
              <p><img src="http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2016_09/1446281/ss-160305-nigeria-floating-school-yh-09_15030a9e0f2a03f352c68f96448b3d16.nbcnews-ux-1024-900.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683"></p>
              </div>
              <div>
              <p>Speaking on the stimulus for its creation, Adeyemi
               told a media organisation that: “The desire to construct the school was
               born out of curiosity after I visited the community. And my interest in
               the coastal community, where despite the little income made daily by 
              the breadwinners, they have never stopped developing the infrastructures
               in the community.” <br>Each of the floors in the school has a modern 
              toilet and electricity supply wires (powered by a solar system) built 
              into the school to provide lighting for the children, who may want to 
              involve in evening educational activities. The ground floor has an open 
              space which serves as a playground for children, and sometimes, 
              relaxation spot for Makoko residents on weekends.</p>
              <div>
              <p>As a pilot project created in 2012, the floating school has 
              taken an innovative approach to address the community’s social and 
              physical needs in view of the impact of climate change and a rapidly 
              urbanising African context. It is aimed at generating a sustainable, 
              ecological, alternative building system and urban water culture for the 
              teeming population of Africa’s coastal regions.<br>This world class 
              project, with beautiful architectural makeup is, however, fast becoming a
               shadow of itself. Since 2012, the structure has not been used and the 
              chairs, tables, roofs and bulb to lighten the classes are unavailable. A
               visit to the place showed that the fishermen have made the structure a 
              resting place during their fishing expedition.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
              <p>The sample floating structure, which has got 
              international press attention, won awards, including the 2013 AR+D 
              awards for Emerging Architecture, was shortlisted for the London Design 
              Museum’s 2014 Design of the Year Award and has been nominated for the 
              2015 International Award for Public Art.<br>Two factors have yet 
              continued to impede on the maximisation of the school. On the one hand, 
              Lagos state government is unwilling to approve the structure as a 
              school. This is because it has tagged the slum as an illegal settlement.
               Thus it is almost impossible for the government to give it the support 
              it needs to function properly.</p>

              </div>
              <div>
              <p>Speaking for the Lagos state government in 2013, 
              Commissioner for Waterfront and Infrastructure Development, Prince 
              Adesegun Oniru, said the structure is illegal, and added that “it 
              shouldn’t be there, and we are trying to get rid of structures there.” <br>On
               the other hand, the community is yet to assume full custody of the 
              structure. Adeyemi has advised the community leaders  to take full 
              control of the structure, get and mobilise the children to come and 
              learn, and teachers to rise up to teach. <br>A source told The Nation 
              that the community is ready to kick-start the teaching and learning of 
              formal education, but are hopeful that some good and noble persons can 
              take it up from where Adeyemi ended it. <br>Meanwhile, community vigilantes are in charge of the security of the floating structure.</p>

              <div><strong>About the school</strong></div>
              <div>Built to float and measuring about a hundred square metres 
              (100-square-metres), the school is a triangular form in sections 
              constructed with a parallel series of timber A-frames on a platform 
              supported by 256 recycled blue plastic barrels</div>
