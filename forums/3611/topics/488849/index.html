              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>More than a ton of ivory
              confiscated from New York and Philadelphia was crushed in Times
              Square on Friday to show intolerance for elephant poaching and
              the illegal ivory trade.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>The event demonstrated the urgency for stopping the criminal
              trade, which is killing elephants faster than the animals are
              reproducing, imperiling their populations, the US Fish and
              Wildlife Service said.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Roughly 907 kilograms of the elaborately carved ivory, some of it still in the form of an
              elephant's tusk, was on display on a table in Manhattan's Times Square. </span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Officials held it up dozens of statues piece by piece, then placed them on a
              conveyor belt that fed into an enormous mechanical crusher,
              where they was pulverized into dust.</span></p>

              <div style="overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;">The US Fish and Wildlife Service orchestrated an event in Manhattan's 
              Times Square on Friday where dozens of ivory statues were crushed as a 
              statement against elephant poaching and illegal trade of their tusks</div>

              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>'This is an illegal product and we feel that burning it or
              destroying it gets it out of commercial use and, therefore,
              there's less of a chance for it to find its way into the
              marketplace,' said Wildlife Conservation Society spokesman John
              Calvelli.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>'It makes it really clear that it will never be used again.'</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>The ivory was confiscated from dealers and retailers in New
              York City and Philadelphia.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>About 35,000 elephants are killed in Africa every year for
              their ivory, according to the Wildlife Service,
              which organized the event in partnership with the Wildlife
              Conservation Society.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>More than 100,000 were killed between 2011 and 2014, according to the Guardians.</span></p>

               crush and urged Americans not to buy ivory</p>

              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>There are only 43,000 elephants left in Tanzania, the country's government said this week.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>New York passed a law in August 2014 hardening the state's
              stance on the ivory trade by banning the sale of ivory and
              increasing penalties for ivory sales.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>New Jersey passed a similar law, which does not make an exception for antiques, right before its neighbor.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>The United States still allows ivory acquired before a 1989 ban to be traded.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Legal trade in ivory is thought to often be used as a cover for illegal sales of the substance.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>'Never
               buy ivory. Even if they say it's antique, it isn't,' Sex in the City 
              actress Kristen Davis said at the event, according to USA Today</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>China, the largest market for ivory, is thought to be a crossroads for many illegal sales.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>The
               country's government said earlier this month that it is working to shut
               down its legal trade, though it has not proffered any concrete plan. </span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Rules
               from the Wildlife Service that went into effect last year banned the 
              commercial import of ivory with the exception of hunting trophies, 
              though the agency website<a style="font-weight: bold;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fws.gov/international/travel-and-trade/ivory-ban-questions-and-answers.html"> </a>says that it expects more restrictions on those as well. </span></p>

              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Exceptions are also made for ivory that is part of a musical instrument. </span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>President Obama has called for a national ban that has yet to materialize, according to National Geographic.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Opponents
               include the National Rifle Association, which says a ban would be a 
              problem for antique gun sales and hunters who wanted to bring back ivory
               from expensive but legal elephant shoots in Africa.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>New York City is the largest port of entry for illegal
              wildlife goods in the United States, according to the New York
              Department of Environmental Conservation.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Organizers said
              they hoped staging the ivory-crushing event in busy Times Square
              would extend the reach of their message.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>'Today's ivory crush will serve as a stark reminder to the
              rest of the world that the United States will not tolerate
              wildlife crimes, especially against iconic and endangered
              animals,' said Sally Jewell, secretary of the US Department of
              the Interior.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>The government held a similar event in Denver at the end of 2013 in which six tons of ivory were crushed. </span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Residue of the crushed ivory will be used in a public education campaign by the Wildlife Service.</span></p>
