              <h2 class="synopsis">The motorcycle-ambulance is a
               new concept in India that is saving lives in remote regions where 
              people had been dying because they could not make it to the hospital on 
              time.</h2>
              <p>When eight months pregnant Sukmi’s water broke she was in Ongnarpal, a
               village deep in the jungle of Chhattisgarh where four wheelers cannot 
              reach and the hospital was miles away. However, help arrived in the form
               of a motorcycle ambulance and Sukmi made it to the hospital “just in 
              time” and delivered a beautiful baby girl.</p>
              <p>The motorcycle-ambulance is a new concept in India that is saving 
              lives in remote regions where people had been dying because they could 
              not make it to the hospital on time.</p>
              <p>Sukmi and her baby would not have survived had it not been for the 
              motorcycle -ambulance that was able to ferry her from her remote village
               and take her to the civil hospital in Narayanpur district.</p>
              <p>Her case is not exceptional. The motorcycle-ambulance has saved the 
              lives of over 200 pregnant women and helped see a drop in maternal and 
              infant mortality rate in the Maoist-hit Narayanpur district of Bastar 
              division in Chhattisgarh.</p>
              <p><img src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/07/image3_759.jpg" alt="" width="759" height="422"></p>
              <p>The ambulance, which had seen success in African countries, is a 
              modified four-stoke motorcycle fitted with a side-carriage customised 
              for the comfort of the patient.</p>
              <p>Given the maze-type forest terrain, which can perplex any outsider, 
              these two wheelers are driven by local riders only, who are trained to 
              provide basic necessary first aid.</p>
              <p>Health specialist at UNICEF, Ajay Trakroo says the 
              motorcycle-ambulance project was initiated last year and supported by 
              the UNICEF in collaboration with an NGO, Saathi Samaj Sevi Sanstha, and 
              the Health Department of the state government.</p>
              <p>“Pregnant women are our main focus in the area as mortality rate is 
              high in this conflict bound region of Chhattisgarh. With this experiment
               we are trying to provide necessary health care to the pregnant women of
               this Maoist-affected tribal and hard-to- reach forest area,” Trakroo 
              told IANS.</p>
              <p>He said the motorcycle ambulance’s USP is that it can be operated in 
              hard to reach areas. It is a referral ambulance, that means it only 
              ferries the patient to the hospital.</p>
              <p>As of now there is only one motorcycle-ambulance in the entire state 
              which serves the pregnant women and other serious patients in whole of 
              Bastar division.</p>
              <p>On expansion of the project, Trakroo said that ten more motorcycle ambulances will be deployed soon.</p>
              <p>“Though 108 ambulance services operate in Narayanpur, these cannot 
              reach deep into the forest or hilly terrain where many villages are 
              situated. This is where the motorcycle ambulance plays a vital role. We 
              will bring 10 more motorcycle ambulances in a few months,” Trakroo said.</p>
              <p>The National Institute of Technology (NIT), Raipur is working to 
              improve the design of the motorcycle ambulance to enhance efficiency.</p>
              <p>“We are focusing on increasing the power of the motorcycle and the 
              stability of the ambulance with help of NIT,” Trakroo added. The 
              ambulance costs Rs 1.7 lakh and Rs 15,000 per month is investment to 
              keep it running.</p>
              <p>Founding member of Saathi NGO, Bhupesh Tiwari says that before the 
              motorcycle ambulance was introduced cases of unorganised delivery were 
              high and mothers used to die often due to lack of proper treatment.</p>
              <p>He said that the motorcycle-ambulance has successfully ferried over 
              300 patients to the hospitals from “adverse areas”, of whom 80 per cent 
              are pregnant women.</p>
              <p>“After the inception of this project the number of organised 
              deliveries has increased in this conflict bound region. It will 
              certainly improve the infant as well as maternal mortality rate in the 
              region,” Tiwari told IANS.</p>
