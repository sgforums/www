              <p class="story-body-text story-content">CAIRO
               — The intricate mural took shape over the past few weeks, little 
              noticed at first, spreading across a harried quarter of Cairo where Egypt's garbage collectors live, amid overflowing bundles of this overcrowded city’s trash.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">By
               the time the painting was finished two weeks ago, it stretched across 
              more than 50 buildings, making it the largest public work of art here 
              anyone can recall. The mural, a circle of orange, white and blue in 
              Arabic calligraphy, quotes a third-century Coptic Christian bishop who 
              said, “If one wants to see the light of the sun, he must wipe his eyes.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">When
               the first photographs of the mural circulated, reactions ranged from 
              astonished delight to disbelief. Some people, struck by its seemingly 
              impossible scale, seemed convinced that the images had been digitally 
              altered, according to the man behind the project, a Tunisian-French 
              artist known as eL Seed.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">But
               what seemed most surprising was that eL Seed and several friends who 
              worked with him had been able to complete the project at all, without 
              being harassed or arrested.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Egypt’s
               highhanded government has shown little tolerance for artists, sending 
              agents to raid cultural centers and recently prosecuting a novelist on 
              charges that he had harmed public morality. Street artists who made the 
              city their canvas in the heady days after the Egypt's uprising in 2011 have lately been forced to work hastily or in secret, carrying out 
              projects “as you would a heist,” said Soraya Morayef, who has documented
               street art over the past five years on her blog.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/29/world/29GARBAGE2/29GARBAGE-1459115547149-articleLarge.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">But
               eL Seed chose a forsaken corner of the city, called Manshiyat Naser, 
              away from the gaze of officials, the kind of place where artists have 
              had more space to work, Ms. Morayef said.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The
               artist said he intended to change popular perceptions of the district, 
              too narrowly associated with squalor, and to celebrate decades of unsung
               work by its residents who sort and recycle tons of the city’s waste. He
               has painted large works of distinctive calligraphy in other countries 
              over the past few years, including in Brazil, France and Tunisia, but he
               said the experience in Egypt, and the reaction, were “overwhelming.”</p>
              <div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"></div>
              <p id="story-continues-1" class="story-body-text story-content">He
               chalked up the success of the project, which was entirely self-funded, 
              to his decision to work quietly, with the cooperation of residents, but 
              also to a visitor’s naïveté.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">That
               meant ignoring the arguments that seem to attend many public 
              expressions in a testy Egypt these days. “Sometimes when you come from 
              outside, you don’t see all the problems that might happen,” he said in 
              an interview. “I was trying not to look at the political situation, the 
              economic struggles, and just focus on the art project.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The
               praise came from the neighborhood, young anti-government activists and 
              other artists. A well-known Egyptian graffiti artist, Ammar Abo Bakr, writing on facebook called the mural “the first of its kind” in Egypt.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“Just
               imagine that our artists who sell their art for thousands of pounds 
              decide to contribute and suggested some solutions to beautify or enrich 
              Egypt’s facades,” he wrote.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content"><img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2016/03/28/garbagemap/534181f1f0b23ae9293ee47a47d683d71f42467f/0329-web-GARBAGEmap-460.png" alt="" width="920" height="512"></p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">More
               than 5,000 people shared a post of eL Seed’s mission statement on 
              Facebook, and there were hundreds of mostly positive comments that 
              suggested that he had accomplished his goals. “Beautiful and honest 
              words,” one woman in Egypt wrote. The garbage collectors, she added, 
              “deserve our gratitude.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Officials seemed taken by surprise. The Egyptian Embassy in Washington promoted the project<a href="https://twitter.com/EgyptEmbassyUSA/status/709799810979786752"></a> on its Twitter feed, and said it was “totally amazed.”</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">As
               eL Seed planned the mural over the past year, he was aided by a local 
              priest, the Rev. Samaan Ibrahim, who is considered a leader of the 
              mainly Coptic garbage collectors in the neighborhood. The priest’s 
              approval and participation in the project in turn brought residents on 
              board, eL Seed said.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">The
               neighborhood was established more than four decades ago, with its 
              striking location in the shadow of cliffs and fetid streets making it 
              the most recognizable of several settlements where the city’s garbage 
              collectors live.</p>
              <div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"></div>
              <p id="story-continues-2" class="story-body-text story-content">The
               neighborhood has also received frequent attention over the years from 
              international aid organizations and journalists, making it one of the 
              most prosperous settlements, said Gaétan du Roy, a Belgian researcher 
              who studies the religious lives of the collectors.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">But
               many of its residents are impoverished and continue to be regarded as 
              second-class citizens because of their association with the trash, he 
              said.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/29/world/29GARBAGE/29GARBAGE-articleLarge.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Their
               relations with the government have also been strained. Officials have 
              tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to replace the garbage collectors and 
              their extensive family networks with more modernized private companies. 
              In one of the most enduring shocks to the area, President Hosni Mubarak’s government, reacting to fears of a swine influnceza epidemic in 2009, decided to kill all of Eygpt's pigs<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/25/world/middleeast/25oink.html"></a>, including thousands kept by the garbage collectors, who used them to consume organic waste and who would also sell their meat.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">From
               the streets of the neighborhood, the painting appears in fragments: 
              above a courtyard where members of one family carefully search for 
              recycling in bags of trash, or looming over a rooftop occupied by a 
              handful of sheep. The bracing scale of the mural is fully visible only 
              from the Mokattam Hill on the edge of the district, near a famous 
              cathedral carved inside a cave.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Viewed
               from there, the colors interrupt the monotonous red brick facades 
              below, distinguishing these buildings from the thousands that have 
              sprung up across the city over decades, with little oversight, to 
              contain Cairo’s bursting population.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">In
               the days after the mural was completed, the residents of Manshiyat 
              Naser seemed not to focus too closely on its message: Many people had 
              yet to trek up the hill for a viewing, and few had any idea what the 
              calligraphy said.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">Instead,
               people seemed moved that eL Seed and his friends had bothered to travel
               to Cairo and immersed themselves in the neighborhood defying the 
              various calamities that have driven away many visitors to Egypt in the 
              past few years. The only complaint was that the artists had not painted 
              more of the houses.</p>
              <p class="story-body-text story-content">“They
               used to play with the kids here, and talk to the people,” said Boutros 
              Ghali, a 24-year-old shopkeeper who placed a photograph of himself with 
              one of the visitors, a young Algerian, on the wall of his store. “People
               loved them, and got used to them. And when they left, people were 
              upset.”</p>
