                                                  has a very important message for us. Water is telling us to take a much deeper 
                                                  look at our selves. When we do look at our selves through the mirror of water, 
                                                  the message becomes amazingly, crystal, clear. We know that human life is 
                                                  directly connected to the quality of our water, both within and all around 
                                                  us.<br><br>The photographs and information in this article reflect the work of 
                                                  Masaru Emoto, a creative and visionary Japanese researcher. Mr. Emoto has 
                                                  published an important book, "The Message from Water," from the findings of his 
                                                  worldwide research If you have any doubt that your thoughts affect everything 
                                                  in, and around you, the information and photographs that are presented here, 
                                                  taken from the book of his published results, will change your mind and 
                                                  profoundly alter your beliefs, .<br><br>From Mr. Emoto's work we are provided 
                                                  with factual evidence, that human vibrational energy, thoughts, words, ideas and 
                                                  music, affect the molecular structure of water, the very same water that 
                                                  comprises over seventy percent of a mature human body and covers the same amount 
                                                  of our planet. Water is the very source of all life on this planet, its quality 
                                                  and integrity are vitally important to all forms of life. The body is very much 
                                                  like a sponge and is composed of trillions of chambers called cells that hold 
                                                  liquid. The quality of our life is directly connected to the quality of our 
                                                  water.<br><br>Water is a very malleable substance. Its physical shape easily 
                                                  adapts to whatever environment is present. But its physical appearance is not 
                                                  the only thing that changes; its molecular shape also changes. The energy or 
                                                  vibrations of the environment will change the molecular shape of water. In this 
                                                  sense water not only has the ability to visually reflect the environment but it 
                                                  also molecularly reflects the environment.<br><br>Mr. Emoto has been visually 
                                                  documenting these molecular changes in water by means of his photographic 
                                                  techniques. He freezes droplets of water and then examines them under a dark 
                                                  field microscope that has photographic capabilities. His work clearly 
                                                  demonstrates the diversity of the molecular structure of water and the effect of 
                                                  the environment upon the structure of the water.<br><br>Snow has been falling on 
                                                  the earth for more than a few million years. Each snowflake, as we have been 
                                                  told, has a very unique shape and structure. By freezing water and taking a 
                                                  photograph of the structure, as Mr. Emoto has done, you get incredible 
                                                  information about the water.<br><br>Mr. Emoto has discovered many fascinating 
                                                  differences in the crystalline structures of water from many different sources 
                                                  and different conditions around the planet. Water from pristine mountain streams 
                                                  and springs show the beautifully formed geometric designs in their crystalline 
                                                  patterns. Polluted and toxic water from industrial and populated areas and 
                                                  stagnated water from water pipes and storage dams show definitively distorted 
                                                  and randomly formed crystalline structures.</span></span></p>

                                                  environmental conditions, pollution and music, Mr. Emoto and colleagues decided

                                                  every one of our thoughts and emotions. It is quite clear that water easily

                      Power of Words over Water </span></strong></p>
              <p>Aren't You Made Up Of Water?</p>
              <p>Yes! 72% of your body is made up of water. <br>Imagine how your words affect your own body.<br> <br>When you say, “I'm a failure,” or “I'm hopeless,” or “I won't get well,” imagine how these words weaken your health. <br><br>Make a choice to say the best words out there. <br>Say often, “I'm wonderful,” and “I'm beautiful,” and “I'm God's child,” and “God has a great plan for my life!” <br><br>It's not only water. <br>Dr. Emoto also experimented with cooked rice. <br>He placed one cup of cooked rice in two airtight jars. <br>On one jar, he wrote, “I love you,” and on the other, “You fool.”<br><br>Everyday for 30 days, Dr. Emoto would say these words to each jar of rice. <br>After 30 days, the “I love you” rice was still white. <br>But the“You fool” rice was so rotten, it was black. <br>How can you explain this?</p>

              <p>In the Science field, credibility is very important. The institute that replicate the experiment is also very important as it give peer scientists an idea how much trust should we give the PI from that institute. If NUS/NTU can able to replicate the experiment, then I believe.</p>
              <p>The results from small kids and household replication experiment aren't actually strong (credible) enough to be published in journals.</p>

              <p>Messages from water is highly possible. This is the answer i got directly from my own spiritual master, Sri Chinmoy. I can trust him because during his lifetime, he did many incredible things that are highly impossible for a human being to perform. Things like lifting elephants, airplanes, composing 22,000 spiritual songs, writing 1,585 books, and many others things.</p>

              <p>The mayan prophecized the end of time to be on 21 Dec 2012. In their ancient calendar 5,000 years ago, they drew a giant crocodile sprouting large amount of water that can flood the earth. This year happens to be the year of the water dragon. Coincidental?   Get ready for lots of water this year. </p>
              <p>Water is trying to tell us something: unless we change, we will be flooded and many will drown. The time for change has come. This time, it could just be the last chance. </p>

              <p>Most people first heard of Dr. Emoto in 2004 when the hit movie "What The Bleep Do We Know?" was released. In the documentary-style film, Dr. Emoto's findings on the energy of thoughts are demonstrated.</p>

              <p>Dr. Masaru Emoto is an internationally renowned researcher who has gained worldwide acclaim by showing how water is deeply connected to our individual and collective consciousness. His message is simple, profound, and far-reaching. His photographs can be seen in Messages from Water Vols. I, II, and III (over one million sold internationally in twenty languages) and in The Hidden Messages in Water (over 500,000 copies in print in eleven languages), The True Power of Water, and The Secret Life of Water.<br><br>Born in 1943 in Japan, Emoto is a graduate of the Yokohama Municipal University's Department of Humanities and Sciences with a focus on international relations. In 1992 he received certification from the Open International University as a Doctor of Alternative Medicine. Subsequently he was introduced to the concept of micro-cluster water in the United States. Thus began his quest to discover the mystery of water. Over time he realized that in its frozen crystal form, water shows us its true power.<br><br>In the March 2004 issue of The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine Emoto did an astonishing photo essay for special medicine based on his research. He is currently the head of I.H.M. General Research Institute Inc., the President of I.H.M. Inc., and the chief representative of I.H.M.'s HADO Fellowship.  Emoto conducts his research from Japan and holds seminars throughout the world. It was at his United Nations seminar in September 2003, that he fully comprehended the global water shortage. As a result of this experience, combined with the enactment of International Decade for Action, Emoto formed his own non-profit organization, “International Water for Life,” through which he will dedicate his water research to achieving world peace.</p>

              <p>.....joke aside, interesting article nonetheless. For mental health maybe, but to achieve world peace? Maybe not.. Take a leaf from company like Coca Cola, they've been buliding water fountain for large part of Africa, providing clean water for it's population. People in these countries need clean drinkable water urgently and care less about what power of thoughts can do to water.</p>

              <p>NeversayGoodbye, i think you missed the point. I can understand why you did. </p>
              <p>Think about it, the air we breathe is also water in gas form. We are made up of over 70% water. If the atomic s<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">tructures of these forms are distorted, i</span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">f millions upon millions of atoms in our enviroment are defective,  </span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">it will affect our thinking process. So we may become more demonic or humane, depending of the structures formed outside and inside of us. Also there will also be more new diseases. People who live near nature like in the mountains for example, when they come to the cities, they could feel something is wrong in the air. </span>This got to do with the vibration in our enviroment. Imagine people around you becoming demonic, what will happen to earth? There will be more wars and endless of suffering. </p>
              <p>Dr Emoto collected water from a lake in Japan, before and after a Buddhist chanting took placed, he saw the difference in the water crystals. And many times in other cities, water collected in troubled cities where a riot took places, or conflict happened, the results were very similar. The water crystals were very deformed.</p>
              <p>It goes to show that what we think and do can affect the vibrations in our environment. If you ever go to a quiet church or temple, you could sense a certain kind of peacefulness in the atmosphere, Why? Because people prayed, meditated and think of God or good thoughts. We create our world with our vibrations. If enough of bad vibrations gathered, somethng catastropic could happen. Either people will start doing more harm to people or some natural disaster will happen.</p>
              <p>This is the message from water. </p>

              <h1>Everything is Energy - Everything is Vibrating</h1>
              <p class="by-line"><em> By				<a title="EzineArticles Expert Author Robyn Bentley" rel="author" href="/?expert=Robyn_Bentley"> Robyn Bentley </a></em></p>
              <p>Quantum physics tells us that nothing is actually solid. Everything is  energy. Everything is vibrating. And everything on earth is influenced by it.  Plants grow better when exposed to certain musical vibrations. Sound vibrations  affect the form of molecules. Words, thoughts and music affect the molecular  structure of water. The unique molecular vibrational frequency of a chemical  works like the actual chemical. The human body has a biofield of energy running  through and around it affecting mental and physical health. Here are a few  examples of these vibrational influences.</p>
              <p><strong>Musical Vibrations Affect The Growth of Plants</strong></p>
              <p>Music affects plants. They grow better when exposed to classical and jazz  music than hard rock music. When plants don't like the music they are being  exposed to, they actually bend away from the speakers the music is coming from.  When they like the music, they bend toward the speakers. In an experiment,  plants leaned away from Jimi Hendrix, Vanilla Fudge, and Led Zeppelin music.  However, when string versions of songs by these artists were played, the plants  leaned toward the speakers.</p>
              <p><strong>Sound Vibrations Affect Molecular Form</strong></p>
              <p>A simple Cymatics experiment can be done by sprinkling sand on a metal plate  and vibrating the plate with sound. The sand will then form itself into  patterns. The higher the frequency, the more complex the shapes produced.</p>
              <p><strong>Thoughts, Words And Music Affect the Molecular Structure of Water</strong></p>
              <p>Masaru Emoto used different words (I hate you, love and appreciation) and the  names of some deceased people (Adolph Hitler, Mother Teresa) typed them onto  paper, taped them on glass bottles filled with water and let them sit overnight.  He also placed water between speakers for several hours and played different  kids of music (Bach, heavy metal). Emoto froze droplets of the water and  examined them under a microscope and photographed them. He found that positive  words and classical music created white crystals in beautiful shapes. Negative  words and heavy metal music created brown crystals in unappealing shapes.</p>
              <p><strong>The Vibrational Frequency of Medicine Works Like Medicine</strong></p>
              <p>Fritz Popp, a German biophysics researcher used the vibrational frequency of  vasodilator chemicals (histamine and acetylcholine) to produce increased blood  flow in the coronary arteries of a guinea pig's heart. Then he applied the  opposite chemicals (atropine and mepyramine) which inhibited blood flow. He did  not use the actual chemical, but the vibration of the chemical in the form of  low frequency waves ( less than 20 Khz). The signal could take the place of the  chemical because the signal is the signature of the molecule of the chemical.  Popp believed that each molecule in the universe has a unique frequency and the  language it uses to speak to the world is a resonating wave. We can swallow  chemicals to expose ourselves to the specific resonating wave of a chemical or  we can vibrationally expose ourselves and the "vibe" of the medicine works like  the medicine.</p>
              <p><strong>Imbalance in the Human Biofield Creates Illness in the Body</strong></p>
              <p>You may have heard the term "aura". Biophysics uses the term "biofield". It  is the subtle energy systems running through and around the human body.  Practitioners of energy medicine believe that illness results from disturbances  of these subtle energies. The biofield or aura can be photographed using Kirlian  photography. Acupuncture is used to balance the energy running through the  meridians of the body. Reiki is used to balance the seven chakra energy centers  of the body.</p>
              <p><strong>Meridians</strong></p>
              <p>The meridians are channels of energy that can be compared to the body's  circulatory system. Just like veins carry blood, meridians are the pathways of  chi flowing through the body. A break in the flow of chi creates an imbalance  resulting in a physical or emotional health problem. Acupuncture helps keep the  chi in balance to help the body be healthier.</p>
              <p><strong>Chakras</strong></p>
              <p>The chakras are seven energy centers in the human body. They each vibrate a  different energy and color. If a Chakra becomes blocked, certain physical or  emotional problems can develop. Keeping the chakras balanced and clear helps  keep a person healthy in body, mind and spirit. Reiki is used to balance the  energy centers.</p>
              <p><strong>Positive And Negative Energies Inside Buildings</strong></p>
              <p>Every building has both positive and negative energies. These energies form  in patterns when a building is constructed. In every building there are nine  different energy patterns. One in each of the eight compass sections and the  center. These positive and negative energies can have an impact on the occupants  of a building. Classical feng shui calls the energies that make up the energy  patterns "flying stars".</p>
              <p><strong>Where attention goes... energy flows. </strong></p>
              <p>What we give our attention to, we give our energy to. You can see what  "giving your energy to something" looks like simply by dangling a necklace from  your hand and making it move with your mind. In feng shui, energy is called chi.  Chi flows through our homes, our bodies, and everything in the universe. We can  focus the chi of our body with our mind.</p>
              <p>Everything is energy. Everything is vibrating. And everything on earth is  influenced by it. That means you.</p>
