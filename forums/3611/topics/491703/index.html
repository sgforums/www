              <p>Just 2.8% of milk in Britain are delivered to the door, but the milkmen 
              who keep the cherished tradition alive say they are here to stay</p>
              <p><img src="http://saudigazette.com.sa/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/brit.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="450"></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">ST ALBANS, United Kingdom – </span><span class="s1">Once
               a daily sight on every British street, a dwindling but resilient band 
              of milkmen still go out at the crack of dawn to deliver bottles of fresh
               milk to the nation's doorsteps.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The overwhelming majority of milk used to
               be sold at the front door until the supermarket revolution all but 
              wiped out this very British institution.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">But by selling more than milk and 
              embracing the Internet, the few thousand remaining milkmen, including 
              Neil Garner, have breathed new life into the cherished tradition.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">"It has given us a big boost and brought 
              us into the 21st century. The future's looking bright," said Garner, the
               customer-nominated Milkman of the Year at Milk &amp; More, the 
              country's biggest doorstep delivery firm.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The 57-year-old has driven his milk float
               – an electrified, open-sided delivery van – through towns and villages 
              in the dead of night since 1994, placing glass pint (half-liter) bottles
               of milk on the doorstep ready for when customers wake for their morning
               cereal and cups of tea.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">"Nowadays, you don't do as many houses in each street. But we sell a lot of other stuff to the people we do have," he told AFP.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">It's not just breakfast staples like tea bags, bread, butter, eggs, and bacon that Garner now has on the back of his float.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jam, cranberry juice, pet food, potatoes,
               and toilet roll are all available. Even bird seed and compost can be 
              dropped off on the round.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.C7JNiLYqmnG01fkJTPHbw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAwO2lsPXBsYW5l/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/e128f0ce6f095f0665d4895e35a284bd30dc10a9.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="532"></p>
              <p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Supermarket boom</span></strong></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1980, 89% of all the milk bought in Britain was delivered to the door, according to trade association Dairy UK.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">That figure plunged to 30% during the 1990s out-of-town supermarket boom.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2015, just 2.8% of milk still went to 
              the door, a total of 154 million liters, with 5,000 milkmen and women 
              delivering to around 2.5 million homes.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Garner's round sees him deliver 6 days a week to St Albans, a small commuter city northwest of London.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the depot in nearby Watford, milkmen 
              load up crates, containing 20 one-pint bottles each, before heading into
               the cold at around 2 am.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The blue, green, red, gold, and orange foil bottle tops mark different types of milk.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Garner's no-frills electric milk float is
               slow and exposed to the elements, but the brisk walker likes the ease 
              of hopping on and off for his 200 to 250 deliveries.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">"Snow, ice, floods, in 22 years I've never not been out due to the weather," the 57-year-old said.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The early drops are in pitch darkness, Garner needing a torch to find his way up the garden paths.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">"This is the best part of the day. The air's fresh and clean, there's no traffic," he said.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The round takes Garner down tiny country 
              lanes; along suburban avenues; up narrow streets of cottages and inside 
              blocks of flats. He delivers to industrial estates, schools, and even a 
              garden shed.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some customers leave rolled-up notes with
               instructions such as "no milk today" or "one extra pint, please," but 
              most now go online.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">"That's the way ahead," said Garner. "Online facilities have attracted younger people.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">A pint of milk, typically 50 pence ($0.70, 65 euro cents) at a supermarket, costs 81 pence.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">"There's nothing else you can order online at 9 pm and get delivered in a couple of hours," Garner added.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Customers can also phone in orders via a Philippines call center.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><img src="http://assets.rappler.com/0764FBE4D0864232ADA6FD397C1FE29A/img/DDC60E626BD24E78B9C6C2318A2EDF97/20160331-britain-milkmen-2.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Pillar of community</span></strong></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">"The secret is being punctual. People like to know their milk will be there at the same time every morning," said Garner.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">He relies on the few other people around to check his timing, including a man he sees getting on his bicycle each morning.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">"Am I early?" Garner asks.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">"One minute early!" the cyclist replies before setting off.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The last delivery is done at 7:30 am, before Garner returns through rush-hour traffic to unload his empties at the depot.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Garner reckons milkmen are a special breed.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">"The milkman is respected. People look upon you as a friend," he said.</span></p>
              <p class="p1"><span class="s1">"A lot of the elderly like a chat and I 
              do things like change lightbulbs for them. Quite often I might be the 
              only person they see all week.</span></p>
              <p><span class="s1">"It's part of this country's traditions and people don't want to lose it." </span><strong></strong></p>
