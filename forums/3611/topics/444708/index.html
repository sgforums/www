              <p>Sydney man Kristian Anderson, made famous by a Youtube tribute to his wife after he was diagnosed with terminal bowel cancer, has died.</p>
              <p>His wife Rachael confirmed Mr Anderson died just after 8am (AEST) on Monday at Manly Hospital.</p>
              <p>"My darling husband went to meet Jesus this morning. It was peaceful and beautiful. Funeral details to come soon," she posted on his Twitter account.</p>
              <p>The 36-year-old from Curl Curl had been having chemotherapy since he was diagnosed with cancer in October 2009.</p>
              <p>His touching Youtube clip was made as a birthday present for his wife and as a thank you for her support.</p>
              <p>It featured an introduction by New Zealand Prime Minster John Key, because Rachel is a Kiwi. Movie star Hugh Jackman also appeared in the video after Mr Anderson asked Triple M presenter Gus Worland for assistance.</p>
              <p>The clip had Mr Anderson holding up placards with words of love and support for his wife against the song Marry Me, by Train. The clip has been viewed more than 65,000 times and even US talkshow queen Oprah Winfrey became a fan.</p>
              <p>Winfrey gave the couple $250,000 for medical expenses when she hosted an episode of her show at the Sydney Opera House in January last year.</p>
              <p>In his last interview, Mr Anderson told the Daily Telegraph of his love for his wife and their sons Cody, 5, and Jakob, 3.</p>

              <p>"I’m not afraid of dying but I am afraid of leaving them behind," he said in early December.</p>
              <p>In his last entry on his blog How the light gets in, posted by his wife after his death, Mr Anderson reflected on his battle with cancer.</p>
              <p>"The truth being we’re all broken, we’re all cracked and what so many people see as a fault or a malfunction really is something to be considered useful," he wrote.</p>
              <p>"I’m not sure how much longer I have left but it appears that the physical and medical signs are all pointing to my end.</p>
              <p>"Thank you for journeying with me this far. I pray you find the same peace I have."</p>
              <p>Bowel Cancer Australia spokesman associate professor Graham Newstead said Mr Anderson’s battle with bowel cancer touched tens of thousands of people.</p>
              <p>"Like many people who in some way shared this young man’s journey, those involved with Bowel Cancer Australia are saddened by the death of Kristian Anderson," professor Newstead said in a statement.</p>
              <p>"We are however also very grateful to him for his brave and valuable work in raising awareness about bowel cancer."</p>
              <p>The disease kills about 4,000 Australians each year.</p>

              <p>Such is the suffering for the bondages to life. I chose to live free so that when it's time to go, no one needs to suffer. In this way, I freed others from suffering after me. </p>
              <p>Many lived a life with families because that is how people know how to live. Some lucky ones survived a long life without mishap, who others suffer prolonged period when one partner has to go. </p>
              <p>Many don't know that there is, in fact, a life, free from leaving behind others to suffer: A life dedicated to God. It is by far, the most freed life I ever known. Free from letting others suffer, and free from letting myself suffer over others. A spiritual life is a life dedicated to God. (This has got nothing to do with the church.)</p>
              <p>I felt it to be a very advanced form of living. Very few people could do it because it requires self control. But for those who could, it's a life of inner peace, joy, meditation and deep purpose. Many ladies who chose this form of living found a great freedom from the usual life of being a mother, wife, career lady all rolled up into one long suffering life. Same goes to man. Worse when the husband is bad or dead later, as in the case above.</p>
              <p>It will be a long time before most of humanity are ready for such a lifestyle, but for those who live it, it's a good life for us.</p>
