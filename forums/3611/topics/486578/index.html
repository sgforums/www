              <p>A marigold and magenta mohawk adorning his shaven skull, Chinese punk
               rocker Shan Lin has a subversive message in a country that suppresses 
              dissent -- a rebel with a cause.</p>
              <p>"The more anarchists the better, the more chaos and the more we love 
              that! This country is so screwed up! There's a reason our band is called
               The Demonstrators," said the 30-year-old, before taking the stage at a 
              punk festival in Beijing.</p>
              <p>A T-shirt sold by the group SMZB set the tone for the event: the 
              design showed one of the columns that line Tiananmen Square, the 
              symbolic heart of Beijing and Chinese state power, emblazoned with the 
              words "Chinese dream" -- President Xi Jinping's catchphrase -- and a 
              pile of skulls at its base.</p>
              <p>The crowd, a few hundred strong, made for an eclectic scene: brightly
               dyed hairstyles mixed with more conservatively dressed students in the 
              heart of 798, an industrial estate converted into a trendy art district.</p>
              <p>Bouncing up and down, they pogoed together in a smoky mosh pit as 
              Shan's voice rose ever higher and he head-banged to a wall of screaming 
              guitars.</p>
              <p>It was a frenzied contrast to the sugary pop and bland rock that dominate China's musical landscape.</p>
              <p>"Protest is the spirit of punk. We're talking about what we live 
              every day," said Lei Jun, a chubby singer in his 30s whose head is 
              shaved and his arms striped with tattoos.</p>
              <p>One of the festival organisers, he wore a dark T-shirt emblazoned with a three-word English obscenity involving the police.</p>
              <p>- 'Disenchanted youth' -</p>
              <p>Sex Pistol posters hang above the till in Lei's little noodle 
              restaurant in a narrow alley in old Beijing, but mainland China has a 
              very different political system to Hong Kong, where major demonstrations
               have taken place in recent days. The country's punks know that they 
              cannot be as openly outrageous as Sid Vicious.</p>
              <p>Some sing in broken English to express their most anti-establishment views.</p>
              <p>The Chinese punk bands may have copied the style of the original British
               punk scene, but their songs have distinctly local themes:  "They come 
              from forced evictions, unemployed youths killing themselves, the fact 
              there is no future, an education system that turns young people into 
              worker robots, the way money rules," said Lei Jun.</p>
              <p>Twenty years later the themes have changed little, but there are 
              still only an estimated 50-odd punk groups in China, and their audience 
              is limited by censorship and lack of media access.</p>
              <p>But Amar said their small crowds gave them a certain freedom.</p>
              <p>"The authorities seem to have decided that looking to ban them would just raise their profile," he said.</p>
              <p>In the event, the Beijing festival only had a brief visit from the authorities.</p>
              <p>- 'Sensible' -</p>
              <p>But there are other limits too. The vast majority of punk musicians 
              have ordinary day jobs: Shan, of The Demonstrators, is a construction 
              worker, and his guitarist smoothes down his hair when he goes back to 
              work at an estate agency.</p>
              <p>"It's
               hard to have a real punk way of life. We have to earn a living, and 
              with the way the Chinese judge by appearances all the time, it's hard to
               maintain a punk look," lamented Lei Jun -- whose festival was sponsored
               by footwear brand Doc Martens.</p>
              <p>Around 30 percent of the crowd were "committed fans who follow the 
              punk ethic", he said, while "70 percent just come to hear the bands and 
              to slum it a bit before going home: one-day or one-week punks".</p>
              <p>Ren Kai, lead singer for the group Fire 6, worries about losing 
              "authentic" fans to the wave of "egocentric entertainment where young 
              people just navel gaze".</p>
              <p>But most of their fans "live in the margins", he said. "There are no 
              second-generation rich kids in this room," he added, referring to the 
              descendants of China's new wealthy elite.</p>
              <p>Wang Yuxin, 24, discovered punk a year ago and it was a revelation: 
              "The pressure at home was too strong for too long and it oppressed me.</p>
              <p>"When I come to this kind of concert I feel free and unbound, I feel 
              alive again," she said, wearing leather boots and her hair in spikes.</p>
              <p>Even so, things change afterwards, she admitted.</p>
              <p>"When I go back home, I become well-behaved again. I'm a very sensible little girl."</p>
