              <p>Chinese news agency Xinhua report 
               of a new building in Suzhou that is nearing completion. The 74-story 
              Gate to the East was designed to look like an arch, but unfortunately, 
              in the eyes of many it appears as a giant pair of trousers.</p>
              <p>The
               developer of the landmark building has recently come under much 
              criticism for the unconventional look. One user on China's blogging 
              website Weibo reportedly said, “This should be called the Pants of the 
              East, not the Gate of the East”.</p>
              <p>The 278-meter-high Gate was 
              developed by the private firm Suzhou Chianing Real Estate Co., Ltd to 
              accommodate offices, hotels, malls and apartments.</p>
              <p>Xu Kang, the company's vice executive of sales, defended the design, 
              saying the linked-twin-tower structure is based on classic garden gates 
              and ancient city gates in China.</p>
              <p>Suzhou's Gate is not the first 
              unfortunate piece of architecture in this world. Here are some buildings
               that were supposed to look magnificent, but turned out to be something 
              embarrassing instead.</p>

              <h3>Doha 9 High Rise Office Tower, Qatar</h3>
              <p>Designed by French 
              architect Jean Nouvel, the 231 meter tall building located between the 
              north side of Doha Bay and the new city centre was heavily criticized in
               2007 when the building was first proposed. An artist impression that 
              appeared back then appeared to look like a huge shining sex toy.</p>
              <p>The
               completed building looks beautiful and was also named the best tall 
              building in the Middle East and Africa. But the early views have stuck 
              making it impossible to see the building as anything else.</p>

              <h3>Velo Towers in Seoul</h3>
              <p>Velo Towers designed by New York-based
               Asymptote Architecture has been compared to both a toilet-roll holder 
              and a cam shaft. The 153 meters tall twin towers is currently shaping up
               in Seoul, South Korea.</p>
              <p>The two towers are connected by a 
              skybridge which is suspended 30 storeys above ground level, providing 
              the residents of both structures with fitness and recreation centres, 
              communal lounges, pools, spas and eateries, as well as a landscaped sky 
              garden. A raised plinth at ground level also offers communal facilities 
              in a light-filled atrium.</p>

              <h3>The Cloud, South Korea</h3>
              <p>Dutch architecture firm MVRDV 
              proposed a design for two high-rises in Korea that reminds people of the
               World Trade Center twin towers exploding on 9/11.  A mockup shows two 
              soaring skyscrapers connected in the middle by a “pixelated cloud” that 
              evoked the clouds of debris that erupted from the iconic World Trade 
              Center towers after terrorists flew planes into them.</p>
              <p>The luxury
               residential towers have been named ‘The Cloud’, with one reaching 260 
              metres or 54 floors and the other covering 60 floors over 300 metres. 
              The total surface area is 128,000 sq metres. The ‘cloud' is housed in a 
              10-floor tall structure positioned halfway up the structures, and the 
              towers feature a fitness studio, pools, restaurants, cafes and a 
              conference centre.</p>

              <h3>Asahi Beer Headquarters</h3>
              <p>Asahi Beer Headquarters located on 
              the east bank of the Sumida River in Sumida, Tokyo, Japan is considered 
              one of Tokyo's most recognizable modern structures. There are two main 
              buildings, the biggest building standing 100 meters tall resembles a 
              giant beer jug complete with a foam shaped white roof. The shorter 
              building is known as the Super Dry Hall. It is a black building in the 
              shape of a beer glass, with an enormous golden flame shaped object 
              perched on top.</p>
              <p>The golden structure at the top is said to 
              represent both the 'burning heart of Asahi beer' and a frothy head, but 
              the the structure is often colloquially referred to as "the golden turd"
               and the Asahi Beer Hall itself as "poo building". Some people even see 
              the flame’s similarity to the human sperm.</p>
