              <h2 class="large centered">And the girls go crazy for me</h2>
              <p class="large centered"><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01468/SNN1121HA_532_1468227a.jpg" alt="" width="532" height="720"></p>
              <p class="large centered">HE has a rare condition that makes him the world's hairiest man — but at least it keeps the wolf from the door.</p>
              <p>After being gawped at all his life and starring in a circus freak show, Larry Gomez is making his fortune in Hollywood.</p>
              <p>He has appeared in a hit movie and a pilot for his own TV reality show.</p>
              <p>And The Wolfman, as he is known to pals and fans, is enjoying fame — bedding dozens of women desperate to run their fingers through his fur.</p>
              <p>Larry, 35 — whose whole body and face is covered in thick black hair — said last night: "When women first see it they don't believe it.</p>
              <p>"Then all they want to do is just touch it. How many girlfriends have I had? At least 35. Women expect me to be more of a man, stronger, because of the hair. I do all right with the ladies. I've even had a few stalkers."</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01468/SNN1121HC_532_1468231a.jpg" alt="" width="532" height="356"></p>
              <p>Larry, 35, suffers from the extremely rare genetic condition hypertrichosis, or Werewolf Syndrome. Only 50 people since the Middle Ages are known to have suffered from it to such an extent — 15 of those are in his family.</p>
              <p>He explained: "Every two weeks I trim my face with clippers. It grows all over my face, even on the eyelids. I have more on my arms than my legs.</p>
              <p>"My brother and sister both have the condition. And some of my cousins. It's harder for my sister Jamie Maria. She's only 20. You have to be very strong to look like this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"There's a guy in China — but he's not as hairy as me. He challenged me to a 'hair off'. He doesn't stand a chance!"</p>
              <p>But Larry hasn't always been so confident. He added: "As a child it was very upsetting being called Wolfboy.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.whatsonxiamen.com/news_images/2206fbe4455912751ca1f866_Larry-Gomez_3.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"But now I love it. I realised this was how I could make something of myself."</p>
              <p>Larry was born Gabriel Ramos Gomez in Mexico but took his new name from a 1941 horror film The Wolf Man, in which the main hair-covered character was called Larry Talbot. As a youngster he and his brother Danny, 33, joined the circus and were known as the Wolfboys. Larry married and had a son Michael, now ten, who does not have the condition.</p>
              <p>But in 2007 he split from wife Nadine and moved to LA to seek fame in films.</p>
              <p>He featured in the hit movie Water for Elephants alongside Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson last year. And he has filmed a pilot for a reality show called Wolfboy: Divorced and Looking For Love.</p>
              <p>Larry grinned and said: "I get lots of strange looks walking down the street. But I am happy with how I look.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"Besides a lot of people like it — especially the ladies!"</em></p>
