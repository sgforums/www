              <p>(Nigeria)</p>
              <p class="first">A Danish aid worker who rescued a young boy abandoned 
              in Nigeria has celebrated the boy's first week at school on the 
              anniversary of his rescue.</p>

              </div>
              <p>The two-year-old boy was ostracised and left to die in the streets last year because his family believed he was a "witch".</p>
              <p>After hearing about the boy left on his own, Anja Ringgren Loven launched a rescue mission to find him last January.</p>
              <p>Photographs of the little boy, known as Hope, were shared around the world after Ms Loven uploaded them to her Facebook page.</p>
              <p>Hope was in ill-health and required an operation a few months after he was found.</p>
              <p>But
               a year on, Hope is now attending school and, from a series of Facebook 
              post shared last week, appears to be happy, healthy and surrounded by 
              loving friends and family.</p>
              <p>In an update on her Facebook page earlier last month, Ms Loven wrote that Hope was "growing with speed".</p>
              <p>"He
               is such a handsome, healthy and very happy young boy because of the 
              tremendous love and care he receive[s] everyday from our staff and all 
              our children," it read.</p>
              <p>Ms Loven, the co-founder of the African 
              Children's Aid Education and Development Foundation (ACAEDF), told the 
              Huffington Post last year that it was a common practice in some Nigerian
               communities to shun children accused of witchcraft.</p>
              <p>"Being 
              rejected by your own family must be the loneliest feeling a child can 
              experience, and I don't believe that anyone can imagine how that must 
              feel like," she said.</p>
              <p>The charity is specifically dedicated to 
              rescuing children who have been abandoned or tortured and ensuring that 
              they have the opportunity to go to school.</p>
              <p>"The children receive 
              plenty of care, medical treatment, food/lodging and schooling, which 
              combined to make children strong and independent citizens,"  the 
              organisation's Facebook page states.</p>
              <p>Ms Loven was also named the 
              "most inspiring person of the year" in 2016 by Germany's OOOM Magazine, 
              beating out former US president Barack Obama — who came in second — to 
              secure the top spot.</p>
