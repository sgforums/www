              <p>The Lantern Festival is one of Taiwan’s tourism highlights and takes 
              place annually during Chinese New Year. It is consistently listed in 
              travel guides as a “must see” for international travelers around the 
              globe. Although there is only a short window of opportunity to take in 
              the festival, and there are guaranteed to be crowds, the night sky 
              illuminated with countless floating lanterns is an enchanting sight that
               is rarely viewed elsewhere in the world.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.escape2taiwan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Pingxi_Lantern_Festival.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667"></p>
              <p>The major lantern festival sponsored by the national government is 
              referred to as Taiwan Lantern Festival, and takes place in a different 
              geographical location each year. It therefore requires some advanced 
              trip planning, which may not work into every traveler’s schedule. 
              However, the Pingxi Sky Lantern Festival (å¹³æºªå¤©ç‡ˆ) is held in the same 
              location (Pingxi, just outside Taipei) and on similar lunar calendar 
              dates every year, making trip planning slightly easier. The history of 
              the sky lantern in Pingxi goes back over a hundred years, as it was used
               as a method for sending one’s wishes up to God (or one’s ancestors in 
              heaven).</p>
              <p>The festival however, where thousands of lanterns and personal wishes 
              are released into the sky simultaneously, only began a couple decades 
              ago. The festival’s majestic beauty and convenient access from the 
              Taipei metropolis has seen the event rapidly grow in popularity, and has
               attracted the attention of major international media outlets. The 
              festival made it onto National Geographic’s 10 Best Winter Trips list. 
              The Discovery Channel has named it the second largest nighttime festival
               in the world. CNN Travel named it one of the top things to do in 2013, 
              and Fodor’s Travel Guides named it one of the 14 festivals a person must
               see in their lifetime.</p>

              <p>Pinxi is the only place in Taiwan where sky lanterns can be released 
              legally, as it has been deemed a safe location due to its location high 
              in the mountains, its significant annual rainfall, and high humidity 
              level. Festival viewers will be glad to know that it is also one of the 
              places with the lowest amounts of light pollution in Taiwan due to the 
              low population density, which means the lanterns appear all the more 
              beautiful and distinct in the sky.</p>

              <p>The lantern festival is held to celebrate the first full moon of Chinese
               New Year, which is the 15th day of the first month in the lunar 
              calendar (not to be confused with the western calendar), and is when the
               main celebrations occur. However, the Pingxi Sky Lantern Festival 
              events are now held in three slightly different locations within Pingxi 
              over three dates during the new year’s period. This is also the last 
              official day of the Chinese New Year period</p>
              <p>To participate in the official sky lantern launching, advance 
              registration is usually required, but if you are prepared with your own 
              lantern and a few spots open up towards the end of the festival, 
              organizers will generally let you sneak into the back and participate in
               the official launching. Even if spots do not open up, you are free to 
              release your own lantern after the official launching has finished, or 
              from different areas of Pingxi around the official grounds.</p>
              <p>There will be plenty of tents selling lantern kits, so you don’t need to bring anything to the festival grounds.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.escape2taiwan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Pingxi_Lantern_Festival10.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667"></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.escape2taiwan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Pingxi_Lantern_Festival9.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667"></p>
              <p>The lantern kit will include a paper lantern and gold paper soaked in 
              kerosene. One must first write their New Year’s wish on the outside of 
              the lantern (pens provided at the tents selling the lantern kits) and 
              then carry the lantern to the launching site. To prepare for launch, 
              first unfold the paper lantern, attache the kerosene soaked gold paper 
              inside the lantern, then light the four corners of the gold paper. Hold 
              the lantern down on the ground and allow it to fill with hot air. Once 
              the lantern is filled full of hot air, release the lantern and watch 
              your wishes float up towards the heavens.</p>
