              <p>Sydney's troubled lose their angel as Don Ritchie dies at 85</p>
              <p><img src="http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2011/01/25/1225994/439465-don-ritchie-australian-local-hero.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>SYDNEY'S troubled have lost their angel. </strong></p>
              <p>Don Ritchie, 85, spent five decades watching out the window of his Old South Head Rd home for the next person he could coax away from the edge of the Gap with a smile and a kind word.</p>
              <p>Officially, he saved 160 lives, his family estimate the figure is closer to 400-500.</p>
              <p>After a life devoted to showing strangers light in their darkest moments, Mr Ritchie died this week.</p>
              <p>His family yesterday remembered one survivor leaving a painting of an angel and rays of sun with a message: "an angel who walks amongst us. Bless you.''</p>
              <p>Local MP Malcolm Turnbull led official tributes, calling Mr Ritchie "one of our greatest Australians.''</p>
              <p>A devoted husband, father and grandfather, Mr Ritchie was a decorated war veteran and served on HMAS Hobart in the Pacific during World War II and was in Tokyo Bay when the surrender of Japan was signed.</p>
              <p>His daughter Sue Ritchie Bereny recalled yesterday how her father constantly watched the ocean while always scanning the cliffs for people in trouble.</p>
              <p>"He loved to look out at the view and look at the ships, he would often notice people in the landscape, he just had a sensitively, he could read some people needed help,'' she said yesterday.</p>
              <p>"He would take the dog for a walk and just quietly check things out. It was often a matter of a kind word and he would bring people back to our place for a cup of tea and breakfast.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes people would locate him quite some time after, 10 and 20 years...sometimes not at all.''</p>
              <p>One rescue, captured on the front page of the Sydney Sun 40 years ago won Mr Ritchie a bravery award.</p>
              <p>Mr Turnbull described Mr Ritchie as the 'Gap angel.'</p>
              <p>"His work lives on forever not just in the lives of those he saved but in his heroism and example of public service,'' he said.</p>
              <p>Last year Mr Ritchie was named Australian local hero of the year.</p>
              <p>In a message posted on the Australian of the Year website in January, Mr Ritchie paid tribute to those he had helped.</p>
              <p>"I'm 85 and even at my age it has broadened my horizons with all the wonderful people I have met,'' he said.</p>
              <p>"I've had welcome feedback from people who have come back from the edge. It's really rewarding knowing that the action I took changed the course of their lives and got them back on track.</p>
              <p>"I've been pleased to share my story in order to help everyone realise just how common depression and suicide tendencies are. And its important for troubled people to know that there are complete strangers out there, like myself, who are willing and able to help them get through that dark time and to come out on the other side.''</p>
              <p>The award prompted people battling depression to write to him. Ms Ritchie Bereny said he replied to every letter.</p>
              <p>Mr Ritchie and his wife Moya would have celebrated 60 years of marriage this year.</p>
              <p>The couple had three daughters, Ms Ritchie Bereny, Jan Quinlan, Donna Brown and five grandchildren, Barney, Annabel, Sigrid, Cleo and Maximilian.</p>
