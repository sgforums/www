              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>(USA) A terminally ill veteran had a special request as he lay in his hospital bed Saturday.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Roberto Gonzalez told his family there were two friends in particular that he longed to see one last time - his beloved horses.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Gonzalez was paralyzed after he was shot two months into serving in Vietnam, on May 21 1970 and later worked as a horse trainer</span></p>

              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>The Texas 
              resident was one of San Antonio VA Hospital's first patients when it 
              opened in 1974, according to a Facebook post by South Texas Veterans 
              Health Care System. </span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Despite
               his life-changing injury, Gonzalez worked for most of his life as a 
              horse trainer in his hometown of Premont, Texas, and dearly loved the 
              animals he spent time with.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>His family were happy to oblige and brought the animals 150 miles to be by his bedside.  </span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>Heartbreaking
               photos show Gonzalez, who is bedridden, wheeled outside to greet the 
              pair of horses named Ringo and Sugar, Saturday.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>The horses immediately recognized him and are seen nuzzling him gently, as he reached out to stroke them. </span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>A
               spinal injury patient, Gonzalez has been hospitalized over the last ten
               months battling a series of infections, but this touching moment was 
              one that lifted his spirits, as well as family's.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>His wife Rosario told KPNX: 'Horses are his life. We've been training and raising horses for over 30, 40 years.'</span></p>

              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Wife Rosario Gonzalez (second from left) said that while the stay has 
              been hard on him and the family, Saturday's visit is one that she'll 
              never forget</span></p>
              <div style="overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;"><br>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>She added that her husband was one of the only handicapped or paralyzed licensed horse trainers in Texas.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>But, she said, Gonzalez never let his injuries slow him down.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>She told KSAT: 'He loved horses, he loved cattle, he loved ranching and farming. He was proud to serve his country.'</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>The
               devoted wife said that even though he is unable to speak she could see 
              the emotion on her husband's face when he saw the horses.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>The moment the horses came up to him, he opened his eyes, she said, and were 'kissing him' on the face.  </span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>She added that while the stay has been hard on him and the family, Saturday's visit is one that she'll never forget.</span></p>
              <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span>She
               said: '[The doctors] are not very optimistic. But we never give up 
              hope. We have faith, so we put everything in God's hands.' </span></p>
