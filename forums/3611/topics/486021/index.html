              <p><strong><strong class="location">CHATTAH: </strong>He may be more than a century old, but Hafeezullah still goes to work every day.</strong></p>
              <p>With the aid of a cane, the wizened white-bearded centenarian tends 
                  to his fields in Pakistan’s hauntingly beautiful Neelum Valley, just as 
                  he did when Britain still ruled this part of the world.</p>
              <p>Pakistan was recently named by the United Nations as one of the worst
                   countries in the world to be for an old person in a report that cited 
                  insecurity and lack of freedom for those over 60.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i1.tribune.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Untitled-1-copy.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>But a dozen or so centenarians like Hafeezulah living in a remote 
                  region of Kashmir are bucking that trend, putting their longevity down 
                  to their simple mountain lifestyle.</p>
              <p>Situated in the Lower Himalayan Range, Neelum Valley is formed by a 
                  200 kilometre long river and is home to some of the most spectacular 
                  scenery on the planet.</p>
              <p>Craggy, snow-peaked mountains, waterfalls and green pastures surround
                   the village of Chattah where AFP met with around a dozen men and women 
                  claiming to be at least a century old.</p>
              <p>Hafeezullah says he is 132, which would make him the oldest person in
                   the world — although Pakistan’s National Database and Registration 
                  Authority (NADRA) says he is a comparatively more youthful 107.</p>
              <p>A slightly built man with a face as jagged as the mountains 
                  surrounding him, he said a healthy diet of mainly fresh produce and 
                  occasional meat was the reason behind his longevity.</p>
              <p>He has lived through the days of British India and witnessed the 
                  partition of India but says the thing he remembers most fondly is the 
                  low cost of living during his youth.</p>
              <p>“We used to eat vegetables and pulses. We dumped the dried vegetables
                   in land during the winter season and then dug them up and ate them in 
                  summer,” he said, referring to the natural system of freezing produce 
                  under snow-covered ground.</p>
              <p>He has outlived three wives but his fourth, Issem Jan, dedicates herself to helping him live as long as possible.</p>
              <p>“I do whatever I can for him. I take care of everything for him. I 
                  serve him a lot and God will give me his reward,” the 70-year-old said 
                  as she massaged his legs.</p>
              <p>Chattah and nearby villages are 2,000 metres above sea level and are 
                  cut off from the rest of the country for almost six months because of 
                  the snow.</p>
              <p>The altitude also increases the production of red blood cells in the 
                  body, and the crisp air is free from the kind of choking pollution that 
                  blights the country’s major cities.</p>
              <p>Despite being a favoured tourism spot, Neelum Valley is relatively 
                  untouched by time and traditional farming methods including the use of 
                  bullocks to plough fields and minimal use of pesticides are still 
                  practised.</p>
              <p>There are no nearby markets, no fast food, and villagers are for the most part self-sufficient.</p>
              <p>“The farmers still use bulls to plough their fields. This is an old 
                  system of agriculture,” the headman of the village, Abdul Khaliq, 75, 
                  said.</p>
              <p>He added that young men and women get up early in the morning, 
                  around  4am, and work till sunset, busying themselves with farm tasks 
                  like chopping wood, carpentry and tending to their livestock — another 
                  factor contributing to their overall good health.</p>
              <p>Mohammad Shapal Khan, a senior NADRA official, said only 60 per cent 
                  of the region’s population had so far been added to federal data — but 
                  each village in the valley has a dozen or so people in their nineties or
                   hundreds.</p>
              <p>In stark contrast, the average life expectancy in Pakistan is 64 for 
                  men and 66 for women, according to the World Health Organisation.</p>
              <p>The UN-backed Global Age Watch Index named Pakistan as one of the 
                  three worst places in the world to grow old in and the worst in terms of
                   so-called “enabling environment” which includes security and freedom of
                   movement.</p>
              <p>Sabat Khan, another elderly local who claims he is 102 although 
                  official records place him at 92, said his idyllic homeland and lack of 
                  ill-health were responsible for his long life.</p>
              <p>“It is thanks to God’s blessing that I’m healthy,” he said, 
                  surrounded by a multitude of grandchildren. “I’ve rarely been sick and 
                  now I’m an old man.”</p>
