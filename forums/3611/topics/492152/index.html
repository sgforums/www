              <p class="article-abstract">An ostrich was filmed dashing down a busy 
              highway in Kuala Lumpur after it jumped through a car window into five 
              lanes of traffic</p>
              <p>Motorists on the Federal Highway 
              were shocked to see the world's largest living bird running between cars
               at speeds of 35 kilometres per hour.</p>
              <p>One driver, 
              Jeff Sandhu, took a video of the bird as it weaved across the lanes, an 
              unusual sighting in Malaysia’s concrete jungle.</p>

              <p>"Everyone wasn't sure whether to overtake it or not so we stayed behind it," Mr Sandhu told <em>The Star</em>.</p>
              <p>He said the flightless bird was on the loose for a while, and only stopped following it because he had a meeting.</p>
              <p>“I don't think anyone would believe me if I told them I was late because I was chasing after an ostrich," he said.</p>

              <p>The runaway ostrich was eventually captured by owner Darren Chow, who was driving his beloved pet to a farm.</p>
              <p>Mr
               Chow said the ostrich, affectionately named ‘Chickaboo’, had never 
              jumped out of the window before and was grateful to the four men who 
              helped him catch her.</p>
              <p>Exhausted and scared, Chickaboo stopped to rest, allowing Mr Chow to pick her up and take her back to the car.</p>
              <p>"I just hoped that she'd be okay. I was willing to trade my life with hers; it's my fault for leaving the window open," he told <em>Channel News Asia</em>.</p>
              <p>"Fortunately there were no motor accidents... she wasn't hurt; no one was hurt."</p>
              <p>Mr
               Chow purchased Chickaboo as a young chick from a farm six months ago 
              and said she was a loving animal who even formed a close friendship with
               his dog.</p>
              <p>When his neighbours petitioned for the 
              ostrich to be kept inside a cage, Mr Chow thought it would be cruel, 
              instead opting to return her to the farm where she was born.</p>
