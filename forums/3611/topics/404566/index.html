              <p class="articleabstract">Diego Maradona, who famously attributed a controversial World Cup goal to the "Hand of God", on Friday said it's the "Will of God" that will inspire Argentina to the final.</p>
              <p>"In the end, it is about whether God wants us to be in the final, but I know that is what God wants," Maradona is quoted as saying by SID, an AFP subsidiary.</p>
              <p>"This time we will not need the Hand of God, because it is the will of God."</p>
              <p>As a player, Maradona used his hand to score against England in Mexico in 1986 and described the incident as the "Hand of God".</p>
              <p>On Saturday, Argentina face Germany in the quarter-finals and the Argentina coach believes 20-year-old Bayern Munich midfielder Thomas Mueller, who scored twice in the 4-1 hammering of England in the round of 16, holds the key for his opponents.</p>
              <p>Mueller was virtually unknown outside of Germany when he made his debut in a 1-0 friendly defeat to Argentina in Munich in March and attended the post-match press conference as his country's great new hope alongside the Argentina coach.</p>
              <p>Maradona joked he thought the ballboy had arrived and felt so slighted that he stormed off and refused to return until the German left the stage to him alone.</p>
              <p>But the Argentinian knows all about Mueller now.</p>
              <p>"This boy is pretty fast and plays with lots of freedom," said Maradona.</p>
              <p>"If we had to run a marathon, Germany would win thanks to Mueller.</p>
              <p>"But in football it's not just about running. With the ball at our feet, we are better."</p>
              <p>Argentina's talisman Lionel Messi has been battling a cold in the build up to the match, but is expected to be fit.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old has yet to score at this World Cup, but Maradona wants to give the world footballer of the year every opportunity to play to his full potential.</p>
              <p>"I want to give Lionel entire freedom so he has so much space to move," said Maradona.</p>
              <p>"Players like Messi can't be put in a box, if you do that you take away their freshness and freedom. You have to just have to let them play."</p>
