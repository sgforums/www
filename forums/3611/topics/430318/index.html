              <p>A few weeks ago, Constable Michael Sanguinetti a policeman in Toronto, was chatting to some students about how to stay safe. One of the things he said was; “I’ve been told I’m not supposed to say this – however, women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimised”. I just checked the calendar and, yes, it’s still 2011, no strange time machine wizardry has brought us back to the dark ages.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sanguinetti has apologised since, but the statement travelled around the internet and has mobilised women all over the western world. The Constable’s case of severe foot-in-mouth brings up so many things that women are just sick of hearing. The obvious one is that it’s never the victim’s fault they are raped. No one asks for it. Also, one rapist’s slutty is another’s virginal. How is one to manage the slut-spectrum?</p>
              <p>There is uproar, as well there should, and groups all over the place  are organising Slut Walks in protest. In the UK, thousands of women are expected  in central London for a SlutWalk on the 4th of June, with other events planned for Cardiff, Edinburgh, Brighton and Birmingham. In more than 20 US states as well as Argentina, Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Sweden, other Slut Walks have been taking place.</p>

He's basically saying if you want to avoid robbers, do not stick wads of cash in your pocket and carrying bundles of $1000 notes in your hand.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>There is definitely merit in the policeman's argument. But as in any issue, there are always two sides to it. Basically, it's not the rich man's fault to be robbed if he wear thick gold chains and lots of diamond rings on his fingers and walking at night into a robbery prone area. The robber is definitely breaking the law. But for all good wisdom if you are the rich man, you would have acted in a smarter way instead of arguing that you didn't break the law because the money is yours and it's your right to flaunt your money in a robbery prone area at night. I mean, sometimes you have to use abit of brain. Just because you're right doesn't mean you're not going to get killed or robbed if you do stupid things.</p></div>
