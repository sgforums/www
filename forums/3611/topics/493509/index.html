              <p class="lead">VIENNA: On a wintry afternoon, tourists huddle around their guide outside Vienna's central train station.</p>

              their feet.</p>

              <p>Vienna is ranked as one of the world's most liveable cities with an 
              excellent social security system, but thousands of people nonetheless 
              fall through the cracks.</p>
              <p>"I'm happy because my hair is long again and I'm totally healthy," she told her tour group.</p>
              <p>"I'm confident that I'll soon have my own place again, not least 
              because of this," she added, referring to her new job at Shades Tours.</p>
              <p>Launched last year, the social start-up is part of a growing European
               trend that sees the needy hired as city guides as a way to help them 
              reintegrate.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/large-portrait/public/articles/2017/01/17/NP_20170117_VIENNA17-V9O_1484547.jpg?itok=BD2CPUiu" alt=""></p>
              <p>While they show tourists in Paris around famous landmarks, the Vienna
               concept goes a step further to peel off the stigma attached to 
              homelessness.</p>
              <p>"I wanted (the tours) to be more educational," explained Shades 
              Tours' creator Perrine Schober, a 33-year-old tourism management 
              graduate.</p>
              <p>"We (see) homelessness on a daily basis but we have no idea what it 
              is actually about, so I guess that's the reason people look away instead
               of trying to help," the French-Austrian told AFP.</p>
              <p>Shades Tours was initially aimed at Austrians, drawing hundreds of 
              school children, social workers and companies last year, with a 
              selection of tours costing 15 euros (S$22.70) that range from a couple 
              of hours to all day.</p>
              <p>"Our guides are in a unique position to explain Vienna's complex 
              social system and its challenges. They provide children with an 
              emotional lesson they can't get in a classroom," said Ms Schober.</p>
              <p>The organisation now employs three full-time guides, two of whom have
               already been able to move from their shelter into private housing.</p>
              <p>Boosted by the success, Ms Schober recently broadened the offering to include English-language tours for international tourists.</p>
              <p>Barbara, who declined to give her surname, switches effortlessly from
               German to English and French as she explains why the central station is
               a "hot spot" for the homeless.</p>
              <p>"It's warm, it's open 24 hours a day and you can be anonymous here," 
              she tells the visitors after they enter the huge glass structure.</p>
              <p>Multilingual social workers, recognisable by their red jackets, walk 
              around the station handing out information to homeless people on where 
              to get help.</p>
              <p>"What's the worst part about being homeless?" asked one of the tour group.</p>
              <p>The isolation, Barbara replied. "Nobody from my former life knows where I am now and I have no family," she said.</p>
              <p>Vienna, a city of 1.7 million, has a solid network of public 
              institutions and not-for-profit organisations helping those in need.</p>
              <p>In winter, around 700 beds are added to the 300 available all year 
              round to prevent people from freezing to death, particularly in the 
              current cold snap gripping Europe.</p>
              <p>But it is not enough to meet the high demand, made worse because 
              Vienna also draws the homeless from other European cities like Budapest,
               Hungary, where conditions are even tougher.</p>
              <p>For two euros a day, you can sleep, eat, shower, and use the Internet
               at the men-only VinziPort shelter, the last leg of Barbara's tour.</p>
              <p>At the end, participants thank Barbara for sharing her story, including Bulgarian Steliana Kokonova, 29.</p>
              <p>"One major thing that will stay with me is that we now have more 
              information about how to direct homeless people towards useful 
              institutions," she said. <cite>- AFP</cite></p>
