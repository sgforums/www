            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Fat and Calories</strong><br><br>Fat is the bodyÂ’s major energy storage system. When the energy from the food you eat and drink canÂ’t be used by your body, the body may turn it into fat for later use. Your body uses fat from foods for energy, to cushion organs and bones, and to make hormones and regulate blood pressure. Some fat is also necessary to maintain healthy skin, hair and nails, so you shouldnÂ’t cut all fat out of your diet. But in general, most people in the United States consume too much fat Â– which can lead to heart disease, obesity, diabetes and many other health problems.<br><br><strong>Types of Fats</strong><br><br>Not all fats are created equal. Saturated fats, which are generally solid at room temperature, are the least healthy and tend to increase the level of cholesterol in your blood. Foods that contain saturated fat include butter, cheese, some margarines, shortening, tropical oils such as coconut and palm oil and the fats in meat and poultry skin, so you should try to limit your consumption of those oils and foods.<br>Unsaturated fats reduce blood cholesterol when they replace saturated fats in the diet. There are two types of unsaturated fat - monounsaturated fat and polyunsaturated fat. Monounsaturated fats have been shown to raise the level of HDL, the 'good' cholesterol that protects against heart attacks, in the blood, so in moderation they can be part of a healthy diet. Olive and canola oils, peanut butter and nuts are particularly high in monounsaturated fats. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that you limit calories from monounsaturated fat to no more than 15% of your total calorie intake.<br><br>Although polyunsaturated fats come from plants and fish, but they may be more likely to form free radicals and lead to tissue damage. Good sources of polyunsaturated fats include most other vegetable oils and high-fat fish such as salmon and tuna. The AHA also recommends that saturated and polyunsaturated fats should make up less than 10 percent of your calorie intake.<br><br>Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, such as those used in many margarines and shortenings, contain unsaturated fats called trans-fatty acids. Trans-fatty acids may raise blood cholesterol levels, although not as much as saturated fat.<br><br><strong>How Much Fat Should I Eat?</strong><br><br>The American Heart Association and the United States Department of Agriculture recommend that you limit your fat intake to no more than 30% of your daily calories. Of that 30%, 10% or less of the fat calories should come from saturated fat. Check the Nutrition Facts labels of the foods you eat for information about fat from saturated and unsaturated sources.<br><br><strong>Adjusting Fat Intake for Weight Loss or Gain</strong><br><br>If you want to lose body fat, limit your intake of high-fat foods. This will not only improve your metabolism, it will allow you more food for your calorie expenditure because fats have more than twice the calories per gram as proteins (which contain 4 calories per gram) and carbohydrates (also 4 calories per gram).<br><br>But just because a food is low in fat doesn't mean you can eat all you want and not gain weight. Low-fat and no-fat foods still contain calories, so it's possible to gain weight from eating too many low-fat foods. Keep your serving sizes and calories under control while monitoring your fat intake, and youÂ’ll be better able to manage your weight. It's also a good idea to choose foods for their nutrient content - not just fat-free or low-fat versions of low-nutrient foods such as cookies, cakes and candy. Fruits, vegetables and whole grains contain plenty of vitamins and minerals, while being naturally low in fat.<br><br>To use up your body's fat storage, you need to exercise regularly. Moderate aerobic exercise, which raises your heart rate, is especially important. And any exercise that builds muscle mass can also help you burn more calories because muscle burns more calories than fat.<br><br>If you're trying to gain weight, you may want to add more high-calorie, high-fat foods. But try to limit the saturated fats in your diet. Exercise is also important because it will help to ensure that the weight you gain is more muscle and less fat.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Burn More Fat</strong><span class="small"> by: Owen Anderson Ph.D.</span><br><br>Runners hoping to improve their performance (and their overall health) by trimming body fat have two options. They can eat less fat and/or total calories, or they can increase the rate at which they metabolize fat during workouts. Since many runners are already either watching their fat intake or unwilling to give up certain favorite foods, the fat-burning approach is often more effective.<br><br>Many so-called "experts" recommend that the best way to burn more fat is to run slowly during workouts. You've probably heard advice about training in your "fat-burning zone," said to correspond to a heart rate of just 50 to 65 percent of maximum heart rate (MHR). This is equivalent to a running pace about 2 minutes per mile slower than your marathon race pace. In other words, very slow.<br><br>At first glance, such slow running seems like a great idea. A recent University of Texas study found that when athletes exercised at only 50 percent of their MHR, fat provided 90 percent of the calories burned. When the athletes sped up to 75 percent of MHR, fat provided "only" 60 percent of calories.<br><br>However, the higher-intensity session actually burned more total fat calories! This happened because the 50-percent workout burned only 7 calories per minute, while the 75-percent workout burned 14 calories per minute. A little simple math reveals that the harder workout consumed 8.4 fat calories per minute (60 percent of 14) versus just 6.3 fat calories (90 percent of 7) for the slow workout.<br><br>A study reported in last month's "Health Watch" column reached similar conclusions. In that intriguing experiment, world-famous fat researchers from Laval University in Quebec City, Quebec, reported that intense exercise led to a ninefold greater loss of body fat, per calorie burned, than less intense exercise. The scientists at Laval had earlier shown that vigorous exercisers are thinner than moderate exercisers who burn the same number of calories. From these studies, you might conclude that you should run at top speed to maximize your fat-burning potential. Not so. Above 85 percent of MHR, fat metabolism begins to drop. It appears that 75 to 85 percent of MHR is the ideal range for fat-burning.<br><br>Of course, if your current fitness doesn't permit you to run very far at 75 to 85 percent of MHR, you'll still reap weight-loss benefits if you do longer workouts at lower intensities. With this in mind, we've created the following five workouts--some fast, some slow--to help you maximize fat-burning on the run.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">If you have just 30 minutes for a workout, jog easily for 10 minutes and then run at 85 percent of your MHR for the final 20 minutes (this is approximately equivalent to your 10-mile race pace).<br><br>For an hour-long workout, run at 75 to 80 percent of MHR (approximately your marathon race pace).<br><br>Once a week, run for 90 minutes at 70 to 75 percent of MHR (about a minute per mile slower than your marathon race pace).<br><br>Every two to three weeks, run for 2 hours in this manner: run 60 minutes at 75 percent of your MHR (slightly slower than your marathon race pace), walk slowly for 15 minutes, then run 45 minutes more at about 75 percent of MHR.<br><br>Once a month, wait 3 hours after eating dinner, then run for 60 minutes at 75 percent of your MHR. The next morning, before breakfast, run another hour at 75 percent of MHR. The morning run will force your carbohydrate-depleted body to burn extra fat.<br><br></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Calorie restriction diet to lose weight</strong><br><br>Losing weight will always require a calorie restriction but how much do we restrict calories in the diet?<br><br>When trying to lose weight many dieters tend to restrict calorie consumption too much too soon, sometimes with a belief that a sudden calorie restriction will shock the body into burning fat quicker. The body does adapt to any calorie restriction quickly however, it does not force increased fat burning, greater fat burning is the result of higher fitness levels or an increased metabolism. Restricting calories too much will only result in a lowered metabolism as the body burns protein from lean muscle.<br><br>When dieters restrict calories too much it also develops a stronger appetite. Many believe this is because they are eating less however, it may be caused by a slight deficiency in essential nutrients. The appetite may be driving the individual to seek more food in order to gain the required nutrition.<br><br>With these possible factors in mind it is essential that calorie restriction is a gradual process developed over many months and not something done within a week or two. A true calorie restriction is also more effective when nutritionally dense foods are eaten in small, frequent meals. A diet void of nutrient dense foods may only cause further cravings and a greater appetite!<br><br>Restricting calories by eating healthy, low energy meals regularly is the best way to lose weight permanently. Introducing healthier varieties into the diet gradually ensures lower calorie consumption with the benefit of providing the body with enough essential nutrition to maintain an effective fat-burning energy system.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How much is too much when restricting calories?</span><br><br>Studies show that many dieters restrict calories as low as 1000 per day. This is way too low and often reached by cutting out complete meals rather than developing a healthy eating calorie restriction. Calories should always be restricted slowly and never go below an average of 1200 per day for women and 1500 for men. A calorie restriction of less than 1000 increases the chance of nutrient deficiency causing further potential health problems, it also may cause a lack of vitality which is an essential requirement if exercise is part of the weight loss program.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>WARNING</strong></span><br><br>If you possess a high number of fat cells you MUST exercise &amp; diet using correct scientific principles in order to empty fat cells, any other way will result in water loss and potential regain after diet stops<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><a href="http://atkins.com/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Atkins Diet</strong></a><br><br><span style="color: red;">What Is the Atkins Nutritional ApproachTM?</span><br><br>The cornerstone of the Atkins philosophy is a four-phase eating plan in conjunction with vitamin and mineral supplementation and regular exercise. Further, it is based upon four principles.<br><br>The Atkins Nutritional ApproachTM rebalances your nutrition so that you improve your energy level and your appearance and gain a sense of well-being. Following this approach lays the groundwork for a lifetime of better health.<br><br>The four-phase individualized eating plan allows you to knowledgeably select which foods to eat based on your need to achieve weight loss and weight maintenance, enjoy good health and prevent disease. Food selections will differ to varying degrees depending upon the phase you are in and your individual metabolism.<br><br>The phases in the Atkins roadmap to sustained success are:<br><br><strong>Phase 1: Induction</strong><br><br>Restrict carbohydrate consumption to 20 grams each day, obtaining carbohydrate primarily from salad and other non-starchy vegetables.<br><br><strong>Phase 2: Ongoing Weight Loss (OWL)</strong><br><br>Add carbohydrate, in the form of nutrient-dense and fiber-rich foods, by increasing to 25 grams daily the first week, 30 grams daily the next week and so on until weight loss stops. Then subtract 5 grams of carbohydrate from your daily intake so that you continue sustained, moderate weight loss.<br><br><strong><br>Phase 3: Pre-Maintenance</strong><br><br>Make the transition from weight loss to weight maintenance by increasing the daily carbohydrate intake in 10-gram increments each week so long as very gradual weight loss is maintained.<br><br><strong>Phase 4: Lifetime Maintenance</strong><br><br>Select from a wide variety of foods while controlling carbohydrate intake to ensure weight maintenance and a sense of well-being. This lifestyle is the foundation for a lifetime of better health.<br><br>Unlike a diet, the Atkins Nutritional ApproachTM is a lifetime nutritional philosophy, focusing on the consumption of nutrient-dense, unprocessed foods and vitanutrient supplementation. Moreover, Atkins restricts processed/refined carbohydrates (which make up more than 50 percent of many people's diets), such as high-sugar foods, breads, pasta, cereal and starchy vegetables. Core vitanutrient supplementation includes a full-spectrum multivitamin and an essential oils/fatty acid formula. This nutritional philosophy has been embraced by an estimated 20 million people worldwide since the release of Dr. AtkinsÂ’ Diet Revolution in the 1970s, and was the cornerstone of the treatment protocols for patients of The Atkins Center for Complementary Medicine in New York City (1984-2003).<br><br><span style="color: blue;">The Atkins Nutritional PrinciplesTM</span><br><br>Four principles form the core of the Atkins Nutritional ApproachTM and are supported by a solid foundation of medical and nutritional scientific research.<br><br><strong>1. You will lose weight</strong>. ItÂ’s hard not to. Both men and women who follow the Atkins approach to weight loss readily take off pounds and inches. For the small numbers who have a truly hard-core metabolic resistance to weight loss, there are ways to overcome the barriers that prevent a successful outcome. Optimizing body weight is a valuable element of any health-oriented program because, by and large, being significantly overweight is an indicator of health problems, either now or in the future. When you've pared pounds, you'll see benefits flow in to take their placeÂ—and they'll be more than merely cosmetic.<br><br><strong>2 You will maintain your weight loss</strong>. This is where the Atkins Nutritional ApproachTM leaves most other weight-control programs in the dust. Almost every experienced dieter has embarked on a weight-loss program, worked hard at it, lost a lot of pounds and gained them all back in a few months or perhaps a year. This is usually due to the expected consequence of low-fat, low-calorie diets: hunger. Although many people can tolerate hunger for a while, very few can tolerate it for a lifetime. Deprivation is no fun. Once the biological gap between hunger and fulfillment grows too large, the rebound can be rapid, as well as heartbreaking and humiliating. But thatÂ’s the problem with diets that restrict quantities. The Atkins program refuses to accept hunger as a way of life. People who do Atkins gradually find their effective individual level of carbohydrate intake, the tool that allows them to maintain a healthy weight for a lifetime.<br><br><strong>3. You will achieve good health</strong>. The change is amazing. With Atkins, you meet your nutritional needs by eating healthy, wholesome foods and omitting junk food. As a result, fatigue drops from your shoulders like a heavy winter coat you mistakenly wore in summer. This occurs not merely because the pounds drop off, but because the physical consequences of a truly dysfunctional blood-sugar and insulin metabolism are reversed. People who do Atkins start feeling good long before they reach their goal weight. Once they abandon the catastrophic American diet of refined carbohydrates for whole, unrefined food, they start to live again.<br><br><strong>4. You will lay the permanent groundwork for disease prevention</strong>. You will change your life, whichÂ—believe it or notÂ—is even more important than looking good on the beach next summer. By following an individualized controlled carbohydrate nutritional approach that results in lower insulin production, people at high risk for chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes will see a marked improvement in their clinical parameters. All the rest of us won't have to become high-risk candidates for disease. ItÂ’s as simple as that.<br><br>More information on <a href="http://atkins.com/" rel="nofollow">Atkins Diet webby</a>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">though i never taken this approach, i heard from friends that have taken it, it is very effective. The first 2 weeks on this dietary will be like HELL. Once the body adapt to the dietary, it should be more managable. </span> - kops21</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I went on the Atkins awhile and it does work. Well not full Atkins cos there were some inevitable carbs consumed like in gravy staches etc.  But I did try to follow the principles in the Induction stage.<br><br>Atkins is tough to maintain locally cos most of our meals consist of noodles and rice.  It's do-able but then you'd have to order meat and vegetable without rice, for example, in your chap chye peng.<br><br>I also found the restriction on starches through vegetable and fruits very difficult, cos I love vegetables and fruits.  I think in the later stages more vegetables and fruits are introduced.<br><br>However there are Atkins designed supplements for fibre, nutrition, etc. which shows that you can't have a full range of nutrition necessary just based on the Atkins diet alone.  Personally I'd rather have as little as supplements as possible, prefering to get my nutrition through food.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by kops21:<br><strong>[b]Phase 1: Induction</strong><br><br>Restrict carbohydrate consumption to 20 grams each day, obtaining carbohydrate primarily from salad and other non-starchy vegetables.<br>[/b]</blockquote></div>
