            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Information gather from</span> <a href="http://www.netfit.co.uk" rel="nofollow">www.netfit.co.uk</a><br><br><span style="color: green;">Most people who decide to lead a healthier lifestyle go on traditional diets. The truth is, however, that 95% of those who go on such diets fail; what's worse, they often end up in worse shape than when they started.<br><br>Diets are both ineffective and potentially harmful; long-term health-oriented programs should replace them.<br><br>Low calorie diets, result in muscle loss, in preference to fat so that the most useful tissue is preserved for times of starvation. Fat produces 9 cal's of energy per gram compared with only 4 cal per gram produced by your muscle tissue.<br><br>However, muscle determines the overall metabolic rate of the body, so if muscle is lost, the metabolic rate will be reduced. This means that when the dieter returns to a normal pattern of eating again, the lower metabolic rate will result in rapid weight gain.<br><br>The other problem with having a low level of lean muscle tissue is the feeling of fatigue, when doing simple exercise tasks. The muscles and the liver both store energy supplies, in the form of glycogen.<br><br>This situation has developed simply because many people are looking for an easy way to lose weight that delivers quick results. No such approach exists, yet the slimming industry continues to misguide people into believing that fast weight loss can be achieved with minimum effort.<br><br>Achieving target weight requires lifestyle changes. These changes include regular exercise, a sensible approach to healthy eating and the right mental attitude.  </span><br><br><strong>Why Dieting can make you FATTER  </strong><br>The conventional approach to dieting is a disaster. The first mistake is to call a program a Â“weight loss programÂ”. There are many weight reduction programs, which if followed can produce rapid weight loss.<br><br>However, this weight loss is neither sustainable nor healthy as it involves dehydration and loss of muscle tissue.<br><br>When you are ill and bed bound similar results are produced in only 48 hours, especially if you have a complaint like food poisoning. How much weight do you think is lost in the form of excess unhealthy adipose fat tissue?<br><br><strong>DEHYDRATION </strong><br>70% of the body is made up of water. It is easy to design a dehydration diet that results in losing 10 lb. of water within several days. Many naive slimmer's are encouraged by these rapid results. Simply dehydration by 2-3 % of body weight can result in a 7% drop in physical performance.<br><br><strong>LOSS OF MUSCLE TISSUE </strong><br>If you lose weight too quickly, much of the weight loss will be muscle tissue. It is estimated that when people lose over 2lbs of weight a week, 30-40% of the weight lost will be muscle.<br><br>This is a disaster for keeping the weight off in the long term because muscle is five times more active metabolically than fat tissue.<br><br><strong>Exercise and Healthy Eating the First Priority </strong><br>The aim of an exercise program is to lose fat without losing muscle and without reducing metabolic rate. The exercise needs to be customized to fitness level and to specific goal of fat loss.<br><br>Together aerobic exercise and resistance training are the ideal combination of exercise to achieve fat loss and it should be part of your lifestyle.<br><strong><br>Aerobic Exercise </strong><br>Aerobic exercise metabolizes calories and raises the metabolic rate. The heart rate needs to be raised to a comfortable level for 20 - 30 minutes at least 3 times per week. By exercising aerobically, calories will be burnt at a rate of 300 + per hour depending on your weight and fitness level.<br><br>If you consider that just 1 pound of body fat has around 4,100 calories, then you can get a rough idea, of just how long it will take to shed those extra pounds permanently. Look again at how long it took to put them on, normally years or a complete lifetime of your own bodily abuse.<br><br>Now comes the debate of how hard to work. Personally I recommend that you work at a level that you know that you can maintain for a minimum of 20 to 30 minutes.<br><br>The debate comes in, when various fitness bodies suggest training at a high heart rate 75/90 % of max, for short periods or 55/80 % of maximum heart rate for easier longer periods.<br><br>IÂ’am no scientist, but I have tried both methods on a number of clients, and have found like most things in life, it may work for one person but not necessary for another.<br><br>In short try both methods, unless you are a complete beginner to fitness, in which case I would recommend training at a steady pace for as long as comfortably possible.<br><br>Aerobic exercise will also raise the metabolic rate for up to 24 hours after you have finished training. This helps to burn up extra calories and prevents the metabolic rate declining.<br><br><strong>Resistance (or weight) Training </strong><br>Look in the section on this web site dealing with weight training for guidelines, or speak to a qualified trainer to aid you in both the correct exercises and techniques for yourself.<br><br>Inactive people lose about 10 % of their muscle mass every 10 years after the age of 25. However with regular resistance training it is possible to regain this muscle mass.<br><br>Resistance training should be carried out 2-3 times per week for around 30 minutes. Although not generally effective as aerobic training for burning calories, resistance training will still burn about 250-500 calories per hour and will raise metabolic rate.<br><br>DonÂ’t feel that by doing weight training that you will develop a body that resembles a body builders, as these men and women spend a great deal of their time as well as strict diets and grueling weight sessions to achieve the physiques that they have.<br><br>Another important point is that muscle will not turn into fat, if you stop training. The muscle tissue will naturally break down and shrink in size, (hypo trophy)<br><br>Important point because lean muscle tissue weighs more than body fat, your actual body weight may stay the same, during the early stages of your new lifestyle regime.<br><br>DonÂ’t be alarmed, the weight will come of, however if it does not, your overall ratio of body fat compared to lean muscle tissue, will certainly be in a healthier ratio.<br><br>Try and avoid using the scales, unless they can monitor your body fat as well, instead measure your body at various points e.g. your hips, chest, stomach and thighs. Using an item of clothing is also a good way to measure yourself, as with a bit of time and dedication, you will find that the clothing fits you properly.<br><br><strong>Healthy Eating  </strong><br>Good nutrition is very important for fat loss, and focusing on health and health promoting foods is far more productive than focusing on fat loss and denial of favorite foods.<br><br>Adopting a whole food diet, avoiding salt, fat, sugar, additives, preservatives, processed and refined foods, needs to become part of a life style change.<br><br>By increasing natural foods with a high fibre and water content (fruit and vegetables) more food can be eaten to appease the appetite without gaining weight.<br><br>A whole food diet also has a much higher vitamin and mineral content than a typical diet containing processed and refined foods.<br><br>Click  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <a href="http://www.netfit.co.uk/fatcal.htm" rel="nofollow">CALORIE EXPENDITURE CHART  PER HOUR FOR VAROIUS ACTIVITIES</a><br><br><span style="color: red;">The more siong the exercise, the more calories it burnt. </span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Recent studies have shown people who regularly eat breakfast enjoy a more positive attitude, are slimmer and concentrate better. Eating breakfast, especially one high in dietary fibre, is a great strategy to stave off hunger pangs and control food intake mid morning and at lunchtime. Smart breakfast choices also help to ensure consumption of the recommended quantities of some essential nutrients. The most common reasons given for not eating breakfast are no appetite and no time, so this article offers a summary of the multiple reasons why it's such a good idea to include breakfast in your early morning routine and some tips to ensure eating breakfast really does kick start your day...</span><br><br><strong>Breakfast is Brain Food</strong><br><br>Studies have demonstrated that eating breakfast is associated with an improvement in mental performance; more specifically starting the day with a light meal has a positive impact on alertness, concentration, and helps to establish a positive attitude towards school studies, workplace tasks and other activities. This is hardly surprising, given breakfast, especially carbohydrate-based breakfasts boost brain glucose levels, and micronutrients, such as B vitamins commonly added to breakfast cereals are also know to have a positive effect on brain function.<br><br>The strong evidence that children and teenagers who eat a breakfast rich in complex carbohydrates are significantly better able to concentrate and problem solve, has led to a number of schools setting up breakfast clubs which provide both childcare and food for children before the school day begins.<br><br><strong>Breakfast Eaters are Slimmer</strong><br><br>AFIC's own research in collaboration with four universities in the Asia region found that young people aged 10-12 who reported eating breakfast regularly were less likely to be overweight or obese than those who regularly skipped breakfast (for more details see Food Facts Asia Issue 16).<br><br>Many other studies have also found a direct link between breakfast consumption and weight management. For example a US study published in the Journal of Obesity Research in 2002, reported that 80% of the 3,000+ study volunteers, who successfully lost excess body weight and then maintained a healthy weight, regularly ate breakfast.<br><br><strong>Breakfast - a Benefit for all Age Groups</strong><br><br>Surveys have found that children and adults who regularly eat breakfast have higher intakes of some vitamins and minerals - including iron; calcium; magnesium; zinc; the B vitamins, riboflavin and folate; as well as vitamins A and D.<br><br>Skipping breakfast becomes more common with age, with around one third of adults not eating anything within the first hour after getting up in the morning. However, those who skip breakfast are more likely to be ravenously hungry mid-morning and eat more calories and more fat during the course of the day than those who eat breakfast. Because parents and care givers are such influential role models for their children's long-term eating habits; there are clearly two good reasons for parents to establish the breakfast habit - it's  good for both their own health and their children's health!<br><br><strong>Make it Easy</strong><br><br>One of the most common reasons given for skipping breakfast is 'lack of time'. The morning rush to get out of the house on time is a common feature in so many busy lives nowadays. This time pressure combined with assumptions that a nutritious breakfast will take time to prepare and eat, is a common reason why breakfast may disappear from the morning routine.<br><br>Another very common reason given for missing breakfast is 'lack of appetite.' Normally night time is the longest period in the daily routine when no food or drink is consumed, and yet despite this, many report not wanting to eat in the early morning. If you want to re-establish the breakfast habit, but 'no appetite' is the obstacle, start with something small, and easy, and concentrate first on making it part of the morning routine. Something is better than nothing.<br><br>One solution to both of these challenges is to plan ahead, and choose foods which seem most appealing in the early part of the day, and then ensure they are on hand and ready in the morning, or why not consider getting up just 10 minutes earlier in the morning?<br><br>Also, think beyond cooked and elaborate traditional breakfasts, and choose foods from the starchy cereals and grains; high calcium; fruit and vegetable food groups: Quick, cold dishes such as breakfast cereal and dairy or soy milk or breakfast bars with a carton of juice or milk; pots of yoghurt, fresh or dried fruit; rice crackers with a sweet or savoury spread, buns or other lower fat bakery goods offer easy grab-and-go options, that can be eaten on the way to work or school if necessary.  If picking up food after leaving the house, try to avoid fried foods and aim to include some fresh fruit or vegetables; for example grilled fish with vegetables instead of fried rice, an omelette stuffed with finely chopped vegetables or a carton of juice with a muesli bar.<br><br><strong>Think Low Fat, High fibre</strong><br><br>High fibre foods are good for the digestive system and good for weight control. To maximise the dietary fibre content of the first meal of the day, choose cereal dishes that are wholegrain and/or are based on barley, wheat or oats; also look for foods that contain at 3-5 grammes of dietary fibre per serving. Another option is to add a spoonful of bran to your morning bowl of congee or breakfast cereal.<br><br>For those who prefer a protein-based meal such as fish or eggs, choose grilled or broiled, instead of fried, and why not supplement with a portion of fruit or vegetables?<br><br><strong>Plan Ahead</strong><br><br>If you want to establish the breakfast habit, or improve the nutritional quality of current breakfast fare, the key to success may be to make advance preparations, by getting as much prepared as possible the night before, and then build a few minutes into the morning routine to actually enjoy the items chosen. Making wise and nutritious choices at the start of your day, can set you on the right track for the rest of the day ahead!<br><br></div>
