            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">The following are an introduction to using Heart Rate Monitoring device. This device has bring me to a new level of appreciation how to exercise properly. From a guy that struggle to finish 2km to someone gonna run 42km in 3 months time over a period of 18months, does speak strength of the device.</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>The following information is an extract from <a href="http://www.brianmac.demon.co.uk/hrm1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.brianmac.demon.co.uk/hrm1.htm</a>.<br><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>Heart rate training zones are calculated by taking into consideration your <a href="http://www.brianmac.demon.co.uk/maxhr.htm" rel="nofollow">Maximum Heart Rate </a> (MHR) and your Resting Heart Rate (RHR). Within each training zone subtle physiological effects take place to enhance your fitness.<br><br><strong>The Energy Efficient or Recovery Zone - 60% to 70%</strong><br>Training within this zone develops basic endurance and aerobic capacity. All easy recovery running should be completed at a maximum of 70 %. Another advantage to running in this zone is that while you are happily fat burning you may lose weight and you will be allowing your muscles to re-energise with glycogen, which has been expended during those faster paced work-outs. Check out the <a href="http://www.brianmac.demon.co.uk/fatburn.htm" rel="nofollow">Fat burning zone</a> page.<br><br><strong>The Aerobic Zone - 70% to 80%</strong><br>Training in this zone will develop your cardiovascular system. The body's ability to transport oxygen to, and carbon dioxide away from, the working muscles can be developed and improved. As you become fitter and stronger from training in this zone it will be possible to run some of your long weekend runs at up to 75%, so getting the benefits of some fat burning and improved aerobic capacity.<br><br><strong>The Anaerobic Zone - 80% to 90%</strong><br>Training in this zone will develop your lactic acid system. In this zone your individual <a href="http://www.brianmac.demon.co.uk/enduranc.htm#ant" rel="nofollow">anaerobic threshold</a> is found - sometimes referred to the point of deflection (POD). During these heart rates the amount of fat being utilised as the main source of energy is greatly reduced and glycogen stored in the muscle is predominantly used. One of the by-products of burning this glycogen, is the runners worst enemy, <a href="http://www.brianmac.demon.co.uk/lactic.htm" rel="nofollow">lactic acid</a>. There is a point at which the body can no longer remove the lactic acid from the working muscles quickly enough. This happens at an individual heart rate for us all and is accompanied by a rapid rise in heart rate and a slowing of your running pace. This is your anaerobic threshold or POD. Through the correct training it is possible to delay the POD by being able to increase your ability to deal with the lactic acid for a longer period of time or by pushing the POD higher.<br><br><strong>The Red Line Zone 90% to 100%</strong><br>Training in this zone will only be possible for short periods of time. It effectively trains your <a href="http://www.brianmac.demon.co.uk/muscle.htm" rel="nofollow">fast twitch muscle fibres </a>and helps to develop speed. This zone is reserved for <a href="http://www.brianmac.demon.co.uk/conintrn.htm" rel="nofollow">interval running</a> and only the very fit are able to train effectively within this zone.<br><br><strong>Resting Heart Rate</strong><br>To determine your resting heart rate (RHR) is very easy. Find somewhere nice and quite, lie down and relax. Position a watch or clock where you can clearly see it whilst lying down. After 20 minutes remain where you are, do not sit up, and determine your pulse rate (beats/min). Use this value as your RHR.<br><br>If you have a heart rate monitor then put it on before you lie down. After the 20 minutes check the recordings and identify the lowest value achieved. Use this value as your RHR.<br><br>As you get fitter your heart becomes more efficient at pumping blood around the body. As a result you will find your resting heart rate gets lower so you will need to check your RHR on a regular basis (e.g. Monthly).<br><br>Calculation of a zone value<br>The calculation of a zone value, X%, is performed in the following way:<br><br>Subtract your RHR from your MHR giving us your working heart rate (WHR)<br>Calculate the required X% on the WHR giving us "Z"<br>Add "Z" and your RHR together to give us the final value<br>Example : The athlete's MHR is 180 and their RHR is 60 - determine the 70% value<br><br>MHR - RHR = 180 - 60 = 120<br>70% of 120 = 84<br>84 + RHR = 84 + 60 = 144 bpm<br><br>If you have any comments, please reply at <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=110169" rel="nofollow">Jogging Saga thread</a>.</div>

Basically, Bart says that if you want to run a marathon in 2:45, 3:29 or 4:11, you should train to the point where you can run 10 repeats of 800 meters in the same time?2:45, 3:29 or 4:11. The only difference is that your marathon time is hours:minutes and your 800 time is minutes:seconds.<br><br>Bart suggests doing Yasso 800s once a week as part of your marathon training. Start with perhaps 4 x 800 and build up to 10 x 800. Between the 800s, take a recovery jog that lasts as long as your 800s.<br><br>(Additional hint: Yasso 800s are a great workout for any runner. Because they are "strong but controlled," they're basically a form of tempo training.) A good Yasso 800 workout: 6 x 800 at Yasso pace with recovery jogs between the 800s.<br><br>If you have any comments, please reply at <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=110169" rel="nofollow">Jogging Saga thread</a>.</div>
