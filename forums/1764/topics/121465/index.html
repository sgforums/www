            <div class='col-md body'><strong>If you're trying to lose weight by following a proper diet and regular exercise plan, you're probably already avoiding cheeseburgers, milkshakes, and fries. What you may not know, however, is that there are many other foods out there that may seem OK but are actually very high in calories or fat. We're here to help. Think twice about the following 10 foods as they may not be helping you reach your physique-enhancing goals! </strong><br><br><span style="color: blue;">1. Rice Cakes</span><br><br>Traditionally considered a health food, rice cakes can contain considerable amounts of high glycemic index carbohydrates. When eaten, foods rated high on the glycemic index will cause a rapid rise in your blood sugar level. These simple carbs may stimulate unwanted fat storage and slow your body's fat-burning capabilities. So choose your snacks wisely and eat in moderation<br><br><span style="color: blue;">2. Fruit Juice</span><br><br>Fruit juice is not only calorie-dense, but also high in sugar. And consuming too much of it may not be the best choice for your fat-loss plan. Notably, one primary sugar found in fruit juice is fructose, which has some unique characteristics that cause it to be stored as fat. By replacing juice with water, you will not only be saving between 110 and 200 calories per cup, but you'll be cutting down significantly on your sugar intake as well.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">3. Flavored Oatmeal</span><br><br>Oatmeal is a staple in many nutrition plans. However, sugar is usually high on the ingredient list of flavored oatmeal packets, turning what could be a nutritious source of high fiber into a high-sugar food that invites fat storage. A wise choice would be to cut down on the packets or stick with non-flavored oatmeal and add some zest by adding a scoop or two of your favorite NITRO-TECHÂ® protein powder.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">4. Alcohol</span><br><br>Although alcohol itself doesn't contain fat, it is loaded with calories. Those Saturday nights can be fun, but too much alcohol can put a wrench in your plan. When you add in mixers Â– such as soda, juice, sugar, and other ingredients Â– the calories can really add up. One other important note is that the more calories an individual consumes in the form of alcohol, the less likely it is that he or she will eat enough food to obtain adequate nutrients. To make matters worse, excessive alcohol consumption can interfere with the body's metabolism of nutrients, especially protein. This also has a profound effect on your body's ability to build muscle, and it drastically inhibits fat burning. Remember, if you decide to drink, drink responsibly and drink in moderation.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">5. Salad Dressing</span><br><br>Salads can be an ideal food for supporting weight loss. Yet, they may not be your best choice when you add fat-loaded salad dressings. A typical salad dressing contains about 6 to 8 grams of fat and around 75 calories per teaspoon. Since we may be enticed to add 3 or 4 teaspoons of dressing on our salads, we're adding nearly 30 grams of fat and 300 calories! Stick with a low-fat dressing. Just read the label Â– some flavors of some low-fat dressings can contain the same amount of fat as some regular dressings in other flavors. Others are higher in carbohydrates and calories, despite being low in fat. A good choice would be a vinaigrette dressing with a little olive oil mixed in.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">6. Muffins</span><br><br>Often thought of as a healthy breakfast option, muffins could actually be adding to your waistline! Muffins can be very calorie-dense, and a large one can often pack up to 400 calories Â– and that's without adding butter! If you can't resist, go for a low-fat muffin, but be aware that many of them can contain more sugar to compensate for the lack of fat. This could make them just as high in calories.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">7. Breaded Chicken or Fish</span><br><br>Breaded chicken and fish might contain<br>ample servings of protein, but also a lot of unwanted fat. In fact, a typical six-piece meal of breaded chicken (approximately 3.8 oz.) can contain 20 grams of fat. And of course, adding dipping sauces brings the total calorie count up even higher. Avoid the bread and dips, and go for a nicely grilled chicken Breast<br><br><span style="color: blue;">8. Frozen Yogurt</span><br><br>Frozen yogurt has long been one of the most popular "health foods" available. What many don't realize is that while nonfat frozen yogurt might have less fat, that doesn't mean it's calorie-free. Nonfat frozen yogurt can still contain carbohydrates that can be converted into fat. In fact, nonfat yogurt can contain too many calories for a diet and exercise plan intended to support fat loss! Also worthy of note is that many frozen yogurt varieties are low in protein and calcium. A good idea would be to stick with regular yogurt, which is higher in both protein and calcium and is lower in calories. If you're craving yogurt, go ultra-low fat, read the label, and reduce the calories.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">9. Deli Meats</span><br><br>Many commercially available deli meats are high in fat and sodium. Some may also contain sugar. In particular, avoid marbled cold cuts such as salami, as their fat content is higher. If you have no other option but to eat deli meats, choose low-fat items like lean turkey and chicken.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">10. Regular Sodas</span><br><br>Think you can get away with having regular soda in your fat-loss program? Think again! A 16-ounce glass of regular cola contains 197 more calories than an identically-sized bottle of diet cola. And if that doesn't convince you, the majority of those calories come from simple sugars! Sticking with diet soda will help you go a long way towards reaching your goals.<br></div>

Lead author Dr. Jay Olshansky, a longevity researcher, reports that children today will likely have shorter and less healthy lives than their parents for the first time in modern history. Obesity is associated with an increased risk of cancer, diabetes, heart disease and is the second-leading cause of preventable death in the United States. About two thirds of adults in the United States are overweight or obese.<br><br><strong>Are you at risk?</strong> Adults and adolescents with a Body Mass Index (BMI, a height/weight ratio) of 25 or more are considered overweight; those 30 and above are considered obese.
