            <div class='col-md body'>NO SEX TONIGHT<br><br>I never quite figured out why the sexual urge of men and women differ so<br>much. And I never have figured out the whole Venus and Mars thing. I have<br>never figured out why men think with their head and women with their heart.<br><br>FOR EXAMPLE: One evening last week, my girlfriend and I were getting into<br>bed.<br><br>Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says "I don't feel<br>like it, I just want you to hold me."<br><br>I said "WHAT??!! What was that?!"<br><br>So she says the words that every boyfriend on the planet dreads to<br>hear......"You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman,<br>enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man."<br><br>She responded to my puzzled look by saying, "Can't you just love me for who<br>I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?"<br><br>Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.<br><br>The very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with<br>her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, big<br>department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several<br>different very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take so I<br>told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new<br>clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit.<br><br>We went onto the jewelry department where she picked out a pair of diamond<br>earrings. Let me tell you..........she was so excited. She must have thought<br>I was one wave short of a shipwreck. I started to think she was testing me<br>because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to<br>play tennis. I think I threw her for a loop when I said, "That's<br>fine,honey."<br><br>She was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement.<br>Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, "I think this is all<br>dear, let's go to the cashier."<br><br>I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, "No honey, I don't feel<br>like it."<br><br>Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled<br>"WHAT?"<br><br>I then said, "Honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You're<br>just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy<br>your shopping needs as a woman."<br><br>And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, "Why<br>can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?"<br><br>Apparently I'm not having sex tonight either.</div>
