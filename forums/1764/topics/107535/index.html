            <div class='col-md body'>Hello everybody,<br><br>I am out of the office. Back only next week.<br><br>But to answer some of the questions ..<br>Medical teams for KLIM is.... ... NO GOOD.   Also not enought of them to be distributed on the race route.  Their strategy is to have an ambulance doing loops around the race route and wait for a call. Then the ambulance will do the pick up and drop off the victim back at the starting venue where a bunch of the medics are located.<br><br>So gentelman ..  its really like one of those Navy Seals mission.  "You are on your own" once you hit the road in KL.  For me I always bring some CASH along ... so that I can call my own ambulance or TAXI.<br><br>KLIM marathon chicks are really scarce .. not many run the 42.195km as there are no mobile toilets provided. SERIOUSLY .. folks .. I am not kidding on this. Only way is to mark your own  toilets base on the petrol stations or  HOTELS en route.   Normall .. I just piss on the road but as this marathon is 70% city .. there is going to be lots of spectators.  Ha ha ..ha..<br><br>Hello Fuqua,  8-)<br>Thanks for visiting my site and reading up.<br>Yeah.. the rules on taking stuff like gels or deep heat ?  Forget the rules .. NO RULES  .. just survive and get ass accross the finish line.  I normally take my own gels and deep heat  and my own medical kit.  Most important take cash as this is a city marathon ..can pop into any 7-11 shop to buy drinks or medical supply.<br><br>Gentelman .. I am not kidding you when I tell you that this KLIM marathon will be a HARD one for you guys.  Expect serious PAIN  !!<br><br>The only positive thing I can tell you about the KLIM is to expect one GREAT sun tan.  There will be water at the water stations !!  Also got water at the sponge stations.  The finisher medal is FANTASTIC !!!<br><br>I will be out of the office until next week. Catch you guys later.<br><br>Penguin-6<br>www.jroller.com/page/penguin<br><br></div>

Normally around RM100 per night kind of Hotel will be sufficient enough. Of course, the location must be ideal.<br><br>I am going to search for budget hotel that is close(max 10mins walk) to Dataran Merdeka. Anyway, we still have lots of time for that.<br><br>Training will be focus at this moment. So how, anyone wanna go Bukit Timah for a run?

Best tell your friend to use fiticious IC numbers  that correspond to your age category. Seems this is the  only thing race official check.<br><br><blockquote>How about returning of the chip? Just return the chip after the run at Dataran Merdeka, &amp; i can get my RM$20 back on the spot? Do i need to use my malaysian friend identification to do that? Same goes for collection of certification. </blockquote>Nope! Just return the chip on the spot and get back your money. No checking. Only rule is got chip .. means got money. As for the cert. make sure your name is printed correct. Again no checking. They will see your  BIB number to confirm before they pass the cert to you.<br><br><blockquote>Is it necessary to run in the Marathon Vest provide? </blockquote>Not necessary. The vest quality normally not good as the sponsors all put the LOGO there. So the race organizors have to stress all must wear the vest but who can enforce this rule ?? Normally I only wear it after the race.<br><br><blockquote>Looking at the route, is Refreshment station = water point. Sponging station = wet sponging point(no water provided). There is no mention of any isotonic drink or gel station.</blockquote>Last year .. sponge stations got water. This year I am not sure. But assume no water.  Last year got isotoinic drinks  after 10km or 15km into the marathon.  Last year .. gel station was at the 30km mark.  I am not sure about this year.<br><br>As for the water stations .. got lots of water. But better watch out on the last 3 water stations towards the finish.  Normally no more water .. dry as the sahara. Also no 7-11 shops to buy... real killer stretch.<br><br>8-)<br>Hope this helps,<br>klpenguin<br>www.jroller.com/page/penguin</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Hello spencer99,<br>8-))<br>Yes .. air quality is not good but if you compare it to mumbai india then its pretty good lah<br>8-)<br>As this is a city marathon .. there are bound to be bus fumes and other stuff that will lower the air quality.  Also there is that ever burning haze problem from Indonesia. I use to worry about it but .. nowadays there is no use in complaining about it (beyond my control) all I can do is focus on the girls up front and think of a cute ice breaker.<br><br>Hello kops21,<br><br><blockquote><br>Can you elaborate on the collection for the "group". That means 1 Malaysian(with valid document) can collect for 5 persons(fictitious) etc?<br></blockquote>So busy how to check during collection.  They will look only at the PAID race registration slips.  Normally 1 person can collect for the group as there are long ques that race organizors want to avoide.<br><br><blockquote><br>According to the website, it mention they will do better route management compare to last year. Wonder how true can that be?<br></blockquote>Well .. I would say yes because last year  all the 10km  route is the almost the same as the marathoners. So some marathoners accidentaly got lost or vice versa.<br><br><blockquote><br>Why last 3 stations can be without water? It seems logically that since there are lesser runners around, they should be more water, compare to the first few stations? Unless the management did not cater enough water !<br></blockquote>Yes it could be due to bad water management.<br><br>Another reason ...<br><br>Most runners do not drink too much at the water stations early into the race as they are going all out and feeling strong. But towards the end ... everybody is so thirsty that .. all water is finish up.<br><br>Also another screw up  from last year is some parts of the race route coverge with the 10km and 21km runners ... so you can just imagine the chaos at the water stations where there is a huge surge for water, creating a water shortage<br><br>8-)<br>But a secret survival tip is ... the mobile looping ambulance do carry water.<br>If you need it .. try flag down an ambulance and ask for water.<br><br>Hope this helps<br>[/quote]</div>
