Constant banging of toe and shoe will cause pressure on the toe nails. Normally after a run, your toe will get sore and subsequently turn blue-black.

            <div class='col-md body'>Nike Spiridon for me.. there is no best running shoe... every runner is different brand also is different.  Model of running shoe is different. This is why going to a specialty running shop where people can provide knowledge on suitable running shoes for you is the best choice =D.<br><br>if you want really slim ones.. you should try getting air zoom miller from nike, mens free 5.0 is rather good as well<br><br>for larger ones.. more to the marathon side, you should try air pegasus, or air zoom elite from nike.<br><br>other good brands to choose from are.. the supernova or climacool series from adidas..<br><br>dont look down on new balance too.. its incredible too, i also own a pair from them now.. get the mens 991gl.. =D, really good pair of shoes</div>

Getting prepared before will put your mind at ease and concentrate on your run.<br><br>Toenails painful.....aiyoh...bad timing...My experienced with toenails, just let it rest, but on a plaster(i use Watson cushion plaster) when i run. At the same time try to get another pair of shoe.<br><br>If you are injury(toe nail) or others, definitely will affect your running. If there is a need to run, just get a plaster, cushion it, lossen your shoe lace(to give more spaces) and run.<br><br></div>
