These last two weeks have been hell. Your boss called to<br><br>tell me that you had quit your job today and that was the last straw.<br><br>Last week, you came home and didn't notice that I had gotten my hair<br><br>and nails done, cooked your favorite meal and even wore a brand new<br><br>negligee.<br><br>You came home and ate in two minut es, and went straight to sleep after<br><br>watching the game. You don't tell me you love me anymore, you don't<br><br>touch me or anything. Either you're cheating or you don't love me<br><br>anymore, what ever the case is, I'm gone.<br><br>P.S. If you're trying to find me, don't. Your BROTHER and I are<br><br>moving away to West Virginia together! Have a great life!<br><br>Your EX-Wife</span><br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Dear Ex-Wife<br><br>Nothing has made my day more than receiving your letter. It's true<br><br>that you and I have been married for seven years, although a good<br><br>woman is a far cry from what you've been. I watch sports so much to try<br><br>to drown out from your constant nagging. Too bad that doesn't work.<br><br>I did notice when you cut off all of your hair last week, the first<br><br>thing that came to mind was "You look just like a man!" My mother raised<br><br>me to not say anything if you can't say anything nice.<br><br>When you cooked my favorite meal, you must have gotten me confused<br><br>with<br><br>MY BROTHER, because I stopped eating pork seven years ago and that was his<br><br>favourite food!<br><br>I went to sleep on you when you had on that new negligee<br><br>because<br><br>the price tag was still on it. I prayed that it was a coincidence that<br><br>my<br><br>brother had just borrowed fifty dollars from me that morning and your<br><br>negligee was $49.99.<br><br>After all of this, I still loved you and felt that we could work it<br><br>out.<br><br>So when I discovered that I had hit the lotto for ten million dollars,<br><br>I<br><br>quit my job and bought us two tickets to Jamaica. But when I got home<br><br>you<br><br>were gone. Everything happens for a reason I guess. I hope you have the<br><br>filling life you always wanted.<br><br>By the way,<br><br>my lawyer said with your letter that you wrote, you won't get a<br><br>dime<br><br>from me. So take care.<br><br>P.S. I don't know if I ever told you this but Jack, my brother was<br><br>born<br><br>Jacqueline. I hope that's not a problem.<br><br>Signed Rich As Hell and Free!</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">A BEAUTIFUL ANALOGY! </span><br><br>A man went to a barbershop to have his hair cut and his beard trimmed. As  the barber began to work, they began to have a good conversation.They  talked about so many things and various subjects.<br><br>When they eventually touched on the subject of God, the barber  said:<br>I  don't believe that God exists. "Why do you say that?" asked the<br>customer."Well, you just have to go out in the street to realize that<br>God doesn't exist.<br><br>Tell me, if God exists, would there be so many sick people?<br><br>Would  there be abandoned children?  If God existed, there would be<br><br>neither suffering nor pain. I can't imagine a loving a God who would<br><br>allow all of these things."<br><br>The customer thought for a moment, but didn't respond because he didn't want to start an argument.  The barber finished his job and the customer left the shop.<br><br>Just after he left the barbershop, he saw a man in the street with long,stringy, dirty hair and an untrimmed beard. He looked dirty and  unkempt.  The customer turned back and entered the barber shop  again and he said to the barber: "You know what? Barbers do not  exist."<br><br>How can you say that? asked the surprised barber.  "I<br>am here, and I am a barber. And I just worked on you!"  "No!" the<br>customer exclaimed. "Barbers don't exist because if they did,  there<br>would be no people with dirty long hair and untrimmed beards, like<br>that man  outside."<br><br>Ah, but barbers DO exist!  answered the barber. " What happens,  is,people do not come to me. "<br><br>Exactly!-  affirmed the customer. "That's the point! God, too, DOES<br><br>exist! What happens, is, people don't go to Him and do not look for<br><br>Him.  That's why there's so much pain and suffering in the world."<br><br></div>
