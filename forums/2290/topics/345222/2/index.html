              <p>hmm very wise. i didn't think of that.</p>
              <p>yeah, in the case of risk of injury.. an elderly or pregnant lady is more at risk of irreversible damage..</p>
              <p>but i think i won't give up my seat to just any old person la. i try to, but truthfully, if i see that he's fit and strong, i'll just keep my seat. hmm right or wrong, i dunno.</p>

              <p>i was thinking about this topic when i was taking train yesterday. I realise that singporean dont have any guilt in themselves. They dont feel guilty at all when the elderly,younger children or <span>PREGNANT</span> women. I was very surpise abt it. I mean it’s a big disgrace for singaporean to do such act in public. Once i come accoss some young guy do not want to give up his sit to the elderly man. He still talk back to the public saying that he needed the sit as well as he got alot of things to carry. I think it’s super unacceptable in singapore.</p>
              <p>Next time if u dun wish to give up ur sit for those ppl that needed it. Please think about it what if the person is someone that related to you.</p>
              <p>Once again fuck off to all singaporean who dont give up their sit to those that need them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's why the clever they are the more cunning they become.I think SG stress way of life thought them to behave like one....Even Chinaman can give up their seat to a children</p>
