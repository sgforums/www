Granted they're not as good-looking as tatu but what's hotter than a lesbian twin?? ok....so a couple of lesbians which both are models are hotter.<br><br>But, what makes tegan and sara hot is their music, alternative indie folk rock. They hail Canada and they have toured with many bands and performers over the course of their career, including Hot Hot Heat, Ryan Adams, Rufus Wainwright, Neil Young, and Ben Folds. Their previous catalogue includes If It Was You (2002) and This Business of Art (2000).<br><br>TeganÂ’s childhood dreams included being a clown, working as a veterinarian with polar bears in the Arctic and being a rock star, of course. Sara wanted to be a lawyer and live in Boston strangely enough. Tegan is impossibly stubborn, while Sara is good-natured and loveable.<br><br>Written by: deathy boy with sources from myspace.com/teganandsara<br>Band: Tegan and Sara Quin</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In preparing material for the new album, Tegan and Sara began writing and recording demos in their respective bedrooms during the fall of 2003. Hoping to transfer as much of their self-styled home-recording sound as possible to the new album, these demos would become the official blueprint for the production of the studio album. With 26 new songs written, Tegan and Sara recruited drummer Rob Chursinoff and bassist Chris Carlson for album rehearsals at Vancouver's legendary Renegade Studios. In an unorthodox move designed to stay true to the vision of the demos, Rob was forced to rehearse his drum parts alone to the sound of what became known as Â“the bedroom demos.Â” The resulting mental duress for Rob was reminiscent of the Karate Kid movies, and he was quoted as saying it was a Â“stupidÂ” technique and that he had never had to try such a thing in all his years of Â“legitimateÂ” rocking.<br><br>So after a month of stick throwing, yelling, and screaming (mostly by Rob, age 32), the band anxiously headed into Mushroom Studios to track the albumÂ’s foundation: drums and bass. They were quickly thrilled (translation: relieved) to discover that their strict rehearsal regimen of dynamics exercises, Greek food, magazine reading, and drumming to bedroom demo CDs had produced exciting musical results. Tegan and Sara followed with three weeks of guitar overdubs, vocals, organ, and Casio keyboards, and Matt Sharp (ex-Weezer, The Rentals) flew in to make a sky-fisting guest appearance on Moog and strings. The end result is a record that everyone seems to think is their best yet, in a Â“high-fi/low-fi kind of way.Â”<br><br>-myspace.com/teganandsara</div>
