            <div class='col-md body'>SLIPKNOT<br><br><img src="http://www.slipknot-metal.com/smimages/group48.jpg"><br><br>As inspired by the Slipknot concert which was held on Tuesday, I have decided to write my first review in tribute to the 9 piece Nu-Metal band from the States.<br><br>Known for their extreme and violent music in the music scene, Slipknot have certainly caught the attention of music lovers from all around the world. The group was formed in the summer of 1995 by Paul Gray, Shawn and Anders Colsefini, they released they first EP "Mate.Feed.Kill.Repeat" and received instant recognition. Slipknot, at that time with only 5 members, was then signed by RoadRunnerRecords.<br><br>Anders Colsefini, because of his wedding plans, decided to leave the band and the remaining band members respected his decision and went on their way to find another vocalist. Soon after, Donnie Steele decided that the style the band adopted was not suitable for him and soon after, left the band. Knowing they needed to find band members fast, Joey pulled in one of his former band-mate, Craig.<br><br>After their first major show in 1996, the band decided they needed more two more drummers and hence the arrival of Chris and Shawn. During one of their shows, Joey and Shawn brought along masks from their former band, the Clown and the Kabuki. The other members decided to wear something over their head and stuffs like pantyhose were worn over heads of members without masks and the idea of wearing masks permenently grew. At the same show, they decided to pull in vocalist of Stone Sour, Corey Taylor. Unwilling to leave Stone Sour, Corey Taylor decided to go along with both bands and became the lead vocalist for both bands. Slipknot was officially formed.<br>June 1999, during the era of Limp Bizkit, Slipknot released their first album, entitled "Slipknot".Although airplay was low, the album sold well and was eventually compared to Limp Bizkit. The famous slogan " Limp Bizkit was hard? They are Osmonds." was famous within hard rock fans at that time. They were also invited to Ozzfest yearly since that year.<br><br>Their second album, "IOWA", was released in 2001 and reached billboard Top 5 chart and Topped UK's chart. Their fanbase grew heavily during that period of time and they officially started on their first world tour. After "IOWA", the band members went on a hiatus while members like Joey and Corey worked on their side bands during that period.<br>They regrouped in 2003 when rumours went around about the disbanding of Slipknot, they released their third album "The Sublimal Verses :Vol 3". It reached billboard chart of number 2. They had also changed their masks, due to requests of band members. They went on their "Sublimal Verses" Europe Tour in 2004 and in 2005, they decided to show Asia what Slipknot is all about by heading to Japan and Singapore, and was well recieved. Slipknot made it a point not to reveal their faces to the public, but many members had been photographed unmasked and due to that, their music video, "Before I Forget" was taken, off mask.<br><br>Slipknot was also voted Top 10 Live band.<br><br>Band members listing.<br>0 - Sid (Turn Table)<br>1 - Joey (Drums)<br>2 - Paul (Bass)<br>3 - Chris (Percussions)<br>4 - James (Guitar)<br>5 - Criag (Sample)<br>6 - Shawn (Percussions)<br>7 - Mick (Guitar)<br>8 - Corey (Vocal)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Funeral For A Friend<br><br><img src="http://n2.umicache.com/p/purevolume.com/big/-472-1089821676-ffaf_photo_new2_thumb.jpg"><br><br>Although the music of Funeral for a Friend is imbued with heavy metal and hardcore elements the band are easily catogorised into the modern definition of emo. However, many genre fanaticists would argue that Funeral for a Friend are not true to the original definition of emo; due to their guitar sound, riffs and structuring having more, in terms of sound at least, in common with heavy metal. (Reffered: FFAF official site)<br><br>Funeral For A Friend, usually known as FFAF, is a Emo band from Wales. Formed in 2002, FFAF is a band which achieved quick success after releasing their first EP " Between Order and Model" after being brought together for a few months without knowing each other eariler on. Warner Brother Records was impressed by the 6 piece band and signed a deal with them. After reordering their members, the now 5 man band released their second EP "Four Ways To Scream Your Name" and received success in the UK and soon had a huge fanbase. Their EP was soon out of print and due to the overwhelming response, their EP was printed again, which was rare for new bands.<br><br>The band released their first album "Casually Dressed and Deep In Conversation" in 2003 and due to their unique swaying Emo style, the album was a hit. The album reached 12th in the UK chart and upsetted many when they had won "Kerrang!" Best newcomer award prior to The Darkness, which was expected by many to win the award. After the award, they released a combination of their EP and first album entitled " Seven Ways To Scream Your Name" was released in the States, but was not very well received.<br><br>Success for the band was still awaiting them when they had a chance to do an Opening for the concert of Iron Maiden and their names was widely spreaded around Europe thanks to Iron Maiden.<br><br>In 2004, they recorded and released their second album, entitled "Hours" and was led by their Hit Singles "Streetcar", which recieved alot of airplay in the UK. "Hours" reached 12th place in the billboard chart and they were noticed by medias for their amazing quick success into the music scene. The band soon joined in a tour with Lost Prophets and most of the tickets for the tour were soldouts.<br><br>Many debated over the reason for the quick success of FFAF and many agreed that the main reason for their success was the support of rock magazine "Kerrang!" who promoted them and played lots of FFAF's music in their own radio station.<br><br>Band Member Listing<br><br>Matt - Vocal<br>Kris - Guitar<br>Darren - Guitar<br>Gareth - Bass<br>Ryan - Drums[/img]</div>

Sounding like an 80s rock favourite, Guns N Roses, this is definitely what you hear from this unmastered EP.<br><br>This 5 song EP is a pretty good effort from Ronin, the first three songs had much feel and energy. The first song, 'Revolution', is a very typical 80s rock song, packed with heavy distorted rock rhythm and great riffing frenzy from the two guitarists. The vocals are really good for a rock outfit; snarly vocals with an edge that does lift the song somewhat.The 3rd track, 'Crazy Son' is a rock ballad about how the protaganist wants to be in a rock band. It tends towards hedonism but not quite yet. It starts with nice caressing arpeggios, and then it gently leads to the heavier side of rock ballads. The song builds up to a full blown rock song with a pretty cool solo to boot. What I liked about Ronin is their huge efforts. One can tell that the band is competent, specially on the guitars. The songs truly sound like it was written in the 80s.<br><br>The vocals are terrifyingly snarly with the rock edge all rock singers from that era would have.<br><br>On the downside, some of their songs did have a lack of feel, but then again, many 80s rock bands had that same problem. In this case, it is probably due to the lack of a rock steady groove and too much focus on the technicalities in the studio.Truly a fine rock effort. Hopefully, the fully mastered EP will have more kick and drive, more refinement in the mixing yet the same rawness in the unmastered EP.[/img]</div>

His self-titled debut album is an unexpectedly smooth ride into town. Produced by the artsy-clever Mitchell Froom and Jeff Dawson, the album is a straight-forward task master, highlighted by PowterÂ’s bright and simple piano melodies that recall the lite-soul groove of Â’70s AM radio. Â“Lie To MeÂ” surrenders to a funky Jackson Five falsetto, whereas Â“Jimmy Gets HighÂ” with its melodramatic strings yearns for Curtis Mayfield while settling into a lush Carpenters-like production. ThereÂ’s the occasional attempt to shake things up like the extra raspy and bluesy strut of Â“Suspect,Â” but mostly PowterÂ’s on a mission to coo those seductive sweet nothings in your ear.<br><br>from yahoo music</div>

It's not a bad spin but one without the sense of adventure that gave that previous set magic. They've left intact a few killer left turns into template tweaking here like the kids' music steel drum hook on "In The Morning" and the choogling rev-up that closes "Come Home." But on the whole, the Coral's trade has made them less rumbling and more meandering, more coherent but less mysterious.<br><br>--Jeff Vrabel</div>
