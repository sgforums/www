            <div class='col-md body'>Nirvana changed my life. Grunge, the genre that Nirvana single handedly made big, but Grunge is more than just music. If you listen to Nirvana, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam or even Alice In Chains, they are one hell of different sounds but yet they were all once classified as grunge. I came to understand that Grunge is not a trend but it is more a state of mind. It is not what music you listen to, it is not what you wear (although there are similarities on what grunge people might wear) but it is more of expression of one self. Like when Eddie Vedder said that they just want to do their stuff and it came to a shock that suddenly a whole group of people identified with their stuff and suddenly they became the spokesman for that group of people. They didnt like it at all.<br><br>Grunge changed my life when I first heard Nirvana in 1990. Because it brought a whole new way of me living my life. I just wanted to express myself without the need for people to identify with me. I just wanted to do it for myself, not for stardom, not for fame or not for anything else. Of cos, as I grow up, I threw away all the "bad" things that seem to be attributed to grunge like "dirtiness", negativity etc.... but the essence of grunge will always be how I live my life.</div>
