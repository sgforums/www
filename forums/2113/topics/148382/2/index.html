Sure maybe its your choice ultimately, but nobody enjoys losing a friend or family member in this way, so they will try to keep u alive. its only natural isn't it?

Each person deals with pain/pressure differently and each person's tolerance level is different. Some people drink, some turn to friends, religion or family. For a person to even contemplate suicide I would think the problem he's facing, to him, might be so insurmountable at that point of time that there is no other way he can deal with it.
