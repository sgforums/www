            <div class='col-md body'>CHTHONIC is derived from the Greek god of the underworld with the phonetic translation into Mandarin as 閃靈 or Shan-ling.<br><br>Formed in 1995, CHTHONICÂ’s melodies can be characterized as extreme metal with a central inspiration and folklore coming from the black metal movement. CHTHONIC uses the traditional Chinese stringed instrument, Er- hu, which can be compared to an eastern violin. The sound of the Er-hu is one of grief and sorrow, which CHTHONIC accompanies with heavy drums, guitar strings blending into a harmony. The music undulates and flows with the tempo of ancient mythology, and often, through lyrics, conveys an abbreviated version of a traditional myth or legend. Freddy Lin, lead vocalist, uses his voice to tear and rip melodies, using both ancient and modern language and energy which mixes easily with the music. The music swings from cool despair, to the heat of shock and anger. By wavering between these emotions, and CHTHONIC is unparalleled in the world of black metal song composition.<br><br>CHTHONIC has achieved many awards in Taiwan and has attracted the attention of many overseas audiences. In 1996, CHTHONIC received the Â”Golden Melody AwardÂ”(Jin Qu jiang).<br><br>In 1999 the band issued its first album, Where Ancestors Souls Are Gathered and embarked upon a tour of 15 colleges and universities throughout Taiwan. In 2000, the band issued its second Album, 9th Empryean, and was invited to perform at the Fuji Rock Festival which was one stop on the Ghost Moon Asia Tour that visited other cities such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia. In 2001 the band held CHTHONIC Five Years of Hell and signed a contract with a US-label, Night Fall records for the English release of 9th Empyrean.<br><br>In 2002, CHTHONIC spent a month in Denmark recording new material, eventually releasing their third album Relentless Recurrence with an April appearance at the US Metal Meltdown Festival, receiving a special award from the Internet site for the festival as Best Band.<br><br>In July of 2003, CHTHONIC was voted Best Band at the Jin qu jiang , which is the most famous music awards over East Asia , CHTHONIC received the awards from Taiwan president Ah bian</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>..... gooood intro!! dead man, never knew such band exist in Taiwan. I had downlaoded a couple of their songs, their guitars work liked Candlemass and The Emperor, the rest of their styles are a mixture of dimmu borgir, laguna coil, nightwish and cradle of filth. The only difference is the er-hu, it adds a touch of sorrowfullness and despair to the dark melody.<br><br>Go check out "Wednesday 13" , formed by the vocalist of "Murderdolls", its a dark/death/black metal band. They sing everythings about death!!! Suits you very well  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
