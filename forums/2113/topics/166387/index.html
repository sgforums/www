            <div class='col-md body'>..... HIM was around since 1997, the band was overshadowed and considered second rated because during this time Cradle of Filth and Marilyn Manson were the rage of dark, black and goth rock.<br><br>In 2004, just when Cradle of Filth and MM were slowing down, HIM released the BEST of album : And love said NO. MTV picked two songs The joy and sorrow &amp; Your sweet 666 for heavy play in their rock channel, and suddenly everything just happens for them. Lots of rock magazines like Metal-edge, Circus, Kerrang and Revolver gave them plenty of reviews and front cover features. As all these magazines are easily available here, so i guessed the locals started to noticed HIM!! This is the main reason i started to check them out and also after hearing the songs Your sweet 666 and In joy and sorrow on Mtv. Furthermore the song Wicked Game went up the rock chart too.<br><br>In fact i had heard of HIM much earlier, but i was heavily into the music of Marilyn Manson. I dun think local radio play his songs, our local radio hardly play any rock songs. Yeahh you are right Mr dead Man, HIM is quite popular at the moment over here, but some still prefer My Chemical Romance.<br><br>Sooo why you like HIM? When do you start listening to them? Your fav tracks?<br><br>My fav tracks for HIM ; And love said no, Buried alive by love, Solitary man, In joy and sorrow and Gone with the sin.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
