Success-starved Benfica fans would not find such comparisons too fanciful. They fell in love with Mantorras as soon as they saw him turn on the style in pre-season. Eusebio himself says of the youngster: 'He has special qualities and is set for a great future.'<br><br>He has turned down moves to internazionale and is rumored to be targetted by barca. he was the catalyst for angola's u-20 african cup success in 2001<br><br><strong>Togo</strong>: Sheyi emmanuel adebayor<br><br>The most well known player in the squad, the tall striker plays for as monaco and was a target for many clubs this summer including everton. he has already scored seven goals in the qualifier. With many togo players not even starters at their club, adebayor will be the one to carry the team on his shoulders.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Ghana</strong>: Ali sulley muntari<br><br>Sulley Ali Muntari's ball-winning ability and tactical acumen make him a key figure in Udinese Calcio's midfield, with a powerful shot from long distance and set-pieces. He was an integral part of the ghana u-20 team that finished second in 2001's fifa youth championship<br><br>He made his Serie A debut in 2002 at the San Siro stadium against AC Milan when he was just 18. He appeared 12 times in Serie A during the 2002/03 season and 23 times the next campaign. In 2004/05, He made 33 appearances Serie A, scoring his first two goals for the club, and also earned his UEFA Cup debut as Udinese finished fourth.<br><br>Just before joining Udinese, Muntari was on the verge of joining Manchester United FC, but Liberty Professionals failed to agree a fee with the English club.<br><br><strong>Tunisia</strong>: Dos santos<br><br>The nippy striker with the number 11 on his back was a key figure when  Tunisia won their first African continental championship on home soil at the beginning of 2004.<br><br>In the current World Cup qualifying, the highly skilled striker has again provided everybody with ample proof of his goal instinct. In the 7-0 win against Malawi on 26 March 2005, Santos amazingly hit the back of the net four times equalling the African record set by CameroonÂ’s football legend Roger Milla.<br><br>Afterwards, French clubs also started to sit up and take notice of the young Brazilian. In 2002, Santos moved to the then second division club FC Sochaux and was immediately promoted with the Â“yellowsÂ”. Santos has in the meantime formed a goal-scoring duo with his Brazilian Â“countrymanÂ”  Ilan. In the previous season he scored 14 league goals in addition to playing a  decisive part in the League Cup win.<br><br><strong>Ivory coast</strong>: didier drogba<br>Chelsea's record signing is slowly but surely proving himself at the premiership, before that he was already a hit at marseille scoring against real madrid in the champs league</div>

However, no one denies the fact that the young keeper, whose regular place is unchallenged with both the national team and his club, is progressing rapidly towards the lofty goals he has set.<br></div>

He finishned as the tournament's top goalscorer. His rise to fame forced Barcelona to offer the youngster a new deal that will keep him at the club until 2012 as well as increasing his buy-out clause to Â€150million, the same level as Ronaldinho.<br><br>The Camp Nou outfit have also assured Messi of a place in the first-team squad after other clubs began to sniff around to see if there was any discontent on the part of the player whilst he remained on the B-team roster.<br><br><strong>Ecuador</strong>: Christian Lara<br><br>When Lara's opportunity came last June, the 25-year-old seized it with alacrity. Ecuador were facing the mighty Argentina in a vital 2006 FIFA World Cup GermanyÂ™ qualifier, and someone was needed to fill the considerable shoes of the injured Edison Mendez. Faced with the dilemma, coach Luis Suarez decided to put his faith in the gifted attacking midfielder.<br><br>Everything went so well, in fact, that no sooner had he come on at the start of the second half than he scored his first goal for his country. Not content with that, he set up Ecuador's second and was named man of the match.<br><br>Even before his stunning display against Argentina, his performances had earned him the following write-up in the Ecuadorian press: "An intelligent, lightning-fast player blessed with a great change of pace, the ability to break forward quickly or roam across the front line and equally adept with either foot." With calls for Suarez to give him a first-team place growing louder by the day, Lara is even being compared to another slightly-built playmaker, Robinho, the new jewel in the Brazilian crown.</div>

Word of his prodigious talent reached Werder Bremen chairman Jurgen Born during one of his frequent trips to Paraguay, and so he decided to check out the player himself. Such was the impression made by the youngster that Born asked him there and then if he would come to Germany for a trial. Though barely 18, Valdez did not hesitate for a moment, setting off for the Old Continent in December of that year.<br><br>The trial was a success and Haedo Valdez began 2002 playing for Werder Bremen's second team, where he scored a very respectable 15 goals in 30 games.
