            <div class='col-md body'>Children Of Bodom<br><br><img src="http://us.ent1.yimg.com/images.launch.yahoo.com/000/010/424/10424455.jpg"><br><br>Yes it's spelled bodom not boredom as some record stores spell their name.<br>Children Of Bodom was originally formed in 1993 by Alexi and Jaska in Espoo, Finland. Until their debut album "Something Wild" was released in the end of 1997 they went under the name Inearthed. They released two demos before recording their first full-length album. "Something Wild" was at first supposed to be released on a small Belgian label but Sami Tenetz from Thy Serpent gave the recording to Ewo RytkÃ¶nen, the boss of Spinefarm Records, who signed them immediately for a three album deal. This was when they changed their name (perhaps to avoid the contract with the Belgian label?) to Children Of Bodom. The lake Bodom was the scene of a multiple murder on the 5th of June 1960 which is still not solved. Shortly after the Spinefarm release of "Something Wild" in November 1997 the band was offered a contract with Nuclear Blast for European distribution.<br><br>The band now recorded a new song called "Children Of Bodom" which was released as a limited single and stayed #1 on the Finnish charts for eight weeks without any real promotion of it. In February 1998 the band went on tour with Nuclear Blast label mates Hypocrisy, Benediction and Covenant. The keyboard player Janne could not participate on this tour because of school exams so Erna, a friend of the band, replaced him. In September they went on tour again with Night In Gales, Dismember, Agathodaimon and Raise Hell. This time Alexi's girlfriend Kimberly Goss (Dimmu Borgir, Therion) helped them out on keyboards since Janne could not join them this time either.<br><br>Between the two tours they had been writing new material and they now recorded thweir second album "Hatebreeder" which was preceded by the single "Downfall", including a cover of Stone's "No Commands". The second album was released in early 1999 and in June Children Of Bodom played three sold out shows in Japan. In September they went on tour in Europe again with In Flames, Dark Tranquillity and Arch Enemy and this time Janne actually had the possibility to go with them.<br><br>In the beginning of May 2000 their new single "Hate Me" was released and once again they were honored with the golden spot of the Finnish charts. In July Children Of Bodom crossed the Atlantic to play at the Milwaukee Metal Fest XIV. On the 30th of October "Follow The Reaper" was released in Finland with a world wide release through Nuclear Blast in January 2001 (Europe) and February 2001 (USA). The first week resulted in more than 50 000 copies sold in Middle-Europe. The chart positions were 3rd in Finland, 46th in Germany, 88th in France and 38th in Austria. In the beginning of 2001 Children Of Bodom toured with Primal Fear and Sacred Steel in Europe but the US tour was unfortunately cancelled.<br><br>Members: Alexi Laiho(guitars,vocals)<br>Jaska Raatikainen(drums)<br>Henkka SeppÃ¤lÃ¤ (bass)<br>Janne Wirman(keyboards)<br><br>Source from:www.tartareandesire.com/bands/childrenofbodom.html<br>Edited by: deathy boy<br>Downloads: their recent cover of britney's opps i did it again<br>here:  <a href="http://%20http://s120908865.onlinehome.us/mp3...id_it_again.mp3" rel="nofollow"> http://s120908865.onlinehome.us/mp3...id_it_again.mp3</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Staind- Chapter V<br><br><img src="http://us.ent1.yimg.com/images.launch.yahoo.com/000/010/462/10462815.jpg"><br><br>It has been said that first impressions last a life time. Luckily for Staind, some only last for about 45 minutes. After a volatile disagreement with Limp Bizkit's<br><br>Fred Durst over some of Staind's early cover art, it seemed their big break had walked out the door. Fortunately by the time Durst had witnessed Staind's intense live show, he was ready to exchange phone numbers.<br><br>Staind's story began in the New England area when vocalist Aaron Lewis and guitarist Mike Mushok met at a Christmas party in 1993. Mushok was able to bring drummer Jon Wysocki into the fold, and Lewis' connection with a bass player (now no longer with the band) completed the early lineup.<br><br>Extensive touring of the northeast with other established metal acts helped them sell over 2000 copies of their self released debut in just over a year. They were primed for their big break, and on October 23, 1997, the hard work paid off.<br><br>At a show in Hartford, CT, Staind was all set to open for Limp Bizkit when Bizkit singer Fred Durst raised a stink over cover art on Staind's self-released CD. After a heated conversation over whether or not Staind were Satan worshippers, Durst forcefully returned the disc to the band, and walked away. 45 minutes later Durst was back, not to further the argument, but to make sure he kept in contact with Staind. Blown away by their live show, Durst exchanged phone numbers, and Staind were now on their way. All they had to do was wait.<br><br>After reworking the new material and a successful live show, Durst contacted the head of Flip Records, and arranged a meeting for Staind with the label. While in Los Angeles, a three-song sampler was recorded, and by the time February rolled around in 1998, the band had a record deal. After playing the Vans Warped Tour, they began work on their first album, Dysfunction. The album was produced by Terry Date (Deftones, Pantera, Soundgarden), and was released April 13, 1999. A tour with Kid Rock followed that spring and later the band reunited with good friends Limp Bizkit for a summer tour. Their follow-up, Break the Cycle, enjoyed a prolonged visit at the number one spot on U.S. charts in 2001. Smash hits like "It's Been Awhile," "Fade," "For You" and "Epiphany" catapulted the band into the mainstream, leaving their 2002 DVD MTV Unplugged to go gold. Staind released 14 Shades of Grey in spring 2003, and after a two-year break returned with Chapter V, named to include their self-released debut in the Staind canon. ~ Chris True, All Music Guide<br><br>Members:Aaron lewis(vocals)<br>Mike lewis(guitars)<br>Jon Wysocki(drums)<br>Johnny april(bass)<br>Streams:the new video from their new album,<br><br><a href="http://wm.atlrec.com/staind/video/righthere_450.wmv" rel="nofollow">http://wm.atlrec.com/staind/video/righthere_450.wmv</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.the-gothicworld.de/cdreviews/06-2003/him-band.jpg"><br><br>Forming in Finland in the midst of 1995, H.I.M. (His Infernal Majesty) portrays a true quest for the reinvention of goth rock. Setting as their main artistic ambition the creation of songs in the similar path of bands such as Sisters of Mercy and the Mission U.K., H.I.M. uses a distinct compound of scowling melodies and mystical love stories' inspired lyrics to mark their musical ground. Vocalist and songwriter Ville Hermani Vallo was the band's founding member, alongside MigÃ© Amour (bass), Lily Lazer (guitar), Gas Lipstick (drums), and Zoltan Pluto (keyboards). The EP 666 Ways to Love, the group's first recording, showed up in late 1996, attaining considerable praise within the Scandinavian market.<br><br>One year later, Greatest Love Songs, Vol. 666 solidified their cult status throughout the region and celebrated the band's cover of "Wicked Game," a Chris Isaak original. It was at that time that the group gained a rising fan base all across Europe, entering an enduring and extensive touring season to even more wide-ranging acclaim. Three years later, Razorblade Romance, H.I.M.'s second album, hit record stores, again achieving substantial results and strengthening their indubitable recognition.<br><br>With production credits featuring John Fryer, who previously worked with crews like White Zombie and Nine Inch Nails, the record substantiated the squad's better acclaim all across Europe. H.I.M. then suffered its first lineup change when Pluto left, later being replaced by Emerson Burton. Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights, the band's third full-length disc, arrived in late 2001, confirming the Finnish crew's better recognition and strengthening the band's growing legion of fans. ~ Mario Mesquita Borges, All Music Guide<br><br>HIM also owes part of their success to skater jackass Bam Margera who uses the band's music his shows and on jackass.

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.afireinside.net/band/images/band_photo.jpg"><br><br>AFI- A Fire Inside<br><br>Although often described as a cross between goth rock and hardcore punk, by the time of their commercial breakthrough in 2003, the Ukiah, California, USA-based quartet AFI (an acronym for A Fire Inside) started out as a straight ahead skate/punk band. Formed in 1991, while its members were still attending Ukiah High School, the band has experienced several line-up changes since their inception, although members Davey Havok (vocals) and Adam Carson (drums) have been present since the beginning. With Geoff Kresge (bass) and Markus Stopholes (guitar) in tow, AFI issued Answer That And Stay Fashionable and Very Proud Of Ya, before the singularly named Hunter replaced Kresge as AFI's bass player.<br><br>By the end of 1997, AFI had issued their follow-up, Shut Your Mouth And Open Your Eyes. New guitarist Jade Puget assumed the role of main songwriter on 1999's Black Sails In The Sunset, adding a welcome melodic slant to the band's hardcore thrash. AFI received some unexpected added exposure when Offspring covered one of their songs, "Totalimmortal', for a movie soundtrack, and by the time of 2000"s The Art Of Drowning, the quartet had grabbed the attention of major labels. AFI's much-hyped major label debut with DreamWorks Records, Sing The Sorrow, was issued in March 2003, and promptly went into the US Top 10.<br><br>Members: Davey Havok-vocals<br>Jade Puget -guitars<br>Adam Carson- Drums<br>Geoff kresge-Bass<br><br>Streams: <a href="http://music.channel.aol.com/artist/main.adp?_pgtyp=pdct&amp;artistid=203376" rel="nofollow">http://music.channel.aol.com/artist/main.adp?_pgtyp=pdct&amp;artistid=203376</a><br><br>Source: http://www.mp3-find.com/biography-AFI-266</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The white stripes<br><br><img src="http://us.ent1.yimg.com/images.launch.yahoo.com/000/009/583/9583914.jpg"><br><br>Detroit minimalist rock duo (specifically, southwest Detroit minimalist rock duo) the White Stripes --<br><br>Jack White, guitar and vocals, Meg White, drums -- formed in 1997 (Bastille Day, to be precise) with the idea of making simple rock &amp; roll music. From the red and white peppermint candy motif of their debut singles, self-titled album, and stage show to their on-the-surface rudimentary style, they succeeded wildly and immediately with that mission. Their first recordings were a mix of garage rock, blues, and the occasional show tune. In frontman Jack (a former drummer for Detroit country outfit Goober &amp; the Peas), the White Stripes have a formidable songwriter, guitar player, and vocalist capable of both morphing between styles and changing the musical styles themselves; ranging from the folk blues of Blind Willie McTell to soaring Kinks-esque pop and narrative pop tunes worthy of Cole Porter and into deepest Captain Beefheart territory within the span of 15 minutes is not an uncommon listening experience with either the White Stripes live show or on record. In drummer Meg, the White Stripes have a minimalist percussionist who seems to sense intuitively exactly when to not play. The White Stripes are grounded in punk and blues, but the undercurrent to all of their work has been the aforementioned striving for simplicity, a love of American folk music, and a careful approach to intriguing, emotional, and evocative lyrics not found anywhere else in the modern punk, or garage rock (or amongst post-modern "blues" practitioners such as Jon Spencer, for that matter).<br><br>While they may have sprung from the Detroit rock scene (and they remain regular fixtures on the Detroit club circuit with Jack producing or working with many Detroit-area bands), the White Stripes quickly gained a national following after two successive tours with indie rockers Pavement and Sleater-Kinney in 1999 and 2000. The White Stripes released their second LP, De Stijl, in 2000 and it further spread the group's reputation. They followed its release with successful tours of Japan and Australia and entered the Memphis studio of renowned producer Doug Easley for 2001's White Blood Cells. The album was a critical smash and the White Stripes soon found themselves, along with the Strokes and the Hives, at the forefront of the new wave of rock &amp; roll bands poised to take over the world. The band certainly did their best to acheive world domination, appearing on Late Night with David Lettterman, being written about in Time, the New Yorker and Entertainment Weekly, playing the MTV Movie Awards and having their video for "Fell in Love with a Girl" in heavy rotation on MTV. They also made the tough decision to jump to a major label; White Blood Cells was reissued on V2 in January of 2002 and their first two records followed suit in June. The White Stripes truly became big time rock stars when their "Fell in Love with a Girl" clip was nominated for four MTV Video Awards including Best Video of the Year (alongside Eminem and *NSYNC!), Breakthrough Video, Best Special Effects in a Video and Best Editing in a Video. That summer the group also played four triumphant shows with the Strokes, two apiece in the bands' respective hometowns. In spring 2003 their fourth full-length Elephant -- recorded in two weeks at London's Toerag Studio and dedicated to "the death of the sweetheart" -- arrived to nearly unanimous critical acclaim. In 2005, the Stripes returned with Get Behind Me Satan, a dizzyingly diverse album that spanned disco-metal and light, marimba-driven pop and was written and recorded in two weeks that spring. ~ Chris Handyside, All Music Guide</div>

Long-time friends Dan Donegan (guitar), Mike Wengren (drums), and Fuzz (bass) played together in Chicago for some time before hooking up with singer David Draiman around 1997. Draiman had grown up in a religious family from which he rebelled, being expelled from five boarding schools in his adolescence. His anger found an outlet in the thrashing sound of Disturbed, and the band built up a following on Chicago's South Side before a demo tape led to their signing to Giant Records, which released their debut album, The Sickness, in March 2000.<br><br>The band gained more fans and exposure playing the main stage of the 2001 Ozz Fest, then breaking away to do their own self-described "victory lap" around the U.S. that fall. Also during this period, they managed to record a vicious new version of wrestler Steve Austin's theme song that was so good it managed to receive radio play, and was one of the many bands announced to work on a high profile Faith No More tribute album. The band stepped into the studio after stepping off of the road and began work on a new disc that would reflect their growth as a band.<br><br>Feeling experimental, the group worked with producer Johnny K. and mixer Andy Wallace in order to create an album that could compare to other classic metal records they admired. Amplifying their fondness for groups like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Pantera, and Soundgarden, Believe was released in the fall of 2002 and was immediately recognized as a heavier, more varied, and ultimately superior record to their debut. ~ William Ruhlmann and Bradley Torreano, All Music Guide<br>Written by William Ruhlmann<br><br>source from:launch.yahoo.com originally by all music guide</div>
