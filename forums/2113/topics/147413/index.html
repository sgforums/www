It's the sound of a band weaned on the heady concrete glamour of The Stones, Dexys, Curtis Mayfield, and Happy Mondays. In love and in debt - the raw materials required to soundtrack a life of box-fresh Adidas, Berwick Street vinyl, and the black economy.<br><br>Recorded at Hard-Fi's Cherry Lips studio (a former 24 hour cab office in the work-a-day granite-grey environs of Staines ) and produced by Wolsey White ("The Phil Spector of lo-fi" - Kerrang) and the band themselves, 'Stars Of CCTV' is Hard-Fi's debut offering, featuring forthcoming single 'Cash Machine'.<br><br>The video for the single is already gaining widespread notoriety, the band having dodged Terminal 3 security to spend two hours performing 30ft below incoming planes at the arse-end of the main Heathrow runway - the kind of'guerrilla gig' that makes The Libertines' best efforts come off like a public school fete.<br><br>Members:Richard Archer (vocals)<br>Ross Phillips (guitar)<br>Kai Stephens (bass)<br>Steve Kemp (drums)<br><br>Source from:www.hard-fi.com/biog.html<br><br>Downloads:<a href="http://www.peoplesound.com/artist/hard-fi" rel="nofollow">http://www.peoplesound.com/artist/hard-fi</a></div>

TheyÂ’ve stuck to their roots of playing laid back music. Since they were formed, theyÂ’ve received many praises from their fans and other musicians. Over the years, theyÂ’ve been invited to play at major music festival like formoz festival.<br><br>At one of their gigs, musician Chen Wei, by chance happened to hear lead singer, Summer. He was astonished; he wanted to sign her and then finally realized that Summer has always been with Relax One making music. The past few years, SummerÂ’s vocals has attracted many record companies but she always insisted on being signed on with her band, in the years band members had to serve national service, she could only wait. Peers called her being stupid, but she felt making music with her band is the real rock spirit.<br><br>When all the band members had finished their national service and assembled their debut album was finally able to be released.<br><br>Dun asked me why they dun translate their chinese name of qing song wan to easy play. i guess that taiwan doesn't have good translators.<br><br>Members: Summer- Vocals<br>Ah Gui- Drums<br>Xiao mao- Guitars<br>Xiao ren guo- Bass<br>translated by:deathy boy<br>Original article here:  <a href="http://www.avex.com.tw/relaxone/album.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.avex.com.tw/relaxone/album.htm</a><br>Streams: <a href="http://www.avex.com.tw/relaxone/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.avex.com.tw/relaxone/index.htm</a></div>
