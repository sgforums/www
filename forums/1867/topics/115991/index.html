            <div class='col-md body'>overall rating<br>93 / 100<br><br>Donald Trump is not only one of the world's richest men, but one of its most recognizable. Add to that one of the most debonair, extravagant, and cocky. But, you'd be hard pressed not find a working man that doesn't admire him. Despite a privileged upbringing, he didn't inherit anything, and went on to fame and fortune, thanks to his business accomplishments (and his love life).<br><br>What makes Donald Trump truly remarkable is how he pulled off one of the most remarkable business turnarounds in history. After accumulating a multi-billion dollar fortune, he saw most of it wiped away under massive loan payments (his companies were reportedly carrying $8.8 billion in losses at their worst), only to regain it after making some very clever business moves.<br><br>The famous bachelor accumulated buildings, yachts, and properties like a kid acquires baseball cards. At his peak he had the Taj Mahal, Trump Plaza, Plaza Hotel, and a yacht allegedly worth $100 million. He's also the owner of the Miss Universe, Miss Teen USA and Miss USA beauty pageants.<br><br>He also has 4 books that have made the best-seller list. He connects with the common man. He lives the life many of us ideally seek. He is the poster boy for Lifestyles of the Rich &amp; Famous. He is... you get the point.<br><br>Is there little wonder then that he decided to flirt with the idea of running for President for the Reform Party? What else would you expect from a man as likely to appear on the cover of Business Week as on National Enquirer? One thing is for sure, "The Donald" makes for interesting press.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>personality &amp; talent<br>93 / 100<br><br>Donald Trump is a throwback to the Greedy '80s, a real life Gordon Gekko from the movie Wall Street (not the corporate raider part, but the charismatic, media-savvy part).<br><br>He is driven, arrogant, intelligent, and he understands the psychology of real estate speculation. He knows the power of branding, and makes sure his name is on his property, lest he miss an important opportunity to promote himself. He even licensed his name to a Seoul building for a cool $5 million.<br><br>His great talent as a businessman is turning bad real estate properties into gold mines (though he overpaid for some properties that resulted in his near complete downfall).<br><br>That talent is what made him rich, but there are a lot of rich people in the world, what made Trump stand out is his outspokenness, and his direct and honest (if misguided at times) public commentaries.<br><br>But Trump has a good heart, and is a regular contributor to charities. Our favorite story is about an unemployed auto mechanic who once helped Trump get his limo functioning again after it stalled on the highway. The man had no money, yet he didn't accept any payment for his services. Trump was duly impressed by his generosity, so the next day he sent flowers to the mechanic's wife, and a letter certifying that the man's mortgage had been paid off in full.<br><br>Trump is equally adept at speaking his mind, among his favorite targets are Bill Clinton. He has regularly criticized Bill Clinton for cheating on his wife with a woman as ugly as Monica Lewinsky. He even said that if Clinton had been caught with a slinky model instead of Monica Lewinsky, "he'd have been a hero." How can't you love the guy?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>woman magnetism<br><span style="color: red;">96 / 100</span><br><br>His appeal obviously doesn't have much to do with physical attractiveness, or his comb-over hair. In fact, some of his ex-girlfriends have gone public regarding his hair loss paranoia, as if it had a Samson effect on his success.<br><br>He never has a lack of beautiful women parading around. His propensity for dating models is well known, as are his high-profile divorces to Marla Maples and Ivana Trump. Though he could have a million single women at his doorstep, chances are if you don't look like a replica of Christy Turlington, you don't stand a chance.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>coolness factor<br>89 /100<br><br>Donald Trump is a player. A real player; a high-roller who can beat you at anything you throw at him. A day in his shoes would be the highlight of anyone's life. No one would hesitate to trade places with "The Donald" (not that Trump would let that happen of course). He isn't trendy or sleek, but in the business world, he is as cool as they come.</div>
