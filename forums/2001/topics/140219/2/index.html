She rebels by running away.<br><br>By Tan Mae Lynn<br>October 09, 2005   </span><br><br><img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2005-10-08/2return.jpg"><br><br>WHENEVER former Miss Singapore Universe 2001 Jaime Teo reads or hears of runaway teens, she reacts with a mix of sadness and regret.<br><br>And she has been feeling that way more frequently lately because of the spate of runaway teens in the news.<br><br>Their stories bring back memories of the days when she, too, was a runaway kid.<br><br>Her escapade was no fun.<br><br>She can't help but think to herself when an appeal goes out for a runaway to return: 'If only they know what they're getting themselves into.'<br><br>As a teenager, she had a strained relationship with her mother. Quarrels were frequent.<br><br>It all came to a head when, at 17, she ran away from home.<br><br>She stayed away for almost eight years.<br><br>Fortunately though, Jaime, whose parents divorced before she was a year old, managed to reconcile with her mother after about a year.<br><br>But she stayed away from her mother even though their relationship slowly improved.<br><br>Now 28, she's back home with her and their relationship has never been better.<br><br><strong>NOT WORTH IT </strong><br><br>Jaime said the experience of being away from home was not pleasant. It could easily have been avoided.<br><br>Jaime, who has an elder sister, told The New Paper: 'My mum was very strict with us and she imposed curfew... At that time, it was all about me wanting to go out and have fun and she wanting me to be home.<br><br>'I wanted to be out partying. When you're out partying so much, you can't get up for school.'<br><br>One of her favourite hangouts was Zouk, where she'd dance the night away with her secondary school friends from St Anthony's Canossian Convent.<br><br>Even though her playful ways had affected her school-work, she didn't think it was a serious matter. She then went on to Serangoon Junior College.<br><br>Jaime recalled: 'Once, my mum set a curfew and said I must be home by 11pm. I came home exactly at 11pm, only to see her angry. She said: 'Why must you come back precisely at the last minute?'<br><br>'I think it was after that I just decided to leave home.'<br><br>Jaime ran over to her friend's flat in a neighbouring block where she was to stay for almost two years.<br><br>She said her friend's family did not mind because it was better than having her run away again.<br><br>She switched from JC to complete her studies at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. She then got a job as a sales executive and found a place of her own.<br><br>While she refused to speak to her mother for a year after leaving home, Jaime kept in contact with her elder sister, Angie, and some relatives.<br><br><strong>IGNORED MUM AT BUS-STOP</strong><br><br>Through them, her mother knew where she was staying and how she was doing.<br><br>Her grandmother also showed up at her friend's place once, to try and persuade her to go home. But, still unhappy with having to live with her mother's rules, Jaime refused.<br><br>One day, she bumped into her mother at the bus-stop.<br><br>'I was walking to the MRT station past the bus-stop and my mum was there. I saw her and she saw me,' she said.<br><br>'Both of us knew we saw each other, but I just ignored her... At that time, I think both of us were still very angry with each other, and we're both very headstrong.'<br><br>When Jaime left home, she was still studying computer science at Ngee Ann. She worked as a waitress after school to make ends meet.<br><br>Reconciliation with her mother was a slow process.<br><br>After a year away from home, Jaime visited her mum during Chinese New Year. From then, she made peace and slowly began the process of mending the relationship.<br><br>Jaime said she didn't want to move back home so soon because the wounds were only beginning to heal. She felt it would be better to take things slowly.<br><br>On hindsight and with wisdom that comes with growing up, she said she understands now why her mother was strict.<br><br>She said: 'Our relationship now has moved to a different level. I didn't see this side of her when I was younger.<br><br>'And she couldn't show this side of herself too because she's a single parent, she had to take on both roles as mother and father while trying to make ends meet.'<br><br><strong>HEARTACHE </strong><br><br>Jaime believes that their close relationship now could have been achieved without all the stress and heartache she put her family and herself through.<br><br>'It's an experience that's still painful when I think about it... I still could have got to where I am now without all of that,' she said.<br><br><strong>Tough for mum: I blamed myself Tough for runaway: I had to juggle school and work</strong><br><br>SHE ran away to be free. Free from her mother's restrictive rules.<br>But what Jaime Teo found out was that life away from home was no bed of roses. She hardly had any time for herself and had to struggle with studies and a part-time job to keep body and soul together.<br><br>After school, she would rush to work in a restaurant in Clark Quay. She needed the job to pay for food and transport.<br><br>The job, which paid $7 an hour, barely covered her daily expenses. She worked about four to five hours a night, knocking off at midnight. She said: 'I remember being very tired all the time.'<br><br>During the school holidays, she would work full-time as a receptionist at an architectural firm and earn about $1,500 a month to pay her school fees.<br><br>While her schoolmates and friends were enjoying their school holidays, Jaime worked through the vacation period.<br><br>'It was very hard trying to manage studying full-time and working part-time,' she said. 'My attendance in school was really bad, I nearly dropped out of the poly in the final year.'<br><br>But, Jaime said, with help and encouragement from her friends, she managed to pull through school. After working late nights she often couldn't wake up in time for school.<br><br>Her friends pushed her, even making wake-up phonecalls.<br><br>Tough for mum: I blamed myself Tough for runaway: I had to juggle school and work<br><br>SHE ran away to be free.

But it doesn't always turn out that way,' she said. 'I know of others who take the wrong path and don't have such a happy ending.'<br><br>Jaime said she had been fortunate to have been able to return to the same restaurant and office to work throughout her school years when she was out on her own.<br><br>Her waitressing job was at an upmarket restaurant so customers, she said, were not difficult to serve.<br><br>When she graduated from the poly, Jaime started working full-time and that was when things started to look up. By then, she'd made up with her mum.<br><br>But starting out in the workforce wasn't a breeze either. She went through eight jobs in two years.<br><br>She said: 'After I finished school, I just wanted to make a lot of money so I didn't have to face the hardship I felt during that school-and-work time.<br><br>'But while having money helps, if you're not happy with the job you're in, it doesn't keep you there.<br><br>'I've always believed that to get ahead in life you have to use your brains... That's why I tell young people they need to stay in school.'<br><br>Jaime said that even when she was very young, her mother had emphasised the importance of education. That, she said, had always stayed with her and made her determined to complete her education no matter what.<br><br>Jaime moved back to live with her mother about three years ago.<br><br>Her mum, Madam Serene Lim, 50, told The New Paper that those years were tough and she tries not to remember the unpleasant times.<br><br>She said: 'I'm responsible for my children. I felt maybe I didn't bring up my children properly. I was very upset and I blamed myself (for her leaving).'<br><br>Although she didn't make contact with Jaime, Madam Lim had her own ways of making sure her youngest child was doing all right.<br><br>She said she would ask her sister to check on Jaime and would ask Jaime's friends how she was doing.<br><br>Madam Lim, who used to work at a clinic dispensing medication, said: 'I kept myself occupied with work so that I wouldn't think about my problems with Jaime so much. When she decided to move back, I was very, very happy that finally, she was coming home.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>JAMIE'S 5 good reasons to stay home   </strong><br><br>HARD TO SURVIVE:<br>When you're so young, jobs are limited and the money earned is meagre.<br><br>2. HARD TO COPE:<br>Extremely tiring juggling work and school.<br><br>3. NO LIFE AT SCHOOL:<br>You'll be too tired and stressed to enjoy your school friends and life.<br><br>4. FUTURE IN DANGER:<br>If it all gets too tough, you'll be easily tempted to drop out of school.<br><br>5. SO DRAINING:<br>Physically - you have school and work at the same time. Mentally - you worry about whether you have enough money to buy food. Emotionally - you're constantly afraid of bumping into people you don't want to see and hope people don't ask questions about your family.</div>
