              <p>its not easy to learn magic, requires time and practice,Â and it costs a lot too. till now i have friends who know tricks, but they aren't willing to teach for free.</p>

              <p><br>haha, but friends should be willing to share their secrets, if you show that you are really interested and not just talking for the fun of it. anyways i think magic is definitely not easy to master, therefore since Wednesday their performance is free, i'm going to watch them at the singapore river man.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>i wonder how it works, they teleport themselves from one area to another just like that? i have to admit that video looks a bit like camera effects man. its a little blurry and all. but if people seen it live and stuff, then i'm guessing its really good. anyways, wednesday i'll head down to see it for myself, with my own eyes. that way there can be no confusion anymore.</p></div>

              <p>Three random shoppers?!?! seriously? wow. that should be seriously rather difficultÂ to pull off man. now im definitely looking forward to wednesday, and definitely will be there. attempting an illusion of teleporting over the river should be hard enough, let alone teleporting 3 random people, lol.</p>
