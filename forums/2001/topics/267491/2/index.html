Her exotic looks have now become her biggest appeal.<br><br>Look what Leah, now 21, has achieved in the past year:<br><br># She's arguably the first pan-Asian babe to successfully move from the US to Japan to pursue a showbiz career.<br><br># Her first pictorial book was the third best-selling title in Japan last year.<br><br># Her name is the 16th most-searched term and the only personality on Infoseek Japan's top 20 list in the first half of the year.<br><br># She debuted in Asia this month as a J-pop singer - after the wild success of Japanese-crooning Korean popster BoA.<br><br># A video clip of hers posing in an itsy bitsy red bikini attracted more than 818,000 views on YouTube.<br><br>Singapore's netizens call her 'super chio' (slang for pretty) on Sgforum.<br><br>How did she manage to make it big in Japan?<br><br>It all started with her US-based website, which attracted an amazing two million hits in a year.<br><br>Netizens from as far as Japan and China became fans of her racy pictures she posted online - in skimpy lingerie for modelling jobs and dressing up as a Japanese school girl.<br><br>'Come to Japan!' her Japanese supporters beckoned.<br><br>So she did. A big fan of J-pop music who first travelled alone to Japan at age 14, she made a demo tape singing her idol Namie Amuro's hit song, I Will, and sent it to various talent agencies in Japan.<br><br>Mid last year, she packed her bags for Japan after inking a contract with the major record label Victor Entertainment (Love Psychedelico, Smap).<br><br>Despite speaking little Japanese, Leah's doll-like face has hogged advertisement billboards and magazine covers in Tokyo, and toy giant Bandai roped her in to design and launch its new clothing line, Sweet Razzer.<br><br>CUTE BUT SEXY<br><br>Her image follows Japanese sex icon Kumi Koda's ero-kakkoii (erotic cool) style - which means she can look Bambi-eyed cute one moment and provocatively sexy the next.<br><br>Check out her official website (www.leah-dizon.net) and you'll find plenty of kawaii (Japanese for cute) pictures of her, together with cutesy English blog entries of how she gets flustered over learning Japanese and being too shy in public.<br><br>Leah said in an interview with Ign.com in 2005 when she was still modelling in the US: 'I'm quiet and shy. I usually only talk enough not to offend anyone.<br><br>'Some people think I come off as rude, or stuck-up, but really I'm just kinda shy. It takes me a while to warm up to people. But once I open up, I'm really a loud ass.'<br><br>On the musical front, Leah is slated to launch her first full-length album, Destiny Line, on 12 Sep in Japan. She has released three CD singles which sold reasonably well.<br><br>The first two - Softly and Koi Shiyou (Love Me) - both debuted at a decent No.7 on the Oricon chart.<br><br>Koi Shiyou entered Singapore HMV's J-pop/K-pop chart at No3 two weeks ago. It comes with a bonus DVD and a 100-page pictorial book, Hello! Leah.<br><br>Hikaru Utada, one of Japan's biggest pop icons, is a fan of Leah's.<br><br>During a variety show in March, the New York-born Hikaru said in English: 'Hello, I saw you on TV saying that you don't have any friends in Japan yet and you're lonely and stressed-up over it.<br><br>'So I was thinking, maybe I could write you a letter or something, and I'd tell you this now, I'm also your fan, I heard that you like my music...'<br><br>At which point Leah jumped out from behind her and thanked her in Japanese. It turned out to be a surprise arranged by the show's producers, which sparked a new friendship between the duo.</div>

Her exotic looks have now become her biggest appeal.<br><br>Look what Leah, now 21, has achieved in the past year:<br><br># She's arguably the first pan-Asian babe to successfully move from the US to Japan to pursue a showbiz career.<br><br># Her first pictorial book was the third best-selling title in Japan last year.<br><br># Her name is the 16th most-searched term and the only personality on Infoseek Japan's top 20 list in the first half of the year.<br><br># She debuted in Asia this month as a J-pop singer - after the wild success of Japanese-crooning Korean popster BoA.<br><br># A video clip of hers posing in an itsy bitsy red bikini attracted more than 818,000 views on YouTube.<br><br>Singapore's netizens call her 'super chio' (slang for pretty) on Sgforum.<br><br>How did she manage to make it big in Japan?<br><br>It all started with her US-based website, which attracted an amazing two million hits in a year.<br><br>Netizens from as far as Japan and China became fans of her racy pictures she posted online - in skimpy lingerie for modelling jobs and dressing up as a Japanese school girl.<br><br>'Come to Japan!' her Japanese supporters beckoned.<br><br>So she did. A big fan of J-pop music who first travelled alone to Japan at age 14, she made a demo tape singing her idol Namie Amuro's hit song, I Will, and sent it to various talent agencies in Japan.<br><br>Mid last year, she packed her bags for Japan after inking a contract with the major record label Victor Entertainment (Love Psychedelico, Smap).<br><br>Despite speaking little Japanese, Leah's doll-like face has hogged advertisement billboards and magazine covers in Tokyo, and toy giant Bandai roped her in to design and launch its new clothing line, Sweet Razzer.<br><br>CUTE BUT SEXY<br><br>Her image follows Japanese sex icon Kumi Koda's ero-kakkoii (erotic cool) style - which means she can look Bambi-eyed cute one moment and provocatively sexy the next.<br><br>Check out her official website (www.leah-dizon.net) and you'll find plenty of kawaii (Japanese for cute) pictures of her, together with cutesy English blog entries of how she gets flustered over learning Japanese and being too shy in public.<br><br>Leah said in an interview with Ign.com in 2005 when she was still modelling in the US: 'I'm quiet and shy. I usually only talk enough not to offend anyone.<br><br>'Some people think I come off as rude, or stuck-up, but really I'm just kinda shy. It takes me a while to warm up to people. But once I open up, I'm really a loud ass.'<br><br>On the musical front, Leah is slated to launch her first full-length album, Destiny Line, on 12 Sep in Japan. She has released three CD singles which sold reasonably well.<br><br>The first two - Softly and Koi Shiyou (Love Me) - both debuted at a decent No.7 on the Oricon chart.<br><br>Koi Shiyou entered Singapore HMV's J-pop/K-pop chart at No3 two weeks ago. It comes with a bonus DVD and a 100-page pictorial book, Hello! Leah.<br><br>Hikaru Utada, one of Japan's biggest pop icons, is a fan of Leah's.<br><br>During a variety show in March, the New York-born Hikaru said in English: 'Hello, I saw you on TV saying that you don't have any friends in Japan yet and you're lonely and stressed-up over it.<br><br>'So I was thinking, maybe I could write you a letter or something, and I'd tell you this now, I'm also your fan, I heard that you like my music...'<br><br>At which point Leah jumped out from behind her and thanked her in Japanese. It turned out to be a surprise arranged by the show's producers, which sparked a new friendship between the duo.[/b]</blockquote>utada hikaru <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>
