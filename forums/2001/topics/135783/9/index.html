In fact, I like to wear them,' she told more than 100 reporters from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore who were gathered at the Inter-Continental Hotel.<br><br>'In the past, I tended to want to stick very closely to the image that my record company had crafted for me, which was something more androgynous,' she said matter-of-factly.<br><br>Therefore, with a label change came an image change.<br><br>Sunday marked the day that Stefanie, or Yanzi to most fans, officially became part of the EMI and Capitol Music family. The former Warner Music Taiwan artiste said she personally chose the Lanvin dress to signify her re-birth.<br><br>Her management contract with Warner expires next year.<br><br>This move is also significant because it means Stefanie officially becomes record label mates with Taiwanese pop princess Jolin Tsai.<br><br>As to why she left the familiar nest of Warner where she has cut nine albums, Stefanie explained: 'I have to admit it's largely because of Sam Chen (managing director of Taiwan's Capitol Music).<br><br>'I love working with him. I have many ideas and they are forever changing. Not many people can catch up with me, let alone allow me to pursue what I want.<br><br>'The important thing is, it feels right to work with him. I'm sure that I'll have lots of space to pursue what I want.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>PASSION</strong><br><br>Stefanie's entry into the Capitol Music stable looks like a heavily-<br>watched move.<br><br>There were several times during the media conference when Stefanie had difficulties expressing her thoughts.<br><br>She would then look at Mr Chen, seated next to her, who would then elaborate on her behalf, as if he could read her like a book.<br><br>And after each reply, Stefanie kept nodding her head in agreement.<br><br>Mr Chen, who used to be from Warner Music too, said: 'I've treated her like a superstar. Each time we work on a song or concert together, I would always be very touched by her passion.<br><br>'I gave her the promise that I would give her the best, and the space she wants to pursue her music.'<br><br>Does that include having the best of everything, including a massive production budget? After all, when Stefanie was with Warner, she was the company's trump card - which never failed to bring in the dollars.<br><br>Since shooting to stardom in 2000, she has sold more than three million albums. But her last album, A Perfect Day, sold less than expected, reportedly shifting over 100,000 copies in Taiwan and 10,000 here. Both figures are only one-third of what she used to command.<br><br>To this, Mr Chen grinned and said: 'It will still be the same as before.'<br><br>He explained that when he worked with Stefanie, he never felt he had to rein in her abilities by pulling the purse strings.<br><br>'Sometimes, Yanzi would come up with an idea and I would tell her it's not commercially viable. But we always let her complete what she wants to do as each time, the product would turn out great,' he said.<br><br>To show Capitol Music's sincerity in working with Stefanie, Mr Chen even went to the extent of consulting experts before deciding on the date of the media conference. 'They told me that in terms of career and love, this is a happy day for Yanzi,' he said.<br><br>The company also presented her a spoon made of white gold, seeming to imply that she was reborn with a silver spoon in her mouth.<br><br><strong>ACTING DREAMS</strong><br><br>Stefanie, who said she is now working on her new album, is perhaps also hoping her new partnership with Capitol Music will open up new opportunities.<br><br>For a start, she seems to have her sights set on the Western music scene. She said she hopes to have the chance to work with Brit band Coldplay, which is also under the Capitol label.<br><br>That's not all. If a suitable movie script comes her way, she would take it up too. 'I've never acted before, so I hope that the role will be something that is closer to my real life. I would love to be a singer in the movie too.'<br><br>Looks like some things will not change.</div>
