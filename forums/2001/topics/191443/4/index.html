My parents never really bought girly toys for me and I've never owned a single Barbie doll in my life! Therefore, this probably contributed to me being a little more tomboyish when I was young, but nevertheless, I blossomed into a young woman as I grew older,' she said.<br><br>When asked to name one person other than her parents who has had the most influence on her life, Miss Cheong, 25, still named her mother.<br><br>'No other person has influenced me the same way that my mum has. I share a very close relationship with her and she has given me a lot of advice in my life and supported me through thick and thin, regardless of my failures. She'll continue to be there for me,' she said.<br><br>In an earlier interview, she had told The Straits Times that her mum's help saw her win the Miss Singapore Universe contest.<br><br>'Mum was always there for me. She helped me through the past two months of the rehearsals and would boil soup and prepare essence of chicken for me,' she said of her mother, Mrs Irene Cheong, 55, who works as an accountant.<br><br>Mum and dad will be there to lend her support when she struts on the stage this coming Sunday in Los Angeles for the crown.<br><br>Miss Cheong, who has an arts degree from Curtin University and works as a freelance art director, mapped out her career ambition in the interview.<br><br>She said she wanted to be a creative director one day.<br><br>'There aren't many female creative directors in the advertising industry, especially in Singapore, and I aspire to be one of the few. I would also like to run my own advertising boutique with a focus on doing award-winning ads,' she said.<br><br>She listed her hobbies as chilling out with friends over coffee or wine; water sports like swimming and wakeboarding; playing the electone organ; looking at art; watching foreign films; shopping; travelling; and reading.<br><br>What makes her unique and different from the other contestants?<br><br>'I'm a person with strong beliefs and I'm very highly driven by my goals. I believe that if you are passionate about something you do, you naturally excel in it. Having a mind of my own and not being easily swayed by people is also another one of my attributes,' she said.<br><br>Miss Cheong's bustline had attracted quite a lot of attention on the Internet soon after she was crowned Miss Singapore Universe in April.<br><br>When The New Paper asked her for her comment then, she said: 'My bustline is part of my anatomy and there is nothing I can do about it. I am a little taken aback by the undue attention.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="small">The Electric New Paper, 26 July 2006</span></span><br><br><strong><span class="large">Stunning gown made me stand out </span></strong><br><br><span class="small">Miss Singapore looks stunning in bikini but her evening gown draws flak for being 'sl<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>utty' and unflattering.<br>She hits back at critics and says she was praised for daring choice<br>By Celine Lim and Ho Lian-Yi </span><br><br>LIKE a toss-up between 'cabaret' and 'stripper'.<br><br>That's just one of the many unkind comments made online about Carol Cheong's evening gown at the Miss Universe 2006 presentation show.<br><br>It was held a few days before the main event yesterday, in which Miss Puerto Rico emerged victorious.<br><br>Carol, 25, Singapore's representative at the event, failed to make the top 20.<br><br>She was not shown wearing that dress on TV, but there was a picture posted on the Miss Universe 2006 website.<br><br>It showed her in what looked like a black bra and an ultra miniskirt covered by what looked like a sheer, lacy dress that had its front cut out.<br><br>Among the many critical comments posted by local bloggers were: The outfit was 'slu<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>tty' and looked more like a night gown than an evening gown.<br><br>But Carol was surprised at the criticism as her gown had drawn lots of positive comments in Los Angeles, where the pageant was held.<br><br>Speaking to The New Paper over the phone last night, she said: 'At the post-party, quite a few people came up to me and told me that my evening gown was stunning and different.<br><br>'They said I stood out from the rest of the girls.'<br><br>She said her evening gown had been designed for the Miss Universe contest by her main sponsor, designer Anthea Chan of Perfect in Black.<br><br>The outfit consists of a tube top, a satin miniskirt and a full-length lace robe which was studded all over with customised Swarovski crystals.<br><br>While Carol had 'no idea' how much the gown costs, she was certain it set her apart from many of the contestants who wore 'white gowns' in 'typical designs'.<br><br>And, no, she did not get the chills wearing the revealing black gown as it was 'quite warm on stage in LA as compared to at Mediacorp'.<br><br>After the glowing feedback she received, Carol was naturally surprised when The New Paper told her about the negative comments directed at her black evening gown.<br><br>Her retort?<br><br>'Singaporeans are way too conservative. All they want to see is conventional evening wear.'<br><br>She added: 'They should be more supportive of their own delegates and stop putting their representatives down as they have over the past few years.<br><br>'I hope Singaporeans will change their mindset because there is a lot of hard work put in by the delegates at international contests like Miss Universe.'<br><br>A stronger response came from Mr Errol Pang, the local organiser of the pageant, who exploded with anger when told of the unkind remarks.<br><br><span style="color: red;">'Tell them to mind their own business,' he shot back.</span><br><br>'Everybody here in LA praised the outfit,' said the president of Derrol Stepenny Promotions, which has organised the Miss Singapore/Universe pageant for the past 34 years.<br><br>Carol's unusual outfit drew much creative vitriol from members of the so-called 'blogosphere'.<br><br>One blog, alexds69.blogspot.com, listed it as among the worst in evening gown in the preliminaries, writing: 'No, Miss Singapore. This is the evening GOWN competition, not the evening SLUT competition.'<br><br>A local blog, angeliatay.livejournal.com, also posted about the dress, with the heading 'Yeucks!'<br><br>One user on the blog, by the name alisonrae, commented archly: 'I think the designer wanted to make a kebaya but ran out of fabric.'<br><br>Another, nicknamed e rambler, complained: 'She must have thought it was night gown competition, not evening gown. So no class the outfit! What were the dressers thinking when they picked her outfits?'<br><br>Even members of Singapore's fashion community were taken aback by what they saw.<br><br>One of them, fashion photographer Geoff Ang, said it was supposed to look like a (Peranakan) outfit, but it looked like 'she stepped out from the movie set of The Addams Family'.<br><br>Did it turn him off?<br><br>'Not so much a turn-off, that miniskirt kind of made it a turn-on, but it's wrong from a traditional (Peranakan) outfit point of view!' he said.<br><br>He felt the designer tried too hard with the miniskirt.<br><br>'And that V-cut at the belly opening may not be the most flattering.'<br><br>Fashion stylist Bruce Chin thought the dress was trying to create individuality, but it might not have been a good idea to try it during the Miss Universe pageant, which is still a conventional affair.<br><br>'It's nice on its own, but it's not 'evening-ish' enough,' he said.<br><br>For him, the top piece was 'fantastic', but the bottom part made her legs look short.<br><br>Couture designer Frederick Lee, who has designed for eight Miss Singapore Universe beauties, including Nuraliza Osman, Bernice Wong and Alice Lim, had created another evening gown for Carol, a typically classy, long-skirted red outfit, which also appeared on the website.<br><br>Mr Lee, who was designer of the year at Singapore Fashion Awards 2004, would not dress a Miss Universe contestant in a short skirt, as it was, after all, unnecessary.<br><br>'If you want to show legs, the swimwear segment is best,' he said.<br><br>Celebrity stylist Kenneth Lee said that while he thought the gown was not suitable for her - it made her stomach protrude and 'squashed her short' - he wasn't sure whether it was because of the gown, the photography or Carol herself.<br><br>He thought the gown itself was fine. It was ultimately about how a person carries the dress. A person has to know if she can carry a dress or not.<br><br>'If you can't, you lose points,' he said.<br></div>
