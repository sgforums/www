And never ever try to play strip poker with her - you could lose more than your pants.<br><br>Ms Liz Lieu is a professional poker player, and she has become a millionaire solely from playing poker for a living.<br><br>The 32-year-old has also earned a title for herself as The Poker Diva. And it shows.<br><br>Her bold outfits flaunt her hour-glass figure. She exudes the poise and determination of an athlete and she has an attractive, steely gaze that stops you in your tracks.<br><br>But it is her mind that is by far her biggest asset.<br><br>Playing against top professional poker players, she needs a sharp mind to read her opponents and to endure 14- to 15-hour games. Amateurs would have little chance as she would likely read them like an open card.<br><br>Last year, at the World Series of Poker, Ms Lieu turned heads when she won fifth place in the first public event of the series. She won US$169,500 (S$264,000).<br><br>Born Elizabeth Lieu in Vietnam, poker-playing is the only career she has ever known.<br><br>She was here for the international poker tournament held at the Meritus Mandarin Hotel last week. This time, she was not that lucky though, and was knocked out on Thursday, after 13 hours' of play.<br><br>Clad in a snug white short-sleeved top, tight white pants and her signature diamond jewellery, she was totally at ease on Wednesday during the poolside interview with The New Paper on Sunday.<br><br>The American citizen (her family moved to the US when she was 1) said: 'I started playing poker at 18 and I've never turned back.'<br><br>Back then, she had just graduated from high-school (equivalent to junior college in Singapore) in Colorado.<br><br>'A friend came to visit me and he introduced me to poker,' she said.<br><br>'Later we organised home games and I was dealer, player, organiser - everything.'<br><br>Home games are occasions when friends get together to play poker, under a social licence granted by the authorities.<br><br>Eventually, she moved on to playing at casinos and, for certain periods of about two years each, she also dealt at various casinos.<br><br>'Five years ago, I turned pro,' she said.<br><br>Poker is popular in the US and Europe with televised games, online casinos and magazines dedicated to the game.<br><br>Ms Lieu honed her skills at games where the smallest bets are US$20 (S$31).<br><br>Now, she only plays at higher-profile ones where the opening bets are at least US$400 (S$623).<br><br>'I enjoy it,' she said, 'but poker is just a job. When I play, I am not there to socialise. I'm there to do my job and win some money.'<br><br>While she's playing, she plugs into her trusty iPod, which is filled with hip hop tracks.<br><br>'The songs calm me and help me focus,' Ms Lieu revealed.<br><br>Are there any sure-win moves or tricks to watch out for?<br><br>'No, it's all in the mind. You've just got to strategise well and watch your opponent's body language.'<br><br>And do professional poker players resort to 'tricks'?<br><br>'If you're talking about cheating, it's very difficult to do that in international games. All the players and dealers are sharp, and it won't help your reputation if you get caught,' she warned.<br><br>What about flashy gimmicks at the table, like throwing a deck of cards in the air and catching the best cards?<br><br>Ms Lieu replied with a laugh: 'You've been watching too many movies!'<br><br>Having played regularly in high-stakes games, she has amassed considerable savings.<br><br>'Let's just say I'm a millionaire. I've won millions and I've lost millions, but I am very careful with my winnings as they're not only for me, they're for my family too,' she said.<br><br>She is supporting her retired parents who 'worked as managers in different companies'.<br><br>'Since my dad had a heart attack ten years ago, my sister and I told both our parents to retire and we started supporting them.'<br><br>Her parents divorced two years ago. Her father is in Vietnam most of the time, while her mother lives in Los Angeles. Her 34-year-old elder sister owns a mortgage company.<br><br>Ms Lieu admitted that 'I haven't been the best daughter when I was younger'.<br><br>'I had no aptitude for school and no interest in it,' she said.<br><br>Now, realising that 'you have only one mother and one father', she gives them everything they want.<br><br>The glamorous poker diva does not hold back on indulging herself either. 'My favourite designer is Roberto Cavalli. I shop at Rodeo Drive in Los Angeles and because I'm there quite a lot, I have my own parking lot,' she said matter-of-factly without any hint of arrogance.<br><br>Part of her income is also used to help the needy.<br><br>'You can't just take, take, take forever. You've got to give back,' she stated.<br><br>That's why she and her best friend, world No 2 poker professional John Phan, support various charities in Vietnam. (See report on Page 10.)<br><br>Asked if she has a boyfriend, she said: 'My last serious relationship was a year ago. Right now, I'm more focused on my career, but when the right man comes along, I'll know.'</div>
