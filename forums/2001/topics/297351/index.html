I'm the quite-average-but-not Singaporean who hasn't gone under the knife and probably won't for the rest of my life.<br>2. I'm not supportive of plastic surgery.<br>3. But neither am I against it.<br><br>There's nothing sinful about plastic surgery, unless you're afraid that God can't recognize you later on.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So why should anyone feel insulted when someone he or she has never even meet face-to-face inquires about such issues on a <strong>public discussion forum</strong> about a famous person, <strong>not him/her</strong>, fgs. Hasn't it been common for stars to surgically upgrade their appearances as well? So what's so insulting for someone curious to ask where the knife go on their faces, if it did?<br></div>
