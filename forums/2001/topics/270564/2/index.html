            <div class='col-md body'>Elynn certainly has that sweet and demure look... Her look appeals to me... she gives me that very comfortable and homely feeling... Cannot explain it any further... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by NewAge:</div><div class="quote_body">not bad face and big bosom nice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stellazio:</div><div class="quote_body">damn she's hot, and she has quite big boobs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>I am appalled by what you have just said NewAge and stellazio! Is that all you see in girls? Indeed, her figure is nice, but I am very disgusted with your point of view you two see in girls - do you just zoom to the parts that interests you? Sigh... don't wish to scold you guys but I am very saddened and disappointed by the way some guys look at women these days... You two ought to be ashamed of yourselves! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gordonator:</div><div class="quote_body">my mum will be very happy if i bring her home to show her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> </div></blockquote>Though initially, I had the same desire like you, but for me, it is not so much on bringing home a beautiful-looking girl that appeals to your parents. It is more about knowing her in person as a friend whether she is fit ot be my better-half before I make any other move. However, my chance of knowing her is slim because I am still of school-going age and I somewhat doubt that she will ever be interested in a guy who is a few years younger than her... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>For now, she appeals to me... not sure if she is my better-half, most likely not - being realistic.  Best of luck to you (Gordonator) in pursuing her! Do get to know her better... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Anyway, thank you sg mata for sharing the scanned images of Elynn from the FHM Magazine... she definetely look stunning in the photos.

Are you of the appropriate age to buy a copy of this magazine? If so, then I think it is 'okay'...<br><br>Though we all of us seem to have a common liking for model number 26, but somehow I think my views and some views shared by users does not really seem to coincide with one another...

But I better not take any chances or opportunities to go flipping in them, got to keep the thoughts in my mind pure... Thankfully, the scanned photos of the two models are not as seductive looking or as bare as what was previously predicted by a user of a separate forum... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Grateful for that!</div>

Most of them are brand-new models who have entered DOND Singapore so that they can be recognized throughout the modelling world and someday make it big in their careers as models.<br><br>Currently I doubt any of them are social escorts.<br><br>There are also a few of the models from Season One who are still studying now.<br><br>What moolah?<br>By the way, it really depends... some ladies/models only want to date or marry men who are rich, but I am sure NOT ALL OF THEM are like that... You are over-generalising them... There are really some of the ladies whom you ought to know in person, they are not exactly what you perceive them to be. Personally, I am unsure whether Elynn is such, but 80% of me doubt so. Have yet to know her in person yet, but I feel that she is someone very nice and warm-hearted, cheerful and friendly.</div>

Are you of the appropriate age to buy a copy of this magazine?

But I better not take any chances or opportunities to go flipping in them, got to keep the thoughts in my mind pure... Thankfully, the scanned photos of the two models are not as seductive looking or as bare as what was previously predicted by a user of a separate forum... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Grateful for that!</div></blockquote>didn't knew just a innocent person like yourself existed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Maxim does it more... and Playboy does that the most...<br><br>Not interested in reading or even touching those magazines, though they are of different degrees - from mild, hot, sizzling... They usually give the same end result in deluding guys to only spotting woman who sexy as their partners and often neglecting other aspects that are crucial in building a healthy relationship with your partner... In my opinion, all of them are the same... I'll tell you why in later paragraphs...<br><br>I am not saying that it is wrong for Elynn or Vanessa to be featured in FHM, it is good for them as they will in turn get more popularity in their modelling careers...<br><br>Personally for me, at that very first time (and last time) that I went flipping in one of the FHM issues that my father brought home each month, I was completely shocked by how cheap and how atrociously the articles in it were written! Omigosh... it is a whole lot of crap talking about better sex lives, etc. I personally did not believe in a thing they say, and felt deeply troubled and regreted my decision to go peeping in my dad's archive of FHM, Maxim and Playboy Magazine... One FHM Magazine was enough to turn me off, I think Maxim and Playboy will turn me off even more...<br><br>I really hated that article about love, relationship and sex, I also hated that article describing women as 'sex machines'... So grosse! It is a totally distorted view on what love is really like! Let's face it... sex does not keep a relationship 'hot enough' to stay together, it never works this way! How can there be love, when whatever the guy thinks in his head are means and ways to achieve better sex each time with his partner? That is not love! That is lust! That is taking advantage of your partner! He is not respecting her at all... Only mutual love and respect between a couple helps keep them together... Both parties will have to learn to respect each other's rights, show care and concern for one another and love each other with all their hearts... only doing so will keep the flame for wach other burning as brightly as it is before... till eternity...<br><br>It is very saddening to see such magazines polluting the thought life of many guys these days... spoils the way they look at women... I never liked the way some guys stared at girls in my Poly. They were not just admiring the girls' beauty, but from their eyes... I can see that string of lustful thoughts in their minds... which simply disgusts me... It is really disappointing for me to see guys to think of sex straight after they see a pretty girl on the streets...<br><br>This is my advice to guys out there: We will need to keep our minds pure for my future partner, so that I can love her with all my heart and soul... I want to develop that kind of love for my future wife that goes beyond all odds, not that kind of love that is just superficial... not attracted to things like any key areas or sex-appeal, whatsoever... most importantly is how she suits and compliments me as a partner, and loving her with my whole heart! :p<br><br>To me, superficial love is that kind that does not really last... Once the other party seem no more attractive, the love for her just ends there... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>In order to really have the love that is true, that love that is gentle and kind, that love that is without any jealousy nor hatred, that love that goes beyond all limitations... one has to make a stand to not only avoid temptations and rid your system of all unlovely thoughts and slowly but steadily nurture this love in your heart to spring forth within you... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>All these are just my point of view of the matter... It is rather risky to read such magazines, as you will probably be risking having a good love life with your partner if you indulge too much in lustful desires... Lust is evil, it ruins love! That is why I am not taking any chances to take a peek in those magazines anymore. I do not want to be like my father... I want to be someone who loves others as much as how much my Creator loves me...<br><br>I better cut my post short for now... Don't want to get too emotional or sentimental typing my views on true love in this thread... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>
