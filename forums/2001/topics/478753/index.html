(Below) Ms Cheng in her prime.</strong></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>She once starred in erotic movies</strong></p>
              <p>Now Ms Cheng Yim Lai, 42, is working hard to make ends meet.</p>
              <p>   She was spotted earlier this week selling burgers at a McDonald's outlet in Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>   The person who made the discovery is a reporter from Next, a Hong Kong weekly news magazine.</p>
              <p>   The report said that Ms Cheng earns about HK$32 (S$5.30) an hour, with her monthly income about HK$10,000.</p>
              <p>   It is not known how many days a week she works there.</p>
              <p>   She works the night shift, finishing at 7am.</p>
              <p>   There was a time when she was seen only in designer clothes, but now she does not even bother to change out of her uniform after work.</p>
              <p>   After the shift, she took off her hat, put on a windbreaker and hopped on to a public bus to go home, the report said.</p>
              <p>   When the reporter approached her, Ms Cheng kept her head down and tried to get away from the scene in an attempt to escape the questions.</p>
              <p>   The reporter asked Ms Cheng if her current state was due to marital problems, but her reply was a curt, "I have nothing to say."</p>
              <p>   The reporter persisted, asking why she chose to live this way, but she kept her head down. She insisted that her life "is normal". She refused to comment any further.</p>
              <p>   The report said that she looked a pale shadow of her former self, having put on weight.</p>
              <p>   She also had grey hair. But the reporter noticed that she had a good work attitude.</p>
              <p>   When her colleagues took supper breaks, she was seen picking up a cloth and cleaning the tables. She was even heard saying, "I'm losing weight!"</p>
              <p>   Next Magazine reported, quoting sources, that she recently opened a private eatery in Taiwan, but was forced to close it in a year.</p>
              <p>   The report also claimed she split with her boyfriend, causing her to lose even more money.</p>
              <p>   That was when her connections within the entertainment industry were cut off completely.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Ms Cheng tiptoed into stardom when she won a radio competition in 1988. She made her first TV appearance alongside Hong Kong movie star Tony Leung, in the 1989 TV show Hap Hak Hang.</p>
              <p>   In 2000, she caught the eye of Taiwanese millionaire Wong Ren Zhong, who is believed to have helped her set up a nightclub and a food outlet.</p>
              <p>   Soon after that, she began acting in Hong Kong erotic movies.</p>
              <p>   It is not clear how many movies she acted in.</p>
              <p>   Her last public appearance was in the Hong Kong comedy film 72 Tenants of Prosperity in 2010, in which she was a guest star, Chinese newspaper Shin Min Daily News reported.</p>
