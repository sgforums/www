Hey girl, easy with that temper. You know a while ago i would be very angry if i were to encounter that. But i encountered this so many times it became a norm.<br><br>You see bosses everywhere practise favourtism. Bosses are bosses because they don't know a thing. If you read <strong>DILBERT</strong><br>He pointed out something very interesting. How many people that run law firms can practise law and represent clients themselves? How many directors in hospitals and similar fields are the leading authority themselves?<br><br>Similarly, how many top notch lawyers are running their own firms?<br>How many scientists actually earn millions and have their own laboratory?<br>Irony eh?<br><br>Well girl... Women who are really into their career/work will just get it done.<br>Rule of the thumb. Bosses are always wrong and never righted. And most men have their IQ lowered by about 100 points when the world cup comes. Luckily i am not obsessed with the game in which rich people chase a ball...<br><br>You go ahead and do that work. And make sure people know you did extra work. Make sure your boss knows that too. The thing is not who does the most jobs. The thing is who gets known for getting most jobs done. Cajoling and politics are the way to go. He may like that dood more then you but when it comes to money everything is official. Make yourself indispensible. Above all, drop the idea that you have to fight against your boss. Instead make use of him to further your career. He is clearly limited in IQ and managing skills. If he is only a manager and not the actual boss of the company, then your chances of replacing him is high.<br><br>One day when things get dicey and someone gets the axe he will generally rid the chump who bets on soccer.</div>
