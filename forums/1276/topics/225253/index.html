            <div class='col-md body'>There are just too much to talk about there. Only those who have been there can understand what I saw and felt.<br><br>Its the people who make the difference in their lives there. And many who can make a diffrence are helpless, as they are short of funds.<br><br>The religion of Hinduism and Buddhist is strong there, and people there nv failed to greet you or return your greeting by saying "Namaste" (Na Ma Stay). Everyone hopes to get peace in life.<br><br>Its sad to see homeless children of Kathmando lying in the streets, sniffing glue all night to forget their woes, hugging on to dogs to keep themselves warm at night.<br>And they do not steal, but beg for money and food. But the moment you give one, you will be horrified to find yourself surround by all those beggers at the area. Thats why the Garment there tell you specifically not to give money to beggars, as you are not helping them, but making their life worst.<br>But I surprised it was at the airport there my watch and CDs got stolen from my check-in luggage.<br><br>In the city, sad that my friend pitied a woman with a baby and an empty milk bottle, asking for milkpowder. He agreed to buy her a tin of milk powder (despite we were low on funds) and she followed us into a mini mart. But she grabbed 3 tins and my fds saids only one tin, which cost ten over Sing dollars. Then she tried to ask for sugar and salt. We then realised that she is from a syndicate, for there are another 4 more women with babies displaying empty milk bottles to us at the mini mart entrance. And i saw that the milk bottles are new with no milk powder residue. God knows if the baby is theirs and how much a tin of milk powder can fetch them.<br><br>The mountains are beautiful, and Mother Nature must be proud of her creation.<br>It would be more beautiful if the Garment and Maoist could agreed who collects what fees, as we had to pay for what we think we shd not.<br><br>Its a great challenge as we climb higher, and it is an eye opener to see a bazzar run by Tibetans who just scalp the mountains over to Nepal to sell clothes at 3440M high. But it also sadden us that my fd developed altitude sickness, which can be fatal. I learnt that not everyone can acclimatize to thin air. As such we turned back.<br><br>And the British, Europeans and Americans I met really amaze me. They love to share their experience. All of them quit their job to travel to see Nepal and other parts of the world. There is not a single Singaporean on my whole trip, and I was glad to hear English similar to Singlish from a Malaysian business woman from KL whom I met in the midst of the montains.<br>While life was a lot tougher trekkkng up, the memories were simple so beautiful, other than the coldness.<br><br>There is so much more to experience, and I encourage all those who thinks of going, to take the adventure, which will leave a huge impact on your life.</div>
