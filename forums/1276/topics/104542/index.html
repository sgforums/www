            <div class='col-md body'>A sharp tongue does not mean you have a keen mind.<br>Anyone who told you to be yourself couldn't have given you any worse advice.<br>Are you always this stupid or are you making a special effort today.<br>Do you want me to accept you as you are, or do you want me to lie to myself and try to like you?<br>Don't let your mind wander; it's far too small to be let out on its own.<br>Don't thank me for insulting you; it was a pleasure.<br>Don't you realize that there are enough people to hate in the world already without you putting in so much effort to give us another?<br>Grasp your ears firmly and pull; you might just be able to remove your head from you ass.<br>He always finds himself lost in thought; it's unfamiliar territory.<br>Her mouth is dirtier than a rubber toilet seat.<br>I bet you get bullied a lot.<br>I can tell that you are lying; your lips are moving.<br>I don't know what makes you so dumb but it really works.<br>I don't mind you talking so much, as long as you don't mind me not listening.<br>I don't think you are a fool, but what's my opinion compared to that of thousands of others.<br>I don't want to make a monkey out of you. Why should I take all the credit for the one thing you've done yourself?<br>I know you are nobody's fool, but maybe someone will adopt you one day.<br>I like you. People say I've got no taste, but I like you.<br>I used to think that you were a colossal pain in the neck. Now I have a much lower opinion of you.<br>I will defend, to your death, my right to my opinion.<br>I would have liked to insult you, but the sad truth is that you wouldn't understand me.<br>I'd like to see things from your point of view, but I can't seem to get my head that far up your ass.<br>If I want shit from you, I'll squeeze your head.<br>If sex were fast food, you'd have and M-shaped arch over your head.<br>If we killed everybody who hates you, it wouldn't be murderÂ…it would be an apocalypse!<br>If you were twice as smart as you are now, you'd be absolutely stupid.<br>I'm busy now. Can I ignore you some other time?<br>I'm glad to see you're not letting your education get in the way of your ignorance.<br>I'm impressed, I've never met such a small mind inside such a big head before.<br>I've come across rotting bodies that are less offensive than you are.<br>Now we know why some animals eat their own children.<br>Pardon me, but you're obviously mistaking me for someone who gives a damn.<br>People would follow him anywhere, but only out of morbid curiosity.<br>Please, keep talking. I always yawn when I am interested.<br>She's the first in her family born without tail.<br>Talk is cheap, but that's ok, so are you.<br>That man is cruelly depriving a village somewhere of an idiot.<br>There are several people in this world that I find unbearably obnoxious, and you are all of them.<br>This is an excellent time for you to become a missing person.<br>What he is lacking in intelligence, he more than makes up for in stupidity.<br>Whatever it is that is eating you, it must be suffering horribly.<br>What's wrong, don't you get any attention back home?<br>When I look into your eyes, I see straight through to the back of your head.<br>You are living proof that manure can sprout legs and walk.<br>You are not as bad as people say, you are much, much worse.<br>You are not even beneath my contempt.<br>You are not obnoxious like so many other people, you are obnoxious in a completely different and far worse way.<br>You are slower than a herd of turtles stampeding through peanut butter.<br>You grow on people, but so does cancer.<br>You have a nasty speech impedimentÂ…your foot.<br>You have an inferiority complex and it is fully justified.<br>You should do some soul-searching. You might just find one.<br>You would never be able to live down to your reputation, but I see you're doing your best.<br>Your mind isn't so much twisted as badly sprained.<br>You're a habit I'd like to kick - with both feet</div>
