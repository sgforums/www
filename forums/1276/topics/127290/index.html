            <div class='col-md body'>I went to Sim LIm Sq to look for a thumb drive. Went with my friend who wanted to buy other stuff for himself and colleagues.<br>Found a shop on the 4th level and saw thumb drives on offer.<br>Saw a Kingston data traveller II 512 MB for $64.90.<br><br>My fd brought me into another shop on the same level call ATF (they have a chain of shops in Sim Lim Sq). I never liked the ATF bcoz their sales quite pushy. But my fd wanted to buy from them. I found the Kingston data traveller (first model) 512 MB at $65/-. My friend went to pay for other things he wanted and a few things my colleagues asked him to buy. I thought can ask for a discount with the things my friend was buying, as my fd got discount for the rest of the things he got for my colleagues. I asked for a discount but they say no further discount. I was thinking if I wanted to buy this thumb drive, as the previous one I saw was only 10 cent cheaper. But I recall it was a 'II" model which means more newer and advance.<br><br>What happen next made me regret til now.<br><br>While I was thinking for the next second, the stuff quickly scanned the thumbdrive and the things my friend was buying. I was not fast enough to say I did not say I want thumbdrive and my friend key in his PIN as he paid with his ATM card. My friend asked me to pay him the cash later. Its like bo pian pay oredi.<br><br>I quickly went back to the other shop to look at the data traveller II and found that it is slimmer and the colour is nicer. The one I got was quite bulky compares to the newer model. I quickly went back to ATF and ask them for the newer model. They say that they do not have it as as the data traveller II is more expensive. They refused to give me a refund (which I am not surprised). I really regret as I could have got a data traveller II for $64.90 when I paid $65/- for an older model.<br><br>I felt cheated as I did not say that I want the thumbdrive but they scanned the thumbdrive without me saying that I am buying it. I think I have to blame myself for not stopping them when they used such strong sales tactics by scanning the product and asking for payment. I felt compel tp pay as they have scanned the thing into the register.<br><br>I went to surf net to find out about the diff of data traveller I &amp; II. No doubt the 'II' was a better model. Chin buay song...<br><br>Just want to get this matter of my chest. Some may say its my fault, but I think a lot of people have been in such situations when you bought something you have not decided to but the staff's action compel you to buy it and you regret later to find that it is not a good deal...<br><br>So if you are not sure if you want to buy something which have ready stock, SAY NO first. You can also get it later...rather than regretting...<br></div>
