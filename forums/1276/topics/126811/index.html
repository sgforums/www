            <div class='col-md body'>I made my mark 3 years ago when I took charge of a team.<br>I took over and uncovered knowledge in a problematic area. I did research and did a presentation which my boss cannot do. My top bos was impressed bcoz the knowledge was lost for years. I excelled and my work was reported in the media on three occasions. I got best performer in my department last year. I became a expert in methodlogy of a certain field and now a consultant cum trainer. I got recognition. I thought it was cool.<br><br>But now I dun think so. I have applied for a few transfers to a higher department to learn new things but my management stopped all the request for me to go over. They are not going to let me go anywhere.<br><br>Reason? I am a 'pillar' of my department and they are going to groom me for higher promotion. I am expected to impart my knowledge and guide all that are in my department.<br><br>But they never asked me if I wanna be groomed to a higher position. Higher position means more respondsibilities, more projects and more presentation. I dun wan all these.<br><br>What I really longed for is good physical fitness and to travel around the world. I wanna learn new things totally out of my field to improve myself. I told one of my friend abt my ideas and she ticked me off. She said one must work hard to climb up and earn lots of money. I pretend to agreed with her. But it actual fact..what is the point of holding a high post with high pay but a weak body and poor fitness.<br><br>I saw one of my big boses from another department. Young, high post and getting high pay. But one day he just exerted a little during work and he collasped. Now he is bed ridden with heart problems when he not even 40.<br><br>I am losing my physical fitness and I am sad.<br><br>I have two choices.<br><br>A) Insist to go to the place I want and my work loan becames light. Promotion is greatly compromised and allowance is reduced. But I get to do what I like and eng eng cheng cheng. I will not be stressed or tied down.<br><br>B) Continue to work like a cow and horse in my current pl, hoping my management keep their promise to promote me, like what they promised the top 10 elite of my team (including me). In the meantime I have to think of ways to outshine the rest of the 9 elite.<br><br>What would you choose?</div>

I know promotion will be slow, allowance will be cut by $100/-. but I will be happy most of the time (except when they annouce the yearly promotion). I will be able to keep myself fit bcoz there will not be common late nights, OT and last minute rush and presentation.<br><br>For choice B, I know the prospect are good but I may end up with hair loss, bad temper and strong stress. The pressure may have adverse influence if not properly managed. Its never ending until you collaspre or retire. When you collaspe or retire, you look &amp; think back...worth it anot?<br><br>Thats why I got lots of thoughts... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

So I will defintely go with A, not because I am choosing hapiness ovr the moolah but rather the challenge. Handling one big project a yr is defintely less stressful than many small ones a yr and hence also free up more time for you to focus and research on the one big project... then lower probabilty of you srewing things up. Working with elites there might help you gain some valuable experience and perhaps exchange of ideas? Also like what you said, the info there would be v rare and privileged, ain't that a niche for you to go into? Bet its gonna be interesting too!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
