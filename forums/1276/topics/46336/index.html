But after a failed relationship, Zhen was not very confident in this new relationship, but she still gave it a try.<br><br>For Zhen, she's one girl who takes relationship very seriously. She got hurt again and again in her past relationships. Guys were always out to cheat her feelings. As for Ming, He's just the typical guy in a relationship. He loves to take things for granted, which resulted in his past failed relationships.<br><br>He did not think much about this shortcoming of his. He thought Zhen is another girl who can accept him for his everything. They knew and understood each other's past. Ming also assured Zhen that he will give her happiness.<br><br>She thought he had started putting his effort in this "baby" of theirs, she too did her part and put in all her feelings. She loved him wholeheartedly...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In this short period of time, they seemed happy and almost inseparable. Friends around them were green with envious. They only started knowing each other when into the relationship.<br><br>They had similar interest of fixing jigsaw puzzles. Whenever there's no one at Zhen's house, Ming would go over and they spend the whole afternoon fixing puzzles together. That was one of the sweetest memories that would exist in her mind. They shared the same hobby, cooking. Moreover, they had the same taste in terms of food. Whenever Ming book out from his camp, Zhen would prepare his favourite seafood fried rice. And Ming never gets tired of Zhen's effort.<br><br>They share the same thoughts and they had everything that is needed in a gd relationship. They could communicate well, understand what's on each other's mind and the word "quarrel" is totally out of their dictionaries!<br><br>Zhen thought he was the one perfectly for her, Ming thought she was his soulmate... They would give each other sweet surprises... Ming, who's a rider, would always bring Zhen out on a ride. To her favourite places, to the beach, and the romantic spots to spend time with her. And she thought she was the most fortunate and happiest girl in the world...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Two years had passed... Zhen thought it was the longest relationship she ever had. Both of them felt that their "baby" had grown, and Zhen felt confident once again.<br><br>She was in the final year of her poly studies. He had completed his NS and now working in an office as an office boy. Both were glad as life is getting a step closer to their future.<br><br>Maybe the fact that they are stable and both busy with exams and work respectively, they started to communicate less. No longer is the existence of honeymoon period...<br><br>More and more people came into their lifes...<br><br>There was this guy, Kel, who's on quite good terms with Zhen. During these studying days, whenever Zhen had any quiries on homework, she would approach Kel for help. This resulted in Kel secretly falling in love with Zhen... Knowing that she's attached, Kel kept his feelings to himself.<br><br>One fine day, Ming was having his offday on a certain weekday. He decided to go to his sweetheart's poly and fetch her, giving her a surprise. When he was approaching her block, his face suddenly changed. To his dismay, he saw Zhen in Kel's arms! Kel was carrying her...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It turned out to be actually Zhen had fell down the stairs as the heel of her sandals gave way. It resulted in her spraining her ankle. Kel witnessed it all and quickly gave her a hand. She could not walk any further so Kel decided to carry her and bring her to the nearest physician. But before he could do that, they met Ming...<br><br>Three of them were stunted, and didn't know what to say. Ming started off.<br><br>"Zhen, I never expect you to let me down..."<br><br>Ming was angry, at the same time, sad. Zhen explained everything to him but he just wouldn't listen. He could cool down no more. He glared at Kel and Zhen for a few seconds, and walked off... He felt betrayed...<br><br>At this moment, Zhen could not do anything but to cry. She couldn't come down and chase after her loved one. She couldn't... If only she had a choice...<br><br>That night, Zhen felt better as earlier on Kel had brought her for treatment. She could walk around slowly. She wanted to call Ming. She wanted to clear the misunderstanding. She stared at the phone for a long time, finally gathered some courage to press the numbers that she's so familiar with. The line got through, she waited and waited, but no answer... Only diversion to voicemail. She did not give up, she called again and again. But stil to no avail. Then she tried for the last time before turning in, this time worse, Ming off his handphone...<br><br>Zhen knew she couldn't gain his forgiveness so soon. On her bed, she thought and thought, and tears started rolling down. For that night, she cried till she slept...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That night, Ming felt so vexed and went out to a pub for a drink... From that moment he saw his sweetheart in another guy's arms, his mind is full of hatred and sadness... He thought things were what he saw, did not even bother to listen to Zhen's explanation. He downed many glasses, one after another, despite he was riding.<br><br>At the pub, he met a girl. This girl happens to be working in the same building as him but different company. They met each other before but didn't talk. In the pub, she approached him and asked what happened. Her name is Helen. She's not really beautiful but there's a certain charisma on her. In his drunken stupor, Ming suddenly felt attracted to her.<br><br>Helen had brought Ming back to her place. She cleaned his face for him, changed his smelly clothes and put him onto her bed... At this moment, Ming totally forgot all about Zhen, he was completely mesmerised with Helen. Her gentleness, her attentiveness towards him... So as expected, they had an affair that very night.<br><br></div>

What are you doing in my boyfriend's house?"<br><br>MIng felt frustrated and grabbed Zhen by her wrist. He told her that they're through and slapped her in the face, in a fit of anger, Zhen went forward and slapped Helen too! Zhen cried bitterly before leaving that scum's house...<br><br>On her way back, she was still crying and wondering what caused the sudden change in him.

            <div class='col-md body'>That day Zhen went home. She just couldn't accept the fact that Ming broke up with her just like that. She did not want a breakup to occur in the midst of their relationship. For the following week she did not attend school. Kel was disappointed not having to see Zhen coming for tutorials and revisions.<br><br>Actually Zhen had cooped herself in her room everyday. Her parents were worried about her. She could not take it anymore, She was really depressed. Finally, she took out the penknife from her drawer n cut her wrists...<br><br>When her parents finally get to come in contact with her, she was already lying unconscious on the floor.<br><br>When Zhen opened her eyes, she found herself in a hospital ward. The first person she saw was Kel... Tears rolled down her cheeks.<br><br>She said, "Why am I not dead yet? I don't want to suffer in the past relationship..." Her voice faded.<br><br>Kel replied her, "Cos I'll protect you. I won't let you suffer any further. I'll stay by your side and watch our future together."<br><br>Zhen was so touched... She hugged Kel and he hugged her tightly. Kel could not hold back any longer and he finally confessed his feelings for her.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Under Kel's care and attentiveness, Zhen started to recover by the day. On the day when Zhen was about to be discharged, she had an unexpected visitor.<br><br>It was Ming. No doubt. It was really him. She had not seen wrongly.<br><br>But the Zhen now was not like before, she had become more brave.<br><br>"I'm sorry, Zhen... It was my fault. Please forgive me." Ming said.<br><br>There was silence for awhile.<br><br>"Can you please give me one more chance? I've already left that girl..." he explained.<br><br>Just then, Kel walked into the ward and was stunt to see Ming. Zhen quickly ran towards Kel's side. Without another word, both of them walked out. Suddenly Zhen felt a kind of relieve. A feeling she hadn't got for the past few months.<br><br>Zhen and Kel has been together since that ordeal. Her parents has approved of him, and she has fully accepted him. From that moment, her bad memories were erased off her mind, giving space to her new born memories of Kel and her.<br><br>She regretted putting in all her feelings for Ming at one time in their relationship. In this brand new relationship, she started off by loving Kel bit by bit. She is very careful so as not to get hurt so deeply again. But she has confidence in Kel. That is the first time she ever felt so secure and confident in a relationship. This proved to be true, their relationship has been smooth sailing ever since that day.<br><br>Until one day they attended their friend's party. Zhen saw someone familiar. Someone she once never wanted to forget. Her so called ex-rival in love. Yes, it was Helen. The both of them were taken aback by their presences respectively...</div>
