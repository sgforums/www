            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Play Second Fiddle</strong><br><br>In an orchestra, the person playing 'the first violin' follows the instructions of the conductor and leads the musicians during a performance. A violin is also called a fiddle, so this says anyone who is a follower rather than a leader plays a second fiddle. "I wasnt happy playing second fiddle working for my brother so I formed my own company," Theodore said.<br><br><strong>Possession Is Nine Points Of The Law</strong><br><br>In disputes over property ownership, the person in possession of something is sometimes said to have nine-tenths a chance of winning it in legal argument. "Toby found a thousand dollars on the bus. He says it his because posession is nine points of the law. I wonder if he's right about that?"<br><br><strong>The Pot calling The Kettle Black</strong><br><br>We use this expression to remind people who critisize others that they may have the same faults. This come from the fact that cooking pans used over a fire become all black. None is better than the other. "Carol's comments about Martha being messy is a case of the pot calling the kettle black</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Procrastination Is The Thief Of Time</strong><br><br>Procrastination refer to waiting or putting off doing something. Because time moves by quickly, those who wait may miss a valuable opportunity to do or have something. Thats the idea behind this saying."Officer Mutt captured a burglar who fell asleep in a clock sho[." "He probably would have got away hours earlier if he had realised that procrastination is the thief of time," Mutt smiled.<br><br><strong>Promises Are Like Pie Crust</strong><br><br>"Marry me and I will give you the moon and the stars and the planets that encircle us," Syrano said. "Oh, Sy, you make me sigh," Roxy replied, "but havent you heard that promises are like pie crust, made to be broken?" This proverb says most promises cannot be kept. "But I'm proposing marriage, not running for political office!" Syrano said.<br><br><strong>Put a Quart Into A Pint Pot</strong><br><br>'I've done it! Fergus smiled. Fergus thinks he has put a quart (of liquid) into a pint pot. This expression describes doing something thats impossible. Its used metaphorically, as in this example. "There 's no more room," the bus driver said as he closed the doors. "I cant put a quart in a pint pot, you know."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Rain Falls On The Just And Unjust Alike</strong><br><br>This saying from the Bible (Matthew 5:45) states that no matter how just (good) or unjust (bad) a person is he must still face the everyday problems that confronts us all. In other words, being moral and righteous does not neccessarily protect a person from the hardship of life.<br><br><strong>A Rolling Stone Gathers No Moss</strong><br><br>"Its true!" Oliver gasped. "A rolling stone gathers no moss!" Just as he said that, another stone struck Oliver down. As he was recovering, he reflected on the meaning of this proverb. I suppose its said that a rolling stone gathers no moss because like a stone thats always moving, a person who wanders from place to place and job to job hasl ittle chance of acquiring property, possessions or friends."<br><br><strong>Rome Was Not Built In a Day</strong><br><br>Long ago Rome was one of the greatest and most beautiful cities in the world. Obviously it had taken centuries to make it great, hence this reminder that important things are not accomplished easily and we should not expect imediate results from our work. "It takes time to learn a foreign language, but be patient and remember that Rome wasnt built in a day."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Seeing Is Believing</strong><br><br>This tells us that we can accept something as real or factual if we can actually see it. "Seeing is believing, and I know flying saucers exist because I saw one on my way to work," Ahmed said, Ahmed explained he was commuting via flying carpet, so if seeing is believing I believe Ahmed and his story about flying saucers when I see them both in flight!<br><br><strong>The Sins Of The Fathers Are/Will Be Visited Upon The Children</strong><br><br>This statement is from the Bible (Exodus 20:5). It says that people are/will be punished for the wrongs committed by their parents, forefathers, or those who have preceded them. "If we do nothing to clean up our environment the sins of the fathers will be visted upon the children of future generations," the speaker declared.<br><br><strong>A Skeleton In The Closet/Cupboard</strong><br><br>A closely kept secret that, if revealed, would be a source of shame to a person, a family, a group - or even to a country or govenrment - is described as a skeleton in the closet/cupboard. "Except for Emma, no one knows that her husband had once been to prison. The secret remains a skeleton in the closet and Emma, of course, never talks about it."<br></div>

If so, he is a snake in the grass. "I've just learned my friend Pete has told the supervisor I am not qualified for my job, the snake in the grass!"<br><br><strong>Someone's Bark Is Worse Than His Bite</strong><br><br>You know the situation: you are walking down a street and a dog runs towards you and begins to bark. You are frightened half to death - but then the dog wags his tail and licks your hand. When you've recovered from the shock you realize the dog's bark is worse than his bite. People too sometimes 'bark' but in time we learn they are not always as frightening as they seem. "Dont let Paul's shouting fool you. His bark is worse than his bite."</div>
