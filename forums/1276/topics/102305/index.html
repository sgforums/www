            <div class='col-md body'>Will be posting a bit, so dont mind me.....<br><br><strong>Adam's Ale/Wine</strong><br><br>Ale is a strong beer, and Adam was the first man on earth. When Adam thirsty all he had to drink was water. From that, Adam's ale and Adam's wine are humorous ways of referring to the water we drink. "No coffee for me, thanks," Helen said. "I'll just have a glass of Adam's ale"<br><br><strong>All Roads Lead To Rome</strong><br><br>When the Roman Empire stretched across Europe its engineers built roads which all led to Rome. "Like a spiderweb with Rome in the centre," Teddy said. Teddy's right, and that has given us this saying that now means there are many different ways of attaining a single goal. "I may do things in an unusual way but all roads lead to Rome and my method seems to work."<br><br><strong>All's Fish That Comes To The Net</strong><br><br>Fibb caught a mermaid. "Fantastic!" Fibb cried. Mrs Fibbs frowned. "But dear," Fibb said, "isnt it true what fishermen say, that all's fish that comes to the net?" Mrs Fibb frowned: "In that case, lets fry it!" Forlornly, Fibb flung the mermaid back into the sea. This proverb tells us that when something comes our way we should consider how it might be useful or benefit us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>An Apple A Day Keeps The Doctor Away</strong><br><br>"If doctors had to depend on me to make a living they'd be in financial trouble," Eve said. "Why is that?" her friend Adam asked. "Because I like apples," Eve smiled. I believe Eve is alluding to the saying an apple a day keeps the doctor away. It means apple are so nutritious they keep you in the peak of health.<br><br><strong>Be On The Safe Side</strong><br><br>It takes Arnie less than an hour to get to work but too be on the safe side he leaves his house very early in the morning. "We live in uncertain times when anything might happen," Arnie said, "so to be on the safe side I allow myself a couple of hours to get to the office." This expression means to take special precautions to avoid making a mistake.<br><br><strong>Beauty Is In The Eye Of The Beholder</strong><br><br>Robert has a new model."She's not a beauty queen," he said, "but to me she's perfect." Prunella blushed. "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, Robert." "Indeed it is," he said, "and this old saying tells us that the idea of beauty exist in our minds. What is beautiful to one person may not be beautiful to others."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>A Bed Of Roses</strong><br><br>"Life," Chadwick grinned, "is a bed of roses." Then he frowned. "The only time it's not is when I am called upon to chase mice. Not many people know this but I can't really stand the things!" Chadwick yawned and went back to sleep. A bed of roses describes a life or a situation that is agreeable and gives comfort, peace and pleasure.<br><br><strong>Beggars Cant Be Choosers</strong><br><br>Since Fergus is usually in need, he's the ideal person to explain this saying. "It says someone in need should be grateful for what is given to him - even if it's not what he wants or expects." he said. :Once I found a purse. I returned it to its owner, of course, and was given a dollar. It wasn't much and I hoped for more but when you're hungry beggars can't be choosers."<br><br><strong>A Bird In The Hand Is Worth Two In The Bush</strong><br><br>"Some people aren't content with what they have," Maltida sighed. "They don't seem to realise that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush." Maltida is using a proverb that tells us that we should be satisfied with what we have - and that we should not risk losing what we already possess searching for we imagine will be better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Blind Leading The Blind</strong><br><br>I know absolutely nothing about physics. If you asked me to help you with your physics lessons it would be a perfect example of the blind leading the blind. This expression is used to describe any situation in which a person helping or advising someone knows as little about the subject as the person who is being advised.<br><br><strong>The Buck Stops Here/With Someone</strong><br><br>"Stop!" Podunk shouted. "I'm the boss. I'll make the decisions in this offcie. The buck stops here." The expression Podunk is using means a final decisionn or total responsibility for an action rests with the speaker. In this case the buck stops with Podunk.<br><br><strong>Burn The Candle At Both Ends</strong><br><br>Those who are always busy and seem to get little rest are said to burn the candle at both ends. "Like me," Lily complained. That's true, during examination time Lily can be seen attending classes during the day and studying until the wee hours of the night. "I'll be happy when I graduate. I'll sleep all day and never have to burn the candle at both ends again," Lily daydreamed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Buy A Pig In A Poke</strong><br><br>Those who buy something without examining it for faults or check to see if they are really getting what they believe they have purchased buy a pig in a poke. "What in the world is a poke?" Elmer asked. A poke is an old, old word for a sack or cloth bag. "So if I bought Ed's old car without having a mechanic look at it I'd be buying a pig in a poke?" That's right, Elmer.<br><br><strong>Catch/Clutch/Grasp At Straws</strong><br><br>A drowning man will reach for anything to save himself, including pieces of straw. That's the idea behind this expression which means to resort to any means to save yourself when in serious trouble. "The neighbourhood kids must be desperate," Abe said. "How else can I explain the way they're clutching at straws to find ways to enjoy themselves?"<br><br><strong>Catch As Catch Can</strong><br><br>"Ozzie can neither kick nor run so there was no logical reasons for putting him on our team," the coach said. "But we needed a goalkeeper and Ozzie was the only man available. Giving him the position was more or less a case of catch-as-catch-can." I hope that doesn'toffend Ozzie because catch-as-catch-can means to do anything or use any means to achieve an aim or reach a goal.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Children Should Be Seen And Not Be Heard</strong><br><br>Much to the remorse of the children, this saying means exactly what the words say. Adults use it to suggest - a better word is command - a child to stop asking questions, talking, or making unneccessary noise. "You children must stop arguing so much. Dont you know children should be seen and not be heard?" "Isnt 'unneccessary noise' a  value judgement?" Fiona whispered.<br><br><strong>Christmas Comes But Once Each Year</strong><br><br>"Our ship's gone and we're stranded in the middle of the sea, but Christmas comes but once each year and I intend to celebrate!" Tim said. I wish Tim well - even though this saying is normally used to provide people with an excuse to indulge on food and drink and spend money during the Christmas season.<br><br><strong>Cry Over Spilt Milk</strong><br><br>Natalie is a little girl with a big problem. The cow she was milking has overturned the milk pail. "I am close to tears," Natalie cried. The cow is more relaxed about it. "A loss is a losse, but there's no point in crying over spilt milk" The cow's right - and this saying means it's pointless to get upset or feel regret about a loss or mistake that can't be undone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Curiousity Killed The Cat</strong><br><br>Cats are said to have nine lives. It's also said that having too much curiousity kills them. That has given us this proverb which we use to warn people not to show too much interest in affairs that didnt concern them. "You attend to your affairs and I'll attend to mine. Remember that curiousity killed the cat."<br><br><strong>Cut Off Your Nose To Spite Your Face</strong><br><br>When people are dissatisfied or angry, they sometimes react by doing foolish things that proves harmful to themselves. When someone does, he is said to cut off his nose to spite his face. "If you quit your job before you find another, you might be cutting off your nose to spite your face," Tom cautioned his brother.<br><br><strong>Dead Men Tell No Tales</strong><br><br>This proverb states that those who are no longer alive aren't able to speak - and therefore won't reveal someone's deepest, darkest secrets. "We may never learn the truth behind the JFK's assassination. All the witnesses are gone, and as you know dead men tell no tales."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Devil Finds Work For Idle Hands</strong><br><br>When Maurice was young, his parents warned him that the devil finds work for idle hands. They were telling him that unless he kept busy doing useful or constructive things he could be tempted into mischief or evil. "Sorry, but I dont think the saying the devil finds work for the idle hands means I should waste my time sweeping floors," Maurice said to a stranger.<br><br><strong>The Devil Has The Best Tunes</strong><br><br>About 200 years ago a religious leader in England named John Wesley turned popular songs into church hymns. "Why should the devil has the best tunes?" he asked. Today someone doing unworthy things because it gives him pleasure might use this phrase humourously. "I know I watch too much television when I should be studying but the devil has the best tunes," Kurt said.<br><br><strong>Dog Eat Dog</strong><br><br>In a competitive situations where each person has his own interests at heart and his own desires in mind it is usually the strong and the determined who succeed. People refer to this type of situation as dog eat dog. "I am happy that there's no dog eat dog in the office where I work," Mildred said. Millie is fortunate because there are some who might say we seen to live in a dog-eat-dog world.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Every Cloud Has A Silver Lining</strong><br><br>A drop of rain landed on Felix's head. That caused him to look up until he located a particular cloud. "Sometimes when it's raining we can see the sun peeking through the clouds," he said. That causes some clouds to have a silver edge and had led to the saying that no matter how dark things are every cloud has a silver lining" He smiled. "That means good things usually follow the bad."<br><br><strong>An Exception To The Rule</strong><br><br>While inspecting his troops, the captain noticed something odd. "What's wrong with you?" he shouted at Wilburforce. "My moustache is an exception to the rule," Wilburforce replied. There are no exceptions to the rule in the army," the captain barked - and no one saw Wilburforce again. An exception to the rule is something that does not conform to or agree with a rule.<br><br><strong>Experience Is The Best Teacher</strong><br><br>You can tell someone how to do something and you can show him how to do it. He will learn best, though, if he does it himself. That's the idea expressed in this saying. "Hold tight and keep trying," Agatha smiled as her niece flew by in her broomstick. "Experience is the best teacher."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Fling/Sling/Throw Mud At Someone</strong><br><br>Fling, sling and throw mean virtually the same thing. In this proverb, to fling/sling or throw mud at someone is to say evil or bad things about someone and in doing so, to damage his or her reputation. "Some people sling mud at people just because they're jealous," Sammy said. That's just awful, isnt it" It is and wouldnt it be nicer world if everyone stopped throwing mud?<br><br><strong>A Fool And His Money Are Soon Parted</strong><br><br>Many people know this proverb but few actually practise it. It says that a person who spends his money foolishly will soon be penniless. That is, he and his money are parted. "Rodney made a lot of money last month but he spent it unwisely. A fool and his money are soon parted, they say."<br><br><strong>Forgive And Forget</strong><br><br>Officer Mutt caught Albert in the act of leaving the jail. "I was just stepping out for a pizza. Forgive me and forget it," Albert said. Mutt was furious. " You do such naughty things! How can you expect me to forgive and forget!" The expression forgive and forget refers to excusing or pardoning someone for doing something. " And then trying your best to forget it!" Mutt muttered.</div>

No matter how difficult things are, he can always be depended on to help. "Oh,oh, I forgot my umbrella," Felix said. "Dont worry, you can share mine," both Herb and Dan smiled. "After all, a friend in need is a friend indeed."<br><br><strong>Genius Is The Infinite Capacity For Taking Pains</strong><br><br>The writer Thomas Carlyle said that the genius consists of having limitless patience to do a perfect job but he said it in the way it appears above. If someone were to ask me to give an example, I'd suggest they stand at Robert's window watching him work. "Its not easy painting butterflies! Robert exclaimed.<br><br><strong>Give Someone Enough Rope And He Will Hang HImself</strong><br><br>If encouraged, a person doing wrong, foolish or ridiculous things will keep on doing them. 'He doesnt even have to be encouraged," Lester said. Just let him keep doing wrong because if you give him enough rope he'll hang himself."

Actually the golden key here is money and it is asumed it will let someone do anything he wants.<br><br><strong>Greener Pastures</strong><br><br>"I've discovered a way to keep my pastures looking fresh," Mortimer grinned, "and by offerring my cows greener pastures they're happy to stay at home." Greener pastures refers to a place where conditions appear to be better or more livable. "MY cows have disappeared!," one of Mortimer's neighbours complained.

Known for his cheerful disposition, Chuck wasnt alarmed. "I have a way of looking at misfortune,' he said. "I simply grin and bear it."

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Home Is Where The Heart Is</strong><br><br>No matter where you are, 'home' is where you feel most comfortable and content. It is where you really and truly want to be. "No matter where my steps might lead me, my heart will always ne here with you and my good friends," Albert said. "I know," Officer Mutt said. "Home is where the heart is."<br><br><strong>If Money Is Not Thy Servant It Will Be Thy Master</strong><br><br>This proverb - and you are likely to see a number of variations of it - is a caution: use money wisely and you are its master. Use it badly and you become its slave. No one knows better than the King for he has this to say about it: "Money hasnt made me its servant for I am the humble master of all money I collect from my subjects!"<br><br><strong>If The mountain Will Not Come to Mohammed, Mohammed Must Go To The Mountain</strong><br><br>This saying is so long that its usually shortened in several ways. Its a reminder that if someone wants something its not going to come about by itself: he must do soemthing to attain his goals. "if its success you're after you will have to work for it. Keep in mind that the mountain isnt going to come to Mohammed," Mrs Bell said to her son Alexander.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>If Wishes Were Horses, Beggars Would Ride</strong><br><br>If we could get all the things we wanted just by making a wish, everyone would have all he ever wanted. That would include beggars, of course, who usually would suddenly become rich. This saying is usually shortened to if wishes were horse. "If wishes were horse I'd live in a big house."<br><br><strong>If You Cant Lick Them ('em), Join Them ('em)</strong><br><br>Today we are going to join some leopards to look at an old saying. The 'em' in it is a contraction of 'them', and its pronounced um. We can define this as saying 'if you cannot defeat an opponent or get him to change his ideas, plans or way of doing things, the best thing is to change your ideas, plans etc'<br><br><strong>In For A Penny, In For A Pound </strong><br><br>The pound here is the British pound sterling. A penny is one hundredth part of one. This old saying tells us that if we decide to do something, we should commit ourselves to it boldly and completely. "I am going to devote myself to earning as much as possible this summer," Teddy said. "After all, in for a penny, out for a pound."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>A Job Worth Doing Is A Job Worth Doing Well.</strong><br><br>Jeffrey has made what may be his last great trip of explorations. Watching someone trying to build a fire by rubbing sticks together he became distressed. "Havent you heard that a job woth doing is a job worth doing well? Here, use my lighter!" This proverb means if you do something you should do it as well as you can.<br><br><strong>Keep The Wolf From The Door</strong><br><br>Wolves, it is said, prey on the weak when searching for food. From that, the 'wolf' in this expression is a metaphor for hunger. To keep the wolf from the door, then, is to avoid hunger and poverty. "I dont like my job,' Rudolph confessed, "but I have to do something to keep the wolf from the door."<br><br><strong>Keep A Dog And Bark Oneself</strong><br><br>People who keep a dog to guard their property would be very unhappy if the dog failed to do his duty. In the same way, a boss who has to do the work his employees should be doing might complain to them by using this expression: "You're never around when I need you! I might as well keep a dog and bark myself!"</div>

Two birds in autumn were discussing winter plans. "Why dont we kill two birds with one stone by stopping off to visit Aunt Martha when we fly south this winter?"<br><br><strong>Know A Hawk From A Handsaw</strong><br><br>When Shakespeare was searching for a way to have Hamlet tell people that he wasnt a fool and that he indeed knew what he was talking about, he gave Hamlet these words to say (Hamlet II,2). Here we have Teddy using the same words to say somethin gabout his uncle. "He's the smartest man in the world. If anyone knows a hawk from a handsaw, Uncle Felix does."<br><br><strong>Laugh And The World Laughs With You</strong><br><br>Most people like to laugh. I guess thats why someone once said that laughter is contagious. Therefore, when someone is in a happy,cheerful mood, people like being with him. Thats the meaning behind laugh and the world laughs with you. The complete saying is this: laugh and the world laughs with you, weep and you weep alone.</div>

That is, less we say about it the sooner the incident will be forgotten.<br><br><strong>LIfe Is Just A Bowl Of Cherries</strong><br><br>This is the title of a song that was popular in US in the 1930s. The song spoke of life being full of happiness and pleasure though tehre was a certain amoutn of sarcasm in it. Today the expression mightb e used hopefully or mockingly. "I just got promoted! Life is just a bow of cherries!" "I fell terrible, but I keep telling myself life is just a bow of cherries."<br><br><strong>Like A Bull In A China Shop</strong><br><br>You can imagine what happen if a bull walked into a china shop. It would lead to a mess, and thats why we say a clumsy or tactless person is like a bull in a china shop. "Jim has no patience or diplomacy.

Thats the idea behind this proverb. Therefore, we should take care to prevent trouble before - not after - it happens. "Thats why I am locking up," Mortimer said. "The horse is gone but I dont want people stealing my hay!"<br><br><strong>The Longest Day Must Have An End</strong><br><br>Some days seems partcularly long and endless, especially when we're unhappy.Every day does end, though, even those that are painful or difficult. By extension, all difficult jobs or situations also have an end. "This has been an awful day," Felix mumbled, " but even the longest day must have an end, thank goodness!"<br><br><strong>Look Before One Leaps</strong><br><br>"I never make mistakes. I always look before I leap," Henry declared. His wife wasnt so sure. "How about the time you jumped into the lake?" she asked, "That was different.

If someone loses something, he weeps - but if someone finds it, he keeps it. As you might imagine, children who say this are usually 'the finders' of something. "THe King cant find his crown. Losers weepers, finders keepers," Nobbin laughed.<br><br><strong>Love Me, Love My Dog</strong><br><br>This old saying comes from the fact that people who have dogs expect others to appreciate them as much as they do. It has come to mean that if we want a person's friendship we must accept him totally, faults and all. "I know i talk too much, Harry, but as the saying goes love me, love my dog."<br><br><strong>Many Hand Make Light Work</strong><br><br>Mr Hayday is fortunate to have found somone as useful as Ollie for his shipping department.
