            <div class='col-md body'>Don't worry too much. You did the right thing. By exposing him, you are doing a favour to everyone who studied hard for the exam. I know it's difficult sometimes to choose between being morally right or to just ignore something and remain 'popular'. Plus, you might be doing him a favour as well because if he gets away from cheating in an exam, god knows what else he will attempt.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in one of my econs class a term ago,  the prof caught two chaps cheating on one of the mid-terms, the chaps somehow got hold of restricted answer booklets which we write all our exams and tests on, filled with formulas and answers ... and were hiding it by putting it on their laps ......<br><br>the prof stared hard at me too ... cos I was of the same skin colour as the guilty chaps .... and I was sitting right beside both of them ...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>these chaps really disgraced themselves ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ... I'm not sure what the penalty would be like for tertiary institutions in Singapore, cos I have never encountered any cheating cases during my poly days ... but overseas institutions take such things very very seriously .... even copying assignments (or lending your assignments for others to copy) is a big no-no, and you can be referred to a faculty panel to be disciplined ... which I think is the right attitude too ... needless to say, with a mark like that, their academic career is over .....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok cheating is obivously wrong. U did the right thing.<br>I think the lines of cheating have already been blurred. If u know the qns b4 the test, is that cheating? But look whats happen around topical tests. At least these are still considered minor.<br>But cheating in a major exam, what's the point ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You done the RIGHT thing. Your brother scolded you for telling he cheated is probably because he cheated once and hates people who see it and tell the teacher. No offence though! Just a theory.</div>
