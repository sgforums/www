            <div class='col-md body'>Use to stay at Blk 70 Telok Blangah Heights in the 90s...nice environment as it faced Telok Blangah hills..very cool at night bcoz got many large trees. Can't recall the unit number bcoz we moved out in just two weeks aft we moved in.....THis is wat happened...<br><br>My dad bought the flat year back but we nv stayed there bcoz we have another house. The Blk 70 flat was rented out cheap to my relatives...but none stayed long and did not say why...<br><br>Then we moved in...I brought along a large poster of Buddha and placed it in my room which I shared wif my younger brother...Everything was normal to me....so I was shocked why my parents quarrel and wanted to move out urgently in just two weeks<br><br>My father constantly experience 'someone' grabbing him on his arm when he was brushing his teeth at the kitchen toilet...My mother, a housewife...kept seeing shadows darting away...my elder brother and parents heard noises at night that kept them awake<br><br>My younger brother and I felt nothing....<br><br>My father got a Chinese medium who told us that he 'saw' a female hanging by the main bedroom doorway when he came to inspect our house. A ritual was done and exorcism was done too (cost a bomb!!). The flat was 'cleaned' but my mom refuse to stay.<br><br>As the quarrel got worse between my parents, my relatives who previous stayed at this Blk 70 flat came and found out. They told my dad actually they moved bcoz they were harassed by a female spirit. One of my young cousin actually saw a female in the living room watching TV and asked my auntie how come this 'Jie Jie' everynight come and watch TV wif him.<br>Another auntie of mine fought back when she feel someone grab her arm...she ended up wif bruises..<br><br>The new owners came and wanted to view the flat at 12 midnite. They knew something was wrong as my father sold the flat too cheap. The new owners brought a baby in and view the flat. They brought the baby and rushed to all corners and the baby did not cry...the new owners say the flat is clean and bought it.<br><br>A few years back this particular block was demolished for reasons unknown...while all the surrounding blocks, even older, remains...</div>
