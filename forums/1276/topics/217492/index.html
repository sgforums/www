            <div class='col-md body'>Today is not a working day for me.<br>But yesterday late afternoon this lawyer called me and said he wanted a document urgently for his client. The document is kept with us for safe custody. I have met this lawyer before and thought he was just a normal guy doing his job. So I say I can try help him, as a favour, as we have met.<br>Then he started taking it that I am the one responsible and kept rushing me. But I did not get clearance yet so I email to another department to confirm that the document can be released.<br>It was 3 plus pm on a Friday and we do not work the next day, a Saturday. By right it will be settled on Monday, the next working day.<br><br>Today, a Saturday, I went back to my office alone at 9 plus am and checked my email. True enough, I received a reply from the other department confirmed thru email that the document can be released. I then called this lawyer immediately and asked him to come down with his client and he said he will come at 11 am. I told him to come on time and to witness the document to be handed over to his client.<br><br>The client came first at 10:40 am but I needed the lawyer to be present. The lawyer came at 10:57 am and I retreived the document from the safe, processed the paperwork to hand over the document.<br><br>When I attended to them at 11:15 am, the lawyer shouted at me. He asked me why I made him wait for 45 minutes. I told him he only waited for 15 minutes and he said why so long? Then he threaten to call my highest boss demanding to know why he called at 3 plus pm yesterday but take almost 24 hours to collect a document.<br>I told him no-one is working today and I am doing him a personal favour by coming in to settle this matter for him.<br>He ased him why am I not present when instructions were given to release the document. I said this is not under my care and I have no idea when the instruction was passed. I am just doing him a favour becoz I know how to retreive and return this document.<br>This arguement was for a few minutes and the client was puzzled why a 1 minute hand-over process became any arguement for a few minutes.<br><br>I was really angry!! Why he is shouting at me when I am doing him a favour on my off day for someone else??<br><br>Then this this lawyer say "I don't want to argue with you. Lets get this over with!" Huh?? Who wanst to argue??<br>I handed over the document to the client and he gladly accepted the document, explaining to me that he needs to leave for overseas so he needs the document urgently. I said no prob, thats why I am here to help.<br><br>I am really disturbed by this incident the whole day! I went an extra mile to help and I got blamed!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
