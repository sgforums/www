            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry to bother you guys to read but I need to get this off my chest.<br><br>My boss used to work with my colleague Mr TXX when I knew them.<br>My boss got promoted and became our boss when I joined my boss team.<br>Now Mr TXX and him still good friends and my boss strongly promote him for promotion. I did not complain as I was promoted too. But I felt I did no less than Mr TXX.<br><br>Now Mr TXX got promoted and became one post below my boss. Mr TXX is doing lesser work and getting lesser assignment. But his pay is now near my Boss in view of his year of service.<br><br>Sometimes Mr TXX ask me to do things for him bcoz he got meeting to attend on behalf of my boss. We did projects together and the results were good. But my boss feels that Mr TXX had credit. But in actual fact Mr TXX ticked me off during our projects when I gave him extra research info for him to present.<br><br>Last Friday, I was given a few heavy project and the last one I asked my boss to give it to Mr TXX, as I can knew I shd not take too much or I can't do all properly. My Boss says OK but gave the last heavy project to another colleague of mine.<br><br>I wonder why not give Mr TXX as he was a suitable person to handle this heavy project as Mr TXX is very expierence. But I least tot about it as I focused on my work.<br><br>Today my colleague told me that he was talking to my boss and my boss is very unhappy that I suggest to him that Mr TXX shd take last heavy project. He says I am implying that Mr TXX has little work. My colleague says Mr TXX does not have much heavy stuff. My Boss says thats bcoz Mr TXX clears his work fast. My Boss also say I shd not have rejected this last heavy project which he wans me to take.<br><br>I see beh du lan. Given less heavy assignment of course can clear other small projects on time lah! Nv mind the privileges he gets, but my boss unhappy bcoz I propose Mr TXX handle the last heavy project. Why is he so protective over Mr TXX. Maybe I shd be happy he thinks highly of me, but I know taking all may drown me. And this is THE VERY FIRST TIME I rejected an assigment since 2002 when my boss first came.<br><br>Worst SHIT is I can't quit bcoz I have a study bond until end 2006. Very buay song!!</div>
