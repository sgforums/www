            <div class='col-md body'>A little boy asked his mother, "Why are you crying?" "Because I'm a woman," she told him.<br><br>"I don't understand," he said. His Mom just hugged him and said, "And you never will."<br><br>Later the little boy asked his father, "Why does mother seem to cry for no reason?"<br><br>" All women cry for no reason," was all his dad could say.<br><br>The little boy grew up and became a man, still wondering why women cry.<br><br>Finally he put in a call to God. When God got on the phone, he asked, "God, why do women cry so easily?"<br><br>God said: " When I made the woman she had to be special. I made her shoulders strong enough to carry the weight of the world, yet gentle enough to give comfort. I gave her an inner strength to endure childbirth and the rejection that many times comes from her children. I gave her a hardness that allows her to keep going when everyone else gives up, and take care of her family through sickness and fatigue without complaining. I gave her the sensitivity to love her children under any and all circumstances, even when her child has hurt her very badly.<br><br>I gave her strength to carry her husband through his faults and fashioned her from his rib to protect his heart. I gave her wisdom to know that a good husband never hurts his wife, but sometimes tests her strengths and her resolve to stand beside him unfalteringly. And finally, I gave her a tear to shed. This is hers exclusively to use whenever it is needed."<br><br>"You see my son," said God, "the beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, the figure that she carries, or the way she combs her hair.<br><br>The beauty of a woman must be seen in her eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart - the place where love resides."</div>
