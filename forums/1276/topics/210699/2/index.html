I think both of you have drifted, and thus the problems. It is not easy to maintain a relationship. If both of you are willing to work hard to work it well, it will take effort. She needs attention and lots of it. She is still young too, can tell. Do not make her pregnant just to tie her down. It may lead to resentment. But sometimes, woman react to mother instincts. If she is ready and if you can afford to, can consider starting a family. A relationship must always move up one level. From courtship to marriage to having kids. Progression is the word. If it remains stagnant, there is really nothing to look forward to. But, you must solve your dissatisfaction fast, or you will start strangling her and the relationship. Or she may rebel. So, talk it out. If words go on deaf ears and still cannot work out, maybe its time to move on. Don't give up on working your marriage. Vows already taken. But if insufferable, do not torture yourself please.</div>

And it is not really for anyone to impose values on other people.<br><br>However, a couple must have the same or similar standards if not there might be issues.<br><br>But what i can tell, it seems that somehow your wife doesn't think of what she is doing is "wrong". Maybe to her, as long as she doesn't have sxx with these men, she is "faithful".<br><br>Obviously you don't think so, and there is the disconnect.<br><br>I am not sure how to resolve it, but it might be better to meet midway... tell her how you feel.... and maybe she cann continue to go out but less frequently. she should also promise to restrain herself... in the physical side but promise not to meddle with her again....<br><br>maybe you can then live happily ever after...<br><br>i am not the clubbing type, but i don't think this kind of lifestyle is  long term, at some point she will be sian... or she will be "old" and no longer attractive enough to attract attention. correct? so time is on your side.<br><br>Since u marry her, there must be some attributes good about her that you like/love. So just focus on that....  and think positive.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>your wife v immature from her way of defending herself against unfaithfuless.<br><br>she is also v stubborn and stuff judging from her actions after speaking with you.<br><br>also she is not ready for marriage even though she is married. she doesnt want to be tied down yet, but from what i read , it seems she is not working. meaning she is a housewife in a sort. but if she aint working, and i dont suppose she is those sporty type who wants to go on adventures and stuff, i think not having a kid is a sign of not able to commit.<br><br>how old are you 2? and what are your jobs? i am guessin you met her during clubbing. so if she is a chiongster, noting much you can do about it unless she matures. did you watch the Da Nan Ren, Xiao Nan Ren? your wife is more or less playing the role of Ezann Lee.<br><br>from the above i think your wife needs a lot of attention. i think she is not unfaithful...yet(touch wood)... but attention is 1 of her needs. thats why she when she needed attention and you were working, she went out. and now that she found a stable source of attention, she doesnt "need" you for attention liao.<br><br>is your wife like a va va voom type of girl? where guys take 1 look and fall head over heels? if so, you can be sure she is getting a lot of unwanted attention to you from the guys, but the best kind of attention she might need from a guy.<br><br>and from what the guy's answer seem to be, he is not a responsible 1. he is just trying to push the blame to your wife. however i think both are at fault, yet in a way both are not wrong in what they want, only wrong is how and where they get it. like your wife wants attention, but getting it from other guys and having itimate holdings is wrong when married. and the guy he wants to have fun but messing with a married lady is a no no.<br><br>what i would suggest is,<br>1) go out with her friends, even if 1 last time, just to let them know you 2 are married.<br>2) talk to her, explain to her your concerns<br>3) start family planning<br><br>if things doesnt turn out positive, i would suggest a separation. it might be temporal or permanent, but i think a separation will do you both good. stop paying for the livelihood at that time.not even a little, or she might think that you purpolsey dont want support her. just let her know that , you need a little time alone, and that she needs to learn to support herself.<br><br>1) you can cool down and think if she is meant for you<br>2) she will start thinking also since she is being forced to stand on her own.<br>3) she will start working, so she will get the stress and stuff. emapthy.<br><br>if she decides to come back to you, high chance your marriage will work out smoothier than now. if she doesnt come back to you for whatever reasons, it is better to end it now, than to find out that she is doing the reason in the future.<br><br>thats all i can think for now. good luck pal. but from the looks of things, if she does not "mature" up into a wife, i guess it is better to call quits. the way she is behaving now is like, "gf+support" where she is your gf, and you support her livelihood. by gf i meant "as long as we are not married, i am allowed to see any men i want and do anything i want." by support i meant ... support with finance.<br></div>

Pressing her for answers will only irritate her and detest.<br><br>Pay her back with her own coin. She wanna go out with guys? You go out with gals...but only for casual meals only. No clubbing...if not wat diff am I from her? Dun volunteer information before hand on such outing. Answer on demand only. Let her know what its like to know only when she probe, then will she knows whats its feel like not being informed before hand when your partner is going out with the opposite gender. She screams at you? Ask her why you were not informed of her last outing with her male fd...and tell her its the same reasons. BUT STRONGLY ADVISED TO USE THIS METHOD ONLY ONCE.<br><br>Talks to gals on the phone quietly. Cut the conversation when she probes. There's nothing actually going on with the conversation...mainly work or look for another fd's number or email. Just to get her suspicion, which will naturally arise when she loves you.<br><br>Spent quality time with her like courtship days...then make this outings good only on certains days and work late on the rest of the days and no outings at all. She will treasure the good times together and keep herself free and look forward to the next outing with you.<br><br>I learn all this from a gal, who is often piss off by her man, telling me how to get back at your woman... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
