Is it the macho pride that is wounded by your discovery? Is it jealousy that your wife is close to someone else? Is it love for your wife that makes you insecure?<br><br>Understanding that will help you to define your next actions ba. Ultimately, you need to know if you are doing this out of love or not. Because if it is due to love, and what you want is to CORRECT the situation, your immature behaviour to embarass her in front of her friends will just aggravate things. You are not mending things with actions but by talking a lot, being confrontational, being accusatory, and alienating her more.<br><br>She doesn't OWE you her company. You can say she's my WIFE, she MUST spend time with me. but that is not sadly the truth. Before she became your wife, she must first CHOOSE to spend time with you. And this choice doesn't disappear when she becomes your wife. You don't OWN her. Have you given her good reason to enjoy your company?<br><br>Instead of staying in the rut and in the past, learn to spend time with her again. You can't stop her from wanting to spend time with her friends, and her reason is valid. But you CAN try to make her enjoy the time she spends with YOU so that she will CHOOSE to spend time with you over them. Let your actions speak.  In time she will see your good intentions.<br><br>But it all comes to - what is your baseline? How much effort do u plan to put in? The more effort you put in to destroy her rapport with her friends, the more you push her to them. So good luck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I suggest that the 2 pf you had better sit down and have an open and calm talk to find out how each other feels abt this whole thing. If the 2 of u still cherish yr marriage, then this talk will be the basis to keep communication channels between u both open and rebuild the trust that is obviously frayed.<br><br>If she refuses, then it's time to weigh yr priorities: continue to live wif her and feelings of betrayal or sever the marriage and earn peace of mind and move on in life. Before severing the marriage, perhaps considering a separatin may be good to give both of you time to reflect..................<br><br>Good luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
