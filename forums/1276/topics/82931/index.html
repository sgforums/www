            <div class='col-md body'>aiyo. go ask him lor. sometimes, the best way to get an answer is to ask the person himself. its pretty pointless speculating here and there.<br><br>if he has to read this thread to tell u how he feels and thinks, both of u have serious communication problems.<br><br>if a couple cant even sit down to talk to each other, and have to rely on the forum to communicate emotional issues, do u think this relationship's going to work in long run?</div>

Try to approach him gently and be interested to listen to him.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong>Become a Solid -- and Secure -- Listener </strong><br><br>Is it even possible to have honest relationships? The assumption is that everybody's going to be honest. The truth is, few people are. And the main reason that people are dishonest is that the consequences are too big. Many men feel that women want and need to be lied to because they can't take the honest truth. Some of my clients have said that they fear telling their partner what is really going on in their lives, or how they truly feel because it will upset her. In fact, many women use their emotions to control men -- and control the relationship. They demand certain responses from men, and feel devastated if they don't get them. Then they're surprised when he shuts down and doesn't talk.<br><br>Unfortunately, many women also have strong images of how a man is "supposed" to feel, and think. That kind of fantasy makes the truth devastating, so they let the man know in many subtle ways that they do not want it. Sound familiar? We're all guilty of this from time to time, but being willing to listen to what he has to say is the beginning of a truly mature relationship. It gives the man the feeling that he has a solid partner who will be there with him through thick and thin.<br><br>Too long to type all. Anyway, i hope you get what i mean.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>
