But diff ppl hab diff views, so you need to find out the reason y mito will think so.<br><br>I know it's been tiring for you, as you've been feeling you are giving in too much to mito and instead he is sort of 'mistreating' u from what you expect from him.<br><br>But dear girl, it's okie to have expectation in a r.s for not wise to forced it to happen. If mito's has all along been like that, y not try to accept instead of changing him if it has been so hard?<br><br>I believe mito has his gd points too rite? and that's what attracts you to him. No one is perfect, just like our ten fingers, they have never been equal in length..<br><br>this is only a small matter, if he dun like it, and you are sensitive to his feelings, instead of making yourself angry that he's not supportive, you can try the softer approach of delaying it, or talk him out 1st b4 you keep insisting on going and let dis tied a dead knot in both of ur hearts.<br><br>Give urself some faith and give him some too. Both of you needs communication.<br><br>Most impt, I need to remind you again, mito is a regular, so he may be more temperamental compared to times when u n him are still in school, and also, you are in the working class now, so things will be a lot diff when comes to this level in your life.<br><br>It may b tough, but if you love him n he loves you, y not put in more effort to show ur love instead of squabbling everyday, just to prove who loves who more, who cares for who more?<br><br>I dunno if mito will read dis, but shan_cai dear, I may not write as well as Yunhaier, or even able to relieve u betta, still I hope my advise can help u sort out ur emotions.<br><br>Life is so fragile, cherish ur moments, be glad that you have each other, be glad that you are in loved, for some that may not have the chance or the ability to be like us.<br><br>Anything, girl reach me at my mobile.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

But diff ppl hab diff views, so you need to find out the reason y mito will think so.<br><br>I know it's been tiring for you, as you've been feeling you are giving in too much to mito and instead he is sort of 'mistreating' u from what you expect from him.<br><br>But dear girl, it's okie to have expectation in a r.s for not wise to forced it to happen. If mito's has all along been like that, y not try to accept instead of changing him if it has been so hard?<br><br>I believe mito has his gd points too rite? and that's what attracts you to him. <span style="color: red;">No one is perfect, just like our ten fingers,</span> they have never been equal in length..<br><br>this is only a small matter, if he dun like it, and you are sensitive to his feelings, instead of making yourself angry that he's not supportive, you can try the softer approach of delaying it, or talk him out 1st b4 you keep insisting on going and let dis tied a dead knot in both of ur hearts.<br><br>Give urself some faith and give him some too. Both of you needs communication.<br><br>Most impt, I need to remind you again, mito is a regular, so he may be more temperamental compared to times when u n him are still in school, and also, you are in the working class now, so things will be a lot diff when comes to this level in your life.<br><br>It may b tough, but if you love him n he loves you, y not put in more effort to show ur love instead of squabbling everyday, just to prove who loves who more, who cares for who more?<br><br>I dunno if mito will read dis, but shan_cai dear, I may not write as well as Yunhaier, or even able to relieve u betta, still I hope my advise can help u sort out ur emotions.<br><br>Life is so fragile, cherish ur moments, be glad that you have each other, be glad that you are in loved, for some that may not have the chance or the ability to be like us.<br><br>Anything, girl reach me at my mobile.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>No finger is perfect. not even my middle fingers, but they look da same when I flash them out!<br>..l..
