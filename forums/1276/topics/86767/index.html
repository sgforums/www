            <div class='col-md body'>If you are a <span style="color: red;"><strong>Dog</strong></span>: A very loyal and sweet person.  Your loyalty can never be doubted. You are quite honest and sincere when it comes to your attitude towards working. You are a very simple person, indeed. Absolutely hassle free, humble and down-to-earth!!  That explains the reason why your friends cling on to you! You have a good taste for clothes. If your wardrobe is not updated with what is trendy, you sure are depressed.  Popular and easy-going.  You have a little group of dignified friends, all of them being quality-personified.<br><br>If you are a <span style="color: red;"><strong>Mouse</strong></span>: Always up to some sort of a mischief! The mischievous gleam in your eyes is what makes you so cute and attractive to everyone. You are an extremely fun-to-be-with kind of person. No wonder, people seek for your company and look forward to include you for all get-togethers. However, you are sensitive, which is a drawback. People need to select their words while talking to you. If someone tries to fiddle around and play with words while dealing with you, it is enough to invite your wrath. God bless the person then!<br><br>If you are a <span style="color: red;"><strong>Lion</strong></span>: Quite contradictory to your name, you are a peace loving person. You best try to avoid a situation wherein you are required to fight. An outdoor person, you dislike sitting at one place for a long duration. You are a born leader, and have it in you how to tactfully derive work from people. You love being loved, and when you receive your share of limelight from someone, you are all theirs!!!! Well, well... hence some people could even take an advantage, flatter you to the maximum and get their work done. So be careful.....</div>

At times, you prefer quietness. You love exploring various things and going into depth of each thing.

Basically, you mingle along freely but don't like talking much to strangers. People feel very easy in your company. You observe care in choosing your friends.<br><br>If you are a <strong><span style="color: red;">Turtle</span></strong>: You are near to perfect and nice at heart.  The examples of your kindness are always circulated in groups of people.  You, too, love peace. You wouldn't like to retaliate even to a person who is in the wrong. You are loved due to this. You do not wish to talk behind one's back. People love the way you always treat them. You can give, give and give love, and the best part is that you do not expect it back in return.  You are generous enough.  Seeing things in a practical light is what remains the best trait of you guys.<br><br>If you are a <strong><span style="color: red;">Dove</span></strong>: You symbolize a very happy-go-lucky approach in life.  Whatever the surroundings may be, grim or cheerful, you remain unaffected.  In fact, you spread cheer wherever you go. You are the leader of your group of friends and good at consoling people in their times of need. You dislike hypocrisy and tend to shirk away from hypocrites. They can never be in your good books, no matter what. You are very methodical and organized in your work. No amount of mess, hence, can ever encompass you. Beware, it is easy for you to fall in love....</div>
