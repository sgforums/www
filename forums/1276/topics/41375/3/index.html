With Bill Paxton acting as host, the group of scientists, biologists, and historians thoroughly explore the wreck with submersibles and remote operated vehicles (ROV's). ROV's specially designed by Cameron himself, nicknamed Jake and Elwood, go deep in the interior of the ship to see what remains of the elaborate decorations inside. Along the way they discover eerie artifacts that belonged to the famous passengers.<br><br>As the wreck is explored, images of the original passengers and crew are superimposed over the rusting hull to help you visualize what everything is. The expedition takes a rather poignant turn when Cameron and crew rise to the surface to the news of the September 11th terrorist attacks.<br></div>

When they learn about a rave happening on a remote island near Seattle from Greg's best friend, SIMON CRUZ (TYRON LEITSO), they rush to recruit their heartbroken roommate, ALICIA (ONA GRAUER), to join them. Reluctantly, she agrees, but by the time they arrive at the party boat, it's already left for the island.<br><br>Not willing to accept defeat, Simon pays the hard-as-nails boat captain, VICTOR KIRK (JURGEN PROCHNOW), to charter his vessel, the Lazarus, to take them to the rave. Pursued by the coast guard, Kirk barely eludes his nemesis, JORDAN CASPER (ELLIE CORNELL), and reaches shore safely.<br><br>But when they arrive on the island, they find it completely deserted. As they search for the missing ravers, they encounter mysterious creatures which attack them. Seeking refuge in a spooky house, built along the shore of the island, the terrified students encounter Alicia's ex-boyfriend, RUDY (JONATHAN CHERRY), and his friend, HUGH (MICHAEL EKLUND), two of the only survivors of a horrible melee which took the lives of everyone at the rave. Unable to believe Rudy's story of bloodthirsty zombies, Hugh plays back a videotape which shows an onslaught of the deadly creatures devouring the ravers during the party.<br><br>Hoping to escape from the island alive, they make a run for the charter boat, but Captain Kirk has problems of his own as strange, mutated beasts begin to climb onboard and attack the ship, while the surviving ravers make a desperate attempt to reach the boat. Fleeing to shore, as the boat is overrun by zombies, they nurse their wounds only to be confronted with more deadly creatures.<br><br>Attempting to make it back to the house to seek sanctuary from the growing number of zombies, they square off against more of the killer beasts prowling through the woods. Staving off an attack, they make it safely into the house where they search for any weapons they can use against the encroaching zombies...<br><br></div>

This leads them to a conspiracy involving a vicious Kingpin (Molla), whose ambitions have ignited a bloody turf war.

Who doesnt like a movie filled with chiobus, fast car and smart mouthed actors. Where martin lawrence gt nowhr with his career after that movie and Will Smith got jiggy with it and churned out a few hits (no bad movies in his track record so far), they do make a good combination to serve slapstick laughter and lotsa attitude. </span></div>
