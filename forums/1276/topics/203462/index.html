So you cannot say that the wife has lied.<br><br>Assuming she deliberately chose not to reveal she was going drinking with male colleagues... ermm... then it's time to sit down for chit chat with wifey.<br><br>And that no female colleagues were seen with her does not mean she did not meet up with any - they could still be inside.<br><br>Actually whether she is drunk or not is quite a determining factor. The males could've been trying to help her hail a cab home, being the stronger of the sexes.<br><br>In short, communicate communicate communicate!
