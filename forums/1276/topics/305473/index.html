            <div class='col-md body'>Went to the food court at Rivervale Plaza in the morning.<br>Got a small table and I ask my 8 months pregnant wife to sit down while I go and queue at the noodle stall to get our food.<br>When I came back to our table with the noodles, I saw a male Chinese seating at our table with my wife.<br>When i put the noodles down, then I realise what is going on.<br><br>This bastard sat down on my seat and refuse to leave.<br><br>My wife said this guy asked if he can seat at our table and my wife said fine, thinking that he is going to get another chair. But he just took my seat! My wife told him that my seat is occupied and he said whoever is with my wife can seat at the chair next to my wife, which my wife place her handbag. Then he talk some cock stuff saying its a public food court and he can sit where ever he wants. He is not a mad person. He just bully my wife bcoz she is 8 months pregnant and can't move much.<br><br>I told this guy its my seat and he have to leave, trying to keep my cool.<br>But he kept saying 'No, she (my wife) said there is only one person with her so I can sit.....(and repeats the same shit all over again). Really piss me off!!! I felt like punching him.<br>I had to raise my voice and tell him to stop talking rubbich and leave! Then he reluctantly leaves. Fark I dun understand why got such a person.<br><br>I was already thinking, if he refuses to leave, what should I do?<br>What would you have done?<br></div>

              <p>2. same thing: foodcourt full; saw a lady at a table with 4 seats; asked her whether could sit there; she said ok; her husband returned with food; saw me and face turned black; reprimanded his wife "cant you tell him that the seats were taken?"; KNN! i tot of telling him off but then his wife will kena later; so quietly finished my food quickly and left.</p>
