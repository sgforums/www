            <div class='col-md body'>Susan's husband, Steven, is a scientist by profession. She loves him for his steady-being nature, and also loves the warm feeling while leaning against his broad shoulder.<br><br>Three years in the courtship and now, two years into marriage, Susan would have to admit, she's getting tired of it, the reasons of her loving Steven before has now transform into the cause of all the restlessness.<br><br>Susan is a sentimental woman and extremely sensitive and exquisite when it comes to relationship and feelings. She yearns for romantic moments, as though a little boy yearning for candy. And her husband, is just a contrast of her, his lack of sensitivity, and of all, inability of bringing romantic moments into their marriage has disheartened her about love.<br><br>One day, Susan finally decided to tell him her decision, that she wants a divorce. "Why?" Steven asked, shocking. "I am tired, there aren't reasons for everything in the world." she answered. He kept silent the whole night, seems to be in deep thoughts the whole night with cigarette lighted all the time.<br><br>Her feeling of disappointment is getting intense, a man who can't even express his detainment, what else can she hope from him? And finally he asked:" What can I do to change your mind?"<br><br>Somebody said it right, it's hard to change a person's personality, and Susan guesses, she has started losing faith in Steven. Look deep into his eyes and she slowly answered: "Here is a question, if you can find the answer in my heart, I will change my mind, Let's say, I love a flower at a mountain cliff, and we both sure that the making you to pick the flower will cause death, will you do it for me?"<br><br>He said :" I will give you your answer tomorrow...." Her heart just sank by listening to his respond.<br><br>The next morning, Steven was not around, and Susan saw a piece of paper with his scratching writing, underneath a glass of warm milk, It goes....<br><br><strong>Dear, </strong><br><br><strong>"I would not pick that flower for you, but please allow me to further explain the reasons." </strong>[This first line has already break her heart. She continued reading.] <strong>"You can only type with computer and always mess up the programs in the PC, and cry in front of the screen, I have to save my fingers so that I can help to restore the programs."</strong><br><br><strong>"You always left the house key behind, I have to save my legs to rush home to open the door for you. You love travelling but always lose your way in a new city, I have to save my eyes to lead you the way."</strong><br><br><strong>"You always have cramps whenever your "good friend" approach every month, I have to save my palm so that I can calm the cramp at your tummy. You like to stay indoor, and I worry that you will be infected by infantile autism. I have to save my mouth to tells you jokes and stories to cure your boredom."</strong><br><br><strong>"You always stare at the computer, and that do no good to your eyes, I have to save my eyes so that when we grow older, I can help to clip your nails,and help to remove those annoying white hairs. I will hold your hand, stroll down the beach, enjoying the sunshine and the beautiful sands... tells you the colour of flowers, just like the glow in your young face..." </strong><br><br><strong>"Thus, my dear, before I am sure there are someone who loves you more than I do... I would not pick the flower, and die.. "</strong><br><br>[Her tears drop on the letter, and blurred the ink of his hand writing... and resumed her reading...]<br><br><strong>"And now, dear... you have finished reading my answer, if you are satisfied with these answers, please open the door of our house, I am standing there, with your favourite bread and fresh milk..." </strong>Susan rushes to open the door, and saw Steven's anxious face, with his hand holding tight on the milk and bread....<br><br>"Oh, I am sure no one ever love me as much, and now I have decided to leave the flower alone..." Susan said, voice fading...<br><br>That's life, someone said, love. When one is surrounded by love, the feeling of excitement fade away, and one tend to ignore the true love lies in between the peace and dullness.<br><br>Love shows in any form, even a very little and corny form, it has never been a model, it could be the most incurious form... Flowers, romantic moments are only the buckish formed on the surface of the relationship.<br><br>Under all this, the pillar of true love stands... and that's our life... I hope you enjoy reading it... Love, but not words win the arguments...<br><br><img src="http://www.singaporebikes.com/forum/images/smiles/icon-smooch.gif"></div>
