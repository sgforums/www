              <p>If you are staying for a night.. You do not have to bring so much money. Basically, I would change only 50sgd to rupiah, if not enough i would change again.. There isn't much shopping to do Batam. If you are doing spa in the resort, you can swipe your credit cards. I would suggest you to bring more sgd.  Some of the places accept sgd too but paying in rupiah is more worth it.  If you are drinking beer, buy at supermarket and it is VERY CHEAP.. i think $1 plus something.. basically we bought a carton...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>KTM is a cheap getaway but their rooms are definitely not the 5 stars type. Basically, I find their concept abit Kampong style. Haha.. they do not have very fantastic and comfy rooms but still acceptable lah.. Anyway, for the price I paid, I also did not expect much. My choice of better resorts would be Harris and Holiday Inn. Basically,KTM resort is quite lok kok but the views that I got was fantastic. Most of the people who stayed there is because It is cheap and their spa was considered quite cheap in Batam. I think it is a place suitable for group of friends to chill out. They also have fishing spots for fishing lovers..</div>

              <p>one nice hotel is the mercure hotel there. previously named royal hotel batam. he The facilities there is good, but the view a little off.</p>
              <p>If you want nice big buffet, go to Novotel Hotel.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>i dunno abt Batam but i just went Bintan not long ago. They are using SG dollars not rupiah cos too many sgporeans, they accept SG dollars. And the things there are definitely NOT CHEAP. Comparable to SG or maybe more exp. No kidding. i spend abt $100-$150 just on food and transport alone.</p></div>

              <p>Miss_Happy,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are right, change S$50 to rupiah is more than enough. In fact, the things there are not really that cheap, a normal t-shirt costs about S$20-30. Might well as buy in SG haha.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Overall my stay at batam view beach resort is not bad. The scenery (we were given a sea view room) is nice and the room is cosy. The staff are friendly too! But, the only thing was there were not too few ppl (maybe we went at the wrong time?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Initally, I thought the beach would be filled with ppl playing sea sports or water activities, but it was empty when we went there...really, no ppl at all, very very quiet. The cafe where we had our dinner was also very quiet, only a few people in a big cafe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe this resort is too isolated from city area, that's why not many ppl stay there. All our activities were confined within the resort. If you like a quiet place to relax or to be with your love ones, then this resort is a recommended choice. If not, I think you should consider other hotels/resorts that are near the city. </p>
