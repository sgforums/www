            <div class='col-md body'>i stayed at the Prudential Hotel in HK which was very convenient for me to shop at ladies' street cos its 2-3 mrts away.<br>the hotel is located in a small shopping mall itself. across the street are some restaurants. i cant rem the name of the dim sum restaurant which i went but i noe it's a double storey and the food was quite good.<br>i did not went to The Peak as it was raining, so kinda spoiltsport.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I stayed at Kowloon Hotel.<br>The hotel itself is very good.  Service, food and location.<br>But the rooms were a bit on the small side.<br>The 2 twin beds had to be placed side by side.<br><br>The hotel is nearer to Victoria harbour... (not walking distance from ladies street)<br><br>Day 1 :<br>When I reached Kowloon Hotel, it was about 2pm already.<br>So we just went for a night cruise round Victoria Harbour.<br>They had a show called the "Symphony of Lights".<br>This is because Victoria Harbour is lined with many many tall buildings with many lights.  And they have about 30mins of laser show from 8pm.<br>My cruise lasted from 7pm to 9pm.<br><br>So if you have nothing to do in the evening,<br>I recommend you go down to Victoria harbour before 630pm to book yourself a ticket on this cruise.  Cost is about HK$135 (S$27)<br><br>I'll talk about Day 2 later... goto take a break now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Day2 of my Hong Kong Trip :<br><br>Followed a half day tour from morning 8am ended at 3pm.<br><br>1st stop was Tim Sum breakfast.<br>Very typical Tim Sum.  Singapore's Tim Sum is just as good or even better.<br><br>2nd stop was at a relatively new land mark on Hong Kong Island.<br>Called Golden Bauhinia.<br>It was built 10yrs ago 1997 when HK was returned to China.<br>The building is in a shape of a Turtle facing towards China symbolizing the returning route to China.<br>Took lots of pictures.<br><br>Next we went to some rich people's place.<br>We took a bum boat cruise and saw Li Ka-Shing's boat.<br>I was told to park the boat at that area costs 50k/day.  I couldn't believe my ears.<br>Until now I still think I heard wrongly.  Even if it is HK$50k/day that would be S$10k/day!  Anyone actually knows how much these things cost?<br>Visited Repulse Bay where Jackie Chan and Shaw Brothers owned properties overlooking the bay.<br><br>Next we were off to some Jewelry shop and Herbal Tea Shop (or Chinese Medicine shop).<br>That's where we faced the real pushy sales people of Hong Kong.<br>Ended up being victims at both places.<br>I never thought I would buy Chinese medicine before this, but I ended up buying their prescribed medicine and their "unique" tea which up to now still sits in the box it came in.<br><br>Rested the rest of the day.<br>Had dinner at the hotel itself.<br>Needed the rest because the next day was Disneyland Day.<br><br>More of that in next post.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Went to HK for 6 nights<br><br>First night arrived really late, so just checked into the hotel and rested..<br><br>The second day we had breakfast at the cha chan teng, and went to shopping, which was a little boring for me but still i made the best out of it. Walked from Yau Ma Tei all the way to Mong kok central as the whole stretch was shopping and finally around mong kok central. Agyrl Centre is a great place for shopping, cheap and lots of variety... but too bad i not a girl... so just walk around..<br><br>Third day went to Ocean park, the ticket costs atound $60 SGD, but after that need not pay anything anymore... Spent practically the whole day there.<br><br>fourth day.... went shopping AGAIN..and went to Wong Dai Xin... Was pretty fun walking around etc etc... Then we went to the jade market and got quite a few stuffs there and then the temple st night market at night, both places can bargain like shit.. was pretty good. ALso went to the night life places.. (cant remember the name) and it feels like "little ang more".<br><br>fifth day we went to Causeway bay. This time i dun wan shop with the girls already, so i went around myself.. The bay is beautiful and the victoria park is very happening. Met a hong kong friend there and she brought me into the Hong Kong Royal Club, which was very very fun... But i really pissed the girls off for going missing and failing to pick up their calls. After that went to The Peak.. The ticket cost around 10 dollars SGD, and we took a very niuce ride up the hill... The shopping was the same but our tickets gained access to the top level.. which the view of the entire hong kong was breath taking.<br><br>6th day Woke up really early and went to Sheung Huan and purchased ferry tickets to Macau. The tickets to and fro cost around 70 SGD per person but it was good.. Walked around Sheung Huan and to the western market... The buildings are western and quite different from the city. One thing is that, i got screened 3 times by police and that is abit fucked up. After that we head over to Macau via an hour's ferry ride. After we arrived, we realised that we dont have the ability to tour Macau ourselves, so we hired a private tour guide. We went to different attractions, like Ma Jie Temple, St Pauls remains, the portugese official houses, Guan Yin temple, and a few others. The tour guide told us lots of stories which made it real enjoyable...Oh.. the tour guide tour us around with a mini van, speaks good english and chinese and was really humorous.. Costs just around 150 SGD.<br><br>7th day we woke up and lazed around in bed.. checked out at around 12, and left our luggage at the conciege... Went for some last min shopping till 6 before we headed back to the airport back to SG.<br><br>Note* Staying too long can get boring, so dont stay for too long.<br><br>If u are the only guy, then make sure u voice out ur opinions, or else sure v sian, that is what happened on the second day for me.<br><br>Prepare to spend alot on transport and food, more if u are going to places like ocean park, disney land or macau.<br><br>Oh, i stayed at YMCA internation guest house. Was good, just that the room is a little small. The staffs there was helpful and i even made friend with a security guard there coz i went down to smoke pretty frequently.<br><br>My hotel was at Yau Ma Tei, which is a very good location as it is just like orchard road area, esp good for shopping, for girls.....-_-<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is better if u know cantonese, easier to fidn ur way around, get bargains, etc. Cos, if u only speak chinese, they think u r some bloody PRC.<br><br>I stayed at Kowloon Hotel too. nice place, near the habour, with some big malls nearby too. DIsneyland was so-so, i think Ocean park was much more fun. For nice food recommendations, u can always ask the hotel staff ... Tt time, they recommended me n my frens some nice tim sum place a few streets away. The restuarant view overlooked the harbour ...<br><br></div>
