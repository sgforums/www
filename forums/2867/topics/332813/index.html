              <p> hey maybe you can try going to the philippines, we also celebrate chinese new year for our chinese residents so you won't feel a bit homesick (^_________^)</p>
              <p>recommended place is the boracay beach , so you dont even have  to worry about the weather its always sunny, and the night club at the bars are just so crazyyyyyyyy. I want  to go back there....</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I went for a 3D 4N star cruise Libra, trip starting from singapore and of cos ending at singapore. Went with a grp of friends, 6 of us including my husband and myself.<br><br>It was an interesting experience as this is the first time I have been on a cruise. As I was a light sleeper, sleeping became a trouble for me, I could hear toilet flashing from neighbor, I am not sure whether they are from upstairs or the next door.<br><br>Food is nice, the curise have provided well when it comes to food. I could remember eating, eating and sleeping most of the time. The only bad point is that most of the time there were long queues to food areas and such. I will find myself being upset about the way they make pple take numbers and then ask them to come back like 20mins again to join a queue even though they have already taken a number, I don't know what kind of queuing system is that, one thing that they can improve on. We spent most of our time playing games rented free from the cruise and also playing majiong (rented @SGD$10 for 3 hours) Must also remember to bring a book or something to read in case you do not do much activities on board.<br><br>They have a small pool and a few jacuzzi, which is most of the time packed. You can also use the gym there, track shoes are available for rental, think around SGD$2 per hour. There is also a small spa there, I don't know much about it since I am not interested about it...If I want to go spa I may as well go to the one at sentosa, well facilitated...anywhere would be better I guess... <br><br>Our first stop was at KL, we signed up for the shopping trip to the biggest shopping mall and the coach brought us to the "twin towers" to take photos before bringing us to the shopping mall, nice to be able to have a break to take photos in KL. However I would advise not going for the shopping trip as there are not much difference in the shopping mall as the other big shopping malls around. I would rather have spent more time resting in the room, since I have paid for the cruise...hee....<br><br>Next stop we went to Langkawi, nice place, too bad we did not get to sign up for the island hopping tour provided by the star cruise, we manage to get the local pple there to bring us to the same island hoping trip for RM290 for the 6 of us. <br><br>The island hopping trip sure is fun, those who love the sun and the beach must really go for it. I am sure you will surely enjoy it.<br><br>I wonder how would it be like to travel on virgo =)<br><br>However I guess if you want to have a more "care free" holiday cruise is not the best idea....you are more confined to a "floating hotel" most of the time<br><br>Hong Kong and China as mentioned by above replies already told you that tourist areas are functioning and prepare to be "chop" (correct me if I am wrong please)<br><br>Perth will be too boring to my point of view... I will suggest going to Tasmania...scenary there is real cool!</p></div>
