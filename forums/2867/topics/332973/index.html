              <p>1. Have cash, &amp; different currencies in your wallet.  I trust you are changing flights in Japan; so try to have minimum 1,000 Yen &amp; another S$30/- ready.  they are for when you are hungry or thirsty during the stopover.</p>
              <p>2. Have medications clearly available in your carry on backpack,</p>
              <p>   2A) and a muscle relaxant for you to sleep thru the 2nd lag of your flight so your body can adjust to the time difference in USA quickly.  Sleep as much as you can.</p>
              <p>  2B) Stuff a small water bottle in that side pocket of the backpack so you can use it to take drinking water at airports &amp; parks. A lightweight torchlight in there is also good.</p>
              <p>   2C) have at least 1 big roll of blanket/towel at easy reach of your backpack so they can be used to support your back when you sleep or can use to prop your head during the flight.</p>
              <p>   2D) have also at least one set of your colthing rolled into your backpack; in case the luggage was lost.</p>
              <p>   2E) Have a change of underwear there with small bottles of talcum powder, face wash, face towels, comb &amp; wet wipes.</p>
              <p>3) In a luggage, try to get one that is about 30 inch big and with about it about half empty for stuffs you might buy and bring back to sg.  The army market kit bag is also good.</p>
              <p> 3A)  You need about 4 set of clothings, One you are already wearing with socks and preferably crocs (fake also can so you wont need to bring it home). a pair of sports shoes &amp; a pair of open toe slippers for wearing with socks into the toliet/bath.  Forget about belts if possible.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>3B) In that luggage, bring at least a bottle of anti dandruff shampoo.  They are good for when your body readjust to different temperature and humidity.</p>
              <p>3C) for coldwear, you can rely on a simple windbreaker &amp; thick socks for when you sleep.</p>
              <p>3D) Bring swimwear and a beach towel &amp; at least a swim goggles.  the swimming pools there use a lot of chorine.</p>
              <p>3E) if there is a function, you should bring along some formal wear, like decent shoes/heels, your school pants/skirts, shirts/blouse &amp; jacket.</p>

              <p>these are for your considerations:</p>
              <p>1. buy anti static wrist bands at the airport.  Cos flights will give you static shocks &amp; the weather in LA is dry and gives static.</p>
              <p>2. Bring a fanny pack along with the backpack.  The fanny bag lets you keeps stuffs yet wont get in the way much when you are taking rides.  Make sure the packs has ready to use lipbalms, water bottles, tissues, wet wipes, sunblock &amp; even vaseline tube (vaseline tube can find in Mustafa Centre, not jar ones.)</p>
              <p>3. Bring extra sets of contacts and your glasses if you need them.</p>
              <p>4. Dont bring your handphone, the power sockets there are not suitable.</p>
              <p>5. Have a jockey cap ready at hand, so you can cap down during flight &amp; sleeping and it helps to prevent the sun from burning your eyes.  A decent sunglass helps too.</p>
              <p>6. leave most of your acne treatment in sg, they might not work in LA or is too dry for you.  Check with your doc for skincare that is richer for use in LA or you can simply use the vaseline gel &amp; sunblock.</p>

              <p><br>Better go browse the website of their customs for the don'ts and make sure you don't carry some prohibited items in your luggage.</p>
              <p>I don't think it's advisable to bring anti-dandruff shampoo cos it's liquid chemical. Better to buy there if you really got alot of dandruffs and super itchy &amp; crispy scalp like popiahs.</p>

              <p>For LA, you should be able to find 'the cheese factory'.  please at least say you went in for a cheese cake &amp; a coffee.</p>
              <p>Cold stone creamery for ice cream.</p>
              <p>Old Navy for some basic clothes.</p>

              <p>in/out burger</p>
              <p>Churrios at road stalls, chocolate covered apples &amp; you must try Fish Burritos.....if you walked into a burritos place that has salsa at the side counter, forget about using their small sauce container.  Get a cup and scoop the salsa!</p>
              <p>Walmart/Target</p>
              <p>Levis/Nike/Victoria Secrets/harley davison/orange county choppers/Crocs &amp; The body shop.</p>

              <p>err...the threadstarter is going on a ONE week SCHOOL-TRIP.</p>
              <p>&gt;.&lt;</p>
              <p>no offense, but i really that that whole list is too much &gt;.&lt;</p>
              <p>esp when flying is such a hassle now, the less you pack, the better it is.</p>
              <p>pack your basic necessities. underwear, clothes. if you are staying at the same hotel/hostel/whatever for the whole trip, you can afford to bring less as you can wash and hang dry while you are there. if you have money to spend, you can always get hotel to wash and dry for you. haha. otherwise bring enough to last the whole trip. bring extra for accidents. yes. pack at least one full set of clothing in your carry on. make sure you carry a decent jacket onto the plane.</p>
              <p>shampoo will be provided by hotel unless otherwise specified.</p>
              <p>check that you have ZERO liquids and gels with you. they allow a certain amount now, but to make things easier for yourself, just don't bring any. water will be available whenever you ask for it on the plane.</p>
              <p>yah. take care of your money. very impt.</p>
              <p>at the end of the day, if you are unsure about anything, you should ask the teacher in charge. he/she will be the most sure as he/she knows what you will be doing during the trip.</p>
