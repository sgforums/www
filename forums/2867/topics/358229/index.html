              <p>(<em><strong>An Experience on the Super Jumbo</strong></em>):<br><br><em>Singapore Airlines</em> is the first airline in the world to fly the <em>A380</em>: the world’s largest commercial aircraft designed to carry 471 passengers in exceptional style &amp; comfort. SIA operates the superjumbo to <em>London, Sydney</em> &amp; <em>Tokyo</em> &amp; from 1 June 2009, SIA will fly the world’s largest passenger plane on its <em>Singapore-Paris</em> route.</p>
              <p><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5328625480115340162" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 320px; cursor: hand; height: 213px; text-align: center;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_66a3hcnNpSQ/SfMUpFNew4I/AAAAAAAABf8/XyM4p6I42XM/s320/380.jpg" border="0" alt="">The SIA <em>A380</em> heralds a new era in air travel, with its cabin offerings providing unprecedented comfort, space &amp; luxury. The aircraft is the quietest large passenger aircraft ever built, &amp; delivers substantial fuel burn reductions per seat kilometre over the next largest aircraft. This means it becomes a cleaner, greener alternative for long-haul travel, while allowing for the addition of extra capacity to congested airports, like <em>London</em>.<br><br>I was privileged to be travelling in the award-winning <em>Business Class</em> of the <em>A380</em> on <em>Singapore Airlines</em>, the most spacious the world has ever seen, on my return flight from <a href="http://luxuryhaven.blogspot.com/2009/04/travel-luxury-shopping-good-buys-in.html"><span style="color: #cc2288;"><em><strong>Tokyo</strong></em></span></a> to <em>Singapore</em>. Flight time: 7hrs 10mins. <span class="fullpost"><br><br>Upon boarding, I was impressed that SIA has created a double-decker entrance in at least two aero-bridges &amp; I was already on the second level instead of having to climb the usual stairs up to <em>Business Class</em>.<br><br>The <em>Business class</em>, located on the upper deck, consists of 60 seats. I like the unique 1-2-1 cabin layout with the unrivalled space between each seat as opposed to 2-2-2 on <em>Qantas</em>. As I’m a ‘window-seat’ traveller, this 1-2-1 feature allows me direct aisle access. I happily slumped into my luxurious 34” wide armchair &amp; it was really nice seating all by myself, with no one beside me.<br><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5328627216521343282" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 260px; cursor: hand; height: 320px; text-align: center;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_66a3hcnNpSQ/SfMWOJ07sTI/AAAAAAAABgM/vce13b_w3XQ/s320/biz.jpg" border="0" alt="">Once on board, coats were taken &amp; a selection of juices &amp; champagne, newspapers, magazines &amp; menus were given out. I was glad I wasn't the only "tourist" on board. A Japanese man, sitting in the two-seater was seen busy snapping photos &amp; I soon join the entourage.<br><br>While the plane was busy boarding passengers, I kept myself engaged by examining my seating area. Storage space was cleverly integrated into the seating space for water bottles etc. On the seat in front, I found a flip-down vanity mirror &amp; more storage compartments for reading glasses etc. </span></p>
              <p><span class="fullpost">A wide array of captivating entertainment options await me on an impressive 15.4" wide LCD screen just between the compartments. I understand that <em>Qantas</em> TV screen is only 12.1" with the screen popping out from the armrest. </span></p>
              <p><span class="fullpost">The plane pulled back punctually &amp; I was airborne in no time. My requested glass of <em>Fruit Spritzer</em> was served soon after we reached cruising level. I made myself comfortable by stretching out on the foot rest area in front of me, which is part of the flat bed. <img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5328627745268159362" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 320px; cursor: hand; height: 240px; text-align: center;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_66a3hcnNpSQ/SfMWs7j_04I/AAAAAAAABgk/zoR9s4pLHDY/s320/380_Rest.JPG" border="0" alt="">Soon, a prelude of local <em>Satay</em> was served. A local delight of skewered slices of chicken or mutton that are grilled to perfection &amp; served with a tantalizing peanut sauce. <img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5328627873106400498" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 320px; cursor: hand; height: 239px; text-align: center;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_66a3hcnNpSQ/SfMW0XzAlPI/AAAAAAAABgs/f6nRjjh2gFI/s320/380_Satay.JPG" border="0" alt="">The inflight cuisines are specially created by SIA's International Culinary Panel of celebrated Chefs from around the globe, complete with contemporary designer tableware from <em>Givenchy</em>. I was given a choice of the <em>World Gourmet Cuisine</em> or the Japanese <em>Hanagoyomi</em>, an exclusively designed Japanese set inspired by the nuances of the four seasons. </span></p>
              <p><span class="fullpost">Most passengers around me seemed to pick the <em>Hanagoyomi</em>, which comprises an elaborated spread of nine appetisers &amp; entrees elegantly presented &amp; served in traditional Japanese style. The array of gourmet enticed me beyond my imagination. <img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5328628940541217842" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 320px; cursor: hand; height: 213px; text-align: center;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_66a3hcnNpSQ/SfMXygTTTDI/AAAAAAAABhM/1CBD8z7MGVM/s320/380_Food.JPG" border="0" alt="">After meal service, I had the friendly crew showed me around. The steward added that viewing the <em>Suites</em> would only be possible after the plane has landed &amp; <em>First Class</em> passengers disembarked. With this, he brought me to tour the <em>Economy Class </em>section. <img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5328629627635632098" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 320px; cursor: hand; height: 240px; text-align: center;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_66a3hcnNpSQ/SfMYaf7YB-I/AAAAAAAABhc/HRZhRb2NSJQ/s320/380_Econ.JPG" border="0" alt="">The knowledgeable steward explained that SIA <em>A380</em> cabin is configured with 399 <em>Economy Class</em> seats &amp; went on to emphasised on all other features. Each seat comes with a larger 10.6” screen &amp; a USB port to allow passengers to access the enhanced functionalities on <em>KrisWorld</em>. An easily accessible new seatback-mounted headset, personal, non-intrusive reading light &amp; in-seat power supply, are just some of the many intelligent touches designed with passengers in mind. <em></em></span></p>
              <p><span class="fullpost"><em>Economy Class</em> passengers are not left out either, on SIA’s quality service. Individual amenity kits comprising a toothbrush set &amp; a pair of knitted socks will be presented on overnight flights exceeding four &amp; a half hrs &amp; day flights exceeding eight hrs.<br><br>We were back in the <em>Business Class</em> after our rounds. He invited me to the self-service <em>Lounge</em>, which is a great place to stretch your legs &amp; also a place to pop-by for snacks, fruits &amp; drinks. </span></p>
              <p><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5328629798481748370" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 320px; cursor: hand; height: 238px; text-align: center;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_66a3hcnNpSQ/SfMYkcYQ4ZI/AAAAAAAABhk/WUR78Rium7s/s320/380_Lounge.JPG" border="0" alt="">The spacious restrooms carry a variety of amenities. Freshen up with custom-designed toiletries - eau de cologne, aftershave lotion, mouthwash &amp; moisturising hand lotion. Each separate drawers contain razors &amp; shaving cream, toothbrush sets, combs, air-sick bags &amp; feminine hygiene items.... all at your dispense.</p>
              <p>As seen here, the Japanese stewardess was helping us to set up the bed, which she did by unfolding the leather back rest which stretched out to make a 76" fully-flat bed, with more room to stretch &amp; enjoy a rejuvenating flight. The sheets, duvet &amp; extra pillows were behind the seat all this time. <img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5328630313003692466" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 238px; cursor: hand; height: 320px; text-align: center;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_66a3hcnNpSQ/SfMZCZH2sbI/AAAAAAAABh0/-bfcV13mzRI/s320/380_Seat3.JPG" border="0" alt=""> <img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5328630525508088162" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 240px; cursor: hand; height: 320px; text-align: center;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_66a3hcnNpSQ/SfMZOww2cWI/AAAAAAAABh8/-t4df8yfzGY/s320/380_Seat.JPG" border="0" alt="">Featuring 100 movies, including the latest blockbusters &amp; 180 TV shows, <em>Krisworld</em> presents you with your very own cinema in the sky. For the music lovers, choose from an extensive library of 700 CDs &amp; over 20 radio channels. I turned myself into a couch potato &amp; slowly dozing off.<br><br>In no time, I landed at the <em>Singapore Changi Airport</em>. The steward remembered my request. As soon as the First Class passengers cleared, he brought me down a flight of stairs to the <em>Suites</em>.<br><br>The <em>S’pore Airlines Suites</em> sets a new standard in ultimate premium air travel by featuring a bold &amp; unique concept where each <em>Suite</em> is the customer’s very own private cabin in the sky. <img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5328630974591703490" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 320px; cursor: hand; height: 240px; text-align: center;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_66a3hcnNpSQ/SfMZo5uumcI/AAAAAAAABiE/JR4KuYl8Sck/s320/380_Suit3.JPG" border="0" alt="">Using separate sleeping &amp; sitting surfaces, the intelligent design of the full flat bed offers passengers the choice to rest in their preferred sleeping positions. It also allows them to sit &amp; lounge in bed to read or catch movies on their personal 23” LCD screen. For couples travelling, the beds in the middle two seats can be converted to an optional double bed.</p>
              <p>Each <em>Suite</em> offers an exquisitely private space, a lavish armchair with adjustable headrest &amp; armrests. The Singaporean Leading Stewardess demonstrated their special turn-down service with fine linen &amp; full-sized pillows. Each cabin features sliding doors &amp; window blinds, offering you the freedom to decide on the level of privacy you prefer. With only 12 extraordinary <em>Suites</em>, available to the most discerning passengers, the <em>S'pore Airlines Suites</em> is truly in a class beyond first. <img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5328633189661296562" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 287px; cursor: hand; height: 435px; text-align: center;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_66a3hcnNpSQ/SfMbp1geR7I/AAAAAAAABik/wSqH5AgIjJs/s400/380_SuitCrew3.JPG" border="0" alt=""></p>
