            <div class='col-md body'><p>If you are going to japan after ur O lvls... <br><br>Try booking ANA or UA flights. No use trying to book flights on budget carriers as usually their savings only comes into effect when u book way in advance. <br><br>My advice is to fly their new daily direct into HND. Its closer to the city and you can save time travelling. <br><br>If you are looking to get around the whole of japan, i would suggest that u buy the JR Rail pass. Please buy it when u are still in Singapore as they dont sell it in Japan. With the pass, you can travel on all JR trains (and some JR buses) around japan. top up with abit of cash and u can travel on the Shinkansen.</p></div>

              <p>1. Air-ticket wise, go check with JAL or ANA ticket office directly, you may get it cheaper like under $700 to/fro Tokyo or Internet. Don't go to a ticketing agent like a tour agency</p>
              <p> 2. Try staying in Youth hostel, i may be cheaper. Join a hi-hostel member at $20 and it can save you from $5-$12 daily.</p>
              <p>3. Go check out the JR pass and buy them when there is a promotion. For example, they had a 3 day JR pass at $160 (any 3 days and no need for consecutive days). Use it for long distance on the bullet train to go further</p>
              <p>4. For 500 to 800 yen, you will be eating Ramien everyday....</p>
              <p>5. Try cooking yourself especially if you have kaki</p>
              <p>6. Bring own water bottle. It can cost you up from $2.40 per bottle if you buy outside. There's alway free flow water when you have your meal.</p>
              <p>7. There's still entrance fees to consider, eg...cable car ride</p>
              <p>8. For so many days, Junyang estimate is reasonable.</p>
              <p>9. You may also look for free-pass tickets for places like Fuji,Hakone, Kamakura etc.....</p>
              <p>10. Since you are going on DIY, read up...</p>

              <p>And yes, HND is nearer than NRT, but at what cost? From Nov'10, SQ does NRT and HND 2x daily each, but very bad arrival times. Forget about NH (ANA) and JL (Japan Airlines)...</p>

              <p>You could try 3K's TPE-KIX inbound, and fly out from NRT via UA/DL.<br>Non-direct flights are a pain to connect. Trust me, have done this before, and if your inbound flight is delayed, say bye bye to your connection.</p>

              <p>If you are going to japan after ur O lvls...<br> <br> Try booking ANA or UA flights. No use trying to book flights on
              budget carriers as usually their savings only comes into effect
              when u book way in advance.<br> <br> My advice is to fly their new daily direct into HND. Its closer to
              the city and you can save time travelling.<br> <br> If you are looking to get around the whole of japan, i would
              suggest that u buy the JR Rail pass. Please buy it when u are still
              in Singapore as they dont sell it in Japan. With the pass, you can
              travel on all JR trains (and some JR buses) around japan. top up
              with abit of cash and u can travel on the Shinkansen.</p>

              <p>UA doesn't fly SIN-HND. Only NH. And they are going to cost a bomb due to the HND connectivity factor compared to NRT flights.</p>
              <p>The hour n a half train ride for NRT to the citycentre might still be mitigated by horrendous arrival times due to curfew at HND.</p>

              <p>1. Air-ticket wise, go check with JAL or ANA ticket office
              directly, you may get it cheaper like under $700 to/fro Tokyo or
              Internet. Don't go to a ticketing agent like a tour agency</p>
              <p> 2. Try staying in Youth hostel, i may be cheaper. Join a
              hi-hostel member at $20 and it can save you from $5-$12 daily.</p>
              <p>3. Go check out the JR pass and buy them when there is a
              promotion. For example, they had a 3 day JR pass at $160 (any 3
              days and no need for consecutive days). Use it for long distance on
              the bullet train to go further</p>
              <p>4. For 500 to 800 yen, you will be eating Ramien
              everyday....</p>
              <p>5. Try cooking yourself especially if you have kaki</p>
              <p>6. Bring own water bottle. It can cost you up from $2.40 per
              bottle if you buy outside. There's alway free flow water when you
              have your meal.</p>
              <p>7. There's still entrance fees to consider, eg...cable car
              ride</p>
              <p>8. For so many days, Junyang estimate is reasonable.</p>
              <p>9. You may also look for free-pass tickets for places like
              Fuji,Hakone, Kamakura etc.....</p>
              <p>10. Since you are going on DIY, read up...</p>

              <p>Checked up ANA, no way you're gonna get near SGD$700 for that peak season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did up Early-Mid Dec and return first few days of Jan11, and result was about SGD$1200 excess including taxes and the like. Nov travel is a bit out, given O's end early to mid Nov? Not to sure when Os end this year.</p>

              <p><br>Needless to say, I wasted a whole day in Milan trying to find out where to go and the like... But if TS is as fast and mobile as me and cover destinations quick, I don't see why TS would need an xtended stay in Japan.</p>
