              <p>i love travelling, can see so many different cultures and taste all the good food.. heh.</p>
              <p>have been to quite a number of countries, and different countries give me different impressions..</p>
              <p>i've been to taiwan 7 times (attachments, travel..), and i just can't get enough of their food! (though their babes are a sight to behold.. LOL) think i'll be going there again next year with my wife cos she hasn't been there before. heh.</p>
              <p>but the country that left me with the deepest impression is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">south africa</span></strong>. you can really see the rich-poor disparity there; undeveloped slums for the native africans, and high class living for the white afrikaaners.. the sights there are really good, especially at Cape Town where most of the affluent white people live. the game park (their term for safari) has a restaurant which serves all sorts of meats that you can think of.. giraffe, zebra, hippo etc.. and boy, zebra meat stinks..</p>
              <p>so which is the most memorable country you've been to? and why so?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Switzerland</strong><br>Nicest country I ever been. Seriously, if you do not have money, save it up for just one trip there. Beats everywhere else in terms of landscape. And you do not have to visit anywhere this whole life. =) You can see snowy mountains everywhere and its like you are in a winter wonderland. =) People are also more friendly, compared to other European countries. They try their best to communicate in English with you. Best time to visit is in December.<br><br>Recommended: Mount Pilatus or Titilis, Interlaken, Zermatt, Berne<br><br><strong>Australia</strong><br>Nice holiday resort. People there are generally friendly. Wind is strong and you can see magnificent sea views. Totally unique experience. Beautiful flowers and also you can expect to see some fruit trees.

              <p>b) Uncle's house got see fireflies at night at the backyard.</p>
              <p>c) Auntie served coffee and youtiao to us kids in the morning!</p>
              <p>d) We climbed a bit of a mountain they call 'Kopi Sua' and we swam at some parts of the waterfalls.</p>
              <p>e) We also went to the public swimming pool that has 3-4 metres deep pool and the pool water is filled with mountain water, so the water is green in colour.  Very Very Cold Water!</p>
              <p>d) We had some of the best morning Bak Kut Teh with the uncle and parents, cos they adults ACTUALLY brought us along for breakfast!</p>
              <p>There was once.  We having bak kut teh breakfast and someone bloodied came running to uncle to tell uncle something.  Uncle listened, say two to three words and the bloodied man ran back to another street where they are still having a major fight with parangs.</p>

              <p>Malaysia - mostly i go to JB, port Dickson and KL and Genting... it was nothing memorable... except SARAWAK! was at Kuching for 4 days, the damai beach resort was magical....guess the East Malaysia is much more beautiful than the well treaded Penisula Malaysia......</p>
              <p>Taiwan - To be fair, I only been to Taipei and Hualien. Hualien was beautiful and more like my kind of travel. Taipei was boring....one thing i note, it is the same as Singapore except you see more pretty girls per minute. haha</p>
              <p>Hong Kong - been there thrice. Extended holiday after work. Not in a hurry to go back. Only thing that impressed me was the islands like Lantau island. Although i must say the vibrancy of the city is fantastic. way past 12mighnight on a monday night and the shopping streets are still full of people.</p>
              <p>Thailand - Been to BKK countless times both for work and leisure. Good place for short getaway lah to be fair. Its cheap and the best part is the food. From BKK, went to Hua Hin before. Beautiful place. Again my type of place, good mix of relaxation and city life. all within easy reach. Went to Chiangmai for 7 days. Fantastic place. Shopping yes but not like BKK kind, more of the nice weather at night and of cos the temples and the mountains.</p>
              <p>AUstralia - Been to Melbourne and Perth only. Perth was ok. It is really typical lazy and slow paced Australia. Even the Perth city is like that. But the slow pace did appeal to me somehow. It is nice to get away from forever busy Singapore some times. Melbourne is fantastic although the greatest part of my Melbourne trip came in the Grampians and the endless driving. The Grampians, after the huge fire almost 3 years ago burned down 50% of its area, evoked alot of emotions and thoughts in me.</p>
              <p>France - Paris, Beaune, Eze Village, Cannes, Lyon, Marseille, Monaco. Did not spend very long there. Around 10 days. Paris was not my cup of tea although climbing the Eiffiel Tower was memorable to me. My legs nearly died there. But the port town of Marseille was nice, its where you can sip your tea by the port and watch the yatchs dock and sail past... Lyon and Cannes has nice view of the sea while Monaco has very nice views but is about the richest part of France although it is an independent principality.</p>
              <p>Italy - Rome, Venice, Pisa, Florence - Pisa is boring where the only thing worth seeing is the Leaning Tower of cos. When you get to Florence, immediately you feel the artistic feeling haha! Venice is great although the gondola boat ride is not as romantic when you see rats jumping into waters beside you. Rome, with great places like the Coliseum, the ancient ruins, the what Trevis (sp?) fountain where we throw coins into it haha but it is the tour of the Vatican that left me in awe.</p>
