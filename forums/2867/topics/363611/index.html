            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi, with the fact that you are reading into this thread, i suppose you are like me, an avid visitor of Bangkok :) my hubby and i have travelled to Bangkok twice within this year already, and have booked to fly up again in July. We rented this service apartment in the RCA (Royal City Avenue)region, where it is the most happening place to be found at night. i-House Condo is just walking distance from the whole stretch of clubbing arenas like 'Route66', 'Slim' etc.. they also have fairly huge 24hrs 7-Eleven there with lotsa things to buy, even when hunger suddenly strikes. Over there they also have cinema, supermarket, cafes, 5min drive to 99bht BBQ buffet, 20min drive to MBK, Siam Paragon, etc. i-house condo houses plenty of foreigners, Aussies, Korean, Singaporeans and many more, you can have access to the gym when u are there too. Security is good as they have security on night duty around the carparks below the blocks and also the security guard house. Here comes the contact details and T's &amp; C's: 800Baht/night for min stay of 5 days. Get a cab from airport level 1 (saves on surcharge) and tell the driver go to RCA i-house condo. Contact Philip when u are there, he will meet u to pass u the key to your service apartment (small but with all the basics u need, toiletries not incl), and for you to pay him. Then at the end of your stay,just need to give him a call when to arrange the handover of keys. Simple as that, free and easy. Interested parties pls PM me for Philip's contact. Thanks!</p></div>
