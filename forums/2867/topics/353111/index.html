              <p>Hi guys..</p>
              <p>I'm going to Hokkaido this coming December. I have never been to cold countries before. So i'm wondering what kind of clothes i shoud bring. Should i just ring 1,2 sets of clothings and then go there and buy? Or should i just buy in singapore? I thought of buying boots. So i'm wondering should i get it there or should i just get it from some taiwan website cause i'm not too sure about the prices. And how much should i save up, minus the accomodation and air-tickets cause they are all being taken care of already. Can anyone help?</p>

              <p>Opps. Sorry didnt notice this thread until so late.</p>
              <p>1) Bring just four sets of clothings.  Eg 4 pairs of jeans and tops. (If got those cottony long sleeve tees will be good.)</p>
              <p>One to wear for day, One to wear for Night, One to wear next day while you do laundry and the last as back up in case you didnt manage to do laundry.</p>
              <p>And make sure one of the sets is worn on your body for when you fly there.</p>
              <p>2) Bring three sets of sleep underwears and pyjamas.</p>
              <p>3) Wear a set of socks and wear crocs up the plane.  Have at least 3 other pairs of socks and a pair of hiking boots/running shoes in the luggage.</p>
              <p>Also keep the pair of hiking shoes/running shoes into your handcarry so you might change into them if the weather is really those horribly cold when you reach Japan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) Four sets of bras and hipster undies.  One set to wear on body.</p>
              <p>5) One set of bikinis.</p>
              <p>6) At least one piece of beach towel, to keep in your handcarry.  They should either be rolled up to function as a temp pillow or use as a blanket.</p>
              <p>7) At least 2 bra balls and 2 mesh bag to wash and keep your undies.</p>
              <p>8) A waist pouch to keep your passport, foreign curriences, camera and a water bottle to hold some water during your trip.</p>
              <p>9) A bubble padded long sleeve light weight jacket with a hood to cover your head.  get those cheap ones.  Make sure the jacket is slung over your hand before you board the plane to Japan. </p>

              <p>The thing about shopping in cold country.  And this is your first time there.</p>
              <p>You will tend to over estimate or under estimate their uses and their need.</p>
              <p>Boots. I am sure you can find those really lovely leather ones, but they may not be practical for either the terrain which you are touring/trampling on.</p>
              <p>Or it can become totally useless in Singapore when you return.  And because you may tend to wear thick socks in Japan under the boots.  It might become a bit too big for when you wear in Singapore with thin socks.</p>
              <p>Also, our feet might contract or expand in different weather.</p>
              <p>Another factor to consider is that.  If you buy the boots for wearing in Japan, you will want to put in feet charcoal heating pads to keep your feets warm.  So You cannot buy it too small a size.  But in sg, this might be too big for your normal daily wear.</p>
              <p>Plus, if they are winter boots.  They are expected to be very warm for your feet there.  But sauna for Sg weather.</p>
              <p>I would still say, shop for the boots in Japan with a mind that its going to be worn in Sg horrid hot weather.  So search for their Summer Season sale and do bring back lots of lovely boots that you can wear in sg.</p>

              <p>And oh....errrmmmm.....if you dont mind wearing used stuffs.</p>
              <p>I can loan, (Which usually ended up donating to friends that borrowed them.)  some still decent condition Hanes cotton long sleeve tees for you to layer for use in Japan.</p>
              <p>And I still has a never been used White Hello Kitty Winter bubble padded coat I got from USA.</p>
              <p>And errmmm.....some of those army kit bags (they also call it parachute bags) in canvas material which you can fold and keep into your luggage.  They are great as extra luggage to lug home your purchases from Japan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And oh.....two different sets of knited cap, scarf and knitted gloves for ladies.  I didnt use them either.  Maybe because I wasnt feeling so cold.</p>

              <p>And a tip from a friend.</p>
              <p>If you, your male family members has lots of white office shirts.  By all means bring them to japan and have the shirts laundered thru the hotel laundry service.</p>
              <p>The clothes will come back well pressed and whiter then white, and does not turn yellow.</p>
