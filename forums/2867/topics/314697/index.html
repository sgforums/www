              <h1>The 220,000-tonne cruise liner that has its very own New York-style Central Park</h1>
              <p>The world's biggest cruise liner is to have a New York-style "Central Park" on the ship, its owners have revealed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Royal Caribbean is building the 220,000-tonne liner with the working
              name Project Genesis and the announcement is the latest salvo in the
              intensely competitive global cruise market.</p>
              <p>The company said the park would be "a revolutionary design in
              which the centre of the ship opens to the sky and features lush,
              tropical grounds spanning the length of a football field".</p>
              <p><a href="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_03/1GenesisLinerPA_700x515.jpg"><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_03/1GenesisLinerPA_468x344.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="468" height="344"></a></p>
              <p>New York style: The liner will have an outdoor area onboard supposedly modelled on Central Park</p>
              <p>The 1,180ft long luxury liner is under construction in Finland at a
              cost of £700 million and dwarfs the current biggest ships - also owned
              by Royal Caribbean - which are 160,000 tonnes.</p>
              <p>The builders said the space will be like a town square for al fresco dining and entertainment.</p>
              <p>The park will be located on Deck 8 of the 16 deck ship and open
              to the sky, with dimensions of 62ft (19m) wide and 328ft (100m) long.</p>
              <p>Trees in the park will tower more than two-and-a-half decks
              tall and the area is to have micro-climate control techniques to make
              sure the plants thrive.</p>
              <p><a href="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_03/CruiseLinerGRAPH_800x473.jpg"><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_03/CruiseLinerGRAPH_468x277.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="468" height="277"></a></p>
              <p>World's biggest: The 220,000-tonne cruise liner is being built by Royal Caribbean in Finland</p>
              <p>Richard Fain, chairman and chief executive of Royal Caribbean, said:
              "This ship is a quantum leap in architecture and design and will
              deliver an unparalleled vacation experience to all who sail with us."</p>
              <p>Figures from the Passenger Shipping Association predict 1.55
              million Britons are expected to take a cruise holiday in 2008 - up from
              1.35 million last year.</p>
              <p>Royal Caribbean will base one of its current biggest liners,
              Independence of the Seas, in Southampton from next month for its
              inaugural season.</p>
              <p><a href="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_03/2GenesisLinerPA_750x561.jpg"><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_03/2GenesisLinerPA_468x350.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="468" height="350"></a></p>
              <p>Al fresco: The outdoor area will have trees and plants and a special microclimate so that they thrive</p>
              <p>P&amp;O Cruises has responded with a new ship - the Ventura, which is
              named in Southampton tonight by Dame Helen Mirren, and Cunard recently
              launched the Queen Victoria - also based in Southampton.</p>
              <p>The recent credit crunch does not seem to be affecting the
              industry as Royal Caribbean alone is pumping £1.4 billion into two
              Genesis class liners over the next few years.</p>
              <p>When finished, Genesis will be able to carry 5,400 passengers
              and stood on its stern it would dwarf Britain's tallest building - the
              800ft One Canada Square in Canary Wharf.</p>
              <p>It will be longer than four football pitches and 40 per cent bigger than the existing biggest liners.</p>
              <p>It is scheduled to enter service in autumn 2009 and its home port will be Fort Lauderdale in Florida.</p>
