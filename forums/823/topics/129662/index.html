            <div class='col-md body'><strong>13/5/05</strong><br><br>My wife and I went shopping at BP Plaza this evening. After buying all the things we wanted, instead of cooking at home I suggested having dinner at a Japanese restaurant located at the plazaÂ’s basement.<br><br>I was patiently queuing (second position) waiting to be served when suddenly the staff at the next counter asked me to come over to her counter.  I was quite surprised because there was an auntie waiting to be served at her counter.   So I gave her a Â“are you talking to meÂ” kind of me and again she motioned me towards her counter.<br><br>I moved over, and the auntie flared up.<br><br>Â“Excuse me, do you know I am in the queue, how come you serve him first?Â” She snapped at the staff and proceeded to give me a disgusted look.  I knew she was pissed.  But what the hell, so was I!!!  I was actually very pissed!!! I am not a queue-cutter. That staff asked me to come over.  Not my fault what, why do you have to give me that kind of look?<br><br>At that moment I really felt like fuc.king her, caused a commotion, etc.<br><br>But I controlled myself because I knew if I have done that, something like the following would have happened,<br><br>Auntie: Why do you want to fuc.k me?  It is YOU who cut the queue. I am the victim here. I should fuc.k you instead young man.<br><br>Okay, I shall fuc.k the staff then since she is the one that want misled me into going over to her counter.<br><br>Staff: Why do you want to fuc.k me? I see you handsome mah, so I want to serve you first lor.  You should be grateful that you so old already still got people like you.  Beside, see my badge here, it says Â“Trainee.Â” I very new here leh, my manager lah, he didnÂ’t trained my properly. Go fuc.k my manger.<br><br>Okay, in that case call your manager out.<br><br>Manager: Why do you want to fuc.k me? Not my fault what.  I was drinking coffee in the office; I am not the one who misled you right?  Beside, all of our staffs are very well trained one. Really I think you it is your fault lah.  Use your brain lah, people ask you to come over you come over ah? CanÂ’t you see there is someone else queuing meh? Stupid.<br><br>Since all of you are not at fault then it must my fault lor.

After buying all the things we wanted, instead of cooking at home I suggested having dinner at a Japanese restaurant located at the plazaÂ’s basement.<br><br>I was patiently queuing (second position) waiting to be served when suddenly the staff at the next counter asked me to come over to her counter.  I was quite surprised because there was an auntie waiting to be served at her counter.   So I gave her a Â“are you talking to meÂ” kind of me and again she motioned me towards her counter.<br><br>I moved over, and the auntie flared up.<br><br>Â“Excuse me, do you know I am in the queue, how come you serve him first?Â” She snapped at the staff and proceeded to give me a disgusted look.  I knew she was pissed.  But what the hell, so was I!!!  I was actually very pissed!!! I am not a queue-cutter. That staff asked me to come over.  Not my fault what, why do you have to give me that kind of look?<br><br>At that moment I really felt like fuc.king her, caused a commotion, etc.<br><br>But I controlled myself because I knew if I have done that, something like the following would have happened,<br><br>Auntie: Why do you want to fuc.k me?  It is YOU who cut the queue. I am the victim here. I should fuc.k you instead young man.<br><br>Okay, I shall fuc.k the staff then since she is the one that want misled me into going over to her counter.<br><br>Staff: Why do you want to fuc.k me? I see you handsome mah, so I want to serve you first lor.  You should be grateful that you so old already still got people like you.  Beside, see my badge here, it says Â“Trainee.Â” I very new here leh, my manager lah, he didnÂ’t trained my properly. Go fuc.k my manger.<br><br>Okay, in that case call your manager out.<br><br>Manager: Why do you want to fuc.k me? Not my fault what.
