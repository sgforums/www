            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by FALL:<br><strong><br><br>How did the question of reality arrive from quantum theory?</strong><br><br>Through the 'final(?)' break up of the smallest(?) particles... It seems that the basis of things don't take up any absolute shape or pattern... Some suggested that the modern day technology is still not advance enough to properly 'diagnose' the break ups.... Most scientists have already accepted it as a theory as basis of things.... Which seems somehow absurb to some others perhaps including myself... I still remember my younger days when I studied Newton's law back in secondary school... So many doubts... I asked my teacher and questioned Newton's law and the limits of its applications... My teacher just told me to learn whatever I'm told to according to the syllabus... Which is of course what I did.... Newton's law is no absolute... Or at least some ways of seeing it could have been quite very wrong.... I've always respected Einstein... He can't accept Quantum till the day he died... Though he did admit that he could have been wrong to question it... But a good scientist should always leave room for doubts... I question Quantum too... And it's a separate matter from my respect for Einstein....<br><br>Anyway... Some more philosophical people who learn about Quantum begin to question about the very basis of reality and its creation....<br><br><strong><br>Any reference?</strong><br><br>You should easily be able to find them in libraries and such... Rather divided views....<br><br><strong><br>Is the theory about quantum energies and maybe some other physical quantities making up the basis of our world?</strong><br><br>Related to Quantum energies and more to it.... Yup... About 'physical' quantities making up our world too... Some people also begin to question... Should we study Quantum under 'physics'.... Or is it more like a whole new branch of its own?<br><br><strong><br>String theory?</strong><br><br>String theory was just one of the proposed basis for quantum... But seems like things are very much more complex than that...?<br></blockquote></div>
