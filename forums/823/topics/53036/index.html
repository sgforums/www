Does mutation process for viruses take on a totally 'random' process? Or is it somehow more specific?

            <div class='col-md body'>For the sake of clarifying clear first on the defination of virus, the readers may wish to have a look at this defination which I had picked up from the Internet.<br><br>The link is as follow :<br><br><a href="http://www.tulane.edu/~dmsander/garryfavwebfaq.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tulane.edu/~dmsander/garryfavwebfaq.html</a><br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>The Definition of a Virus: </strong><br><br>Biological structure composed mainly of nucleic acid within a protein coat, ranging in size from 100 to 2000 angstroms (unit of length; 1 angstrom is equal to 10-10 meters); they can be seen only with an electron microscope. During the stage of their replication cycle when they are free and infectious, viruses do not carry out the usual functions of living cells, such as respiration and growth; however, when they enter a living plant, animal or bacterial cell, they make use of the host cell's chemical energy and protein- and nucleic acid-synthesizing ability to replicate themselves. Viral nucleic acids are single- or double-stranded and may be DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) or RNA (ribonucleic acid). After viral components are made by the infected host cell, virus particles are released; the host cell is often dissolved. Some viruses do not kill cells but transform them into a cancerous state; some cause illness and then seem to disappear, while remaining latent and later causing another, sometimes much more severe, form of disease. Viruses, known to cause cancer in animals, are suspected of causing cancer in humans. Viruses also cause measles, mumps, yellow fever, poliomyelitis, influenza and the common cold. Some viral infections can be treated with drugs.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Now interestingly there is also a certain paragraph in which, the editor of the webby actually answered a query on viruses.<br><br>According to the web master, by established standards, viruses are actually <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> considered to be alive.<br><br>Not that I'm pretty much convinced by him, but heck.

            <div class='col-md body'>With reference to my earlier post way up above in the page, I have suggested the possibilty of Mankind to engage genetic enginneering to 'reform' a virus, remove it's malicious genes that causes harm to humans, stablized it from mutating away from it's re-enginneered variant and eventually employ the virus organically thru artificial introduction into the human body.<br><br>To the majority, the idea may prehaps sound absurd, unethical, or even insane.<br><br>However unknown to the minds of many, do you know that in just decades back ago, Mankind was already employing such technics already?<br><br>Highlighting the focus onto the Polio disease, do you know that the vaccine for Polio was actually developed from the virus itself?<br><br>To understand what had happened back in the 1950's and 1960's whereby polio was a major devastation that ravaged the defendless population of Humanity, a good read could be derive from the following :<br><br>'Since the late 1950's and the early 1960's, there has been a controversy between which type of polio vaccine should be used. Jonas Salk had first discovered the polio vaccine which was injected into the blood stream. It consisted of dead polio viruses which the body makes antibodies from. He used a dead strain of a virus which was uncommon at the time. Albert Sabin later came up with another polio vaccine which was taken orally. It consisted of 'weakened' polio viruses.<br><br>The body attacks the weakened polio virus and grows immune to it. The weakened virus isn't strong enough to create a full blown polio infection, but strong enough for the body to create antibodies to it. Occasionally, the virus does become strong enough and the person gets a polio infection, especially with people who have weakened immune systems due to treatments of other illnesses. This doesn't happen with Salk's vaccine since the polio viruses injected are dead. But are these risks worth it? Which type of vaccine should be used?<br><br>Sabin's vaccine is now used 99% of the time in the U.S. over Salk's vaccine. Approximately 100 million Americans had taken three doses of the Sabin vaccine by the mid 1964. It has many advantages over the vaccine Salk came up with. It is taken orally and kept in the refrigerator until administration time. The vaccination doesn't require any uses of needles. It can be put in sugar cubes or sweetened syrup. Therefore, it was easy to administer and is used widely in third world countries such as Africa. On the other hand, Salk's vaccine needed to be administered with a needle, which can be unsanitary in third world countries where they can't afford to use one needle or each person. The Soviets found out that the Salk vaccine was complicated to administer. (It takes 3 shoots to complete the vaccination.) It was therefore never widely used there.<br><br>The vaccine is 96% to 100% effective in a field test in the former Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia of 12.6 million people. It immunizes the digestive tract instead of the blood, unlike Salk's polio vaccine. It is also known that 'gut' immunity is better than blood immunity. The vaccination lasts longer than the Salk's vaccine so it doesn't require multiple doses throughout your lifetime.<br><br>After taking the oral vaccine, you could excrete live polio virus from their feces. This could infect unvaccinated adults who, for example, change the diapers of a baby who took this vaccine. This could be an advantage because you could become immunized secondhandedly. Therefore, not only the baby will be immune to polio, but also the adults that were around.<br><br>One assumption to make refrigeration an advantage is that the cost of a refrigerator is much cheaper than the costs of needles in the long run. The problem with this is that refrigerators could be used for other vaccinations and medicines instead of storing polio vaccination. Another assumption with the refrigerator is that there is electricity to run the refrigerator. In certain parts of the world, there isn't enough electricity to run enough refrigerators to store all the vaccines and medicines, since refrigerators require a great deal of energy. This could pose a problem in some country's. But as technology moves and expands throughout the world, this problem won't be a big deal in the future.<br><br>Another assumption of why Sabin's vaccine should be used, especially in third world countries, is that the country has resources to handle people who do come down with polio. Sabin's vaccine can cause polio, even though the risks are very low. In the U.S., approximately 3/4 of all polio cases are related with vaccinations and contracting the disease through the vaccine.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In both Sabin and Salk's approach, the two gentlemen had obviously chosen to boost the human immune system via provocation with a weaken virus that operateswith less vigor and agression as compared to an 'unfanged' one.<br><br>While this approach has proven its' effectiveness, the versality of this methodology still has relatively great disadvantages which renders the style of treatment to remain an unviable option for treatment against many other diseases caused either directly or indirectly by viruses.<br><br>Firstly, as the recent SARS example had proved in conjuction with the grim reminder such as the Black Death episode in London around the time when the Big Ben was burntdown, we know that there are certain viruses that reproduce themselves too fast for the human immune system to adapt accordingly.<br><br>Secondly, the success of the treament in addition to the weaken status of the manipulated virus, the success of the treament was also partially attributed to the crutial factor that the original human immune system within the body of a subject is still in a relatively well functioning condition.<br><br>Now a problem would arise when we talk about the second issue.<br><br>What would happen then to a patient, who's original immune system was already malfuntioning or detolerating rapidly from the attack of another disease?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now in view of the above mentioned limitation...<br><br>Think.<br><br>What if the therapeutic process had been designed to revolved in an opposite manner by which the previous provocative approach was reversed instead?<br><br>Now if a strain of hyper-agressive but 'defanged' virus which had been earlier infused with re-enginneered and human reseambling DNA and RNA codings were to be available, the induction of the 'good' virus would instead, propel a patient who is formerly in poor health back into pink again with an even faster pace than other malicious but slower duplicating versions.<br><br>Of course, this is only one of the more traditional use of the viruses' existance.<br><br>But venturing more adventurously down this same path which seek to fully employs the natural strength of viruses to reduplicate their 'contents' into any available foreign cell, imagine what this spells for more dangerous areas of gray.<br><br>Say we employ a re-enginneered variant into combat soldiers, and this variant contained 'antidotes' that kill off other common viral disease such as malaria or other common jungle sicknesses, the mass vaccination of a country's entire army would have greatly increased and multiple crazily upon their on field fighting capabilities.<br><br>At best, such dreams are only still being dreamt more predominantly along the traditional streamline.<br><br>But upon the day where a crazy scientist can come up with even more earth shocking alternatives, only that would then mark the tue beginning of the Viral Revolution.<br><br>And when this day does dawn, prehaps civilization may finally have a chance at re-making them itself for the better.<br><br>Or then again, for the worst too prehaps?</div>

Didn't know what exactly went wrong with my formating...? ~Sigh....~<br><br>Anyway, I've already know about vaccines... But usage of vaccines though could be useful, it's limited in quite a way...

Usually vaccines are made in 2 ways? Or issit 3..? Can't really remember my school stuffs...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If I never remember wrongly...<br><br>1. Vaccines made from modification(s) of original virus (in deactivated form).<br><br>2. Vaccines made from broken virus and only selected parts.<br><br>3. Vaccines man-made either with parts attached to an appropriate artificial carrier or whole artificially (genetical?) vaccine.<br><br>High risk mentioned in my earlier post refers to the possible risk of true infection when vaccine is applied, especially so in case (1). That's why vaccines have to be tested. BOTH for efficiency and unwanted (side effects or disease effects) effects.....</div>
