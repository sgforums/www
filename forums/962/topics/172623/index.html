"And taught me, in part,<br><br>That the best of a man is what's in his heart."<br><br>The rest, I thought, this man will never know. . .<br><br>How thankful I am that he touched my soul!<br><br>===================================================<br><br>"People will forget what you said, and people will forget what you did, but people will never ever forget how you made them feel."<br><br>by "Unknown</div>
