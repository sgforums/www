            <div class='col-md body'>Jimmy sits at the front besides his father who is driving the car. "Be careful Jimmy," Dad said. "You have to help me to keep on watching Uncle John's car which is in front of us. We will follow his trail from North<br>Carolina until we reach Indiana. Pay more attention especially when another car tries to surpass our way or when we are at the red light. Jimmy is very happy that he can help his Dad. He has been expecting this trip for weeks.<br>Jimmy and his parents get into one car while Uncle John and other 3 members of the Church get into another car. They will attend a Church Congregation week in Indiana states. Wow it's so wonderful to travel together !<br><br>But on the first day of their trip, when the sun is very hot, at one pm, Dad got a flat tire. Dad honked twice-long honk, a short one and another long honk again. That's a signal they agreed, so the front car will notice immediately when something gone wrong with the car behind. Uncle John's car slowly retreated to the place where Dad is already busy working. He has a spare tire and a jock ready. "Quiet unlucky!" Uncle John said. "Yes, but quiet lucky too. It happened right here, under the canopy of this big tree,"<br>Dad answered. Those two men start working together so they can fix it more quickly. Jimmy and his Mom and other passengers wait in the sheltered place.<br>Now, we've fixed it," Uncle John said.<br>And I'm thirsty now." He looks around. A little bit far from the street, there's a small house. At its front porch sits an old lady, her skin is black and her hair is very white. She sits with a big book on her lap. Uncle John pointed to that old lady. "Hey Jimmy, go to that house and ask for<br>water," he said.<br>Jimmy climbs the steps and get to the front porch. That old lady turns to him but didn't say a word. "Excuse me, Mam," Jimmy said, "We just change our flat tire and we are all thirsty. Could we have water from here?" The old lady smiled. "Water? Yes, there's a spring with very sweet water in that wood, behind that small hill. Here, Boy, keep holding this rope and you will<br>get there!" While she explained, that old lady put her hands on a strong rope that was tied to the front porch column. It seems that the rope stretch out over the yard until it disappears behind the house.<br>Jimmy says his thanks. A little hesitant, he starts holding that rope. He follows it, crossing the yard..entering the woods..keep following the rope until it reached a small hill. There he found the spring. It's true; the water is very sweet and also very cold.<br>After drink that water, Jimmy returned to his dad and showed the place to the others. They are all go to that spring and drink to their contents. "I will go to that old lady's house with you," Dad said to  Jimmy. "I want to ask a road direction. We also have to say thanks again to that old lady for the water."<br>Slowly both of them walk through the wood and crossing the house yard. "It's obvious that people who lives in this house likes flowers," Dad said. "I never smell so many fragrant." When they come closer to the porch, the old lady is still sitting there. But she didn't turn to them. It seems that her eyes were directed to the front not to the big book on her lap. However her fingers are moving very quick on top of the pages of that big book.<br>"Oh, , she is blind!" Dad whispers to Jimmy, "that's why there's a rope to guide her to that spring. And that's why also she likes to plant flowers.<br>She cannot see but she could enjoy the fragrant. Apparently the old lady hearing is still sharp even though her eyes are blind. She heard that whisper and turns to Jimmy and his Dad. "How is it Boy? Did you find that spring? Isn't it very fresh at this hot day?"<br>"It is refreshing, Mam," Jimmy answered politely. "And very delicious!" Dad also speaks, "We owe you, Mam," And he  continued: "Is there anything that we<br>can do for you before we continue our journey?"<br>The old lady smiled," Oh no Sir, thank you. No need. You can see by yourself, my eyes are blind ever since I was a little but I don't need help.<br>No need!" And then she laughed heartily.<br>"I'll bet you didn't stay here alone!" Dad said. "Alone! And I like living here!" the old lady answered and she laughs again. "My son, he is the one who puts all those ropes for me. This rope guides me to the spring. That rope takes me to the barn, another rope, guides me to fruit tree. And there's also a rope to guide me to vegetables garden. I don't need those ropes while I'm in the house, because I can feel my way and walk everywhere insides.<br>Once again she smiled to Jimmy and his father although she can't see them. "<br>I keep on holding my ropes," she said again. And then she lifted a big book on her lap," Do you know what it is?"<br>"I know, it is a Braille book printed with raised dots so we can touch it with our fingers," Dad answered. "And if I'm not mistaken, it is a Bible.<br>"Yes! Yes! Said this black lady with a cheerful voice. "Now, you listen to this old lady says: Just now you keep on holding my rope and you can reach the spring water. Now, keep on holding this Bible and it will takes you to the heaven!" "You are right, Mam," Dad said.<br>That old lady puts her wrinkled hands to the rope that led to spring water, "Keep on holding it to get the water," And she touched the rope that led to the garden, "Keep on holding it to get the food. "And then with full of love and respect, she puts her hands to that big bible, "Keep on holding it, to get to the Lord. And this is my most important rope!"<br>"It's true," Dad said again. "Mam, I don't have to holding on to those ropes like you. However I try to keep on holding to Bible's teachings. Just like my boy here, and just like the others who are traveling with us.<br>"Good!Good!,"that old lady said with a more wider smile. Jimmy's father still talks a little while with her. Then Uncle John pushed the horn from the street and they have to live. It turns out that Dad totally forget to ask road direction.<br>The old lady stands at the porch while they're saying goodbye. Her face is turned to their footsteps. She waited until she heard both of the cars engine started again, and then she shouts: "Keep on holding this, all of you! Yes, keep on holding this!" and with both of her hands she lifted up that big Bible.<br>Jimmy look at his father: his face seems amazed, "Dad, Apparently she is not sad although she's blind," Jimmy said. "Yes she is not sad, Jimmy," Dad agreed. " She has learned something that neglected by people with a fine eyes. The Lady knows that we have to keep on holding to the most important<br>thing.<br>Both cars keep moving, climbing the hills and down to the valleys. With its tires rolling sound, Jimmy feels he could hear again that black old lady shouts: "Keep on holding this, all of you! Yes, always, keep on holding this!"<br><br>End</div>
