            <div class='col-md body'>Author: Unknown<br><br>Once upon a time lived a spider in a cornfield. A big spider with a beautiful<br>nest goes around between corn stems. It becomes fat by eating all the insects that trapped on its web. It really loved to live on that cornfield and plans to stay there forever.<br><br>One day, the spider catch a tiny insect on its web, and when this spider going to eat it, the insect said, Â“If you let me go, I will tell you one important thing that will save your lifeÂ”. That spider stops for a moment and listen carefully. Â“You better go from this cornfield,Â” said this tiny insect, Â“Harvest time already here!Â”<br><br>The spider smiles and says, Â”What this harvest time you talk about? I think you<br>just make up a storyÂ”. But the tiny insects says, Â“Oh no, its true. The owner of this field will come soon to reap. All the corn stalk will be cut off and the corn will be gathered. You will be killed by a giant machine if you stay here.Â”<br><br>The spider answers, Â“I do not believe in the harvest time or giant machine that will cut off the corn. How you may prove it?Â” The tiny insect continues, Â“Look at those corns. Look how those corns were planted in ordered lines. That proves that this field was designed by somebody brilliantÂ”.<br><br>The spider laugh and said, Â“This field grown by its own and has no relationship<br>with a creator. Corns always grow like thatÂ”. The insect explain more, Â“Oh no.<br>This field owned by an owner who plants it, the harvest time will be here soon.Â” The spider grinned and said, Â“I do not believeÂ”, and then it eat that insect.<br><br>Few days later, the spider was laughing remembered the tiny insectÂ’s story. He thinks, Â“Harvest. What a stupid idea. I already here all my life and no body is<br>disturbing me. I already here when the plants just half meter tall from the ground, and will be here for the rest of my life, because there is nothing will changed on this field. Life is beautiful, and I will make it that way.Â”<br><br>The next day was a beautiful day on the cornfield. The sky was bright and thereÂ’s no wind. That noon, when the spider walks, he suddenly realizes there was a thick dust move on his way. It hears the sound of giant machine and told itself, Â“What is happening?Â”<br><br>Luke 12:39 And this know, that if the oodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through.<br>Luke 12:40 Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not. (Luke 12:39-40)<br><br>Matthew 13:36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.<br><br>Matthew 13:37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is<br>the Son of man;<br><br>Matthew 13:38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];<br><br>Matthew 13:39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.<br><br>Matthew 13:40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.<br><br>Matthew 13:41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;<br><br>Matthew 13:42 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.<br><br>Matthew 13:43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. (Matthew13: 36-43)<br><br>The stair of life is full with wood shavings, but you will never realize it before you slipped down.<br><br>Translator: Christine Pepah<br></div>
