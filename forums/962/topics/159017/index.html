            <div class='col-md body'>TRANSLATED FROM THE LATIN INTO MODERN ENGLISH<br>__________________________________________________<br><br>BOOK ONE<br><br>The First Chapter<br><strong>Imitating Christ and Despising All Vanities on Earth</strong><br><br>HE WHO follows Me, walks not in darkness,Â” says the Lord. John 8:12. By these words of Christ we are advised to imitate His life and habits, if we wish to be truly enlightened and free from all blindness of heart. Let our chief effort, therefore, be to study the life of Jesus Christ.<br><br>The teaching of Christ is more excellent than all the advice of the saints, and he who has His spirit will find in it a hidden manna. Now, there are many who hear the Gospel often but care little for it because they have not the spirit of Christ. Yet whoever wishes to understand fully the words of Christ must try to pattern his whole life on that of Christ.<br><br>What good does it do to speak learnedly about 2 the Trinity if, lacking humility, you displease the Trinity? Indeed it is not learning that makes a man holy and just, but a virtuous life makes him pleasing to God. I would rather feel contrition than know how to define it. For what would it profit us to know the whole Bible by heart and the principles of all the philosophers if we live without grace and the love of God? Vanity of vanities and all is vanity, except to love God and serve Him alone.<br><br>This is the greatest wisdomÂ—to seek the kingdom of heaven through contempt of the world. It is vanity, therefore, to seek and trust in riches that perish. It is vanity also to court honor and to be puffed up with pride. It is vanity to follow the lusts of the body and to desire things for which severe punishment later must come. It is vanity to wish for long life and to care little about a well-spent life. It is vanity to be concerned with the present only and not to make provision for things to come. It is vanity to love what passes quickly and not to look ahead where eternal joy abides.<br><br>Often recall the proverb: Â“The eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing.Â”1 Try, moreover, to turn your heart from the love of things visible and bring yourself to things invisible. For they who follow their own evil passions stain their consciences and lose the grace of God.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>1<br><br>Eccles. 1:8.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Second Chapter<br><strong>Having a Humble Opinion of Self</strong><br><br>EVERY man naturally desires knowledge2; but what good is knowledge without fear of God? Indeed a humble rustic who serves God is better than a proud intellectual who neglects his soul to study the course of the stars. 3 He who knows himself well becomes mean in his own eyes and is not happy when praised by men.<br><br>If I knew all things in the world and had not charity, what would it profit me before God Who will judge me by my deeds?<br><br>Shun too great a desire for knowledge, for in it there is much fretting and delusion. Intellectuals like to appear learned and to be called wise. Yet there are many things the knowledge of which does little or no good to the soul, and he who concerns himself about other things than those which lead to salvation is very unwise.<br><br>Many words do not satisfy the soul; but a good life eases the mind and a clean conscience inspires great trust in God.<br><br>The more you know and the better you understand, the more severely will you be judged, unless your life is also the more holy. Do not be proud, therefore, because of your learning or skill. Rather, fear because of the talent given you. If you think you know many things and understand them well 4 enough, realize at the same time that there is much you do not know. Hence, do not affect wisdom, but admit your ignorance. Why prefer yourself to anyone else when many are more learned, more cultured than you?<br><br>If you wish to learn and appreciate something worth while, then love to be unknown and considered as nothing. Truly to know and despise self is the best and most perfect counsel. To think of oneself as nothing, and always to think well and highly of others is the best and most perfect wisdom. Wherefore, if you see another sin openly or commit a serious crime, do not consider yourself better, for you do not know how long you can remain in good estate. All men are frail, but you must admit that none is more frail than yourself.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>2 Aristotle, Metaphysics, i. 1.<br>3 Augustine, Confessions V. 4.<br><br><strong></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Third Chapter<br><br><strong>The Doctrine of Truth</strong><br>HAPPY is he to whom truth manifests itself, not in signs and words that fade, but as it actually is. Our opinions, our senses often deceive us and we discern very little.<br><br>What good is much discussion of involved and obscure matters when our ignorance of them will not be held against us on Judgment Day? Neglect of things which are profitable and necessary and 5 undue concern with those which are irrelevant and harmful, are great folly.<br><br>We have eyes and do not see.<br><br>What, therefore, have we to do with questions of philosophy? He to whom the Eternal Word speaks is free from theorizing. For from this Word are all things and of Him all things speakÂ—the Beginning Who also speaks to us. Without this Word no man understands or judges aright. He to whom it becomes everything, who traces all things to it and who sees all things in it, may ease his heart and remain at peace with God.<br><br>O God, You Who are the truth, make me one with You in love everlasting. I am often wearied by the many things I hear and read, but in You is all that I long for. Let the learned be still, let all creatures be silent before You; You alone speak to me.<br><br>The more recollected a man is, and the more simple of heart he becomes, the easier he understands sublime things, for he receives the light of knowledge from above. The pure, simple, and steadfast spirit is not distracted by many labors, for he does them all for the honor of God. And since he enjoys interior peace he seeks no selfish end in anything. What, indeed, gives more trouble and affliction than uncontrolled desires of the heart?<br><br>A good and devout man arranges in his mind the things he has to do, not according to the whims of evil inclination but according to the dictates of 6 right reason. Who is forced to struggle more than he who tries to master himself? This ought to be our purpose, then: to conquer self, to become stronger each day, to advance in virtue.<br><br>Every perfection in this life has some imperfection mixed with it and no learning of ours is without some darkness. Humble knowledge of self is a surer path to God than the ardent pursuit of learning. Not that learning is to be considered evil, or knowledge, which is good in itself and so ordained by God; but a clean conscience and virtuous life ought always to be preferred. Many often err and accomplish little or nothing because they try to become learned rather than to live well.<br><br>If men used as much care in uprooting vices and implanting virtues as they do in discussing problems, there would not be so much evil and scandal in the world, or such laxity in religious organizations. On the day of judgment, surely, we shall not be asked what we have read but what we have done; not how well we have spoken but how well we have lived.<br><br>Tell me, where now are all the masters and teachers whom you knew so well in life and who were famous for 7 their learning? Others have already taken their places and I know not whether they ever think of their predecessors. During life they seemed to be something; now they are seldom remembered. How quickly the glory of the world passes away! If only their lives had kept pace with their learning, then their study and reading would have been worth while.<br><br>How many there are who perish because of vain worldly knowledge and too little care for serving God. They became vain in their own conceits because they chose to be great rather than humble.<br><br>He is truly great who has great charity. He is truly great who is little in his own eyes and makes nothing of the highest honor. He is truly wise who looks upon all earthly things as folly that he may gain Christ. He who does GodÂ’s will and renounces his own is truly very learned.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Fourth Chapter<br><br><strong>PRUDENCE IN ACTION</strong><br>DO NOT yield to every impulse and suggestion but consider things carefully and patiently in the light of God's will. For very often, sad to say, we are so weak that we believe and speak evil of others rather than good. Perfect men, however, do not readily believe every talebearer, because they know that human frailty is prone to evil and is likely to appear in speech.<br><br>Not to act rashly or to cling obstinately to one's opinion, not to believe everything people say or to spread abroad the gossip one has heard, is great wisdom.<br><br>Take counsel with a wise and conscientious man. Seek the advice of your betters in preference to following your own inclinations.<br><br>A good life makes a man wise according to God and gives him experience in many things, for the more humble he is and the more subject to God, the wiser and the more at peace he will be in all things.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CHAPTER FIVE<br><br><strong>Of the reading of Holy Scriptures</strong><br><br>It is Truth which we must look for in Holy Writ, not cunning of<br>words.  All Scripture ought to be read in the spirit in which it<br>was written.  We must rather seek for what is profitable in<br>Scripture, than for what ministereth to subtlety in discourse.<br>Therefore we ought to read books which are devotional and simple,<br>as well as those which are deep and difficult.  And let not the<br>weight of the writer be a stumbling-block to thee, whether he be<br>of little or much learning, but let the love of the pure Truth<br>draw thee to read.  Ask not, who hath said this or that but look<br>to what he says.<br><br>2. Men pass away, but the truth of the Lord endureth for ever.<br>Without respect of persons God speaketh to us in divers manners.<br>Our own curiosity often hindereth us in the readings of holy<br>writings, when we seek to understand and discuss, where we should<br>pass simply on.  If thou wouldst profit by thy reading, read<br>humbly, simply, honestly, and not desiring to win a character for<br>learning.  Ask freely, and hear in silence the words of holy men;<br>nor be displeased at the hard sayings of older men than thou, for<br>they are not uttered without cause.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sixth Chapter<br><br><strong>Of inordinate affections</strong><br><br>Whensoever a man desireth aught above measure, immediately he<br>becometh restless.  The proud and the avaricious man are never<br>at rest; while the poor and lowly of heart abide in the<br>multitude of peace.  The man who is not yet wholly dead to self,<br>is soon tempted, and is overcome in small and trifling matters.<br>It is hard for him who is weak in spirit, and still in part<br>carnal and inclined to the pleasures of sense, to withdraw<br>himself altogether from earthly desires.  And therefore, when he<br>withdraweth himself from these, he is often sad, and easily<br>angered too if any oppose his will.<br><br>2. But if, on the other hand, he yield to his inclination,<br>immediately he is weighed down by the condemnation of his<br>conscience; for that he hath followed his own desire, and yet in<br>no way attained the peace which he hoped for.  For true peace of<br>heart is to be found in resisting passion, not in yielding to it.<br>And therefore there is no peace in the heart of a man who is<br>carnal, nor in him who is given up to the things that are without<br>him, but only in him who is fervent towards God and living the<br>life of the Spirit.<br></div>

Be not ashamed to be the servant of others<br>for the love of Jesus Christ, and to be reckoned poor in this<br>life.  Rest not upon thyself, but build thy hope in God.  Do what<br>lieth in thy power, and God will help thy good intent. Trust not<br>in thy learning, nor in the cleverness of any that lives, but<br>rather trust in the favour of God, who resisteth the proud and<br>giveth grace to the humble.<br><br>2. Boast not thyself in thy riches if thou hast them, nor in thy<br>friends if they be powerful, but in God, who giveth all things,<br>and in addition to all things desireth to give even Himself.  Be<br>not lifted up because of thy strength or beauty of body, for with<br>only a slight sickness it will fail and wither away.  Be not vain<br>of thy skilfulness or ability, lest thou displease God, from<br>whom cometh every good gift which we have.<br><br>3. Count not thyself better than others, lest perchance thou<br>appear worse in the sight of God, who knoweth what is in man.  Be<br>not proud of thy good works, for God's judgments are of another<br>sort than the judgments of man, and what pleaseth man is ofttimes<br>displeasing to Him.  If thou hast any good, believe that others<br>have more, and so thou mayest preserve thy humility. It is no<br>harm to thee if thou place thyself below all others; but it is<br>great harm if thou place thyself above even one.  Peace is ever<br>with the humble man, but in the heart of the proud there is<br>envy and continual wrath.<br></div>

Far safer is it to<br>live in subjection than in a place of authority.  Many are in<br>obedience from necessity rather than from love; these take it<br>amiss, and repine for small cause.  Nor will they gain freedom of<br>spirit, unless with all their heart they submit themselves for<br>the love of God.  Though thou run hither and thither, thou wilt<br>not find peace, save in humble subjection to the authority of him<br>who is set over thee.  Fancies about places and change of them<br>have deceived many.<br><br>2. True it is that every man willingly followeth his own bent,<br>and is the more inclined to those who agree with him.  But if<br>Christ is amongst us, then it is necessary that we sometimes<br>yield up our own opinion for the sake of peace.  Who is so wise<br>as to have perfect knowledge of all things?  Therefore trust not<br>too much to thine own opinion, but be ready also to hear the<br>opinions of others.  Though thine own opinion be good, yet if for<br>the love of God thou foregoest it, and followest that of another,<br>thou shalt the more profit thereby.<br><br>3. Ofttimes I have heard that it is safer to hearken and to<br>receive counsel than to give it.

Because they steadfastly<br>sought to mortify themselves from all worldly desires, and so<br>were enabled to cling with their whole heart to God, and be free<br>and at leisure for the thought of Him.  We are too much occupied<br>with our own affections, and too anxious about transitory things.<br>Seldom, too, do we entirely conquer even a single fault, nor are<br>we zealous for daily growth in grace.  And so we remain lukewarm<br>and unspiritual.<br><br>3. Were we fully watchful of ourselves, and not bound in spirit<br>to outward things, then might we be wise unto salvation, and make<br>progress in Divine contemplation.  Our great and grievous<br>stumbling-block is that, not being freed from our affections and<br>desires, we strive not to enter into the perfect way of the<br>Saints.  And when even a little trouble befalleth us, too quickly<br>are we cast down, and fly to the world to give us comfort.<br><br>4. If we would quit ourselves like men, and strive to stand firm<br>in battle, then should we see the Lord helping us from Heaven.<br>For He Himself is alway ready to help those who strive and who<br>trust in Him; yea, He provideth for us occasions for striving, to<br>the end that we may win the victory.  If we look upon our<br>progress in religion as a progress only in outward observances<br>and forms, our devoutness wll soon come to an end.  But let us<br>lay the axe to the very root of our life, that, being cleansed<br>from affections, we may possess our souls in peace.<br><br>5. If each year should see one fault rooted out from us, we<br>should go quickly on to perfection.  But on the contrary, we<br>often feel that we were better and holier in the beginning of our<br>conversion than after many years of profession.  Zeal and<br>progress ought to increase day by day; yet now it seemeth a great<br>thing if one is able to retain some portion of his first ardour.<br>If we would put some slight stress on ourselves at the beginning,<br>then afterwards we should be able to do all things with ease and<br>joy.<br><br>6. It is a hard thing to break through a habit, and a yet harder<br>thing to go contrary to our own will.  Yet if thou overcome not<br>slight and easy obstacles, how shalt thou overcome greater ones?<br>Withstand thy will at the beginning, and unlearn an evil habit,<br>lest it lead thee little by little into worse difficulties.  Oh,<br>if thou knewest what peace to thyself thy holy life should bring<br>to thyself, and what joy to others, methinketh thou wouldest be<br>more zealous for spiritual profit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thirteenth Chapter<br><strong>Of resisting temptation</strong><br><br>So long as we live in the world, we canot be without trouble and<br>trial.  Wherefore it is written in Job, The life of man upon the<br>earth is a trial.(1)  And therefore ought each of us to give heed<br>concerning trials and temptations, and watch unto prayer, lest<br>the devil find occasion to deceive; for he never sleepeth, but<br>goeth about seeking whom he may devour.  No man is so perfect in<br>holiness that he hath never temptations, nor can we ever be<br>wholly free from them.<br><br>2. Yet, notwithstanding, temptations turn greatly unto our<br>profit, even though they be great and hard to bear; for through<br>them we are humbled, purified, and instructed.  All Saints have<br>passed through much tribulation and temptation, and have profited<br>thereby.  And they who endured not temptation became reprobate<br>and fell away.  There is no position so sacred, no place so<br>secret, that it is without temptations and adversities.<br><br>3. There is no man wholly free from temptations so long as he<br>liveth, because we have the root of temptation within ourselves,<br>in that we are born in concupiscence.  One temptation or sorrow<br>passeth away, and another cometh; and always we shall have<br>somewhat to suffer, for we have fallen from perfect happiness.<br>Many who seek to fly from temptations fall yet more deeply into<br>them.  By flight alone we cannot overcome, but by endurance and<br>true humility we are made stronger than all our enemies.<br><br>4. He who only resisteth outwardly and pulleth not up by the<br>root, shall profit little; nay, rather temptations will return to<br>him the more quickly, and will be the more terrible.  Little by<br>little, through patience and longsuffering, thou shalt conquer by<br>the help of God, rather than by violence and thine own strength<br>of will.  In the midst of temptation often seek counsel; and deal<br>not hardly with one who is tempted, but comfort and strengthen<br>him as thou wouldest have done unto thyself.<br><br>5. The beginning of all temptations to evil is instability of<br>temper and want of trust in God; for even as a ship without a<br>helm is tossed about by the waves, so is a man who is careless<br>and infirm of purpose tempted, now on this side, now on that.<br>As fire testeth iron, so doth temptation the upright man.<br>Oftentimes we know not what strength we have; but temptation<br>revealeth to us what we are.  Nevertheless, we must watch,<br>especially in the beginnings of temptation; for then is the foe<br>the more easily mastered, when he is not suffered to enter within<br>the mind, but is met outside the door as soon as he hath knocked.<br>Wherefore one saith,<br><br>Check the beginnings; once thou might'st have cured,<br>But now 'tis past thy skill, too long hath it endured.<br><br>For first cometh to the mind the simple suggestion, then the<br>strong imagination, afterwards pleasure, evil affection, assent.<br>And so little by little the enemy entereth in altogether, because<br>he was not resisted at the beginning.  And the longer a man<br>delayeth his resistance, the weaker he groweth, and the stronger<br>groweth the enemy against him.<br><br>6. Some men suffer their most grievous temptations in the<br>beginning of their conversion, some at the end.  Some are sorely<br>tried their whole life long.  Some there are who are tempted but<br>lightly, according to the wisdom and justice of the ordering of<br>God, who knoweth the character and circumstances of men, and<br>ordereth all things for the welfare of His elect.<br><br>7. Therefore we ought not to despair when we are tempted, but the<br>more fervently should cry unto God, that He will vouchsafe to<br>help us in all our tribulation; and that He will, as St. Paul<br>saith, with the temptation make a way to escape that we may be<br>able to bear it.(2)  Let us therefore humble ourselves under the<br>mighty hand of God in all temptation and trouble, for He will<br>save and exult such as are of an humble spirit.<br><br>8. In temptations and troubles a man is proved, what progress he<br>hath made, and therein is his reward the greater, and his virtue<br>doth the more appear.  Nor is it a great thing if a man be devout<br>and zealous so long as he suffereth no affliction; but if he<br>behave himself patiently in the time of adversity, then there is<br>hope of great progress.  Some are kept safe from great<br>temptations, but are overtaken in those which are little and<br>common, that the humiliation may teach them not to trust to<br>themselves in great things, being weak in small things.<br><br>(1) Job vii. I (Vulg.).   (2) I Corinthians x. 13.</div>

In judging others a man laboureth in vain; he often<br>erreth, and easily falleth into sin; but in judging and examining<br>himself he always laboureth to good purpose.  According as a<br>matter toucheth our fancy, so oftentimes do we judge of it; for<br>easily do we fail of true judgement because of our own personal<br>feeling.  If God were always the sole object of our desire, we<br>should the less easily be troubled by the erring judgement of our<br>fancy.<br><br>2. But often some secret thought lurking within us, or even some<br>outward circumstance, turneth us aside.  Many are secretly<br>seeking their own ends in what they do, yet know it not.  They<br>seem to live in good peace of mind so long as things go well with<br>them, and according to their desires, but if their desires be<br>frustrated and broken, immediately they are shaken and<br>displeased.  Diversity of feelings and opinions very often brings<br>about dissensions between friends, between countrymen, between<br>religious and godly men.<br><br>3. Established custom is not easily relinquished, and no man is<br>very easily led to see with the eyes of another.  If thou rest<br>more upon thy own reason or experience than upon the power of<br>Jesus Christ, thy light shall come slowly and hardly; for God<br>willeth us to be perfectly subject unto Himself, and all our<br>reason to be exalted by abundant love towards Him.</div>

Ah! What is our life<br>when compared to theirs?  They, saints and friends of Christ as<br>they were, served the Lord in hunger and thrist, in cold and<br>nakedness, in labour and weariness, in watchings and fastings, in<br>prayer and holy meditations, in persecutions and much rebuke.<br><br>2. O how many and grievous tribulations did the Apostles,<br>Martyrs, Confessors, Virgins, endure; and all others who would<br>walk in the footsteps of Christ. For they hated their souls in<br>this world that they might keep them unto life eternal.  O how<br>strict and retired a life was that of the holy fathers who dwelt<br>in the desert!  what long and grievous temptations they did<br>suffer!  how often were they assaulted by the enemy!  what<br>frequent and fervid prayers did they offer unto God!  what strict<br>fasts did they endure!  what fervent zeal and desire after<br>spiritual profit did they manifest!  how bravely did they fight<br>that their vices might not gain the mastery!  how entirely and<br>steadfastly did they reach after God!  By day they laboured, and<br>at night they gave themselves ofttimes unto prayer; yea, even<br>when they were labouring they ceased not from mental prayer.<br><br>3. They spent their whole time profitably; every hour seemed<br>short for retirement with God; and through the great sweetness of<br>contemplation, even the need of bodily refreshment was forgotten.<br>They renounced all riches, dignities, honours, friends, kinsmen;<br>they desired nothing from the world; they ate the bare<br>necessities of life; they were unwilling to minister to the body<br>even in necessity.  Thus were they poor in earthly things, but<br>rich above measure in grace and virtue.  Though poor to the outer<br>eye, within they were filled with grace and heavenly<br>benedictions.<br><br>4. They were strangers to the world, but unto God they were as<br>kinsmen and friends.  They seemed unto themselves as of no<br>reputation, and in the world's eyes contemptible; but in the<br>sight of God they were precious and beloved.  They stood fast in<br>true humility, they lived in simple obedience, they walked in<br>love and patience; and thus they waxed strong in spirit, and<br>obtained great favour before God.  To all religious men they were<br>given as an example, and they ought more to provoke us unto good<br>livings than the number of the lukewarm tempteth to<br>carelessness of life.<br><br>5. O how great was the love of all religious persons at the<br>beginning of this sacred institution!  O what devoutness of<br>prayer!  what rivalry in holiness!  what strict discipline was<br>observed!  what reverence and obedience under the rule of the<br>master showed they in all things!  The traces of them that remain<br>until now testify that they were truly holy and perfect men, who<br>fighting so bravely trod the world underfoot.  Now a man is<br>counted great if only he be not a transgressor, and if he can<br>only endure with patience what he hath undertaken.<br><br>6. O the coldness and negligence of our times, that we so quickly<br>decline from the former love, and it is become a weariness to<br>live, because of sloth and lukewarmness.

            <div class='col-md body'>Nineteenth Chapter<br><strong>Of the exercises of a religious man</strong><br><br>The life of a Christian ought to be adorned with all virtues,<br>that he may be inwardly what he outwardly appeareth unto men.<br>And verily it should be yet better within than without, for God<br>is a discerner of our heart, Whom we must reverence with all our<br>hearts wheresoever we are, and walk pure in His presence as do<br>the angels.  We ought daily to renew our vows, and to kindle our<br>hearts to zeal, as if each day were the first day of our<br>conversion, and to say, "Help me, O God, in my good resolutions,<br>and in Thy holy service, and grant that this day I may make a<br>good beginning, for hitherto I have done nothing!"<br><br>2. According to our resolution so is the rate of our progress,<br>and much diligence is needful for him who would make good<br>progress.  For if he who resolveth bravely oftentimes falleth<br>short, how shall it be with him who resolveth rarely or feebly?<br>But manifold causes bring about abandonment of our resolution,<br>yet a trivial omission of holy exercises can hardly be made<br>without some loss to us.  The resolution of the righteous<br>dependeth more upon the grace of God than upon their own wisdom;<br>for in Him they always put their trust, whatsoever they take in<br>hand.  For man proposeth, but God disposeth; and the way of a<br>man is not in himself.(1)<br><br>3. If a holy exercise be sometimes omitted for the sake of some<br>act of piety, or of some brotherly kindnesss, it can easily be<br>taken up afterwards; but if it be neglected through distaste or<br>slothfulness, then is it sinful, and the mischief will be felt.<br>Strive as earnestly as we may, we shall still fall short in many<br>things.  Always should some distinct resolution be made by us;<br>and, most of all, we must strive against those sins which most<br>easily beset us.  Both our outer and inner life should be<br>straitly examined and ruled by us, because both have to do with<br>our progress.<br><br>4. If thou canst not be always examining thyself, thou canst at<br>certain seasons, and at least twice in the day, at evening and at<br>morning.  In the morning make thy resolves, and in the evening<br>inquire into thy life, how thou hast sped to-day in word, deed,<br>and thought; for in these ways thou hast often perchance offended<br>God and thy neighbour.  Gird up thy lions like a man against the<br>assaults of the devil; bridle thine appetite, and thou wilt soon<br>be able to bridle every inclination of the flesh.  Be thou never<br>without something to do; be reading, or writing, or praying, or<br>meditating, or doing something that is useful to the community.<br>Bodily exercises, however, must be undertaken with discretion,<br>nor are they to be used by all alike.<br><br>5. The duties which are not common to all must not be done<br>openly, but are safest carried on in secret.  But take heed that<br>thou be not careless in the common duties, and more devout in the<br>secret; but faithfully and honestly discharge the duties and<br>commands which lie upon thee, then afterwards, if thou hast still<br>leisure, give thyself to thyself as thy devotion leadeth thee.<br>All cannot have one exercise, but one suiteth better to this man,<br>and another to that.  Even for the diversity of season different<br>exercises are needed, some suit better for feasts, some for<br>fasts.  We need one kind in time of temptations, and others in<br>time of peace and quietness. Some are suitable to our times of<br>sadness, and others when we are joyful in the Lord.<br><br>6. When we draw near the time of the great feasts, good exercises<br>should be renewed, and the prayers of holy men more fervently<br>besought.  We ought to make our resolutions from one Feast to<br>another, as if each were the period of our departure from this<br>world, and of entering into the eternal feast.  So ought we to<br>prepare ourselves earnestly at solemn seasons, and the more<br>solemnly to live, and to keep straightest watch upon each holy<br>observance, as though we were soon to receive the reward of our<br>labours at the hand of God.<br><br>7. And if this be deferred, let us believe ourselves to be as yet<br>ill-prepared, and unworthy as yet of the glory which shall be<br>revealed in us at the appointed season; and let us study to<br>prepare ourselves the better for our end.  Blessed is that<br>servant, as the Evangelist Luke hath it, whom, when the Lord<br>cometh He shall find watching.  Verily I say unto you He will<br>make him ruler over all that He hath.(2)<br><br>(1) Jeremiah x. 23.   (2) Luke xii. 43, 44.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CHAPTER XX<br><strong>Of the love of solitude and silence</strong><br><br>Seek a suitable time for thy meditation, and think frequently of<br>the mercies of God to thee.  Leave curious questions.  Study such<br>matters as bring thee sorrow for sin rather than amusement.  If<br>thou withdraw thyself from trifling conversation and idle goings<br>about, as well as from novelties and gossip, thou shalt find thy<br>time sufficient and apt for good meditation.  The greatest saints<br>used to avoid as far as they could the company of men, and chose<br>to live in secret with God.<br><br>2. One hath said, "As oft as I have gone among men, so oft have I<br>returned less a man."  This is what we often experience when we<br>have been long time in conversation.  For it is easier to be<br>altogether silent than it is not to exceed in word.  It is easier<br>to remain hidden at home than to keep sufficient guard upon<br>thyself out of doors.  He, therefore, that seeketh to reach that<br>which is hidden and spiritual, must go with Jesus "apart from the<br>multitude."  No man safely goeth abroad who loveth not to rest at<br>home.  No man safely talketh but he who loveth to hold his peace.<br>No man safely ruleth but he who loveth to be subject.  No man<br>safely commandeth but he who loveth to obey.<br><br>3. No man safely rejoiceth but he who hath the testimony of a<br>good conscience within himself.  The boldness of the Saints was<br>always full of the fear of God.  Nor were they the less earnest<br>and humble in themselves, because they shone forth with great<br>virtues and grace.  But the boldness of wicked men springeth from<br>pride and presumption, and at the last turneth to their own<br>confusion.  Never promise thyself security in this life,<br>howsoever good a monk or devout a solitary thou seemest.<br><br>4. Often those who stand highest in the esteem of men, fall the<br>more grievously because of their over great confidence.<br>Wherefore it is very profitable unto many that they should not be<br>without inward temptation, but should be frequently assaulted,<br>lest they be over confident, lest they be indeed lifted up into<br>pride, or else lean too freely upon the consolations of the<br>world.  O how good a conscience should that man keep, who never<br>sought a joy that passeth away, who never became entangled with<br>the world!  O how great peace and quiet should he possess, who<br>would cast off all vain care, and think only of healthful and<br>divine things, and build his whole hope upon God!<br><br>5. No man is worthy of heavenly consolation but he who hath<br>diligently exercised himself in holy compunction.  If thou wilt<br>feel compunction within thy heart, enter into thy chamber and<br>shut out the tumults of the world, as it is written, Commune with<br>your own heart in your own chamber and be still.(1)  In<br>retirement thou shalt find what often thou wilt lose abroad.<br>Retirement, if thou continue therein, groweth sweet, but if thou<br>keep not in it, begetteth weariness.  If in the beginning of thy<br>conversion thou dwell in it and keep it well, it shall afterwards<br>be to thee a dear friend, and a most pleasant solace.<br><br>6. In silence and quiet the devout soul goeth forward and<br>learneth the hidden things of the Scriptures.  Therein findeth<br>she a fountain of tears, wherein to wash and cleanse herself each<br>night, that she may grow the more dear to her Maker as she<br>dwelleth the further from all worldly distraction.  To him who<br>withdraweth himself from his acquaintance and friends God with<br>his holy angels will draw nigh.  It is better to be unknown and<br>take heed to oneself than to neglect oneself and work wonders.<br>It is praiseworthy for a religious man to go seldom abroad, to<br>fly from being seen, to have no desire to see men.<br><br>7. Why wouldest thou see what thou mayest not have?  The world<br>passeth away and the lust thereof.  The desires of sensuality<br>draw thee abroad, but when an hour is past, what does thou bring<br>home, but a weight upon thy conscience and distraction of heart?<br>A merry going forth bringeth often a sorrowful return, and a<br>merry evening maketh a sad morning?  So doth all carnal joy<br>begin pleasantly, but in the end it gnaweth away and destroyeth.<br>What canst thou see abroad which thou seest not at home?  Behold<br>the heaven and the earth and the elements, for out of these are<br>all things made.<br><br>8. What canst thou see anywhere which can continue long under the<br>sun?  Thou believest perchance thou shalt be satisfied, but thou<br>wilt never be able to attain unto this.  If thou shouldest see<br>all things before thee at once, what would it be but a vain<br>vision?  Lift up thine eyes to God on high, and pray that thy<br>sins and negligences may be forgiven.  Leave vain things to vain<br>men, and mind thou the things which God hath commanded thee.<br>Shut thy door upon thee, and call unto thyself Jesus thy beloved.<br>Remain with Him in thy chamber, for thou shalt not elsewhere find<br>so great peace.  If thou hadst not gone forth nor listened to<br>vain talk, thou hadst better kept thyself in good peace.  But<br>because it sometimes delighteth thee to hear new things, thou<br>must therefore suffer trouble of heart.<br><br>(1) Psalm iv. 4.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CHAPTER XXI<br><strong>Of compunction of heart</strong><br><br>If thou wilt make any progress keep thyself in the fear of God,<br>and long not to be too free, but restrain all thy senses under<br>discipline and give not thyself up to senseless mirth.  Give<br>thyself to compunction of heart and thou shalt find devotion.<br>Compunction openeth the way for many good things, which<br>dissoluteness is wont quickly to lose.  It is wonderful that any<br>man can ever rejoice heartily in this life who considereth and<br>weigheth his banishment, and the manifold dangers which beset his<br>soul.<br><br>2. Through lightness of heart and neglect of our shortcomings we<br>feel not the sorrows of our soul, but often vainly laugh when we<br>have good cause to weep.  There is no true liberty nor real joy,<br>save in the fear of God with a good conscience.  Happy is he who<br>can cast away every cause of distraction and bring himself to the<br>one purpose of holy compunction.  Happy is he who putteth away<br>from him whatsoever may stain or burden his conscience.  Strive<br>manfully; custom is overcome by custom.  If thou knowest how to<br>let men alone, they will gladly let thee alone to do thine own<br>works.<br><br>3. Busy not thyself with the affairs of others, nor entangle<br>thyself with the business of great men.  Keep always thine eye<br>upon thyself first of all, and give advice to thyself specially<br>before all thy dearest friends.  If thou hast not the favour of<br>men, be not thereby cast down, but let thy concern be that thou<br>holdest not thyself so well and circumspectly, as becometh a<br>servant of God and a devout monk.  It is often better and safer<br>for a man not to have many comforts in this life, especially<br>those which concern the flesh.  But that we lack divine comforts<br>or feel them rarely is to our own blame, because we seek not<br>compunction of heart, not utterly cast away those comforts which<br>are vain and worldly.<br><br>4. Know thyself to be unworthy of divine consolation, and worthy<br>rather of much tribulation.  When a man hath perfect compunction,<br>then all the world is burdensome and bitter to him.  A good man<br>will find sufficient cause for mourning and weeping; for whether<br>he considereth himself, or pondereth concerning his neighbour, he<br>knoweth that no man liveth here without tribulation, and the more<br>throughly he considereth himself, the more throughly he grieveth.<br>Grounds for just grief and inward compunction there are in our<br>sins and vices, wherein we lie so entangled that we are but<br>seldom able to contemplate heavenly things.<br><br>5. If thou thoughtest upon thy death more often than how long thy<br>life should be, thou wouldest doubtless strive more earnestly to<br>improve.  And if thou didst seriously consider the future pains<br>of hell, I believe thou wouldest willingly endure toil or pain<br>and fear not discipline.  But because these things reach not the<br>heart, and we still love pleasant things, therefore we remain<br>cold and miserably indifferent.<br><br>6. Oftentimes it is from poverty of spirit that the wretched body<br>is so easily led to complain.  Pray therefore humbly unto the<br>Lord that He will give thee the spirit of compunction and say in<br>the language of the prophet, Feed me, O Lord, with bread of<br>tears, and give me plenteousness of tears to drink.(1)<br><br>(1) Psalm lxxv. 5.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CHAPTER XXII<br><strong>On the contemplation of human misery</strong><br><br>Thou art miserable wheresoever thou art, and whithersoever thou<br>turnest, unless thou turn thee to God.  Why art thou disquieted<br>because it happeneth not to thee according to thy wishes and<br>desires?  Who is he that hath everything according to his will?<br>Neither I, nor thou, nor any man upon the earth.  There is no man<br>in the world free from trouble or anguish, though he were King or<br>Pope.  Who is he who hath the happiest lot?  Even he who is<br>strong to suffer somewhat for God.<br><br>2. There are many foolish and unstable men who say, "See what a<br>prosperous life that man hath, how rich and how great he is, how<br>powerful, how exalted."  But lift up thine eyes to the good<br>things of heaven, and thou shalt see that all these worldly<br>things are nothing, they are utterly uncertain, yea, they are<br>wearisome, because they are never possessed without care and<br>fear.  The happiness of man lieth not in the abundance of<br>temporal things but a moderate portion sufficeth him.  Our life<br>upon the earth is verily wretchedness.  The more a man desireth<br>to be spiritual, the more bitter doth the present life become to<br>him; because he the better understandeth and seeth the defects of<br>human corruption.  For to eat, to drink, to watch, to sleep, to<br>rest, to labour, and to be subject to the other necessities of<br>nature, is truly a great wretchedness and affliction to a devout<br>man, who would fain be released and free from all sin.<br><br>3. For the inner man is heavily burdened with the necessities of<br>the body in this world.  Wherefore the prophet devoutly prayeth<br>to be freed from them, saying, Deliver me from my necessities, O<br>Lord.(1)  But woe to those who know not their own misery, and yet<br>greater woe to those who love this miserable and corruptible<br>life.  For to such a degree do some cling to it (even though by<br>labouring or begging they scarce procure what is necessary for<br>subsistence) that if they might live here always, they would care<br>nothing for the Kingdom of God.<br><br>4. Oh foolish and faithless of heart, who lie buried so deep in<br>worldly things, that they relish nothing save the things of the<br>flesh!  Miserable ones!  they will too sadly find out at the<br>last, how vile and worthless was that which they loved.  The<br>saints of God and all loyal friends of Christ held as nothing the<br>things which pleased the flesh, or those which flourished in<br>this life, but their whole hope and affection aspired to the<br>things which are above.  Their whole desire was borne upwards to<br>everlasting and invisible things, lest they should be drawn<br>downwards by the love of things visible.<br><br>5. Lose not, brother, thy loyal desire of progress to things<br>spiritual.  There is yet time, the hour is not past.  Why wilt<br>thou put off thy resolution?  Arise, begin this very moment, and<br>say, "Now is the time to do: now is the time to fight, now is the<br>proper time for amendment."  When thou art ill at ease and<br>troubled, then is the time when thou art nearest unto blessing.<br>Thou must go through fire and water that God may bring thee into<br>a wealthy place.  Unless thou put force upon thyself, thou wilt<br>not conquer thy faults.  So long as we carry about with us this<br>frail body, we cannot be without sin, we cannot live without<br>weariness and trouble.  Gladly would we have rest from all<br>misery; but because through sin we have lost innocence, we have<br>lost also the true happiness.  Therefore must we be patient, and<br>wait for the mercy of God, until this tyranny be overpast,<br>and this mortality be swallowed up of life.<br><br>6. O how great is the frailty of man, which is ever prone to<br>evil!  To-day thou confessest thy sins, and to-morrow thou<br>committest again the sins thou didst confess.  Now dost thou<br>resolve to avoid a fault, and within an hour thou behavest<br>thyself as if thou hadst never resolved at all.  Good cause have<br>we therefore to humble ourselves, and never to think highly of<br>ourselves, seeing that we are so frail and unstable.  And quickly<br>may that be lost by our negligence, which by much labour was<br>hardly attained through grace.<br><br>7. What shall become of us at the end, if at the beginning we are<br>lukewarm and idle?  Woe unto us, if we choose to rest, as though<br>it were a time of peace and security, while as yet no sign<br>appeareth in our life of true holiness.  Rather had we need that<br>we might begin yet afresh, like good novices, to be instructed<br>unto good living, if haply there might be hope of some future<br>amendment and greater spiritual increase.<br><br>(1) Psalm xxv. 17.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CHAPTER XXIII<br><br>Very quickly will there be an end of thee here; take heed<br>therefore how it will be with thee in another world.  Today man<br>is, and to-morrow he will be seen no more.  And being removed out<br>of sight, quickly also he is out of mind.  O the dulness and<br>hardness of man's heart, which thinketh only of the present, and<br>looketh not forward to the future.  Thou oughtest in every deed<br>and thought so to order thyself, as if thou wert to die this day.<br>If thou hadst a good conscience thou wouldst not greatly fear<br>death.  It were better for thee to watch against sin, than to fly<br>from death.  If to-day thou art not ready, how shalt thou be<br>ready to-morrow?  To-morrow is an uncertain day; and how knowest<br>thou that thou shalt have a to-morrow?<br><br>2. What doth it profit to live long, when we amend so little?<br>Ah!  long life doth not always amend, but often the more<br>increaseth guilt.  Oh that we might spend a single day in this<br>world as it ought to be spent!  Many there are who reckon the<br>years since they were converted, and yet oftentimes how little is<br>the fruit thereof.  If it is a fearful thing to die, it may be<br>perchance a yet more fearful thing to live long.  Happy is the<br>man who hath the hour of his death always before his eyes, and<br>daily prepareth himself to die.  If thou hast ever seen one die,<br>consider that thou also shalt pass away by the same road.<br><br>3. When it is morning reflect that it may be thou shalt not see<br>the evening, and at eventide dare not to boast thyself of the<br>morrow.  Always be thou prepared, and so live that death may<br>never find thee unprepared.  Many die suddenly and unexpectedly.<br>For at such an hour as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh.(1)<br>When that last hour shall come, thou wilt begin to think very<br>differently of thy whole life past, and wilt mourn bitterly that<br>thou hast been so negligent and slothful.<br><br>4. Happy and wise is he who now striveth to be such in life as he<br>would fain be found in death!  For a perfect contempt of the<br>world, a fervent desire to excel in virtue, the love of<br>discipline, the painfulness of repentance, readiness to obey,<br>denial of self, submission to any adversity for love of Christ;<br>these are the things which shall give great confidence of a happy<br>death.  Whilst thou art in health thou hast many opportunities of<br>good works; but when thou are in sickness I know not how much<br>thou wilt be able to do.  Few are made better by infirmity: even<br>as they who wander much abroad seldom become holy.<br><br>5. Trust not thy friends and kinsfolk, nor put off the work of<br>thy salvation to the future, for men will forget thee sooner than<br>thou thinkest.  It is better for thee now to provide in time, and<br>to send some good before thee, than to trust to the help of<br>others.  If thou art not anxious for thyself now, who, thinkest<br>thou, will be anxious for thee afterwards?  Now the time is most<br>precious.  Now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation.<br>But alas!  that thou spendest not well this time, wherein thou<br>mightest lay up treasure which should profit thee everlastingly.<br>The hour will come when thou shalt desire one day, yea, one hour,<br>for amendment of life, and I know not whether thou shalt obtain.<br><br>6. Oh, dearly beloved, from what danger thou mightest free<br>thyself, from what great fear, if only thou wouldst always live<br>in fear, and in expectation of death!  Strive now to live in such<br>wise that in the hour of death thou mayest rather rejoice than<br>fear.  Learn now to die to the world, so shalt thou begin to live<br>with Christ.  Learn now to contemn all earthly things, and then<br>mayest thou freely go unto Christ.  Keep under thy body by<br>penitence, and then shalt thou be able to have a sure confidence.<br><br>7. Ah, foolish one!  why thinkest thou that thou shalt live long,<br>when thou art not sure of a single day?  How many have been<br>deceived, and suddenly have been snatched away from the body!<br>How many times hast thou heard how one was slain by the sword,<br>another was drowned, another falling from on high broke his neck,<br>another died at the table, another whilst at play! One died by<br>fire, another by the sword, another by the pestilence, another by<br>the robber.  Thus cometh death to all, and the life of men<br>swiftly passeth away like a shadow.<br><br>8. Who will remember thee after thy death?  And who will entreat<br>for thee?  Work, work now, oh dearly beloved, work all that thou<br>canst.  For thou knowest not when thou shalt die, not what shall<br>happen unto thee after death.  While thou hast time, lay up for<br>thyself undying riches.  Think of nought but of thy salvation;<br>care only for the things of God.  Make to thyself friends, by<br>venerating the saints of God and walking in their steps, that<br>when thou failest, thou mayest be received into everlasting<br>habitations.(2)<br><br>9. Keep thyself as a stranger and a pilgrim upon the earth, to<br>whom the things of the world appertain not.  Keep thine heart<br>free, and lifted up towards God, for here have we no continuing<br>city.(3)  To Him direct thy daily prayers with crying and tears,<br>that thy spirit may be found worthy to pass happily after death<br>unto its Lord.  Amen.<br><br>(1) Matthew xxiv. 44.   (2) Luke xvi. 9.   (3) Hebrews xiii. 14.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CHAPTER XXIV<br><strong>Of the judgment and punishment of the wicked</strong><br><br>In all that thou doest, remember the end, and how thou wilt stand<br>before a strict judge, from whom nothing is hid, who is not<br>bribed with gifts, nor accepteth excuses, but will judge<br>righteous judgment.  O most miserable and foolish sinner, who art<br>sometimes in fear of the countenance of an angry man, what wilt<br>thou answer to God, who knoweth all thy misdeeds?  Why dost thou<br>not provide for thyself against the day of judgment, when no man<br>shall be able to be excused or defended by means of another, but<br>each one shall bear his burden himself alone?  Now doth thy<br>labour bring forth fruit, now is thy weeping acceptable, thy<br>groaning heard, thy sorrow well pleasing to God, and cleansing to<br>thy soul.<br><br>2. Even here on earth the patient man findeth great occasion for<br>purifying his soul.  When suffering injuries he grieveth more for<br>the other's malice than for his own wrong; when he prayeth<br>heartily for those that despitefully use him, and forgiveth them<br>from his heart; when he is not slow to ask pardon from others;<br>when he is swifter to pity than to anger; when he frequently<br>denieth himself and striveth altogether to subdue the flesh to<br>the spirit.  Better is it now to purify the soul from sin, than<br>to cling to sins from which we must be purged hereafter.  Truly<br>we deceive ourselves by the inordinate love which we bear towards<br>the flesh.<br><br>3. What is it which that fire shall devour, save thy sins?  The<br>more thou sparest thyself and followest the flesh, the more heavy<br>shall thy punishment be, and the more fuel art thou heaping up<br>for the burning.  For wherein a man hath sinned, therein shall he<br>be the more heavily punished.  There shall the slothful be<br>pricked forward with burning goads, and the gluttons be tormented<br>with intolerable hunger and thrist.  There shall the luxurious<br>and the lovers of pleasure be plunged into burning pitch and<br>stinking brimstone, and the envious shall howl like mad dogs for<br>very grief.<br><br>4. No sin will there be which shall not be visited with its own<br>proper punishment. The proud shall be filled with utter<br>confusion, and the covetous shall be pinched with miserable<br>poverty.  An hour's pain there shall be more grievous than a<br>hundred years here of the bitterest penitence.  No quiet shall be<br>there, no comfort for the lost, though here sometimes there is<br>respite from pain, and enjoyment of the solace of friends.  Be<br>thou anxious now and sorrowful for thy sins, that in the day of<br>judgment thou mayest have boldness with the blessed.  For then<br>shall the righteous man stand in great boldness before the face<br>of such as have afflicted him and made no account of his<br>labours.(1)  Then shall he stand up to judge, he who now<br>submitteth himself in humility to the judgments of men.  Then<br>shall the poor and humble man have great confidence, while the<br>proud is taken with fear on every side.<br><br>5. Then shall it be seen that he was the wise man in this world<br>who learned to be a fool and despised for Christ.  Then shall all<br>tribulation patiently borne delight us, while the mouth of the<br>ungodly shall be stopped.  Then shall every godly man rejoice,<br>and every profane man shall mourn.  Then the afflicted flesh<br>shall more rejoice than if it had been always nourished in<br>delights.  Then the humble garment shall put on beauty, and the<br>precious robe shall hide itself as vile.  Then the little poor<br>cottage shall be more commended than the gilded palace.  Then<br>enduring patience shall have more might than all the power of the<br>world.  Then simple obedience shall be more highly exalted than<br>all worldly wisdom.<br><br>6. Then a pure and good conscience shall more rejoice than<br>learned philosophy.  Then contempt of riches shall have more<br>weight than all the treasure of the children of this world.  Then<br>shalt thou find more comfort in having prayed devoutly than in<br>having fared sumptuously.  Then thou wilt rather rejoice in<br>having kept silence than in having made long speech.  Then holy<br>deeds shall be far stronger than many fine words.  Then a strict<br>life and sincere penitence shall bring deeper pleasure than all<br>earthly delight.  Learn now to suffer a little, that then thou<br>mayest be enabled to escape heavier sufferings.  Prove first<br>here, what thou art able to endure hereafter.  If now thou art<br>able to bear so little, how wilt thou be able to endure eternal<br>torments?  If now a little suffering maketh thee so impatient,<br>what shall hell-fire do then? Behold of a surety thou art not<br>able to have two Paradises, to take thy fill or delight here in<br>this world, and to reign with Christ hereafter.<br><br>7. If even unto this day thou hadst ever lived in honours and<br>pleasures, what would the whole profit thee if now death came to<br>thee in an instant?  All therefore is vanity, save to love God<br>and to serve Him only.  For he who loveth God with all his heart<br>feareth not death, nor punishment, nor judgment, nor hell,<br>because perfect love giveth sure access to God.  But he who still<br>delighteth in sin, no marvel if he is afraid of death and<br>judgment.  Nevertheless it is a good thing, if love as yet cannot<br>restrain thee from evil, that at least the fear of hell should<br>hold thee back.  But he who putteth aside the fear of God cannot<br>long continue in good, but shall quickly fall into the snares of<br>the devil.<br><br></div>

It is thy<br>duty to have a good hope that thou wilt attain the victory, but<br>thou must not fall into security lest thou become slothful or<br>lifted up.<br><br>2. A certain man being in anxiety of mind, continually tossed<br>about between hope and fear, and being on a certain day<br>overwhelmed with grief, cast himself down in prayer before the<br>altar in church, and meditated within himself, saying, "Oh! if I<br>but knew that I should still persevere," and presently heard<br>within him a voice from God, "And if thou didst know it, what<br>wouldst thou do?  Do now what thou wouldst do then, and thou<br>shalt be very secure."  And straightway being comforted and<br>strengthened, he committed himself to the will of God and the<br>perturbation of spirit ceased, neither had he a mind any more to<br>search curiously to know what should befall him hereafter, but<br>studied rather to inquire what was the good and acceptable will<br>of God, for the beginning and perfecting of every good work.<br><br>3. Hope in the Lord and be doing good, saith the Prophet; dwell<br>in the land and thou shalt be fed(1) with its riches.  One thing<br>there is which holdeth back many from progress and fervent<br>amendment, even the dread of difficulty, or the labour of the<br>conflict.  Nevertheless they advance above all others in virtue<br>who strive manfully to conquer those things which are most<br>grievous and contrary to them, for there a man profiteth most and<br>meriteth greater grace where he most overcometh himself and<br>mortifieth himself in spirit.<br><br>4. But all men have not the same passions to conquer and to<br>mortify, yet he who is diligent shall attain more profit,<br>although he have stronger passions, than another who is more<br>temperate of disposition, but is withal less fervent in the<br>pursuit of virtue.  Two things specifically avail unto<br>improvement in holiness, namely firmness to withdraw ourselves<br>from the sin to which by nature we are most inclined, and earnest<br>zeal for that good in that which we are most lacking.  And strive<br>also very earnestly to guard against and subdue those faults<br>which displease thee most frequently in others.<br><br>5. Gather some profit to thy soul wherever thou art, and wherever<br>thou seest or hearest good examples, stir thyself to follow them,<br>but where thou seest anything which is blameworthy, take heed<br>that thou do not the same; or if at any time thou hast done it,<br>strive quickly to amend thyself.  As thine eye observeth others,<br>so again are the eyes of others upon thee.  How sweet and<br>pleasant is it to see zealous and godly brethren temperate and of<br>good discipline; and how sad it is to see them walking<br>disorderly, not practising the duties to which they are called.<br>How hurtful a thing it is to neglect the purpose of their<br>calling, and turn their inclinations to things which are none of<br>their business.<br><br>6. Be mindful of the duties which thou hast undertaken, and set<br>always before thee the remembrance of the Crucified.  Truly<br>oughtest thou to be ashamed as thou lookest upon the life of<br>Jesus Christ, because thou hast not yet endeavoured to conform<br>thyself more unto Him, though thou hast been a long time in the<br>way of God.  A religious man who exercises himself seriously and<br>devoutly in the most holy life and passion of our Lord shall find<br>there abundantly all things that are profitable and necessary for<br>him, neither is there need that he shall seek anything better<br>beyond Jesus.  Oh! if Jesus crucified would come into our hearts,<br>how quickly, and completely should we have learned all that we<br>need to know!<br><br>7. He who is earnest receiveth and beareth well all things that<br>are laid upon him.  He who is careless and lukewarm hath trouble<br>upon trouble, and suffereth anguish upon every side, because he<br>is without inward consolation, and is forbidden to seek that<br>which is outward.  He who is living without discipline is exposed<br>to grievous ruin.  He who seeketh easier and lighter discipline<br>shall always be in distress, because one thing or another gives<br>him displeasure.<br><br>8. O! if no other duty lay upon us but to praise the Lord our God<br>with our whole heart and voice!  Oh! if thou never hadst need to<br>eat or drink, or sleep, but wert always able to praise God, and<br>to give thyself to spiritual exercises alone; then shouldest thou<br>be far happier than now, when for so many necessities thou must<br>serve the flesh.  O! that these necessities were not, but only<br>the spiritual refreshment of the soul, which alas we taste too<br>seldom.<br><br>9. When a man hath come to this, that he seeketh comfort from no<br>created thing, then doth he perfectly begin to enjoy God, then<br>also will he be well contented with whatsoever shall happen unto<br>him.  Then will he neither rejoice for much nor be sorrowful for<br>little, but he committeth himself altogether and with full trust<br>unto God, who is all in all to him, to whom nothing perisheth nor<br>dieth, but all things live to Him and obey His every word<br>without delay.<br><br>10. Remember always thine end, and how the time which is lost<br>returneth not.  Without care and diligence thou shalt never get<br>virtue.  If thou beginnest to grow cold, it shall begin to go ill<br>with thee, but if thou givest thyself unto zeal thou shalt find<br>much peace, and shalt find thy labour the lighter because of the<br>grace of God and the love of virtue.  A zealous and diligent<br>man is ready for all things.  It is greater labour to resist sins<br>and passions than to toil in bodily labours.  He who shunneth not<br>small faults falleth little by little into greater.  At eventide<br>thou shalt always be glad if thou spend the day profitably.<br>Watch over thyself, stir thyself up, admonish thyself, and<br>howsoever it be with others, neglect not thyself. The more<br>violence thou dost unto thyself, the more thou shall profit.<br>Amen.<br><br>(1) Psalm xxxvii. 3.<br></div>
