            <div class='col-md body'>1) Definitely<br>2) Absolutely not<br>3) Actually, no. She can't stop hmi if he 'happens' to be there too right?<br>4) If I was the guy, I'd make a clean break. But then and again, it's the feelings that stop him from doing that. But it's also the his feelings that the girl is taking advantage of, treating him like a toy.</div>
