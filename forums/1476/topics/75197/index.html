            <div class='col-md body'>Real life story just heard last night.<br><br>Stone a 20 pulse young man after tender his resignation as an employee, decided to start his own business. Since he do not need to report to work in time, he went jogging with his father Rock every morning.<br><br>Last night Rock pull Stone to a nearest playground for a talk. Son remember Auntie Dolphin we met every morning? She has a 20 pulse daughter Pebble, we decided to pull both of you together. Here is her mobile number 9XXX-XXXX. She is expecting your call tonight.<br><br>Stone did not call Pebble last night, Stone put all his mind on career thinking that after he can build up his career and finance then he look in to relationship.<br><br>My opinion :<br>1) He should be gentleman enough to give Pebble a call and ask her out with her friends or his friends<br><br>2) Though career come first but still keep in touch with gals at least till his success in career the might still be some gals that are single around him to pick as wife.<br><br>Question:<br>1) Why is the 20 pulse gal needed the parents to pull string for her?<br>2) By knowing that her mother is introducing a guy which she nv met before how she feel as in expecting Stone to call her up.<br>3) If she accepts this way of knowing guys I don't think she has any problem make friends or knowing guys from outside, why she accepts the offer?<br><br></div>

If after meet up, stone dun like Pebbles, i believe he has other "options". If he has high "market" value, ppl will be out to snatch for him in time to come.<br>Pebbles dun like stoner, either he can take it as a friend known or just forget abt the whole incident. Rock shld leave the decision to both Pebbles n Stoner, if both parties dun like each other, there is nothing Dolphine n Rock can do. Decision still lies in Pebbles n Stone</div>
