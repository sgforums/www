Say 'buns' for 'ass' as in 'kiss my buns' or 'you're buns hole. Say 'poo' for 'sh*t' as in 'bull-poo', 'poo-head' or 'this poo is cold'.<br><br>c) Avoiding vulgar, be it referring to sexual intercourse, male or female anatomy. (oops me guilty of this very much)<br><br>d) Distance yourself from sarcasm. Such as quoting someone and saying 'Some people are an ass'. The quoted guy might feel insulted and will start a personal attacks. Also do not hide sarcasm in between lines.<br><br>e) Do not denigrate others, by questioning other people wisdom, integrity, character or even ancestry, race, religion. Argue the facts, who cares if the guy has vested interest in the matter. If he is right, he is right.<br><br>f) If possible, use a lot of emoticons, such as  ,  ,  ,will help in your expressions.<br><br>g) If you are coming in with the intention of making trouble, stay out!<br><br>h) If unsure, check with the relevant authorities or even the person in question.<br><br>Whew, here are the 'ba da yuan ze' I thought of which can be used here.<br><br>Copied this from FOS thread.<br><br>Hey guys, this quarrel between stoner and keisha is l ke between me and my sis. Its almost never ending. We quarrelled from young till now. But now less liao.<br><br>My mum's right. Nobody is right or wrong. the Bear and whoever may side with keisha, and point out facts against stoner. Therefore he is in the wrong coz of what he posted, which are crude and childish for 43 years old.<br><br>And also, its also keisha fault, coz she admit as much she has her personality and her own thinking, but that doesnt make you have the right to deem whoever displease you as a nutter, though he may put up some stupid posts in ur forum. He already stay out of ur forum and posted in 30s Forum.<br><br>Seems both of you are wrong. The only way I guess is for the first one to apologise without other unnecessary words. Then the other one also step back.<br><br>Whoever want to go first , just say "I am sorry, I withdraw all I said" That all, and the other will follow suit.<br><br></div></blockquote>hmmm... got one part i dun agree... i dun think sexual intercourse is vugluar lor.... if not sexual intercourse then wont have us people hanging ard in this forum liao mah... then all the pioneers will think " eeerrrrkkkksss sexual intercourse vugluar dirty minded pervert then we wont be able to exist liao.. right??? paisey hor.. is just my own views only. a bit rubbish ar i noe...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
