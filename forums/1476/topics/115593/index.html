            <div class='col-md body'>This will be my last thread, after I finish writting all I needed I will never login again.<br><br>La Kopi session will be my last outing.<br><br>I knew this guy went I was new in forum, I share whatever I knew and trusted him.<br>A Senior warn me that this guy always use the words crap to spread whatever he knows or he forgot he was told in shout box, I did not believe her.<br><br>After few month in forum, this Senior had a chance to meet someone do not want most of the people to know him. The Senior ask his permission and I was told to kept it a secret.<br>On the following day me and the senior and I was having a discussion about the guy we met in a private forum, the oldman which I consider as friend pop in and notice we had met the special guy. He start to tease the guy in shout box like as he is a big brother scolding small kid.<br><br>I found an occasion in an outing I tell the oldman, donÂ’t treat that guy like a small kid, he is not much younger than you, give him some respect. To add on support my point I lie that the guy is a lecturer and he do not want to meet his students.<br><br>In few days time the senior saw the oldman talking about the guy as if he know him personally in shout box. I was warn by my senior to  learn my lesson from this.<br><br>Many times in the past I had call this oldman personally stopping him from saying no more about other things which is sensitive, but the reply from him is always he do not know that was real , he is just crapping, I am too sensitiveÂ…Â…..<br><br>Obviously those who knows who I referring to notices our dispute started from KOC, but some stupid supporters of the oldman didnÂ’t even understand my part of the story why I so angry with the oldman about KOC.<br><br>My reason  :<br>Does he need to spying me and my officer and open discuss in shout box?<br>When I told him to stop yet he proudly tell me and a few who witness Â“ I canÂ’t even catch him up the rankingÂ” Â“you can spy me backÂ” obviously he knows I canÂ’t.<br>I just find he likes to Â“digÂ” people secret and announce to public.<br>In exchange of words he say I take the game seriously ( but if he is not why must he spy me and teach me what to? I donÂ’t even check my account everyday)<br><br>Ever since not long after our dispute, there is 1 mother FUCKER which day and night after me and my officer. If he is reading this he should remember in the beginning of my reply was Â“ who cares, its just a game to meÂ” , and his reply was (you canÂ’t even play a game well, is as good as you canÂ’t succeed in real life)<br><br>I notice that to prevent him from taking my money (30 minutes 22,000 gold) I should log in more often to spend my gold, but isnÂ’t it more stupid if I spend more time in game than earning the real gold in real life? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
