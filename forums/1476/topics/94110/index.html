Also I m curious as in she started paying after u guys r together or even b4 u guys got together?<br><br>If u do accept her financing ur studies n everything including day to day expenses in the 1st place, then I'm sorry 2 said that u got no rights 2 talk abt pride in the 1st place, since u accept the financial aid willingly.<br><br>Well having accept financial aid 4 3 yrs liao, if that's the option taken, then it's only right that you returned all the money, roughly lah, regardless of whether u guys r together, or else u will nvr redeem ur so-called pride.<br><br>Given such a situation, receiving financial aid from ur gf is not such a big deal, provided u don't abandoned her lah. Even if she did the abandoning. I will return her the sum for studies. As for day to day expenses, I think I m quite capable 2 sustain myself, working n studying at the same time. </div></blockquote>1st I have to clearify that I am not here to compliant, just to read others opinion.<br><br>My salary can only affort my school fees and my basic expenses, she just started by paying movies, food , everything slowly whatever we went out.<br><br>She has to eat in "air condition" place , she knows I can't affort it and she will always find excuses that is becos of her thats why she needed to pay.<br><br>I do agree with Devil1976, ask her to lower down the expenses so that I can share the burden, but we always ended up quarrel.....<br><br>I am not talk abt pride here, if I am I won't be posting it here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Being an advocate of new world, new decisions, new options and new choices, I will have to say the following (a little too ideal but still can be managed):<br><br>1) Firstly, love is a two-way process as such I feel it might be better if<br>- If there is a conflict between two decisions, always follow the rule of having equal share of the outcome. i.e. Today, your decisions. Tomorrow, my decisions. Until then, you have to try to accomodate one another's way of life even in the future.<br><br>2) Secondly, money is an external factor in love. It cannot be used to subject another to one's will. There will be a time when the mine can run out of gold. Moreover, we must understand we're no longer in a time phrase where might alone earns the keep. Men are no longer the sole breadwinner of the family, so we must adopt the practice of sharing burden. Thus, it is no longer important to remind ourselves who is footing the bill.<br><br>3) Thirdly, love is unconditional. Please throw away the old view that men at work, women at chores. Women are not items, possessions and slaves or decorational vases. They have their own views and ideals such that we cannot avoid and should not force them to accept roles we expect them to. However, it changes when other responsibilities are more critical like and we might need to adjust to suit the needs to give up the wants:<br>- Having a handicapped family member that require constant care<br>- Having children, or aged family members that are not capable of handling themselves<br>Thus, in situations similar to the abovementioned, a consensus must be reached between both parties.<br><br>4) Last, love is between two parties, not the whole world. Your own decisions and calls are more important than anything.</div>
