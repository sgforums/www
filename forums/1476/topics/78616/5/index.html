I feel anyone witha righteous spirit will be angry &amp; feel sorry for the poor victim &amp; unfound accusations on the craft. It is ridiculous for the Bear to pull such shameless stunts in the public like a bi+ch. i alwiz thought i am THE Bi+cH until i met him. It is not small &amp; harmless coz it hurts people heart, soul &amp; mind, Who the HELL is him or her or himbo or watever!!! Bless all who spoke in the name of craft, Damn him for the sake of craft, so wat!!! Dun bully me huh coz i got sharp claw...MmmmmmmmmEOOoooooooW................<br><br>Fossegrim</span></div>
