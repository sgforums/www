Some customers have a certain preference on the roads on different times of the day so I'm sure he asked out of courtesy to know the way u wanted to go. If he really wanted to cheat u, he prob wun even ask u in the 1st place. And even if he wanted to cheat u, u still knew the best route for u so u were not cheated anyway.

I don't have a car now. And I hate to take taxi. I rather take the bus or MRT where possible.   But the few incidents is because I was taking my mum to hospital and since public buses is a bit difficult for her movement, I took the cab..  Not that I am calculative.  While we were waiting, we see all taxi with sign " Hired " or they don't stop.  We had to wait like 45 minutes and still cannot catch a single cab.  Finally, booked taxi and it appear within five minutes...  What can we say about this ???  From then on, it is like book taxi first instead of trying to flag one on the road....</div>
