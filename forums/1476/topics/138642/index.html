            <div class='col-md body'>There was a boy who liked a girl &amp; his<br>name was Dave... She liked him too...but one day<br>she was walking to class and she heard someone<br>call her when she turned around Dave was there...<br><br>"Hey wait up!" he called.<br><br>She waited for a few seconds and let him catch<br>up then once he did she started walking again.<br><br>"Yes,you need something?" she said<br>"Yea...a favour."he said.<br>"Sure what is it?"she asked.<br>"Go out with me." he said with a gleam in his eyes.<br>"ok...sure."she said secretly jumping with joy in<br>her mind.<br><br>He walked her to class and kissed her good bye...<br>then the late bell rang and he sprung down the hall<br>to get to class. He walked her to class every day<br>and kiss her every day and he was with her every<br>chance he got. Then days turned into weeks and<br>weeks turned into months and months turned into<br>a year and he still ran to catch up with her, tat was<br>the day of their one year anniversary and he<br>walked her to class gave her a box and a<br>kiss...then he whispered into her ear..."I love you."<br>then he left.<br><br>She opened the gift and it was a ring...a gorgeous<br>ring. That night they were out at dinner to celebrate<br>and all he surprised her...AGAIN...<br><br>"Hey...you know how I said that I loved<br>you?"he asked<br>"yea?" She got really nervous....<br>"I really do, you know I love you."<br><br>She didnt say any thing and she knew he wanted<br>her to say it but she didnt want to seem stupid so<br>she stuffed food in her mouth and he didnt say<br>anything but she could tell he was disappointed.<br>They have finish eating and he was driving her<br>home at the red light he turned and looked at her...<br><br>"Why wont you say you love me? dont you love<br>me like I love you?" he asked, She didnt know how<br>to say that she loved him more than She could cud<br>ever imagine, but She just didnt know how or<br>when to say it...<br><br>"I...I...lov...."<br><br>BOOM!!!!!!!!!! a semi had hit the driver side and<br>ramed them right into a lake.The next day She<br>was<br>in the hospital and all she could think about was if<br>Dave was ok...so she got out of her bed and<br>searched for him...but when she found him he<br>was<br>barly alive...seeing the one she loved near death<br>made her drop to her knees and cry...<br><br>"Dave I love you...I've loved you since the first day<br>we meant I love you soooo much dont you leave<br>me please dont leave me I need you here...I LOVE<br>YOU!!!!"<br><br>With his very last breath he said...<br><br>"Hey...I love you too." then he was gone. A week<br>later she was able to go home but she wasnt<br>ready<br>to face school yet and her mom understood. She<br>went up to her room and she found a note inside<br>the ring box....<br><br>Hey,I hope you like this ring. It was my grandma's<br>she told me to give it to the one I love and well i<br>love you.No matter what happens to me I will<br>always love you. If I died today I want to die<br>knowing you love me...I wont leave this earth<br>without knowing you love me. Ashley your always<br>in<br>my heart forever until the day i die.<br>Dave...<br><br>p.s.<br>I love you now...I will love you forever.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You want him back but...
