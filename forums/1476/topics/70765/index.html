I saw good guys fighting against the pirates and also the pirates being defeated, what a happy ending always.<br><br>In our dreamland we use comment like color, /me, kok your head Â….. to represent actions. Even when there is a birthday we celebrates by pictures of cakesÂ….<br>Everybody include the pirates plays an important role, without the pirates there are no good guys, there are no hero like Peter Pan.<br><br>If you had watched that movie you know Peter Pan never kill the pirates, that is why he can always be the hero cause there are no ending of fighting.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Real World</strong></span><br>Well need not explain much but individual of us had our own real life and world. There are some people bring real world into Dreamland, there are some that live in 2 different character and sure there are some that bring the Dreamland to the real live.<br><br>Well I tried bringing the real world to the dreamland but I destroy Â“Peter PanÂ’sÂ” Dream, I tried second method but it seems to some people I had a split personality, I canÂ’t bring the Dreamland out to the real world cause in the real world I canÂ’t see who is the real pirates and who is Peter Pan.

By knowing her for 2 weeks I realize what I want in life and she is the right one for me. She is the one, yes I made a heart broken decision with all the blame from girlfriend and relative, in just a month I became the public enemies.<br><br>We love each other, we live together like husband and wife, we do everything chat anything without running out of topics and activities. It took us nearly a year that my parents and families accepted her. We were like a happy couple that living in the love story. Both of us looks alike and many people mistake us as brother and sister, some after they know we are couple they praise us like what Chinese said FU1 QI1 XIANG4.<br><br><strong>Good thing never last</strong><br><br>During that time I was still serving my NS, she has to support her family and she was taking her part time diploma at night, she help up in a shoes shop in her near by market place, She work part time  for him since she was 13 during her Secondary sch, and she announce that guy as sworn brother which is 15yrs older then her.<br><br>One night, as usual we were talking on the phone after her night class she mention about a classmate which helps her a lot on her school work invited her for a movie on Friday night. I agree straight on the spot without showing her any hesitate because I trust her and I know she loves me. She went, and she called me after class before when in to the movie, I replied, Â“Enjoy yourselfÂ”.<br><br>On that very Sunday afternoon she called me asking me to join her with the guy classmate to a Motor Show at World Trade Centre, knowing that I do not like driving and Cars I rejected her and ask her to carry on. Never realize anything wrong that following Monday she called me from school again saying that she and a group of friends going to disco, again she know I wonÂ’t cause I never and ever like dancing.  But this time I felt funny in my heart, I begin to doubt her which I ever did starting from 9pm, 10pm, 11pm.<br>I page her (that time hand phone was not affordable and popular yet) ever hour which usually she will reply but not this time.<br><br>12am, I canÂ’t sleep and I decided to drive my fatherÂ’s car to her house. Luckily her families still not asleep and accompany me waited till about 1 plus, I hear foot step and I rush out the house, I sense something was wrong, I can tell and feel from her face and look.<br><br><strong>Too be continueÂ…Â…</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Part II</strong><br><br>She knew IÂ’m not there for nothing, she pull me downstairs to have a talk instead of creating seen outside her house. She admit to me that she has a crash with that guy, she started holding hand and Â…. (not bed  while no chance yet I guess) since movie on Friday.<br><br>I was shock by her confess, she was so frank without hiding, she answered every single detail I ask. I forgive her on my face but not my heart. I started restrict her freedom by asking her to leave message in my pager or call me every 3 hours. I gone crazy, I started to raise my voice to her and no longer sweet talks.<br><br>7 months later, my ex girlfriend which I had for 4 years call me. She told me Â“Its enough, if you love her, you have to trust her , donÂ’t torture a gal and since she has obey to my unreasonable request for seven monthsÂ”.<br><br>Yes! I realize I had hidden my love towards my gal fro 7 months, I have not trusted her for the pass 7 months and how can we live together in the rest of our life? I propose marriage to her, I promise her I will love, care and trust her from now. We apply for flat want to set up our own family. I move out my parents house and stay in my friends house know that our flat should be coming in 6 months time by then we will ROM. I thought so that time.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>16 September 1995 Saturday</strong></span><br>I was so happy that I am finally moving out from my family, and staying really together with her in a guy friend house. And some how my mind still disturbed by the past incident and I asked I question that I lost her for my whole life.<br><br>Since we are getting married, is there anything you want to tell or ask me before you or me regrets? She replies, Â”Yes, do you remember my sworn brother?Â”<br>It was like thunder and lightning across my mind!! I thought she is going to tell me about her classmate butÂ…. Huh!! Â“I am his mistress before I know youÂ” she said.<br></div>
