If she already knew that he is 'like that' and still go ahead to marry him, she shouldn't be complaining now since the both of them had their fair share of understanding, knowing one another during the relationship. And no, 3 years or even 10 years is still no excuse - if it doesn't work/suit, no amount of time could change the course of fate.<br><br>But then again, one thing I don't blame her is because most people do not realise that marriage and BGR is one hell of a two different thing. Especially when the guy is routine-run and as a girl, would like their partner to ocassionally spice up the relationship. A good man has strong principles, therefore, when he thinks he is right, he wants you to understand the reasons why. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Analysis</strong></span>:<br><br>Ok, external factors pops in when she felt a little unsatisfied with the relationship. This would probably be a passing phrase, or a complication if it is not properly handled and by the looks of it, its heading towards the latter.<br><br>Her love is young and misled - she has a fear of betrayal (probably from past experience or personal phobia) and is willing to accept a man whom she know that would never betray her.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> That doesn't equate to compatiability and love.<br><br>The appearance of this japanese guy is dangerous to the relationship, not because he wants to chase her, rather, SHE would subconsciously compare and probably find the qualities she couldn't find in her husband in him, and this will lead to love complication.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> In this case: platonic friendship is impossible.<br><br>The next hell is her husband's respond to restrict her. This is definitely leading her towards her complication. Her husband's suspect not only possible affair outside, rather, he would know that she has been seeking shelter and ranting about her marriage - which by a man's ego AND kinda skeleton in the cupboard.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> In all cases: elimination will only surface problems.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Advice</strong></span>:<br><br>She needs to talk to her husband about it. They both have been newly married, things that should/could satisfy each other in their marriage life, physically, emotionally and spiritually must be communicate, understood and learn to work towards them. (Sexually must be fulfilling (both) - for her - her emotions dis-satisfaction must be adjusted and corrected, in turn, her husband should influence her to make her feel more complete spiritually) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In marriage, its all about complementing and adapting. She can't just keep quiet, learn to talk things out.<br><br>P.S: Nothing to do with christian - non christian marriage. Even non-christian/christian marriages faced such problems for this is a common scenario. If God wants your marriage to have meaning, God will drop problems occasionally because God wants you to grow and mature. Before you can gain wisdom, you need gain experience. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Continue Â…<br><br>I have to first intro about this girl that I knew.<br><br>She is a decent girl and had been keeping virginity till her marriage,  she had done nothing sorry to her husband or boyfriend for the past 7 years of relationship.<br>She kind of gal that always consider about others feelings instead of herself.<br>Due to 7 years of relationship she married because she knows her husband love her and do not want to disappoint him. Indeed before the married she already avoid hugging and kissing with her husband. Even the first night of their marriage she is feeling fare and not feeling in giving her husband that ended up husband has to take her virginity after a quarrel. (I donÂ’t know to laugh or to feel sad for the guy)<br><br>Today I had lunch with her, she keep me posted with her latest update of a adventure.<br>She had a fight that injured her hand with her husband recently over SMS on her hand phone that the husband discover the Jap guy outside.<br><br>They had a talk and she told her husband that she had lost her feel with him and wanted to be alone. (Divorce)  Ever since then she avoid even more as in no kissing or huggingÂ… as and when the husband request, everything that she donÂ’t feel like doing (generally everything).<br><br>The Jap guy continue his calling, SMS and dating her out as usual, but she couldnÂ’t resist as he is really caring, nice and everything she can feel, she said to me.<br><br>I shock that the guy has made a closer move and she has had a petting with him, which I believe she is in confuse over her concept donÂ’t to blame herself and sorry for her husband now.  I believe she now feel love or likes the guy much more than her husband.<br>She canÂ’t pull herself out the mess though she understand that she canÂ’t be sure she will end up with the Jap guy or not.<br><br>Sorry for the long essay, below are my questions though I know I canÂ’t or nobody can and only both she and her husband can solve.<br><br>1.	She wanted to move out their house and stay with a couple which is both she and her husband friend as in giving both some quiet time.<br>(I think she canÂ’t have quiet time if she do not stop contacting the Jap guy, its rather unfair to her husband)<br>2.	She feels that she no longer has the feeling towards her husband and she had tried but fail, her feeling sorry to her husband and she knew her husband love her but she just canÂ’t love the husband anymore, not because of the Jap guy (way before she knows the Jap guy). Just your opinion, do you think they should divorce?<br>3.	<strong>If YOU</strong> wanted a divorce were you consider about your parents, parents in law, CHURCHÂ….. , friends, relativeÂ…..? Is that part of a consideration of a divorce?<br><br>I hereby clarify, I am <span style="color: red;"><strong>NOT</strong></span> the person involve in above issue, I just want to help her with the right way, I am a divorcee I worry she will follow my footsteps.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Her priority should be to sort out her marriage first - to stay and work or to quit.  The other man should stay out of the picture for now.<br><br>1. Time and space apart is good so that the couple can think about what they want from the marriage.<br><br>2. If she truly feels she doesn't love her husband, then yes divorce is an option, in my opinion.<br><br>3. Christians consider their religion a major part of marriage and subsequently divorce.  Some would rather pretend to be happily married just to avoid the ... shame?  Scorn of their fellow church members? from a divorce.<br><br>I claim now that no external factor will influence my decision to divorce, but if it happens for real, I may think otherwise.<br><br>The Jap guy is just looking for sex, your friend cannot be too naive to think that it will mean anything more at this moment.  She should not bank too much hopes on him.<br><br>She commited emotional infidelity by liking the japanese guy in a "more than just friends" kind of way.  And physical infidelity, by the petting session.  I think this is enough to judge it to be an affair.<br><br>I have no doubt that you think she's decent and nice and did everything in her power to do what's right in the past.<br><br>Unfortunately one is decent only until he/she commits his last transgression.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by F.O.S:</div><div class="quote_body">1.	She wanted to move out their house and stay with a couple which is both she and her husband friend as in giving both some quiet time.<br>(I think she canÂ’t have quiet time if she do not stop contacting the Jap guy, its rather unfair to her husband)<br>2.	She feels that she no longer has the feeling towards her husband and she had tried but fail, her feeling sorry to her husband and she knew her husband love her but she just canÂ’t love the husband anymore, not because of the Jap guy (way before she knows the Jap guy). Just your opinion, do you think they should divorce?<br>3.	If YOU wanted a divorce were you consider about your parents, parents in law, CHURCHÂ….. , friends, relativeÂ…..? Is that part of a consideration of a divorce?</div></blockquote></div>
