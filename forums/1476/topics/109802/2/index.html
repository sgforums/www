But how about a continuation, a flow of other people keep coming in to point out his crappy posts towards others, as seen in the thread the topic starter linked to, the one on Americans? There is no guarantee of his safety in sgforums. A continual flow of new people coming in to point out his insensitivity..<br><br>so how? The campaign is  successful until and unless fireice finds it absolutely necessary to press the ban button. Hope ur campaign will not mislead him to think his actions is a ok, and result in a ban or something.<br><br>Thats all i wanna say. Good luck.<br><br></div>

I don't think it's nice to come back and see people throwing stones at each other, especially when the year is ending, when we're supposed to forgive and forget the past and move on. Of course, you're still entitled to continue your actions, but I see the repeated attacking of someone over different threads is uncounted for. And I will like to remind those who think it's fun and knew it is wrong when you don't have a sensible reason for persistent attacks that they are going overboard with their mindless actions.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by laurence82:<br>Regarding 'knocking sense into someone', no point pointing out its useless trying to knock sense into ceecookie, while in the other thread, told ceecookie directly he has to 'go up one notch on his sensitivity level', with regards to the tsunami victim thread.

You're not involved but I do not see any reasons in that particular thread as a base for attacks unless its personnal and those found inside the mentioned thread does not seem to have a concrete basis for their unneccessary attacks even though he was being blunt and stupid.

I don't think so that you're more sensitive in certain ways. Let me fix this at it. We're not sensitive at times, but his actions now does not equate to a necessary ban. If he should be banned, then SBSK, 5 times over, you and I ten times over.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by laurence82:<br>so how?
