Racial and religious harmony is something that we can never take for granted in Singapore. Some of ceecookie's postings crossed the OB line - big time. Inflaming racial and religious sensitivities is not a small thing. He did apologise in the end, but he still continued with his insensitive postings. To err is human, to repent is courageous - but to apologize and then continue with one's wrong deeds is utter hypocrisy.<br><br>I seriously hope that what he posted does not reflect his true character and personality.<br></div></blockquote>hi,<br><br>did you read my post in page 2? have you encounter someone that "they don't know what they don't know and thought they know?"<br><br>and for his case is born with it,  if you get what I mean.<br>The more you explain it has become you don't accept ppl like this around us.<br><br>not flaming, just my 2 cents worth.</div>
