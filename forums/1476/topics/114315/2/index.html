Now with cheap airfares, IDD calls &amp; internet, easy to stay in touch.<br><br>I know of many cases where fathers are working long term overseas  &amp; families in S'pore due to kid's studies. This is a more worrying trend as the family bond won't be so strong.<br><br>A family I know (mum + 2 kids) went to Perth cos S'pore edn. too stressful, left behind the dad in S'pore.

            <div class='col-md body'>I was a Civil Engineering draftman back in the past in 1996, some how due to another relationship I quitted my job and not been working for a year. ( another story, will tell you guys next time.)<br><br>I knew a gal which is 7 years younger than me and our relationship last for 3 years. She is from a rich family educated studying her Â‘AÂ’ level. Her family was not happy with me because I am skinny, Â‘OÂ’ level and most important not from family that match their status. Specially her mum always bring her to meet all the rich man and son trying to match make them.<br><br>She is after me and she is willing to give herself against her family to be with me, I decided to turn over a leaf and starts all over again in IT as a sales, earning a salary of $500. I stay back every evening help the technical engineer to setup new PC, trouble shoot to learn the technical stuffs with not extra money. During that time she is having her school holiday working part time in a bank earning $1500 per month, she donÂ’t need the money and she use her money to support me.<br><br>After few month of training, and she has gone back to school our life change. I manage to get in a bigger company as a System Engineer and Network Engineer within 6 months and She entered NUS. My Job has taken my time more and more and that mean less and less time for her.<br><br>She has more and more functions and parties, and always come back with lots of stories. Who and who is after her, doctors, lawyerÂ…Â….<br><br>Ended up she left me with a Â‘OÂ’ level guy which own Fishing tackle shop in Changi Village given by the guyÂ’s father.<br><br>Now and then I still see the guy smiling to me when I walk pass his shop, because before I knew they were together my gf actually introduce him as her sworn brother and brought me to his shop to buy fishing rod which I am still using it now.<br><br>Moral of the above story : if your career is not stable donÂ’t step in relationship, its very fragile. ItÂ’s a waste of time, although she loves me and support me but she gave me up because she canÂ’t wait to see my success.<br><br>Whats the point of stepping into relationship which is only left you with sorrow and pain?<br>How many of the similar relationship really ended happily ever afterÂ….?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Again itÂ’s a 3 years relationship, just before the above story I mentioned.<br>We had everything in common, my family and friends likes her. Both of us after a year of relationship started to save money for marriage, she save up all her salary and both of uses mine salary for expenses, during that time she took a part time account class in the weekend for half a year. After the course I found out that she has been getting very close to a classmate and start to lie for going pubs with him. I do not know how long they have been together till I found out and I finally win her heart back. It took me 7 months to mend my broken heart and regain my trust towards her. During that 7 months since she has finish her course, she claim that she would like to work thing out with me and start to find her Â“sworn brotherÂ” which owns a shop selling shoes to work as part time help him. They knew each other for many year during her secondary school they used to work together for other company, the guy is 9 years older than her.<br><br>I was teaching canoe on every Sunday and will visit her to help her to close shop. She always would take money from the cashier to buy me dinner and sometimes borrow car from him and we go for ride.<br><br>When we reach the final 3rd year , we decide to get married. On my birthday I propose to her and she agreed. We start to talk about our future and suddenly I pop out a question. Â“Do you have any thing in your mind that you think we must discuss before we really  regret ?Â”<br><br>She reply Â“Yes, I always wanted to tell you  but I afraid to lost you, I am mistress of my sworn brotherÂ”<br></div>

( another story, will tell you guys next time.)<br><br>I knew a gal which is 7 years younger than me and our relationship last for 3 years. She is from a rich family educated studying her Â‘AÂ’ level. Her family was not happy with me because I am skinny, Â‘OÂ’ level and most important not from family that match their status. Specially her mum always bring her to meet all the rich man and son trying to match make them.<br><br>She is after me and she is willing to give herself against her family to be with me, I decided to turn over a leaf and starts all over again in IT as a sales, earning a salary of $500. I stay back every evening help the technical engineer to setup new PC, trouble shoot to learn the technical stuffs with not extra money. During that time she is having her school holiday working part time in a bank earning $1500 per month, she donÂ’t need the money and she use her money to support me.<br><br>After few month of training, and she has gone back to school our life change. I manage to get in a bigger company as a System Engineer and Network Engineer within 6 months and She entered NUS. My Job has taken my time more and more and that mean less and less time for her.<br><br>She has more and more functions and parties, and always come back with lots of stories. Who and who is after her, doctors, lawyerÂ…Â….<br><br>Ended up she left me with a Â‘OÂ’ level guy which own Fishing tackle shop in Changi Village given by the guyÂ’s father.<br><br>Now and then I still see the guy smiling to me when I walk pass his shop, because before I knew they were together my gf actually introduce him as her sworn brother and brought me to his shop to buy fishing rod which I am still using it now.<br><br>Moral of the above story : if your career is not stable donÂ’t step in relationship, its very fragile. ItÂ’s a waste of time, although she loves me and support me but she gave me up because she canÂ’t wait to see my success.<br><br>Whats the point of stepping into relationship which is only left you with sorrow and pain?<br>How many of the similar relationship really ended happily ever afterÂ….?<br><br></div></blockquote>You should know where things are going... Don't have to be all pessimestic though? End of the day when relationship don't work out.. At least you should know life would still work out somehow...</div>
