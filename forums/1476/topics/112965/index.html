On what grounds do the forum members think a ban would be served and on what grounds do you think that a warning would suffice.<br><br>Personally, I felt that bans were only necessary to dissuade and only served after a series of warnings were first given, and subjected to the decision of a panel of not less than three individuals.<br><br>Suspensions of accounts might be a valuable addition to the forums as it served as a means to show that action was taken.

Who thinks that getting a premier membership should entitle a member to warnings before a ban is issued, as they are showing their support for the forums by contributing, albeit they have possibly commit a foul mistake once in a while?<br><br>Do you think that there is a incomprehensible line between fault and fraud since we're not strongly aware that under which clauses that a member was issued a ban, and the number of attempts that was made to dissuade a member from undermining the necessary forum etiquette?</div>
