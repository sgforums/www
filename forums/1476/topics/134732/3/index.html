            <div class='col-md body'>some of u say to live on forever is to have no more meanings in life. So i ask: why do u say a SHORT life has MORE meaning to it than a LONGER life? what is the meaning of dying? what is the purpose of death? do u really think u achieve anything at all in death? if u say u get relief in death then i must say u get the idea wrong - u lose EVERYTHING in death, even the feeling of relief. Religious people like to think that there is life after death, well good for you, I'm not going into details about that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>While i agree that there is a chance that an immortal might make it a habit to postpone deadlines becoz "there is always a tomorrow", i cannot agree that the main reason why people are motivated is becoz they "only live once". Do u <strong>ALWAYS</strong> remind yourself that you only live once when u are trying to complete certain tasks, all the time thinking that you are dying as time goes by? Rather I believe u want to get the sense of satisfaction from the success of doing it right the first time and meeting the deadline, or u dont want to do the task all over again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Even an immortal might want to meet his "deadlines" and this can be a motivating factor by itself.<br><br></div>
