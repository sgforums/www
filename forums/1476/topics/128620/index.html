            <div class='col-md body'>Look Beyond us, we can perceive alot of social problems of the teenages have begining to evlove today when the tecnologies became more modern &amp; culture emerging to the western.<br>Kids are too sheltered is far from generalising the poplulation. Looking around are many kids who come from lower &amp; middle income families, parents might not hav the abilty to provide any laptops, play station or any forms of entertainment technology.<br>When kids grow up to be teenagers &amp; have their own group of friends to hang around with, where their mind have filled with jealousy &amp; peer pressure. Why can he always have the most "in" toys &amp; stuff &amp; showing off his branded clothes, why not me? That issue had certainty be with me during my teenager day.<br>These social problems such stealing, shoplifting &amp; even prostituting may have beomce a desire, an ego among some of teens who cant hide their desire to own the same things as other when their parents can only provide them the simpliest form of childhood &amp; growing up stage.<br></div>
