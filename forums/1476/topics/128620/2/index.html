            <div class='col-md body'>The problem i guess stems from the parents. My aunt is an example. She went thru a very hard childhood together with my mum and now she wants to give her child the best of everything, the life she always wanted but never had. Fortunately, my uncle n my dad have been stepping into the picture to keep my nephew from stepping out of line.<br><br>Sure he gets lots of stuff i didn't have when i was younger...heck even my brother gets more and better stuff than me. But now, come to realise it...getting what you want all the time may not be the best way to go thru life.<br>Also...i agree about the peer pressure part, but its really up to the person and how he reacts to it.<br><br>Take me for example...i was one of the latter ones to get a handphone in sec sch...n i was stuck with one of the lousier models. Naturally i wanted to get the better ones when they were released and went handphone crazy fo awhile. Fortunately my parents refused to buy me every hpone i wanted and now, i've given up chasing phones. Whats the point? Theres more to life than that.<br><br>I hope thats one thing that kids these days will learn. There's more to life than all those toys and gadgets. And parents really need to stand firm and set limits...else the butterfly effect steps in and we all know how it goes from there.</div>
