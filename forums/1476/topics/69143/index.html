            <div class='col-md body'>Anyone here knows how it feels like to be rejected by society?<br>Anyone here understands how a person who knows that he will earning at most S$1200 for the rest of his life feels??<br>Anyone here knows how one will feel if he knows that he may be lonely for the rest of his life .....<br><br>Here goes the story of a real heartlander...... one who lives to cash in money for others.....<br><br>It has been like almost yesterday when I first started my first job as a cashier at Clementi's Emporium...... . I still remember the fresh metal smell of the cash register and the new spray of paint that fills the shop. Not to mention the number of hot cashier chicks around me ... I am Stoner, Cashier number 7 at Clementi Emporium.<br><br>I meet many people from all walks of life..... mostly tok to me in Hokkien and chinese with a few in English ..... I was happy and contentend earning that S$600 at that time... life was good .. and it feels good to be earning that money and finally I am going to be independant and will soon be able to afford my own house ...... so I thought.......<br><br>TIme went by and soon months turn into years and to decades.... now after 20 years, I have changed numerous companies, doing what I can only do best ...-Cashier.<br><br>I have been to almost every department store, served almost 50% of the Singaporeans..... and some even remember me from Emporium, NTUC, 7-11, Metro ... etc just to name a few..... Everything around me has changed, ..... all except me .......<br><br>20 years of work and still I am alone, still I am nothing .... my dreams of owning my own place still exist and remained unfullflled.... and it never maybe ...... ...<br><br>In spite of all these, I do still have my trills and spills as a cashier.... especially in carrefour.... I joined them in 1999 and since then it has been 5 good years. My boss is good and even offered me a promotion 1 year back which I kindly turned him down. . ..<br><br>Stupid ... did u say I was, .... I had my reasons.... To be honest, I wasn;t the best in the field .... I had reservations about going up as I feel that in time to come, I will be the first to be fired if the economy worsen... I am no stupid....<br><br>I am a easily contented person.... happy with the S$600 and have nothing more to ask although to my dearm, I still lack S$200,000. Would any ger out there be willing to selltle down with me ?? ..... did I hear a "NO" ......................... <span style="font-style: italic;">comming up next .... the love of stoner</span></div>
