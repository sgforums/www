            <div class='col-md body'>He was an average guy, aloof, and probably the most unusual character around. She was a normal girl, simple, full of dreams and wanted to be loved and cared for. The guy met the girl one day when old friends gathered on a small event and they became friends.<br><br>The guy was always very nice to the girl, treating him like a younger sister, though in his heart he had a crush on another girl. Soon the guy was dejected, when he knew the girl he loved had a new boyfriend. The average guy and the normal girl then went out a few times, though in the company of other friends.<br><br>During her birthday, the guy organised a birthday outing, bought a nice cake for her and a present. The girl was touched and moved by the warm feeling the guy gave her. He was probably the only one who bothered to remember her birthday while her friends had to be reminded to remember.<br><br>Then they went out a few more times, in the company of other friends. The guy was trying to recommend a good friend of his to this sister of his. The good friend eventually popped the question, but she said she already had someone on her mind outside their circle.<br><br>The guy was soon attached with another girl. He told everyone including her about it and she suddenly turned very cold and oftenly silent in his presence. She indulged in her games more and became very anti-social. Yet within a short span of two months, the guy was ditched, and sad. He told her and his friends, and they met up together.<br><br>Then one day while the guy was working, the girl came to his workplace, and waited for her brother to finish his work before having dinner with him. They chatted as usual but this was the first time they were alone. She was unusually joyous and gave him a small toy for him to keep alongside him whereever he goes. She paid for the dinner and they had dinner for the first time together.<br><br>The good friend of the guy then told the guy that the girl likes the guy but the guy would not believe it. So when the girl wanted to shop with the guy alone, but the guy actually had arrangement the day before and told the girl about it. Then the girl spoke that she disliked the good friend, which was weird to the guy, since the girl knew the good friend before she knew him.<br><br>Here's what she said.<br><br>She said, "If I would lose my memory one day, I would be very sad, because I would not know you."<br><br>He said, "If you would not know me, you would not be very sad because I would not want to make you sad. I would not let you know me, and be even more sad than not knowing me."</div>
