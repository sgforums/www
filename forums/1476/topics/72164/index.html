            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Part Zero</strong><br>Last weekend while I was out fishing with FOS off sentosa's siloso beach on a small rubber dinky boat, I got caught in a storm and was blown off shore to about 2 km away ....<br><br>The weather was nasty and the poundering rain kept falling on my head, knowcking me unconscious, but before I went off ..... I swear by GOD, I saw a mermaid.<br><br>She was the most beautiful thing I ever saw in my entire life, her hair was long silky and light brown in color, she had large eyes with well "mascaraed" like eyes...... her breast were full and firm atleast a B cup ... (and NO there were no sea shells covering her nipples like in fairy tales)..... her figure was simple gorgeous.<br><br>Her fins were brightly colored in yellow and red and gliters with the little rays that managed to penetrate thru the rain.......<br><br>The view was simple spectacular ........ at first I thought I was dreaming, until she swam right up next to me,  push herself up my boat, leaning her firm breast on my , holding my hands, in one trust, grab me overboard and into her WORLD......<br><br><strong>Part one</strong><br><br>FOS ... FOS... i called, but he was fast knocked out and failed to yield my screams..... in a flash, "bllloooppp" I was in the water, being drag along like a helpless human in the vast ocean.<br><br>I tried tugging her but she just went on ... and on...... god knows how far and deep we went before she stopped ........ I was so shocked that I even forgot to breath  ...... i just stare in amaze and cannot help but admire her beautiful face and breast of cus .....<br><br>moments later, I came out of my stare and realised that I needed air,.... I tried struggling to the surface but instead, she pulled me back and gave me a kiss....... and gave me literally a "kiss of life" .<br><br><strong>part 2</strong><br><br>It was indeed an adventure that I could never forget..... that gentle kiss, and the "awe" that came with it was simple beyond your imagination....... slowly but surely, I could feel that I am sinking ... almost like into the abyss,.... within minutes, I could no longer see her and it seems like i m at the end of the tunnel ........ as I felt her lips depart from mine, I slowly begin to resign to fate..... and just at this moment, I realised that I could breath underwater and no longer requires her kiss..It was just so magical.... ... "WOWoo ..." I exclaimed  as I was once again being dragged and moved thru the water at a remarkable high speed...... moments later, I say light .... and slowly more lights ..... till ... i had to close my eyes ... it was too blinding .....<br><br>I knew we have stopped .... as she tried to slowly lift my eye lid ..... and at that instant, I knoe I was not dreaming,..... seeing pass her beautiful face of the MERMAID, I saw a whole "city" of sea creatures..... all becking to the calls of the mermaids and mermans., .. this is unbelievable .... and unlike all the stories that have been told, .... these mer-people actually live in fishes and not some "buildings" etc.<br><br><strong>part Three</strong><br>The view was simply astonishing ..... as I watched in amazement of how a community like tat can be hidden from the eyes above for so long ........  ... before I could take a second glance round the premises, I was once again pulled along by this beautiful mermaid and with a trust of her powerful tail, we were off, .... heading towards a opening .... which looks like the mouth of a spermwhale..... this is truely unbelivable.<br><br>Inside ..... everything looks gross....  but within lies a throne and a mer-King .. I suppose ..... "Speak human, what brings you here !" I was stunted by his question and replied .. "hey ... thought you needed my help here so u send a maid to fetch me ??"<br><br>"How dare you .. you punny human speak to me in such rude tone." the king replied....... then before I could defend myself, ... the mermaid spoke up " father..... I love him and want to be with him."<br>And that was the last I hear ......before..... *faint<br><br><strong>Part 4</strong><br><br>"Finally u are a wake" . .. .. this is most shocking, I am lying in a giant clam and surrprisingly it is very comfortable...... I tried to pretend nothing had happened and told her that I had to leave.....  I also told her that this cannot be and that our lives are so different . But she refused to accept all this and told be that since I was a boy, she has already noticed my wa back in the 1970s, when I first came to sentosa..... I could not believe my ears,,,, when I heard those worlds... and vividly in my mind, i recall seeing a mermaid young girl in the water when I was at sentosa 30 years ago.<br><br>"No it cannot be .. i thought you were just a part of my imagination." I said ..... she then took my hand and placed it upon her breast and said " I am as real as it can be .." at this point, i was like hit by a thousand of WHYs !!!! and What !!! lost am I in a world so familiar and yet so distance away .....<br><br><strong>Part 5</strong><br>Looking at her I know I can no longer deceive her ... I then told her the truth that we belong to two different worlds and can never be together ..... and also mentioned that i already have a tai tai waiting for me on Earth and a career at carrefour waiting for my reesignation...... seeing my strong will to wanna leave .. she sadly agreeded but not before requesting that I give her the "device" my handphone and my number....<br><br>She then guided me along back the way we came from, into the abyss and finally we saw light once more...... I kissed her goodbye and with at that instant, I knew I needed air once more and reluctanly left her where she was and make hast for the surface.<br><br><strong>Part 6</strong><br><br>It was already evening when I returned and the rain had already ceased. "FOS, FOS ... wake up" I shouted and tried nudging him till he woke up .. " wat happened" he exclaimed .. sounding shock ..... welll I told him ... lets go back and I'll tell you about it in the forum on Monday ...... .. just then a passing oil tanker saw us drifting and sent help for us ......<br><br>Althought it was like 2 am on a sunday morning when we arrived home, ... but I know that this would be, the mis adventure of my life time.<br></div>
