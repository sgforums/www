            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mourinho relies on past progress</span><br>JosÃ© Mourinho has won all five of his previous semi-finals as a manager<br><br>JosÃ© Mourinho is hoping his semi-final luck holds when his Chelsea FC team face Liverpool FC for a place in the UEFA Champions League final. Including four semi-final triumphs with previous club FC Porto, <span style="color: blue;">Mourinho has never lost at this stage of any competition and wants to prolong that record so his players avoid a repeat of last year's disappointment against AS Monaco FC. </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">Growing ego</span><br>The Chelsea manager joked that he arrived in England with a big ego, which is now even bigger because of the success he and his Premiership champions-elect have enjoyed. Nevertheless, he maintains that his wishes are irrelevant on Wednesday as the two English clubs go head to head.<br><br><span style="color: red;">'Fantastic situation'</span><br>Mourinho said: "I hope to do it [against Liverpool] more because of the players, more because of the club because they have never done it before and because of Mr [Roman] Abramovich and the way he has created this fantastic situation for Chelsea. I am not thinking about myself, I am thinking more about the players because they lost in the semi-final last year and I would like to make my little contribution to take them to Istanbul."<br><br><span style="color: red;">Three victories</span><br><span style="color: blue;">Chelsea have beaten Liverpool three times this season, once in the English League Cup final, twice in the Premiership</span>, and start as clear favourites. Mourinho says it does not worry him that he might be due a defeat and added that in this campaign he has already lost three matches Â– against Porto, FC Barcelona and FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen Â– which is more than normal.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Robben dilemma</span><br>His only selection poser is whether to start with winger Arjen Robben, who proved his fitness following an ankle injury in the win against Fulham FC last weekend. The Dutchman cannot last the full 90 minutes, so either starts and comes off, or is brought on at some stage from the bench. Mourinho has made a decision, but refused to reveal his plans.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Mourinho reflective</span><br>"The key is not to panic, not to think we have to win the first game at home," he added. "If we don't win, we don't win. We can then win the second game. I have never lost a semi-final in my life. One day I will have to, I know. Last year I was saying that I had never lost a final and then I went and lost the Portuguese Cup final."<br><br><span style="color: red;">Preparation essential</span><br>Liverpool manager Rafael BenÃ­tez denied that they had to win a psychological battle to turn the tide of Chelsea's domination. "We have played well in the last two games against them and we can win," he said. "It's not a question of psychology, it's a question of being prepared, playing well and being compact as a team. We have a good team and I think we have the confidence."<br><br><span style="color: red;">Measured approach</span><br>BenÃ­tez said his side would try to take a measured European approach rather than adopt a style typical of the Premiership, which is understandable given their success away from home in the Champions League. The clean sheet against Juventus FC at the Delle Alpi two weeks ago was hard to believe, considering the Reds' ten defeats away from Anfield in the Premiership.<br><br><span style="color: red;">BaroÂš back</span><br>There was relief in the fact that Milan BaroÂš was able to train last night. The Czech Republic striker damaged a knee last weekend against Crystal Palace FC and <span style="color: blue;">his absence would leave Liverpool severely short of attacking options with Fernando Morientes ineligible and Djibril CissÃ© still not fully match-fit after a broken leg.</span><br><br></div>
