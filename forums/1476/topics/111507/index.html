When you lost it, small memory lost less data and to buy back it will be cheaper.<br><br>argue over 128 and 256 is very Auntie, who can use a small memory and do the most things will score point, so the end result the management see is who can produce result not who has the rank to carry 256MB.<br><br>If you can produce better result with either 128 or 256MB is more than enough to disgrace her.<br><br></div>
