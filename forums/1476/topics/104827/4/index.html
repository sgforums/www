            <div class='col-md body'>IÂ’m just contributing my 2 cents<br><br>In a relationship it takes 2 hands to clap, if 1 party is not ready no matter is career or commitment is better not to make such a great decision.<br><br>You are pursuing your study and he is , for better future so that both can provide better life to your family. Are both of you sure you guys gonna make it? If both of you donÂ’t even know what is  in front of your why make such a decision?<br><br>Will you commit to something you need and not needed at the price of $2000 per month for your whole life before you can earn that much?<br><br>Which come first? Career come first or stable life? Do you want to raise a kid without providing good education, good environment?<br><br>I think you should make a decision that is can afford, can handle. You and him should be concentrating in studies and not just settling down without a stable job that can provide.<br><br>Learn this lesson and practice safe sex, I faced an opposite incident as yours before. I can have and afford but she donÂ’t want and not ready.  With your love one please learn to compromise with each other, you might Â“thinkÂ” you can make it but he might not think so, if you give birth to the child and he donÂ’t give the love to the baby donÂ’t you think is not fair to the baby? You want your child to question you WHY YOU GIVE BIRTH TO HIM/HER?<br><br>You have financial problem over studies, now you want to add on the problems. You are still young, there are much more difficulties in front of you . DonÂ’t make this a permanent mistake that affect your life, studies, career and family.<br><br>Now a days is different from Kampong life from the pass that kid grown up by themselves, if you and your bf canÂ’t even support yourself donÂ’t get 3rd parties involve.<br><br>Please donÂ’t just think what both of your wants and needs, what about the baby? Do you think he/she can accept what you / bf plan for him/her? You sure want to provide him / her the best you can but can you? With the baby can you do as good as you are without him/her?<br><br>Working more jobs mean less time for the baby, your life still not stable yet why create another surprise which you donÂ’t even know you can handle or not?<br><br>Grown up and look far, talking to your parents or bfÂ’s parents just solve partial of the problems, the most they can do is FORCE you guys to get married and take care of the kid, if that is what you and your bf wants, both of you wonÂ’t be worrying now.<br><br>If you give birth to a child and you canÂ’t give him the best that you can is as good as you are killing him/her.<br><br>FOS<br><br>Call me again or fix another day for coffee (not today)<br></div>
