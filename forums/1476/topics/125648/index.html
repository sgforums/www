            <div class='col-md body'>A man was walking across the road when he met with an accident. The impact was on his head which caused him to be in a coma for 2 days.<br><br>When he opened his eyes, his wife was by his side.<br>He told her (in tears), "When I was struggling with my studies in the University, I failed again and again. Sometimes I even have to re-take my papers. You were there by my side, encouraging me to go on trying."<br><br>She squeezed his hands as he continued, "When I went for major interviews and failed to clinch any of the jobs, you were there, cutting out the job ads for me to apply..."<br><br>He added, " ...then I started working in this little firm and finally got a big contract. I blew it because of a small mistake. But you are still there for me." His wife was in tears.<br><br>The man said, "I finally got a job after being laid off for quite some time. But I never seem to be promoted and my hard work was not recognised. I remained in the same position from the day I joined the company till now. You are still beside me..."<br><br>His wife's tears trickled down as she listened to him, "And now I met with an accident and when I woke up, you are here with me. There's something I'll really like to say to you..."<br><br>She flung herself on the bed and hug her husband, sobbing with deep emotion.<br><br>Finally her husband said, "I think you bring me bad luck."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">An announcement in Punjab Airways :</span><br>Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen. This is your very handsome captain Banta Singh welcoming you to Punjab Airways. Sorry we are four days late in taking off cos I had to do some overtime at the bakery. This is the one two six flight to New Delhi. We cannot guarantee that we will end up in Delhi but rest assured it will be some where in the East. And if you are very lucky we may even be landing on your village! A real Punjabi will land where he wants to, isn't that right brothers!<br><br>Today we have 12 passengers on the plane - which is a bit of a problem because we only have 5 seats! Hmmm.For safety reasons we will be counting all the passengers again during and after the flight. We have a very good record for safety. In fact We are so safe even the terrorists are afraid to fly with us! I am pleased to tell you that over 50% of our passengers end up at their destination. For those of you who don't make it, don't worry, our staff have lots of experience consoling the next-of-kin. If, however,you are still worried then ask Stewardess Bubbly to tell you about our out of court settlements. We will do everything to make your journey an enjoyable one and even a surviving one!<br><br>If our engines are too noisy for you, don't worry, we'll turn them off! We even make your fall to earth pleasant by serving complimentary tea during free-fall! And for our religious passengers, we are the only airline who can help you find out if there really is a God!  Sadly, today's in-flight movie will not be shown because my son forgot to record it from the television. But if you really want to see a film then we will be glad to fly next to Air India so that you can look at their movie through the window.<br><br>Although there is no-smoking in this aeroplane, you may find that during the light you can see smoke in the cabin. Don't worry your good minds over this! It is only the early warning system on the engines telling us to slow down! Yes, we are very advanced at Punjab Airways. Not only do we provide you with a life jacket but we also give a free bathing costume to the aunties and a swimming short to the uncles!<br><br>Some airlines are happy to fly thousands of feet over landmarks but not Punjab Airways! For your pleasure we try to get as close as possible for the best view. If, however, we go a little too close then please let us know. Our co-pilot sometimes becomes too enthusiastic.<br><br>Remember that guy who crashed into the White House, well it is the same bloke! Now kindly sit on your seat and tie your belt. For those of you who can't find a belt please tie your own leather belt to the door handle. And for those of you who can't find a seat, sit on your suitcase instead.<br><br>Byt the way, this is a recorded Message. Sorry, but I won't be flying with you today because I have to attend my nephew's wedding. But please make yourself at home and help yourself to the cockpit. Thank you for choosing Punjab Airways. We guarantee that we may not always take you on a flight but we'll definitely take you for a ride!"<br>HAVE A NICE JOURNEY ? ? ?<br><br></div>

"Please", says the woman. "I won't have that kind of language in this bank." "Well excuse me, but this fuckin' check ain't drawing any goddamned interest with you yappin' away about my language." "Sir, I don't have to take this abuse" she says. "Well then let's get the fuckin' manager okay? I mean what kind of shit is this I have to take from you?" The manager is summoned, and says "What seems to be the problem?" The woman says, "This man is using vulgar language and I won't stand for it." The man says "Hey alls I'm trying to do in this goddamned bank, for Christ's sake is deposit this fuckin' check for 15 million dollars." The manager looks at the check and then at the man and says "And this fuckin' bitch won't help you?"<br><br>Three hillbillies were sitting on the porch.

Yesterday I was in the kitchen and I saw her purse on the table. Everything was spilled out of it and there was a bunch of rubbers layin there... and she ain't even got a dick!"<br><br>A nerdy accountant is sent to jail for embezzlement and they put him in a cell with a huge evil looking guy.
