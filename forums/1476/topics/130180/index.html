            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to start with a joke first before I get into the real encounter.<br><br>This happens in the year 1990, Junction 8 is still under construction.<br>My friend and I were waiting for N.S and working part time.<br>My friend was on leave and came from Ang Mo Kio to my work place meeting me for dinner. His father has just passed away 1 months ago at that time.<br><br>When he first saw me that day he canÂ’t wait to tell me what he saw in the toilet  locate in  Ang Mo Kio Mrt Station.  He went in to the second last cubic, according to him the last cubic lamp is always spoil the lights is always blinking. Its in the afternoon he was wearing Sun glasses, he took out and put it on the floor and started his Â“businessÂ”.<br><br>While happily bombing , he see the reflection of the last cubical from his sun glass, a man is holding his manhood stroking it very very slowly . He look at it for quite sometime and rub his eye incase he see a wrong vision, why will ppl choose to use the last cubical where the rest are empty? Before he enter the second last cubical there is no one and he never heard anybody enter the last cubical.<br><br>Out of curiosity he bend down and look over the partition to confirm what he see. He was shock that actually there is nobody next door. He check his sunglass and confirm the person still there and he bend down and check again. Twice he checked and confirm what he see from the sunglass and he own eye is not match. All the mood of bombing gone, he quickly rush out the toilet and took the train to meet me.<br><br>We were talking about this the whole night in a coffee shop till 11 plus, we took the same train as he is staying in Ang Mo Kio and me in Bishan. While the train reaches Braddel , it was 11: 56pm, my friend tell me that there were people seeing headless passenger in the train from braddel to Bishan station. Both of us was so afraid and I was scolding him for reminding me about that and I have to walk across the dark quiet construction of Junction 8 as a short cut in 12 midnight.<br><br>This good friend of mine pass me photo  and he say Â“ DonÂ’t worry carry this photo with you and he will protect you all the way home. I take a close look at it and the photo looks familiar, I saw it during his father funeral. OMG!!!! I rejected and say no thanks, but he keep insist and ask me why not I just smile and reject but in my mind I hate him for showing me that photo. I alight the train and run a big round avoiding Junction 8 without stopping and looking around all the way home, because I was afraid I will meet an old men that looks like my friendÂ’s father I will sure faint right the way.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>4th encounter 2002<br>I had a 14Â” TV in my room for 2 years and I have been watching it very night before I sleep, when I get tired I will put the TV on Sleep mode.  That night as usual I when to bed about 11 plus, getting my position ready laying on bed  I switch the TV on with the remote by pressing sleep mode but it doesnÂ’t work. I thought it was my relative that  came to my house to do cleaning for me in the afternoon that switched it off. ( I was staying alone that time.) I wake up and check the  socket and the TV on/off switch. Everything is on. So I have no choice but to sleep early, I jumped back on my bed and sleep. Just about 5 Â– 10 minutes after I close my eye , I hear someone pressing my TV button on and of  slowly , and soon faster and faster. (Sound like checking why the TV is not on) It last for few minutes and it end with a slap on the TV plastic cover. I did not open my eye to see because I am very sure I am alone in the my bedroom and alone in the house, there is human besides me.<br></div>
