              <p>At hospitals and clinics, communicating the names of illnesses, explaining 
              the consent form for an operation, and other medical minutia can be a challenge 
              for staff, even when talking to a Japanese patient. When the patient is a 
              foreigner, the language barrier can magnify those challenges, which is where 
              medical interpreters come in.</p>
              <p>Medical interpreters aim to explain medical workers' intentions as precisely 
              as possible to patients, and in turn relate the patients' thoughts clearly to 
              Japanese doctors and nurses. In hospitals, where life and death decisions are 
              made by medical staff every day, these interpreters have a great role to play in 
              the welfare of foreign patients.</p>
              <p>"Look up, please," and "We're going to apply this gel," translates certified 
              foreigner supporter Mieko Shikayama, 65, for Brazilian patient Lidjane 
              Shimabukuro during an ultrasound exam of her thyroid. She stays close to 
              Shimabukuro, holding her hand as she relays the ultrasound technician's 
              directions in Portuguese.</p>
              <p>"Until now, even if I was in pain I'd just bear it," says Shimabukuro, who 
              until recently had had to hire a translator for medical checks out of her own 
              pocket. "There were no translators at the hospital, so I often couldn't go. This 
              is really amazing," she enthuses regarding the medical translation offered here 
              at Izumisano Municipal Hospital in Izumisano, Osaka Prefecture.</p>
              <p>"Even if you speak a little Japanese, you can't understand difficult words 
              like disease names or terms used in test results," says Shimabukuro's husband. 
              "It's such a relief that we can also say what we want to the doctors 
              clearly."</p>

              <p>The hospital is close to Kansai International Airport, and foreigners brought 
              in on emergencies are not uncommon. Thus, in fiscal 2006 the hospital 
              established an international outpatient facility, providing medical translation 
              in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Chinese. The facility provides examinations 
              by appointment, and medical interpreters and certified foreigner supporters -- 
              who aim to become medical interpreters -- are on standby from 9 a.m. to 3 
              p.m.</p>
              <p>The service is provided free of charge, and the hospital has been receiving 
              visits from patients even from outside the prefecture as word of the 
              interpreters spreads. The number of times the service has been used has been 
              rising, from 88 times in fiscal 2006 to 427 times in fiscal 2008.</p>
              <p>"There are different ways of thinking about medical care, depending on one's 
              culture and religion," says the hospital's head of health management Kaori 
              Minamitani, who also does interpreting in Spanish and Portuguese. "Medical 
              interpreting is very important in preventing problems."</p>
              <p>There are also entire regions in Japan that dispatch interpreters to medical 
              facilities with the support of non-profit organizations (NPO). For example, 
              local bodies in Kanagawa Prefecture have taken on the expense of providing 
              interpreters, provided by the NPO Multi-language Information Center (MIC). MIC 
              is cooperating with 17 medical institutions in the prefecture and, including 
              instances when the NPO has decided independently to dispatched interpreters, 
              their services were used 3,561 times last fiscal year. Furthermore, the NPO 
              Center for Multicultural Information and Assistance Kyoto provides interpreting 
              services to four hospitals in that city.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, such services are not available everywhere in the country. 
              Medical institutions are not duty-bound to provide interpreting services, and 
              the central government has no system in place to take on the cost of 
              interpreters as a part of medical expenses. Additionally, the ability of the 
              interpreters varies, and the question of compensation in cases where a 
              mistranslation causes serious problems remains, leading many institutions to 
              hesitate to provide interpreters.</p>
              <p>"Everyone has the right to an equal level of medical care," says Izumisano 
              hospital assistant director Mamoru Ito. "I hope that both medical institutions 
              and the government will work toward creating a system where foreigners can seek 
              care with peace of mind," he concludes.</p>
              <p>---</p>
              <p>The Mainichi also spoke to Izabel Arocha, president of the International 
              Medical Interpreters Association (IMIA) -- an organization affiliated with some 
              2,000 medical interpreters in 15 countries -- concerning the importance of 
              medical interpreters.</p>
              <p>"When most people think of interpreting, they think about conference 
              interpreting or business interpreting. They don't usually think about medical 
              interpreting. But that is the area where the most interpreters are needed all 
              around the world. The demand for this new specialization is much greater than 
              the supply of interpreters who are educated and qualified in (the medical) 
              setting. These are situations where a miscommunication or misinterpretation 
              could be the difference between life and death.</p>
              <p>"We're working hard now to standardize interpreter quality through 
              certification... and improving the working conditions of (qualified) 
              interpreters, so that they are able to stay in the field. This is difficult 
              because there are many, many interpreters.</p>
              <p>"(For example,) there are about 15,000-20,000 interpreters in the U.S. 
              working in the medical field, and their qualifications are diverse. Some of them 
              are highly qualified, highly-educated. Some have PhDs and they have a lot of 
              training in medical interpreting. And some are... without enough English 
              knowledge, and without enough training, because the need is so great. (However,) 
              we're very close to launching a national certification system (in the U.S.), the 
              first one in the world that is specifically for medical interpreting.</p>
              <p>"(Medical interpreting) is not new in Japan (but) you have to... increase 
              awareness of this issue. (However,) I think Japan is going in the right 
              direction. What I admire about Japanese is that they respect and value 
              education... and that is really key. I think it will make Japan... leap 
              ahead.</p>
              <p>"Health care is a right. If you want to have health care, you need to 
              communicate with the doctors, so communication is a right as well."</p>
