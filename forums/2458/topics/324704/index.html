              <p>Attended a 'traffic safety talk' a few days ago where the police officer gave a talk about safety while driving bicycles, bikes and cars, even though I don't drive the latter two.</p>
              <p>But anyway, during the talk, it was mentioned that cyclist are encouraged to cycle on the roads rather than on the pavement to prevent inconvenience or injury to the pedestrians. It was the first time I actually heard this sort of thing.</p>
              <p>How could cycling on the road be anywhere safer than cycling on the pavement? I thought getting knocked down by a bicycle would be better than being knocked down by a car...</p>
              <p>And there's cycling with the flow of traffic, which sounds illogical to be because cycling against the flow of traffic would actually allow you to see incoming cars...</p>

              <p>as usual, singaporean cyclists are also a bunch of a**holes and that's why pdesdestrians are against it.</p>
              <p>And singaporean pedestrians are also another bunch of a*hholes who walk like their grandfather's road even on cycling path, so fight lor.</p>
              <p>so in the end it's a bunch of a*holes against each others. nothing to do with whether cycling on road is safe or right anot.</p>

              <p>I find cycling on road is better (I cycle very frequently). If keep to left side of road and respect traffic rule, it is actually quite safe.</p>
              <p>It is wrong to cycle against the flow of traffic as bicycle is also consider a vehicle when on the road and should follow the traffic rule.</p>

              <p>where have you been all this while. just recently, a 50+ yr old cyclist was knock down by a car, and the cyclist died. you call this safe?</p>
              <p>yes, maybe a bicycle is a vehicle, but it definitely can't match up to the speed of the other vehicles on the road. look at east coast park, the maximum speed limit is 15kmh (assuming that you can even go that fast).</p>
              <p>on the road, the maximum speed limit is 50kmh -80kmh, depending on the road/ expressway. can a cyclist even go at that kind of speed to avoid being crash into? even those electric bikes can only go at slightly above 20kmh. they are certainly no match for those automobiles on the road.</p>

              <p>U r spot on!!,  bull's-eye on your take of this cycling problem.  I would like to add in a little:  generally it's **holes vs **holes &amp; these **holes r usually wannabes young punks, ah bengs &amp; mat sallehs.  However there r people who will be considerate, reasonable with a sense of give &amp; take &amp; hopefully this group will grow from strength to strength in time to come.</p>
