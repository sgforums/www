              <p>By right, cyclists are supposed to only cycle on the newly created bicycle paths and on the road only, but it is obvious that most people don't really care about it.</p>
              <p>Since you are just starting to learn cycling, I suggest you try cycling in less crowded parks and those areas specially set up for cyclists under the guidance of an experienced cyclist. This is to ensure that you will not meet any mishaps or get into trouble by crashing into others.</p>

              <p>Yes, on the road with the car.</p>
              <p>DO NOT try that for now, as you still have plentiful to learn.</p>
              <p>It is not illegal not to use helmets, but since you are a new cyclist, you should get not only a helmet, but also some elbow pads and knee pads to protect yourself against unneeded injuries.</p>

              <p>Yes, cyclist should go on road. If you want to ride on pavement, try to slow down and give way to pedestrian. I am a frequent cyclist too and I think it is relatively safe to cycle on the road if you observe the traffic rules and ride defensively (always keep left, look out for other vehicles, and be extra careful when you are near junction).</p>
              <p>But if you are a new cyclist, I suggest you ride on the pavement first and go on the road when you are more confident.</p>

              <p>   When you learn , try to learn in a park or some footpath with nobody in sight or little pple walking ard . With or without anyone to help is optional , as i learn it by myself alone after numerouse near crashes . As i myself also used to ride on the road last time , i had my fair share of near accident including 1 which i nearly got run over by a bus and also another 1 nearly crash into the side of a car while speeding to catch up with my friends near somerset rd as they rode past a yellow light sending me braking hard and skidding and then stopped at the middle divider finally with a furiouse thumping heart .</p>
              <p>   No mater where you chose to ride , you HAVE to be responsible for your own safety as blaming pple after your crash is pointless and you may not even have the breath to argue also if it is fatal . Always remember that don't expect the motorist to be able to see you as many accidents invlove cars and motorcycles and the car driver can say that they never see the motorcycles . If that is the case , do you think they will see you ? Follow traffic rules also even though you are riding a bicycle use the rules of pedestrain if you are ever in doubt . Last but not least gain experiences sometimes they can tell you more then words can tell .</p>
