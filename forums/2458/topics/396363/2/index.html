              <p>Also, im not as idiotic as you are. If a car honks at me whilst i am cycling, i would give way. If not the car would have every right to run me over. Imagine that a group of cyclist refusing to give way on the road to a car behind them. Thats like you, you retard.</p>

              <p>You are assuming that everybody in Singapore is as stupid as you. Apparently you have never driven before or knew anything about singapore's driving culture..</p>
              <p>Nobody in their right sense of mind (unless if it is the above idiot) would want to run anybody over. Even if it wasnt the driver's faults it would also be very troublesome because of all the investigations that need to be done and not to mention the grief that any normal human being would felt for taking away th life of another human being (unless the person is worse than a beast like the idiot.)</p>
              <address>Hey. I hope that the day when your grandparents/parents (and yourself when you are a frail old man) are too old and slow to react to the bell ringing of the cyclists..Those cyclists you met would be just like YOU.. RUN your grandparents/parents and yourself over... HAHA. Do go and visit your grandparents/parents later in the hospital and tell them right in their face that <strong>"Why didn't you give way to the bicycle when the cyclist rang the bell at you..  The cyclist has the every right to run you over."</strong> Sounds familiar right? Haha...</address>

              <p>In bishan, there are many cyclists that uses the walkways. I have nothing against 99% of them, cause they signal and when we give way, they say "thanks", and we nod our heads.</p>
              <p>But the 1% is spoiling everything. They come real close to you, ring their bell, and "tsk tsk" if U don't move fast out of their way.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, we just come back from NTUC, with heavy stuffs, and pushing a stroller with our youths, how to move fast? Once, they even almost hit my pregnant wife, and gives me the "tsk tsk" and rude stare. I really wanted to push a stick into their wheels, see what happens next, but the good nature in me just ignore.</p>
              <p>while to most, it is a chicken and egg thingy, I feel that if there are crowded walkways, cyclists should alight and push their bikes. Just a short 5m, and the cyclists should be able to go about their way. Not a big deal, right?</p>

              <p>Cannot be like that lah....its so impractical to dismount and re-mount everytime a cyclist see people....Do u know how many times it has to be done? Maybe more than 20 times for a relatively short distance.</p>
              <p>I do slow down, in fact, I slow down until very slow, everytime I see people. But dismounting is not neccessary I think.</p>

              <p>Some cyclists that I encountered are so damn rude... Me and a few people were walking on a narrow pedestrain walkway then one idiotic cyclist behind us kept 'ringing' us like trying to force us to give way. Mind you, the above mentioned incident did not happen at Tampinese. </p>
