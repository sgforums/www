              <p>Some cyclists that I encountered are so damn rude... Me and a few people were walking on a narrow pedestrain walkway then one idiotic cyclist behind us kept 'ringing' us like trying to force us to give way. Mind you, the above mentioned incident did not happen at Tampinese. </p>
              <p>I did not give a damn and continued walking slowly... He got no choice but to wait behind me..</p>

              <p><br>Consideration has to go both ways. Were the cyclist being considerate when he rang his bell impatiently to force and intimidate pedestrian into giving ways when the pedestrian was supposed to have the rights of way on the pedestrian walkway?</p>
              <p>What he should have done on that NARROW walkway was to alight and to push his bicycle. Not to continue cycling on it and sounding the bell at pedestrian, expecting others to give way... Giving way to him might just gave him the flawed idea that he has the rights of way when he dont...  It's the attitude that matters. If he had alighted and pushed his bicycle.. I would surely have given way to him if he was to say 'excuse me'. But no way would I give way if he just expects me to give way so that he can conveniently and comfortably carrying on with his cycling... This is so dangerous. What if somebody got knocked down or got injured when the cyclist tried to squeeze through the crowd? </p>

              <p>Perhaps i will have reacted the same way if i am in a bad mood, and some annoying cyclist comes and keep ringing his bell. Normally if cyclist rings the bell, just give way . No cyclist will alight and push his bike past you anyway</p>

              <p>Then maybe it is more a case of attitude / mannerism.</p>
              <p>It is the same, like if a person who walks (pedestrian) is saying "excuse me" nicely, or whether he is saying "excuse me" with loud volume and being pushy.</p>
              <p>It is not really whether it is right or not right for a cyclist to be on the pathway.</p>
              <p>The problem is....there is no cycling path....</p>
              <p>So he either go to the road...or onto the pathway.....but really, both of these scenarios are not optimum.</p>

              <p>From experience MOST heavy vehicles and MOST taxis don't give chance even to drivers. So far only had 1 incident where a taxi driver kept trying to squeeze me off the road. As for vehicles "flying" by, I try to anticipate it so that I don't get surprised. </p>

              <p>The times whereby I hear cyclists ringing their bell is when they are riding crazily on the pavement. But face it, pedestrian pavement is not a place for bikes. No matter how fast people walk, its still slower then a bike.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>@TTFU<br>Its a rule to wear helmet on the road. Never wear will kena fine if TP spot you. Not sure if normal patrol officer will catch you. Headlights and tail lights are mandatory for night cycling, day time I'm not very sure but I have them installed all the time. </p>

              <p>Then maybe it is more a case of attitude / mannerism.</p>
              <p>It is the same, like if a person who walks (pedestrian) is saying "excuse me" nicely, or whether he is saying "excuse me" with loud volume and being pushy.</p>
              <p>It is not really whether it is right or not right for a cyclist to be on the pathway.</p>
              <p>The problem is....there is no cycling path....</p>
              <p>So he either go to the road...or onto the pathway.....but really, both of these scenarios are not optimum.</p>

              <p>You were right in saying that there was no cycling path. This implies that roads were originally designed (in the case of singapore) for pedestrian and drivers. Not cyclists. It is just like the case of FTs influx into Sg. Should we change our lifestyle to adapt to FTs or the other way round?</p>
              <p>I wont insist that cyclist cycle on the main road. I drive too and I must say that I hate cyclist on the road. Just like what you have mentioned, they are actually viewed as pariah by many car drivers.. Especially if they were to hog up an entire lane or worse.. I have seen PRCs and Banglas driving against traffic flow! They were cycling towards me!!</p>
              <p>Nobody can have the best of both worlds. By cycling, cyclist already saved a great deal of money (compared to car owners) and time (compared to pedestrians). It is expected of cyclist to be understanding and not invading into the rights of pedestrians like sounding bell aggressively etc... If one day someone were to get killed (maybe elderly) after getting knocked down by cyclist.. This might forced govt to ensure that cyclists cycle only the on main road..</p>
              <p>By then cyclists can have a taste of their own medicine... This time they will be honked at by faster moving and larger vehicle (cars, lorry, bus etc)... When that day comes that I shall ask the same cyclist how he felt...</p>
              <p>I feel that cyclists should be made to go for official test before they are allowed to cycle in the public.. be it main roads or pedestrian crossings.. (That excludes recreational area that's meant for cycling!). This ensures that they know basic traffic rules and some basic ethics pertaining to cycling..  </p>

              <p>Also, im not as idiotic as you are. If a car honks at me whilst i am cycling, i would give way. If not the car would have every right to run me over. Imagine that a group of cyclist refusing to give way on the road to a car behind them. Thats like you, you retard.</p>
