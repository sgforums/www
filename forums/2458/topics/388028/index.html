              <p>I parked my Raleigh M20 at the bicycle lot at Tampines Library with 2 x
              CCTV pointing at the area at 1045am this morning - 14/01/2010. Locked
              with 2 locks, one at front and one at the back wheel. Coming back after
              20 minutes of errand running and my bike with both locks was missing.
              Asked the library staff whether I can view the CCTV recording and was
              told to lodge a police report....
              Did that at Pasir Ris Police Post at drive 6.
              Don't think I will see my ride again..
              Beware of pro bike thief around that area....</p>

              <p>Raleigh M20 is a moderately attractive target for bike thieves (I use that model too), so you need to be more careful with it. Unfortunately bike lots seem to be good targets for thieves as it provides them a legit reason to be near your bike for a longer period of time to tamper with the lock. Cameras don't seem to deter them that much.</p>
              <p>Parking your bike in plain sight near a hawker centre with a lot of human traffic will make your bike less appealing to the thief. If possible, use a U-lock when you can... esp those without the round key. These locks have to be picked or pried apart, so they provide considerably more hassle to the thief.</p>
              <p>A strong chain probably works better then those cable locks as well, which are at best just to prevent opportunistic thief... but a determined thief will not really be detered by them and in fact I even accidently broke one just by pulling on it! U locks and chains add considerable weight to your bike thou, but since u are using it for an errand and not like going sport riding I think it's worth the extra weight.</p>
              <p>All the best with your future biking activities... remember no lock will stop the most determined thief, but you can take measures to make your bike far less appealing to them. The whole thief situtation in Singapore is what is keeping me from getting too ex a bike.</p>

              <p>Another possibility is to hide your bike in an ulu area that makes it hard to see by many people... cover it with a bike cover if you can.</p>
              <p>The downside to this is that if the thief decides to target your bike, he has a lot more cover to steal it. But generally thiefs cruise areas where many bikes are parked and try to spot an easy target.<br>Bike alarms might work as well, but I don't see them being sold around. An alarm going off in a crowded area will certainly make a thief think twice about messing with your bike.</p>
              <p>And oh ya, remember your frame number and check out theives' market... chances are your bike might have gone there but you prolly have to buy it back -___-</p>
