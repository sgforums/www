            <div class='col-md body'>Forgot to add:<br><br>1)On the very 1st day which I bought my very first MTB (Giant Yukon Disc ), my friend and I went cycling at MacRitchie reservoir.<br><br>Was my 1st time riding offroad with my own bike(too used to riding sentosa's rental bikes le ) , so I'm not very good at controlling it.<br><br>As I was going downhill, a bunch of monkeys suddenly appeared at the bottom of the track! I skidded as I did an "E brake " and fell sideways off the bike. Heng I grabbed on to a tree root and did not join the bike as it tumbled down the slope. The monkeys screeched loudly as they dodged my bike.<br><br>I escaped with a few scratches on my left elbow and forearms. Mild bleeding.<br><br>2) Riding behind a friend at East Coast Park... suddenly , the kid in front did a on-the-spot U turn with his bike. My friend did an E-brake...I couldn't stop in time and rammed hard into him. I wasn't hurt... but my friend had a huge bruise on his back as my aero bar kana him.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Got one time, after the rain stop, I went out to cycle and cycle at top speed. While making a turn, the bike skidded. Lady Luck on me that time, never fell down.<br><br>Got another time cycle downhill, couldn't apply brakes in time and buang the lamp post.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Still, another time fell into the drain. Underestimated the space between the bike and the drain, that's why fell into it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>The next one happened at car park. Lost my balance and fell of my bike. Scrapped my right arm and there's still a scar.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The worst one is after I change my spectacles. I think I can't get use to the new pair of glasses, buang into a bus stop bench. Scare the people in the bus stop.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Other accidents include almost getting strike by lightning (lightning strike behind the rear just when I chiong past the traffic light), almost falling into the drain (still noob at that time).<br><br>Enough accidents to last me a lifetime hor?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah.... u guys had just jogged my memory!<br><br>Here are some more of my past accidents and near accidents !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>1) Was at Traffic light with friend at Zion Road (opp Joo Huat bike shop ) . When the green man appeared, I waited till  traffic on the 1st lane  stopped(there's a Merc rather far away in the 2nd lane )  before inching my bike forward. Suddenly , my friend (next to me ) yelled "OEI! " I jammed the brakes, turned around and asked "What ? "<br><br>A Split second later, the stupid merc on the 2nd lane screeched to a halt ONE CAR's LENGTH over the stop line!<br><br>Had my friend not yelled at me, I would had been knocked down that day. The driver didn't even wind down his window to apologize.. simply looked around in a haughty manner! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>I gave his bonnet a punch as I rode pass while my friend glared at him.<br><br>The screeching of tires was so loud dat even the Joo Huat boss came out to take a look!<br><br>2) Was cycling home from the west after the rain and was travelling along Chinatown. When I was outside Funan, a bangala Jaywalker suddenly jumped onto the road. As I couldn't brake in time, I slammed into him and we both fell to the road. I (and my bike ) landed on the Bangala so I wasn't hurt.<br><br>But the Bangala had a bruise on his right leg. I stayed back and calmed him down as several kaypos gathered around to stare at us. No one helped the Bangala up and I had to do so before picking my bike up from the road.<br><br>10 mins later, the Bangala felt better after some stretching. I gave him some plasters for the scratches he suffered.   Bangala forgave me as he said he was the one at fault for suddenly jumping onto the road (he wanted to cross the road )<br><br>My handlebar got misaligned... went to GHC later on to get it fixed.<br><br>3) was at ECP riding with my cousin. Cousin tailgating me....<br><br>We are riding on the cycle path outside the mac..when a kid on a kick scooter suddenly swerved into my lane. I applied the front brakes a little too hard and did a  very high "Stoppie " . My cousin who's behind me slammed his face into my rear wheel. Both of us fell to the ground. I had a few scratches. My cousin had scratches, a cut lip and a bleeding nose....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Somehow, just wish kids are off the park. They are really reckless. The last time I went East Coast to cycle, I was cycling at a very slow speed. One kid (around 5 years old, I guess), roller blade his way and bang the rented bike. I already siam all the way to the corner of the cycling path, and he just roller bladed his way right into me. Can't move to the other side, there's another cyclist. Luckily I am only cruising, if not bang him real hard to give him a lesson.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
