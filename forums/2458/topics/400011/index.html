              <p>These days, cyclists using the walking pathway are getting aggressive. they think they should have the right of way and behaved as though the walkway is their's.</p>
              <p>Last night I was walking on a pathway and then I heard a cyclist horn not once but repeatedly for a good 10 seconds. There was enough space for him to move ahead of me, so I just kept walking. I dunno why the heck the cyclist horn and horn until I was pissed off I shouted at him kao peh lar. he then cycled past me and then stop, then finally continue his cycle, dunno why the fark he need to horn at me when there was space for him to cycle past me. When I saw he stopped his bicycle and wanted to confront me, I was ready. I wanted to tell him, which walkway is he riding on, cyclist or pedestrian walkway and I have to give way to him when there is space for him to cycle past me, its not like there wasnt any space for him to cycle past me. This is not the first time and certainly not the last time I have encountered these idiotic cyclists. I seriously dunno what I will do to them if they actually dare to hit me one day or provoked me as such.</p>

              <p>one fine day the same thing is going to happen to cyclists and pedestrians...just a matter of when.</p>

              <p>As a cyclist, I object to your anti-cyclist racism and discrimination.</p>
              <p>Let me address the issue of the "proper place" for cycling.</p>
              <p>First,</p>
              <p>Cyclists who cannot find dedicated cycling path, need to decide to go onto either the pathway / broadway, or on the road.</p>
              <p>If we go to the pathway, pedestrians like you curse us.</p>
              <p>If we go to the road, motorists would curse us.</p>
              <p>It seems that we are a vulnerable group and marginalized and discriminated by everyone.</p>
              <p>First let me remind you we are also human beings.</p>
              <p>I object to your generalization and sweeping statements. As if all cyclists should be condemned as a class of people, due to the action of 1 individual.</p>
              <p>You just had a bad experience stemming from the action of one seemingly impatient person. But that doesnt mean that you can use this incident to advance your anti-cyclist hate agenda.</p>
              <p>Let me remind you I myself personally never do such things, and I think many cyclists are well-behaved too.</p>
              <p>Looking at pedestrians, I can condemn your class too........I can say you always jaywalk, cross the street haphazardly, or such things.......but I dont do that because it is stupid and immature, and it shows your smallness.</p>

              <p>Legally-speaking...unless U are in Tampines...U go on the road.No need to choose.</p>
              <p>however...I do understand that it is dangerous to be on the road...so...cyclists...when U are illegally using the walkways...pls ride carefully and leave your "king-of-the-walkway" attitude by the roadside...</p>

              <p>Why should it be logical that cyclists should go to the road...?</p>
              <p>Legal and illegal I dont know. It may be stemming from archaic law and obselete legislation. What I know is that traffic police never arrest me for cycling on pathway. There is indeed a need to develop a more equitable and fair system, one where all users can have peace, stability, and comfort. This cannot be achieved by pushing cyclists here and there.</p>
              <p>We are not ping-pong balls.</p>
              <p>Anyways, on the issue of discourtesy and such,</p>
              <p>This is the issue of discourtesy or impatience, and I agree 100% that all people should behave in a civil manner. However, when one encounters an uncivilized person, and then generalize one whole group of people to bear responsibility for the action, then he is being uncivilized himself.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>A law that is seldom enforced does not make it non-enforceable.All it takes is someone willing to take the time and effort to do it...and if the cyclist is showing his attitude on the pedestrian walkway...then that someone might just come along.</p>
              <p>Pedestrians are not ping-pong balls as well....which brings us back to the same old starting point isnt it...which I feel is the attitude of all using the walkway...not just the act of cyclists using the pedestrian walkway per se.</p>

              <p>I have no problems with cyclists on the pavements. I just refuse to give way to them when I am already on the side of the pavement, not in the centre. So I ignore all the bells/horns coming from behind or in front of me. So far I've collided with a few, some of whom fell down. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, I do not recommend this approach for small skinny people. You need to be of a certain mass to be able to brace for impact.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And yes, most of the cyclists I encountered are assholes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I dunno what's with the cyclists these days, horn and horn all the time, even though there are spaces for them to pass thru. even if there are no space for them to go thru, its because there are many pedestrians on the pathway and its designed for pedestrians only.</p>
              <p>cyclists, I suggest you ride slow and be patient, see if the pedestrian move to one side and give way to you. if they do not give way to you, just wait and dun bloody horn at them because this is not the cyclists pathway. who has the right of way first, pedestrians or cyclists?</p>
              <p>Once I saw a cyclist hurtling towards me at a great speed, I just stood still and stay rooted at the spot. I felt like raising my leg up to give the cyclist a kick damn.</p>
