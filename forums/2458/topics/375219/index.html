              <p>I'm not sure if this is the correct place to post. If it isnt, then just lock this topic.</p>
              <p>I observed that many cyclists on the roads are becoming more and more xialan(cocky). As a BC, and also a cyclist myself, having the absolute right of way doesnt mean you can do anything u like n blame vehicles for everything.</p>
              <p>Just this morning, i was driving my bus along a road where speed is fast n traffic is heavy. I encountered two cyclists, let me call them A and B. A was ahead of B throughout the time when i saw them. Because traffic is fast n heavy, and the two of them were travelling in a line, it was hard to overtake them.(i hope my explanation is clear, if it isnt please let me know)</p>
              <p>My first attempt to overtake them: I reached the side of B but i needed to enter the bus stop so i stopped n gripped my steering wheel tightly so i wont turn into B. B waved at me for giving way to him. No problem with that.</p>
              <p>Second attempt is the main problem. The traffic is fast n heavy n many cars were behind me. A and B were in front of me but i couldnt overtake due to the traffic. I was travelling like 25km/h or even less(not that certain as i cant look at speedometer at this kind of situation). After a while i finally had a chance to overtake, so i moved ahead of them, open left signal for vehicles behind as a bus stop is near. But as i was beside A, A picked up speed so i gripped my steering wheel tightly (so i wont turn him into the kerb) n stopped. A shouted 'OEI' rudely and kept on hitting my bus even though i didnt turn my steering. I was GIVING WAY to him as i saw him pick up speed. He even came to my front windscreen and stopped to make some rude gesture. I just stare back at him unhappily. After that, A and B sped off, A kept turning n make some hand gesture which i wasnt interested to look at. B didnt do anything.</p>
              <p>My point is, is it so difficult to stop or slow down a BICYCLE? Many times i also encounter bangla cyclists near bus stops n most are kind enough to slow down, keep to the side to check my reaction before moving ahead, no bad behaviours exchanged between us. As a cyclist myself as well, i know i will be hogging traffic behind, so if i realise vehicles trying to get ahead of me, i will let them pass more easily. They give way to me, i give way to them. Roads will be more courteous. Is bicycle so difficult to slow down compared to car or bus?</p>
              <p>I will explain more if required :)</p>

              <p>They may be dangerous, but I actually pity those who are cycling. A lot of times it has been said on the TV that cyclists causes a danger to pedestrains on the paths (and I do agree when they speed along the paths) and that they should use the road instead. Then the road is full of vehicles that poses a threat to them because they are bigger and faster. Seriously, the cyclists don't have a place that belongs to them to cycle until recently the bicycle lanes are built (but they are not everywhere)</p>
              <p>Just my thoughts though ... ...</p>

              <p><br>I fully agree with you.</p>
              <p>Actually if you prefer to cycle slowly, keeping to the pavement is much safer. It may be illegal, but i think not much has been done by authorities to keep them off the pavements, so use it if you can. I believe pedestrians have a higher level of tolerance towards cyclists compared to drivers on the roads, where potential dangers are more. BUT having said that, give way to pedestrians as much as possible when on pavements. Slow down or possibly stop when near a pedestrian. Avoid ringing the bell to demand the right of way, as it's still THEIR road(as some pedestrians might think). In fact, avoid ringing the bell as much as possible. Say thank you if pedestrians let you pass.</p>
              <p>But from my observation, most cyclists keep on ringing the bell to demand right of way. But they are angry when drivers horn them on the roads.</p>
              <p>Very often, when i let passengers board and alight at bus stops, cyclists will keep on ringing the bell to prevent the alighting passengers from getting in their way. They also expect the boarding passengers to let them pass before boarding. Like i said, is it so difficult to slow down a bicycle? :)</p>

              <p>Actually the govt shd ban cyclists from the roads. A bicycle vs killing car machines on the road......what the hell. And they cant even match the speeds of cars. Cyclists on the roads should have their own seperate lane but that's another matter altogether.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Twice these banglas almost lost balance and fell right in front of me. I could have killed them. Overtaking them is another problem and if I can't do it because the lane's too narrow, I road hog. :(</p>

              <p><br>I agree! I am a commuter in bicycle. Those cyclist flout the rule or law. Just ran over them. They deserve it.</p>
              <p>Like those bangala or China man ride in side by side. Run over them.</p>
              <p>Those riding center of the lane for no reason. Just ram them</p>
              <p>But to ban all cyclist is absurd. I see too many bad driver on road. Shall we ban all bus and car?  Car and bus are a real hazard. Don't u think?</p>
              <p>Usually I saw lots of impatient driver. When I am already very near junction still die die want to speed up and want to cut in front me. SBS bus too. Near bus stop still want to cut. Slow 1-2 seconds will die , is it? </p>

              <p><strong>My point is, is it so difficult to stop or slow down a BICYCLE?</strong> Many times i also encounter bangla cyclists near bus stops n most
              are kind enough to slow down, keep to the side to check my reaction
              before moving ahead, no bad behaviours exchanged between us. As a
              cyclist myself as well, i know i will be hogging traffic behind, so
              if i realise vehicles trying to get ahead of me, i will let them
              pass more easily. They give way to me, i give way to them. Roads
              will be more courteous. Is bicycle so difficult to slow down
              compared to car or bus?</p>
              <p>I will explain more if required :)</p>

              <p>In certain cases, yes it is. May I assume you are an SBST/SMRT bus captain/service leader?</p>
              <p>I was cycling along Sims Ave between Eunos and Kembangan MRT stations. Vehicles from the side lanes have just cut across me even though I am about 20m away from the junction. Naturally, I braked. Luckily no vehicle was behind me or else I may have been dead. My bike skidded as the wheels locked and the front tyre almost went into the gutter. If I braked normally, I would have crashed into his side.</p>
              <p>Another incident along Jln Eunos. A taxi cut in 2 lanes and went straight into the car park. Same thing, brake hard. Nothing happened here. Luckily the BC behind me slowed down together or else, splat.</p>
              <p>However, if I do see impending danger in front of me, I will slow down. I follow the "Give Way to Buses" scheme, although some BCs do signal me to pass first. I slow down at intersections after that Kembangan incident.</p>
              <p>But one thing stands: <strong>We are faster than you think and our brakes aren't as "power" as a motorbike.</strong></p>
              <p>----------</p>
              <p>To add on: The road is our designated path. If you pass by Mandai, Upp Changi Road East, you'll see road signs saying "Cyclists Ahead". A fine of $30 will be imposed if we are found cycling on pavements (although I haven't seen or heard of anyone being fined yet). It's common sense for us to keep safely nearest to the left. The black sheep take up the whole lane to themselves.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>There are both good and bad motorists as well as cyclists. The worst motorists are those rude, reckless and tailgate others dangerously at high speed. The worst cyclists are those that thought they own the road and cycle dangerously, assuming the role of motorists (they cycle on the road), and on red light switch into the role of pedestrians unexpectedly and sped across red traffic lights (or zebra crossing). I've seem plenty of these cyclists (mostly foreigners, though not necessarily, sorry I'm hope I'm not generalising) that zoomed past zebra without waiting for motorist to stop, crossing causing motorists to brake suddenly. Plenty of them in Jurong industrial estates. </p></div>
