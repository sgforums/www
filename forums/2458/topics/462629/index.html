              A week ago, I kenna summoned for cyling across a pedestrian crossing by a traffic cop.
              
              
              They say it is not safe. But what is their problem? The crossing is completely empty, only me, no one else. 
              Then they say I must push bike across Traffic Light also. Singapore got so many traffic light, if must stop and push every light, then why cycle? Waste money build park connector somemore.
              
              Then got cyclists cycle across the crossing at the opposite traffic light, but they dont care.
              
              Plz lah, If you want to anyhow enforce the law, then dont enforce at all.
              
              Who is the stupid idiot who create such a stupid law? So what if ride bicycle? So long as you dont have two feet on the walkway then not a pedestrain meh? Then what about wheelchair people? Even cycle slowly not enough for the traffic warden.
              
              They say its not safe, can knock down ppl. Lol. We blind or what? If you look out for people then wont knock them down. 
              
              Worse still, the law  allow car to  zoom across pedestrian crossing at 20kmh. And cars to turn in the direction of green man when got people crossing. Same what?  If car driver never look properly they still can knock down people. Bicycle knock down pedestrian, pedestrain get bruise. Car knock down pedestrain, pedestrian die. 
              
              But car can cross pedestrian crossing at 20kmh, cyclist must cross at 5kmh (walking speed). Stupid rite? Might as well say that car cannot exceed walking speed when going past traffic light.

            <div class='col-md body'>As a pedestrian, cyclist, Class 2A motorcyclist and Class 3 driver for over 25yrs, I feel that the current rule requiring cyclists to dismount and push bike across every pedestrian crossing is too stringent to be followed by majority. I hardly see it being done. Authorities shud consider review allowing cyclists to push bike (no peddling allowed, just push ground) without the inconvenience of dismounting...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Then more cyclists will follow the rule and roads become safer. Don't know if others agree? BTW how much is the fine for cycling across pedestrian crossings? Touch wood hvn't kn b4...</div>

              <p>How do you know that becoz of that incident, cars cannot see bicycles clearly? Whats wrong with bicycles that make cars cannot see them clearly?</p>
              <p>Motorcycles have accidents with car many times a year but you cannot say that that is because cars can not see them clearly.</p>
              <p> Besides, if car knock down the cyclist then why is it cyclist fault and cyclist must slow down? Should be the car fault, so car must slow down at zebra crossing or crossing the traffic light mah. If car slow down to 5kmh walking speed, then it can brake instantly. No problem. Even if it hit, will  only be minor.</p>
              <p>Obviously, because traffic light and zebra crossing is longer than wide, it is more incovienience to cyclist to push than car to slow down. To get across  crossing, car only need to slow for a few sec. To push bicycle across traffic light take over a minute.</p>

              <p>Blindspot is just a blindspot.  pedestrain can be in the blind spot as well, so why are they allowed to cross the road just to get into the blindspot and knock down?</p>
              <p>Im just saying the law is unfair because it discriminates against bicycles. </p>
