              <p>Hi likedatosocan,</p>
              <p>I believe that most areas have a path for people to walk on, and another path for cyclists to cycle on.</p>
              <p>However, if there is no cycling path, the legal thing to do will be to cycle on the road. It is highly advisable to keep to the roadside though, as you never know when a reckless driver will knock you down.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi Ldoc,</p>
              <p>We, the citizens of singapore, are well brought up to "just follow lor(law)", so in this case the law states that:</p>
              <p><strong>Cyclists are no longer allowed to cycle on "footways", unless you are cycling in Tampines.</strong> (Refer to the link below on how "fine" this ruling is)</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1027177/1/.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1027177/1/.html</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hence, a quick answer to your query is  (when cyling at non-tampinese area):</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Cycle on the road only (that means conforming to the rules of drivers and motorists: signalling when you are changing lanes, installing the necessary lightings, be familiar with bus lane timings etc, not forgetting your parking coupons)</li>
              <li>When on "footways", dismount immediately and push the godamn bicyle.</li>
              </ol>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope this clarifies matters.</p>
              <p>By the way why is this thread under Sports?</p>

              <p>it is easier for non-cyclist to ask cyclist to cycle only on road</p>
              <p>why not put yourself into shoes of cyclists?</p>
              <p>many a time, being a cyclist on road, i have to give way to taxi stopping abruptly infront of me to pick up a passenger; endure multiple close shaves with cars zipping pass me( leaving so little space, and at times, i can almost touch their side mirrors) at high speed and risk falling down and getting rolled over by the car behind and cars that do not check their blind spot or just cut abruptly into the extreme left lane which im in, only to slow down to almost a complete stop before turning into the side road. hey! its not so courteous to force a cyclist riding at 30 over kmh to slow down suddenly. i have seen many cyclists endo ( flipped forward) because of this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i have to admit that some cyclists are too much when they are speeding on pavement or riding recklessly. these are just minorities,so dont not pin the blame on the whole cycling community. so as to speak reckless behaviour, it seems like many road motorist are much reckless as their actions can cause more damage.</p>
              <p><br>why not educate the motorist to practice road courtesy ( like signalling/ checking blindpsots/ leaving ample space when encountering a cyclist on road)? if the road is much more safer, i'm sure much more cyclists are more than willing to cycle on road.=)</p>

              <p>That is not a suggested reason... The rule has really been around for many years already.</p>
              <p>It is because of the increased amount of bicycle-pedestrians accidents, that this rule is brought up and reminded to the public again.</p>
              <p>Even if you complain and rant to me and the other forummers , there is nothing I can do. If you want, complain to the government instead...</p>

              <p>Actually the rule has been around for donkey years.</p>
              <p>While it is illegal to cycle on the footpaths, the traffic police generally turn a blind eye to cyclists who are not cycling recklessly and will only catch those who are quite obviously riding unsafely.</p>
              <p>Just go around, if the TP was really clamping down, they would literally have thousands of people to catch, not to mention it isn't really hard to drive around for more then a few moments before you spot people cycling on the footpath.</p>
              <p>While it is written in law, it is one of those rules that the TP will enforce depending on the situtation... if the amount of complains on cyclists on the footpath goes up, they will then start to clamp down on it... but I don't think their intention is to stop cyclists from using the footpath, but rather to weed out reckless cyclists. Personally I have ridden on the footpath in the prescence of Traffic Police and they didn't pay me any further notice.</p>
              <p>But use your common sense... if you see people on the footpath, use your bell and don't speed. Also don't zip past them at high speed and do unsafe things... cyclists have been sharing the footpath with pedestrians for years and there hasn't been too much of an issue if cyclists respect those who are walking. Unfortunately some jokers just don't do that and that's where the problem starts.</p>
              <p>But riding on Singapore roads? I think your life is worth more then a $20 dollar fine. I just think the problem is not just with drivers, but with the fact that Singaporeans in general have no space for the humble bicycle in their minds as a valid form of transport, and hence act as if there isn't a need for them.</p>
              <p>The current road environment is simply too unfriendly for safe riding, esp. for the mother who is ferrying her kid back on her bicycle (you expect her to ride on the road?) or the uncle riding his flying pigeon. What about a young secondary school boy? Ban everything? Limit cycling only to the parks?</p>
              <p>But frankly I think more harm will be done trying to force cyclists to stick to the roads. The problem with trying to pass hard-and-fast rules is that they don't really solve the issues. Singaporeans really should be learning to move out of this "ban culture" and learning how to respect one another. It is our responsibility to cycle safely.</p>

              <p>Alternatively, I feel a more useful ruling would be to catch reckless cyclists, as opposed to putting a blanket ban that does not really help anyone. Other nations have managed to accomidate bicycles into their midsts quite easily, and frankly it will Singapore be a joke and laughing stock of the world if we can't handle this in a mature way.</p>
              <p>So yah, ride safely!</p>
