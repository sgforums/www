            <div class='col-md body'>The Basic NCC Training Syllabus is gradual and progressive. It aims to provide a cadet with a diverse range of challenging,enriching and FUN acitivities. The 5 broad objectives of our training are:<br><br>1. Character Building<br><br>2. Miliatry Awareness<br><br>3. National Education<br><br>4. Adventurous and "Can Do" Spirit.<br><br>5. Leadership<br><br>Year One - Part A (Sec 1)<br><br>This is the stage of self discovery and Teacher-student bonding. This is where we prepare our young cadets for a taste of the NCC. The conduct of Part A camps are carried out by the School units. One of the key reasons is to allow the NCC teacher to bond with his cadets in the first year of the cadet's life.<br><br>Teacher Offices in the school are encouraged through the Part A syllabus to conduct their training in an interesting and fun manner. This is the time where the cadets will learn the basic skills of the military, such as footdrills, first aid, individual fieldcraft, weapons handling, Orienteering, the NCC-Core values as well as visit to Army Units. The Part A cadets are also exposed to the individual Marksmanship Trainers (IMT) range.<br><br>To further enhance our effort to retain their interest in the NCC, we will also be inviting selected units to send their Part A cadets for Camp FEAST , a fun and experiential learning camp for Part B cadets.<br><br>Year Two - Part B (Sec 2)<br><br>This is the stage where cadets are encouraged to step out of their inhibitions. Apart from updating them on skills and knowledge that they have learnt in Part A, but at a higher level, we will also equip them with various other skills. The main exposure for these cadets would be through Camp FEAST . This camp intends to build cadets' confidence, teamwork and character through fun-filled and adventurous outdoor activities. Some of these activities include, high and low ropes course, archery and the newly introduced paintball gun arena.<br><br>Part B Cadets are also introduced to the M16 live firing range as well as civil defence course, SANA course and basic kayaking course.<br><br>They will also be encouraged to take part in the shooting competition, orienteering competition and the sea competition<br><br>Year Three - Part C (Sec 3)<br><br>This is the stage where cadets are equipped with skills and knowledge to allow them to assume leadership roles. This is the most interesting part of their life in the NCC. Part C cadets apart from revisiting the skills and knowledge that they have learnt from Part B, will be invited to take part in adventure camps and expeditions and leadership courses. Some of these adventure camps include, Outward Bound Courses (local and overseas), Mount Ophir Expedition, Annual Round the Island kayaking Expedition, Camp Pinnacle , and the National Camp. Part C cadets are also invited to participate in the International Cadet Exchange Programmes, where the NCC has programmes with Australia, Brunei, UK, US, India, New Zealand and Hong Kong.<br><br>Outstanding cadets are sent for the Specialist Course and Senior Specialist Course for promotion to higher ranks and appointment in the unit. Cadets at this level are also invited to attend SAF courses such as Basic Airborne Course and the Underwater Diving Course.<br>Year Four - Part D (Sec 4)<br><br>Cadets upon completing Part C are considered to be qualified Cadet Leaders. The will assist the teacher officers in the running of the school unit. Because of the demands of the school academic curriculum, most programmes at Secondary Four are elective programmes. The Secondary Four students will have to manage their time carefully between their academic studies and their love for NCC<br><br></div>
