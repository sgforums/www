              <p>Long tedious process.  File, then kenna consultation and finally hearing before judge.  SCT is pretty informal although you should get all the evidence and documents ready to show.  The first stage is mediation, the next stage is before the judge who will decide on the case.  Just present what you have.  Say clearly what was promised to you and why you should get your money back.  Limited to $10K only - so if you paid more, and you win, you give up any amount above $10K. It is a good resolution though - since you will have paid a lawyer the difference anyway - provided you paid may be a few thousand more?  Filed for failure to do what they said. </p>
              <p>How did your hearing go today?</p>

              <p>hi all..</p>
              <p>Last night me and my husband went down to smiths and baron office (they requested to meet them to discuss about our letter concerning the cancellation of the purchased of their membership called H.I.Ts). We met with the contract officer lady and asked them to give us back our money. They said they will bring our case to their head office and will answer us within a week. is there any of you here given the same answer like us? ( I am afraid this is just one of their trick). Me and my husband decided that if within  a week whether they delay their answer and ask for more time or said they won't give us back our money then we will go with the case through SCT. Well, one more thing I went to SCT yesterday morning and they said that my case is out of their jurisdiction, cos the contract worth is 19k, even if i claim only 2k. But they say they will still process my case if i insist.</p>
              <p>@tomorrownevercome : is my husband should come to the SCT too to filed the case? because when I went to SCT they didn't say anything about my husband should come there too.  Thanks before. </p>

              <p>Chantiq - file anyway.  If yours is a cancellation case - ie. you just bought, gave notice and they refuse to cancel and refund, you have a good chance.  But yes, the SCT can only give you $10,000 at the end of the day unless the other side agrees to up the stakes to $20K.  So what it means is that you will have to forfeit the $9K. I would just try.  Never mind.  Getting something back is better than nothing. </p>
              <p>Mindeye - just throw everything in. Let the judge decide.  But of course I am saying you must have something to support your case lah.  If you say misrep, show where you were misrep to.  cannot just say say and no proof.   I just told my story - did not use any "legal" terms cos I am not too sure what it all means.   Because you always hear pp say but what it is in legal terms may be different.  SCT is not like normal court so the judge is more patient to listen to you cos no lawyer.  If you not too sure, before you go for your hearing, seek out free legal clinic advice.</p>

Please keep me in the loop.  I going down to CASE tomorrow at 9.00 am with another member got scam by them. Anyone want to joint in please be there to exchange contact.</p>

              <p><strong>
              </strong></p><div><strong>Hi All,</strong></div><strong>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I have the same experience.I have read all your posting and i'm also one of the victims. I have tried considering to file by issue at CASE but until now im still unable to find time.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I have spoken to their General Manager(Henry Lee) and Assistant General Manager(Francis Goh) for refund. It takes me almost everyday calling them. Finally i was able to get a letter of refund from GMC itself, stating that they will do the full refund to my credit card(refund dated Nov.24) but up until now i havent receive the refund to my credit card. Im giving them until this week to refund to my credit card.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>On my own personal experience i think the best way to get there attention is to go there(around 7pm) and make a scandal or make a scene i that way you are telling there clients that what they are telling in there presentation sucks.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Now im not worried to much because i have a black and white writing that they will make a full refund to my credit card. If in anycase they will not comply with the letter. Then i can file a case against them will solid proof.</div>
              </strong><p></p>
              <div>
              <div>My basis for dispute to them are mis-representation and bad services.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Misrepresentation because instead of charging to my credit card in installment plan the bank has charge me in full. I was able to get 10 years for 4,800. They said it should be PIP(im not sure of the term) mode of payment whereby i will ask my bank to make an installment plan instead. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I went there for the first time and explain my situation to Francis Goh and he has called all those the Account manager and others(Hanis, Sonia, Bella) etc. I straight away let to there faces that you are misleading me and the PIP thing was not mentioned before i signed and i only knew about PIP when i call the bank(btw, the bank also confirm that they dont have any installment for this merchant - GMC).</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Second time i went i spoke to Henry Lee, this been trying so hard to persuade me, so  give him another chance provided that he can transfer the full amount to there inhouse finance with out interest, reverse the charges to my credit card and have in writing the perks that comes with the contract(e.g. no tipping, 20-30% discount compare to the other travel agents, 10-15% off to any airfare tickets, etc)</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>As suspected Henry Lee wasn't able to deliver the promise. So i didnt stop calling there mobile, land line until such time i receive an email that they are terminating my contract and will do a full refund to my credit card.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I have given them another 6 weeks to refund, 6 weeks has past and the refund did not happend. So i went to there office 3rd time, on the 3rd time i have spoken to Francis Goh again and he issue me a letter to refund by Nov 24, now after 2 or 3 weeks refund still didnt happend. I am planning to go next week if my refund is not yet settled by this week.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Bad service because i have ask for there quote for HK trip but what they have given me is not as cheap as i expected. I have compared the price with travel agents and its almost the same. Also i was clearly mentioned on there quote that i will still need to pay for tipping whereby during the presentation it was clearly mentioned that no tipping or any kind will happend once we signed a contract.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I suggest that collectively we gather our complained together with others so that we can have a strong case to file since the amount involve would be greater compare to individual.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Even if i will get my refund i wont stop searcing for justice(if i may say) since this is hard earned money. We can consult a lawyer if necessary. They should be STOP, and i will make sure that singapore government will be aware of this kind of company.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I have created a GMAIL for Gliteratti Marketing once i get me refund i will try to brocast to all on my address list and all the groups that i know let them know to BEWARE of this company. I this matter they will lose client and there reputation will spread.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Lets go for it.</div>
              <div>Ultimately i would suggest that we meet face to face and share notes.</div>
              <div>Lets consult a lawyer since i think if a lot of us can complain it would be a strong case rather than each of us file a complain to CASE.</div>
              <div>We must teach GMC a lesson!!!</div>

              <p>Hi all</p>
              <p>I am within the cooling -off period. I went to SCT for my mediation on 1 Dec. No one from S&amp;B turned up. The asst registrar said that he will send an order for them to pay the deposit I've paid. If they still did not pay by a certain time given to them, SCT will send a court order to them</p>
              <p>So, please if you are fighting against cooling off period, please go to SCT immediately. Don't wait any longer. I suspect S&amp;B will take their time to pay me back but I will continue to pursue this!</p>

              <p>hi all</p>
              <p>@gh5128 : Me and my husband also were in the cooling-off period but SnB replied that their not a time share so, we can demand it. Pufff..... Then on 1 dec i and my husband went there to talk to them and demand to cancel our contract and give us back our money ( we met with shobana (indian) the contract officer lady and kartini (indonesian but now singaporean) the manager). they said they will answer us within a week. and last tuesday they email my husband and said that they agree to cancel the contract but the money we have paid will be retained as written in our contract. This is what written in our contract :</p>
              <p>"if the purchaser shall fail to make any payment due to the company under the terms of this agreement by the due date, either the company or the company's legal representatives acting on behalf of the company may (without prejudice to the company's other rights under this agreement) serves a contractual default notice on the purchaser specifying that if payment is not made within seven days of the date of service of such notice then all payments made by the purchaser and any rights occurring to the purchaser under this agreement shall be forfeited and retained by the company and shall not be recoverable by the purchaser and the purchaser shall remain liable to the company for the outstanding balance under this agreement"</p>
              <p>The due date supposedly on 24th dec 2009, and in the contract it's written we pay "deposit". Isn't deposit meaning money that you give to other party, that should be recover if u don't use the service or buy the goods? I kind of confuse with this term. Because we haven't use any of their services and we didn't get the card either yet. So, how come they can say they agreed to cancel the contract but couldn't give us back our money?  </p>
              <h2>well, i went to SCT last wednesday and will meet Snb this coming tuesday.I dont know anything bout law in singapore and my english isn't that good either so I kind of confuse and scare for meeting this people from SnB. anyway, if any of you want to share anything with me u can contact me here nainggolan_c@yahoo.com</h2>

              <p>Chantiq - the whole idea of the cooling off is that both parties are returned to the position as if the contract never happened - so they have to cancel AND RETURN your money.  No keeping of deposit or any amount for admin fee or that fee.  So make sure you do not sign anything else and make sure they give you back your money. </p>
              <p>Alain - you should go and claim on the letter of refund as soon as possible.  I wonder if you can use the letter n show to your credit card and get them to refund the amount instead of having to wait for the company to do it.</p>
              <p>Think they are very sneaky now - if there is an order, they just ignore and dont pay.</p>

              <p>Hi Chantiq</p>
              <p>S&amp;B is receiving more and more complaints at SCT. I have a friend who also went to SCT last Wed and there he met another person also claiming against S&amp;B. So, I urge more and more people to go to SCT. </p>
              <p>Initially when I wrote in, they did not reply my letter so I went to file at SCT.When the mediation date comes, they did not attend so now they have to pay back my deposit +$15 of disbursements ordered by SCT.</p>
              <p>So now, as S&amp;B is getting more and more people wanting to cancel contract, they try to counter offer you and they will ask you to pay admin fee. Don't listen to them. Let SCT handle them. Make S&amp;B busy- let them go down to SCT every now and then to face SCT and disrupt their operations!!!</p>

              <p>Dont be afraid when you go to SCT. You have nothing to fear; just describe your case to the retired judge (or referee) in choronlogical order and where you were misrepresented. You do not need to know legal terms. Justice and fairness will prevail !</p>

              <p>hello all, </p>
              <p>I went to SCT this morning for my consultation and guess what, no one from SnB showed up. So, the referee told me that they will send a letter to SnB to give all my money back by 15 january 2010. Thank Goodness. I also just found out that the contract officer lady from SnB, tried to call and email my husband related to the letter they've received from SCT for today's consultation, but my husband never answered them. Maybe it's a good move not answering them, I guess. </p>
              <p>so, anything I could help, please send me email. If I can I would be glad to help. Btw, I probably leaving singapore on the 24th dec and going back to my country. I'll be back if only my husband get job again in singapore or have to deal again with SnB if they don't pay my money.  </p>
              <p>I wish you all the best, and thank you for all the support and sharing. I don't know how to say my gratitude to you all. But Thank you so very much. And hopefully the SnB will pay back our money. I crossed my finger.</p>

              <div>Hi All,</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Just a quick update on my trip today at GMC.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I arrived at GMC around <span id="lw_1260884859_0" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed; cursor: hand;">6pm</span>, when i arrived they already some potential members in the meeting room. I had spoken to the reception and ask for Francis but as expected Francis didn't show up.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>They asked my to step out and go to they're other office, i refuses to go. So while waiting i make a scene to make sure that the other clients are able to hear me from the meeting room. One client setup the room and i have spoken to her and told her not to be fooled by GMC, she go back to the room and shortly after they step out of the room and did not get the package and thanking me. Then some of the clients arrived i been saying the same thing to them(saying that this is a scam and you can search in google and you will find a forum that discusses GMC). I think i have spoken to atleast 6-7 potiential members.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>They try to call security and told me to expect a letter coming from they're lawyer. I know to myself that this is a bluff.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Then i have noticed that they are only getting the clients information and give them the voucher without even bothering for presentation. I think they just doing this since im making a scene and don't want there potential client to hear what im saying but i also think that they are being resched for presentation.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Finally i get there attention and spoken to Alfie and he mentioned that my cheque will be ready tomorrow 1:30pm, i just told him that i dont believe anymore and i need a writen note from them. They are not able to issue me a letter and mentioned that this is just a verbal agreement. So i stayed and make a scene.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>After a few minutes around 7:30 they close office(too early right?). I think they have done this to avoid more scene coming from me. So i did left they're office but i just take me dinner, i went back again to check if they're just fooling me but indeed they close office at 7:30.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I am glad of the result of my efforts today. Atleast i was able to help those potential members and was able to close and disrupt they're business.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I told Alfie that i am happy to do this every until i get my refund.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I just hope that they get the my message because if i need to go there everyday i will</div>

              <p>It has been an eyeopener for me.  After going through the forum, I realized that I have also been cheated.  I then read the terms &amp; conditions in the GMC contrat.  It mentions that there will be no cancellation of membership.</p>
              <p>I have paid SGD2500 for 3 years membership which was paid in full.  They were telling me that they would be sending membership cards etc. but received nothing till date.</p>
              <p>Do I have any option of going to SCT?  Kindly suggest.</p>

Actually it has crossed my mind to do likewise at SnB.At least to put a stop to cheat more people.  SnB is very tricky. They ask for another consultation with  me because they claim that they did not receive the first letter sent by SCT.Funny right? And why didn't they say they did not receive the second letter too????</p></div>
