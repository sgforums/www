              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I am a member of Garraway since 09, but i have yet to use their service as i didn't pay in full. Already pay around $4-5k for their package but didn't pay further although they have send letter to me to pay up or else legal action will be taken. Anyone successfully claim anything from garraway?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If i were to lodge a complaint against them, what are the chances as i didn't use their service yet, but come across many complaints against their services??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Need some advice. You can email me @ <a href="mailto:email2ahjo@gmail.com">email2ahjo@gmail.com</a></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hi everybody here</p>
              <p>I am also a victim from this Garraway scam.  The cooling period is just for show only, I did went back during the cooling period 1 year back to request for contract termination but was rejected, have not used their services since the day i sign the contract. Left with no choice, approached CASE, went for mediation but the offer was unacceptable by us, just want to get back my money.  Sick and tired of all these.  Now I am waiting for a hearing date from SCT.  Difficult to imagine that Singapore as a fair and order country but allow such scam company to cheat us of all our hard-earned monies....is there JUSTICE</p>

              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>Went down to Garraway Office yesterday. The previous grand office at #14-07 is taken over by S&amp;B and is closed. Garraway is now located in a small corner with a small office. The officer in charge tell us because there is not much marketing proj hence only left a small admin office space.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The officer explain himself, saying that the recently CASE injunction only disallow them to say that they are cheaper than other places, but they are allowed to say they have a price guarranteed. Also mention to him about the 20-60% savings that they claim in the presentation, he mentioned that some doesn't have much savings is because due to the peak season or the last min booking, they can't give at such a high discount rate. Maybe anyone has use their service and have such savings? can share your experiences?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>Very much appreciated to three of you. I filed the case at SCT and it was decided that I was mis-represented by SnB. I was refunded by SnB( had to go to Garraway office) by means of cash.</p>
              <p>The case went a bit long as I initially went to CASE and later decided to go to SCT thru their advice.</p>
              <p>These folks especially Helping-people48 did provide a very detailed advice that truly made alot of difference.</p>
              <p>As per other cases we were promised discounted travel packages, air tickets and credibility of the company that was different from what we saw factually.</p>
              <p>We presented our sequences of events and 4 examples of what we were told during sales and what we experienced during the membership that was not meeting their promises.</p>
              <p>We are happy we won the case. We are here to help you if needed.</p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>

              <p>All GMC Victims,  I went to SCT on 1st July but GMC didnt turn up. So SCT issued a
              letter to pay us back. But i dont think, GMC will do anything about
              this. Also SCt advised to go to a Lawyer for further consultation. I
              think, we should go to police and report this scam. I already filed a
              case with Police but they might be waiting for more complaints to take
              any action against GMC.<br> <br> Let me know what are you guys going to do? Its a lot of money, we just cant let them to walk away?</p>

              <p>Please can anyone share the procedure for teminating the CVC membership contract as I'm not using the membership for past 2 years.</p>
              <p>Now it seems the annual membership needs to be paid in Euros and 20 year membership has been converted to perpetual membership without my consent.</p>
              <p>Have anyone able to terminate the contract and get back the money paid to Garraway in case if they have sold the membership by mis-representation.</p>

              <p>Hi i hope to be able to help fellow singaporeans or rather victims of CVC members who have been fallen prey to timeshares woe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) For new victims, 4 days after contract signed is very crucial, send notice of cancellations for record purposes even if they refuse to accede, at least we as a consumer have something on record. Very helpful also if you present it during SCT hearing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) For those who are already a member, go directly to SCT instead to CASE as there is a 1 year frame.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was a victim myself and I just want to help other victims like me.  My contract was signed in 2009 and my 1st mistake was I didn't put on record to terminate the contract. 2nd mistake is after various unsuccessful negos with Garraway/concepts, didn't go directly to SCT but instead to CASe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I lost my case but life still carries on.  I hope nobody will follow in my footsteps.  Thanks and wishes all best of luck.  I believe that heaven will do us just.  I hope soon local government will come up with a law to curb all these doers.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Hello to all,</span> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">I came too late to read about the scam from GLITTERATI MARKETING yesterday with so many victims like me.</span> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">As I am also one of the victims,  I had file a police report and also file a claims SCT and was advised by the court to pay a fee to enforce a writ of seizure on the Company.  As I feel that the Company no longer exit, it might be a waste of my monies to go ahead with the seizure.  I was told that I cannot go to the director as this is a private company.  I was also surprise that the police close my case saying that this is a civil case and that they cannot arrested anyone.   They should at least arrest the person who is behind all these. Can some one pls tell me Is there any other way that we get back our monies??</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Did any one of the lucky victims claim back your monies now that we cannot locate them??    If yes how did you do it???  We have to make a stop to all these scammers who go around trying to cheat our monies.  Did any one of you try to publish it on to the newspapers so as to warn the public about these Companies and also shame them?? </span></p>
              <p> <span style="font-size: small;">Any feedback on the Company or any comments, suggestions and opinions will be highly appreciate. I would not mind to meet up with all of you to discuss on this issue if the response to meet is good.</span></p>

              <p>Today attended a session similar to what I read in this forum after a telemarketeer called me up with promise of freebies - free 2D/1N package to Batam or Genting Highlands. I found out later that these so-called "freebies" are not at all free - as I have to pay an admin fee of SGD80 per-pax. I can easily get the same Batam package for under SGD70 with any tour agent in SG. And also all are done via fax/email...highly suspicious way of doing business. I don't intend to use it at all - lesson learnt anyway!</p>
              <p>As usual with all scam companies - the only difference in my case is the name of the company - it's called <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Lastminutte Marketing &amp; Planning Pte Ltd" - located at  #04-44, People's Park Center, Chinatown</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>The modus operandi is exactly the same as experienced by those highlighted in this forum. But I went there just to see what these people are up to since I have some free time on hand. After being challenged by me on the authenticity of their claims of alliance with various hotels and to prove it to me...they finally gave up on me and told me I can leave with my earlier promised free-bies if my answer is already a "No" even when I find it worthy of consideration.</p>
              <p>I told them that it is reasonable to expect that before I buy a product - I should be convinced first that it's authentic/it works...and within the 75mins I gave them - I still didn't get to know how much I've to pay - as they insisted that I've to give a "Yes" answer first based on just the "benefits" highlighted in their presentations before I get to know the price. I guess their mysterious way of doing  business already confirmed my earlier suspicion that these people are scammers doing things in broad daylight.</p>
              <p>So, if anyone here who had been scammed before and curious enough to find out whether these are the very same people who just changed the name of the companies - you should just pay a visit to the address I mentioned above. But I believe they'll not allow you to go into their office without checking whether you had been pre-invited via an sms.</p>

              Hi all
              
              just an update on our issue with smiths and barons... They decided to cancel
              our membership though we never got the refund ( a couple of hundred SGD)
              CASE helped with the correspondence as we went there. My point to 
              Smiths and baron was that they didnt give a cancellation option. They cancelled 
              it maybe due to the number of issues they are having especially those
              who go to SCT.
              
              
              
              Thanks for this forum and to helpingpeople.

              <p>Hi all...</p>
              <p>Im not a local in S'pore. During my one week hols there, I signed up with this "Garraway Ent" for a promised 20yrs of membership for only S$8k. I have another $1k plus to settle before I can really 'enjoy' the services offered. Yes, I went through the same 'process' like you guys n had it signed! After reading all these posts, I just can't stop sighing.. :(</p>
              <p>Just to share, It is said that in the contract, we are being 'protected' under this Consumer Act (S'pore).  Being one of the factors on why I decided to 'sign my life away' ;P</p>
              <p>I just want to know if anyone here who signed up, have actually travel using their service and how was it? </p>
              <p>Say if I intend to 'not-wanting-to-have-to-do-with-Garraway-anymore', what are the likely action they would do?</p>
              <p>I should have not trust things as such but here I am......sighing...</p>

              <p>Hello Everyone</p>
              <p>I got my money back (every single cent). Here is my story</p>
              <p>I signed up with GMC in Oc t 2009 against my wife's wishes (sometimes it pays to listen to your wives as they are more intuitive). Anyway within 3 days (supposedly the cooling off period) I wrote to cancel my membership. I spoke to Henry, written emails after emails, made multiple visits to their offices, numerous calls and the list goes on and on..</p>
              <p>The result : I didnt receive the refund that Henry promised me. I did  receive a piostdated cheque. But the cheque bounced</p>
              <p>In Feb I decided to go to SCT which was in my favor. But subsequently GMC closed operations and I stll didnt get the money.</p>
              <p>Here is what I did : I contacted DBS customer service (as I paid with DBS credit card). Intially they told me they cant help and that I have to get in touch with the merchant himself. But subsequently when I showed them all the documents (SCTs orders,police reports, etc) they relented and agreed to help me get my money back under "charge backs" for non delivery of service and products. Typically all credit cards have this charge back clause which can admistered under certain conditions.</p>
              <p>I filled up a charge back form and DBS put up a case for me with GMC's merchant bank.If within 30 days, the merchant bank does not dispute, then DBS has successfully recovered my money. The merchant bank did not dispute and I got my money back on 1st June 2010.</p>
              <p>Here are the things you need to do:</p>
              <p>1. Try and get hold of the top man for customer service. It's useless trying to speak to the officers on the phone. What I did was that I wrote in and the VP of customer service contacted me.</p>
              <p>Good luck</p>

              <p>Hi John76</p>
              <p>Just wonder when you filed the charge back? I called Citi and they mentioned that I need to file it with 60 days.</p>
              <p>Looking forward for your input.</p>
              <p>Btw, would you mind to email me the letter you sent to DBS. My email is amostan@yahoo.com.</p>
              <p>Many thanks!</p>

              <p><strong>WARNING AGAINST SIGNING UP WITH TIMESHARE "CANCELLATION" / "TERMINATION" COMPANIES</strong></p>
              <p>Hi!  If any of you have been approached by companies that cold call you and say that they can help you to terminate your timeshare - HANG UP IMMEDIATELY! Most of them are scams and trying to undo their contract with you for helping you to cancel is harder than cancelling your timeshare contract in the first place.  At the end of the day - you not only end up losing your money paid to your timeshare company - you will lose more money to these cancellation companies!  This is how they work.</p>
              <p>(1) X claims that they can help you cancel / terminate your contract.  All you need to do is pay them $10,000 and they will help you transfer or terminate.  Usually with no timeline.</p>
              <p>(2) You sign and pay and then you wait and wait.  If you complain, they may get a "lawyer" - and you will never know if it is a real firm or not- and you get a lawyer's letter written to your timeshare company to say that the firm represents you and if the firm does not hear from the timeshare company in 7 days, the timeshare is cancelled. Yeah - if it were that simple - you could have written the letter yourself.  There is no legal effect in this!!!! And if a letter was all you needed - (a) you could have sent one yourself; (b) why do you have to pay X $10,000 for this - which effectively makes them the kapo who contacted the lawyer; (c) could you not have hired a lawyer yourself and sent the letter for a few hundred bucks?!</p>
              <p>(3) You then wait and wait.  For the more "glossy" and "slicker" companies- they may be "associated" with your timeshare in the first place (ever wondered how they got your number in the first place?!) - you may get a letter in reply to say - yes everything is cancelled.  You dont owe us a thing - no need to continue to pay subscription - but what you paid to us - $15,000 for the membership is forfeited.  You dont owe us and we dont owe you.  SQUARE MINUS ONE!  You just lost your initial $15,000 plus ANOTHER $10,000 paid to X. </p>
              <p>($) Wait there is more!  Remember the stuff you were asked to sign with X before they would terminate?  Uh-oh!  You did not read properly or you were to eager to cancel your first timeshare to realise that you were made to sign on to another "BETTER" timeshare or "GREAT" investment plan with X!  Now you into a dispute with them and lo and behold - ANOTHER helpful company has called to help you terminate your contracts with X!..... there is a question of our small fees and here are a few papers we need you to sign.......Aw Man! </p>
              <p><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO</strong></p>
              <p>(1) If you are serious about cancelling your timeshare - do it within the cooling off period.  You have 5 days - check the Consumer Protection Fair Trading Act - available online.  There are the regulations.  Think it is 5 working days.  So dont believe them when they tell you "our policy is 3 days including weekends and PH...so you are out of time" etc.  If you regret your buy - fax them and cancel immediately.  Do registered posting or even courier delivery.  You just spend $5,000.  It is nothing to spend a few dollars more to get your money back.  The important point here is to show that you gave them proper notice of your intention to cancel.  Read the Act - there is a sample form in there which you have to follow.  In the meantime- get some legal advice.  Again - you spent $5,000.  You can spend a few hundred to get this money back.  There is no free lunch!</p>
              <p>(2) If you are not within the cooling off period - then you will have to see if they have totally misrepresented on their services or products.  This has to be a genuine case.  Cant be that you read the forums and found that they were "cheats" etc or that people complained about them.   So if you signed up because they told you the discount would be 60% off the recommended price - and they are unable to deliver, then that would be misleading and a misrepresentation.  Of course - you will have to produce proof.</p>
              <p>WARNING - just be wary of anyone offering to help you or assist you to terminate or cancel especially if they are asking for more money upfront.</p>
              <p>(3) You can go to a lawyer and get your lawyer to advise you and if there is any demand or correspondance to be made - your lawyer can do it.  You dont have to go through a third party "cancellation" company.</p>
              <p>BE WARNED.</p>

              <p>Hi ShareKhan,</p>
              <p>I nearly fell for another scam today (18/08/2010).  My husband n I have fully paid for the CVC membership back in Nov in 2009, but have yet to use any of their services. </p>
              <p>2 days ago a "investment co." called me up and proposed to buy back our ($10K)timeshare with CVC.  We arranged for a meeting and end up knowing that our 10 years membership was actually to a life-time one and we are still in liability to pay another ($16.5K) to the so-called trust fund!!..  It was a shock of my life! How many more bombs like this do I have to withstand before all this shit is over??..</p>
              <p>I have no idea who to believe cos the ANGMOH in-charge of the investment co. in Tong Bldg says that they can help to release us of the liabilty by paying them the $16.5K and they will then issue a SGD$26K cheque back to us in 75 days as to purchase our time share with CVC! </p>
              <p>This is ridiculous...  They really think we are brainless and out of our mind! What is lost is gone, once bitten twice shy...  We will never fall for such gimmicks again cos I finally understand that there is no such thing as a free lunch.  The authorities should really put a stop to all this, it involves our hard-earned money... Haiz...</p>
              <p>So ShareKhan I can truly understand your feelings, trust me...     </p>
