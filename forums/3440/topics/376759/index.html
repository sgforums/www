              <div>Any comments on this post by newbie in Stomp?</div>
              <div>As a warnG, i did attend the Garraway 90 min talk at ngee ann city tower B sometime in yr 2007 &amp; i was given some spa voucher as well as a supposedly free holiday like 5 days, 4 nites thingy. But i will have to pay $100/pax as admin fee first and with the standard waitG period. I was not comfortable as i felt the company sounds like Data Dyanamitz or something is not very credible. Everything is done thru email &amp; the reply is so ambigous and only asking me to remit $ to some posb acct no. first..In conclusion, i didnt use any of the vouchers as well as the holidays nether did i sign up for any schemes wt Garraway..<br><br>19th Aug 2009,<br>I was invited by another company called GMC, selling royalez paradize holiday, <a href="http://www.glitteratimarketing.com.sg/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #22229c;">http://www.glitteratimarketing.com.sg</span></span></a> located at Maxwell house #04-01A, maxwell road. They promised a 75min no pressure presentation &amp; free holiday. Their presentation is exactly the same as Garraway &amp; to my horror, the free holidays conditions are also the same, but by different issuing company. This time its called Capital Gateway Private Ltd, Bedok Central Post office, PO BOX 438 Spore 914602. email is <a href="mailto:admin@capitalgateway.com.sg"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #22229c;">admin@capitalgateway.com.sg</span></span></a>. U will first need to remit $100/pax to their DBS current acct no.025-901561-9..<br>They also gv a $20 outback steakhouse voucher, $20 Myra's beach club voucher &amp; a $50 chinese Dragon restaurant voucher which u wld need to spend $150 first..<br>The guy who called to arrange for the appointment is called james &amp; his mobile is 81500827, 98140496, the telemarketing no. is 63728-990, 63728-979.<br>Reading from the post here, i realised all of these companies are scam &amp; out to prey on the ignorance..<br><br>To my greatest horror, some of those guys who worked with Garraway are also with this GMC company; Gliterati marketing consulatcy.They have forgotten my face but i never forget ppl's faces...<br><br>Be very careful &amp; do not fall prey to any of these talks. Do not buy or sign for any of these packages. They offered me $18,800 package, then dropped to $15,000, then $7800, then $5800, then $2400...Wow lelong lelong...But I have no $. so how cheap also no money to sign..<br><br>I am very sad that our govt actually allows all of these companies to merry go round &amp; prosper as well as how could the sales people be so heartless &amp; lack of conscious? Why are they not quitting and yet choose to merry go round with different outfits???<br>I just found out they are dubious company today thru Sg forum that my eyes are open &amp; i felt its my social responsibility to warn the public of another similar set up...</div>

              <p>I would encourage victims like me, to report your case to CASE TRUST.</p>
              <p>I believe there would be many victims like me, just sit in silent, just to save your time &amp; energy. We should not let this kind of company continue to create more victims....</p>

              <p>Hi, all.</p>
              <p>Let me tell you that this is not the only company doing it. Beware, their mode of operation is the same. To answer llchong's question, they will promise you high discounts during the presentation. Later when you want to use the service they offer you what you can get at any tour agency. Example, in  my case I was told that I could get about 50% off a cruise. They even showed me the brochure. Later they say up to 50%. Meaning 1 - 50%. They use terms loosely. My scammers are from Nee Ann City tower B. Smith &amp; Baron.</p>

              <p>Hi all</p>
              <p>I also signed up. I have a letter from them to say that if we are unhappy with their services after the first trip, we can ask for 100% refund; or get back 80% of what we pay after 2 years. Are these the same terms you all have ?</p>

              <p>I agree. Do beware of such companies. Remember nothing comes free. Esp if it comes fm sm "unknown companies".</p>
              <p>Was almost conned to sign up with Glitterati Marketing Consultancy Group by the sales Person AC and his Manage. But I sticked firm to my decision, bec gt no $, hw to buy rite?</p>
              <p>So to bait me to sign up with them, they offered me a complimentary free 2 nites stay in either KL/Batam. The criteria was I need to indicate the date I am travelling and also fax the form over to them. I promptly fax the form and indicated an off peak date, non school holidays. There was absolutely no confirmation given for &gt; month. I then receive a reply that the hotels are fully booked,</p>
              <p>Didn't bother to sent them email to enquire further. As I am more or less confirmed that It is a scam.</p>

              <p>Hi to all, the salespeople in GMC are very good in enticing you to sign-up, but once you have tried booking, you'll end up frustrated as the services are not as promised. This has been my experience and from what I gathered as experiences of others in several forums. For those who have recently signed, I believe there's something in the contract that says you can cancel it during the cooling off period of 5 days. I guess this wasn't explained by them during their sales pitch. I only got to know it after some time too.</p>
              <p>If you want to cancel the membership, go to the Small Claims Tribunal if they ignore your CASE letter. Pls bring all supporting documents when you try to put up a claim at SCT.</p>
              <p>I hope the Singapore government will stop these kinds of companies to proliferate. It is quite appalling that these companies dare to operate in this country.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Got Reply from Smiths &amp; Baron's Director. He said that I was vague in saying that the discounts were insignificant and deny breaching CPFTA. They promised me 55% discount and then give me 10%. So CASE ask me to send them the details and I did. Waiting again. Most likely will try Small Claims and see what my choices are.</p>
              <p>For Bahterasy,</p>
              <p>if you are in their in-house installement scheme then you will only be able to use their services after you have paid all. Then when you try and use their services then you will notice that it is a waste as the discounts offered can get from any tour agency.</p>
              <p>If yours is through the banks installment scheme, like visa. Then the full amount has been paid to them. U can use it instantly.</p>
              <p>I am sure there are others like us. And I think we need to stop them. Now they are hiding under the CPFTA. It should be made as a criminal crime. That way they will not just change company name or disguise their "crime" and start all over again.</p>

              <p>Hi KenaScam</p>
              <p>Sorry to hear your update - good luck to you!</p>
              <p>I dont understand what you mean when you say they are "<span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #333333;">hiding under the CPFTA.". Shouldn't the CPFTA protect us ? or at least be fair ?</span></p>

              <p>Hi Summonli, Surfer1401, IIChong, GYC</p>
              <p>- do you have any updates / successes ? Please share with all. For me, I am waiting for their reply to my CASE letter.  If there's a pattern to how they treat us individually, we should think if there's anything we can do collectively  for ourselves legally too. </p>
              <p>*****</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #333333;">HI Surfer 1401, </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #333333;">"For those who have recently signed, I believe there's something in the contract that says you can cancel it during the cooling off period of 5 days. I guess this wasn't explained by them during their sales pitch. I only got to know it after some time too." - I checked my contract but there isn't this line - but under clause #9, there is a line that say no cancellation whatsoever - which maybe a unfair clause even if it is in the contract. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">
