              <p>Pras - As I said before - just give them notice.  Dont bother about paying the $500.  They cant do anything.  even if they say not effective - Just give them notice to cancel - there should be a form given to you.  Give it to them all completed.  Fax it in - email it - register post it - hand it in.  Just show you gave them notice within the cooling off period.  They have no right to charge you anything for it.  Under the act, everyone is suppose to be back in the same position - you with your money back, them as if you never bought.  So dont PAY anymore.  You should be getting back every cent.</p>
              <p>Just make sure you give them notice of cancellation - DOnt pay more!  If they refuse to refund you, then you file CASE and SCT</p>

Hopefully they will honor the 5 days cooling period and return me my hard earn money... Someone should close down this GMC.

              <p>Hi All</p>
              <p>I have signed up with S&amp;B with the usual pressurized tactic. Until now it's unbelievable that i have signed up for such a scam! Anyway the cool off period is over. I was given only 3 days as per the contract. So since im in "it", i made an enquiry on the rates of a particular hotel for my coming holiday. Rates quoted was much difference from what was mentioned by the Saleslady. On top of that, you can never get hold of the officer on the phone. Communication are mostly done by email. Receptionist is unprofessional.  </p>
              <p>If anyone could assist me, how do i get my 50% deposit back? How do i make a claim with STC? How should i cancel the contract?</p>
              <p>please share with me. TQ.</p>

              <p>Hi Paris1909</p>
              <p>Go and lodge complaint against them at SCT for mispresentation immediately! We already have 4 successful cases which the judge ordered to pay full refund due to misrep.</p>
              <p>Did your contract state any cancellation charges if you wish to terminate the contract?</p>
              <p>Act fast and be prepared to attend SCT mediation for 2 sessions and then if still not resolved, proceed to hearing.</p>

              <p>Thank you for the suggestion. I went thru the contract. There is no cancellation clause.</p>
              <p>You mentioned "proceed to hearing". Would you like to share a bit more on that?</p>

              <p>Hi there,</p>
              <p>There are a few things that I can help to clear all doubts.</p>
              <p>There are a few questions you guys might be wondering about <strong>Garraway, Smiths &amp; Baron, GMC(Glitterati Marketing &amp; Consultancy Pte Ltd).</strong></p>
              <p>1) <strong>Garraway, Smiths &amp; Baron </strong>are actually under the same management, but selling different "products" WHICH are similar. However, they claimed not to be TIMESHARES, but basically they are. Memberships DOES work, but you have to pay FULL AMOUNT like what most of the sales representatives would have told you.</p>
              <p>2) Holiday packages sponsored by the Call Officers who sent you SMS/CALLS, they do work. But beforehand,they will never tell you that you'll have to pay a fee of $50-$100 reservation/admin fees, this $100 EXCLUDES the Airport Taxes.</p>
              <p><strong><em>** A little tip here for you guys, when doing the confirmation of free trips, person who organises the trip for you WILL mark up the Airport Taxes, that's where they earn their commission, so PLS! check out the Airport Taxes yourself beforehand! **</em></strong></p>
              <p>3) Their membership works despite the SLOW respones from the officers &amp; on the FREE holiday trip telemarkerters.</p>
              <p><br><strong>4) ALL ABOUT GMC.</strong></p>
              <p>Most of you who has received calls from this company, I would advise you to NOT go for their "presentation" as this company is a total scam. Most people who has visited LGM/ Garraway/ Smiths &amp; Baron/ Oriental/ RCI would be called up to this GMC company as they are "buying" over client details from these company by putting SPYs in all these company to work for these victim company.</p>
              <p>GMC's not a honorable company, what they do here is RE-SELL. It means, they will offer to "BUY BACK" your membership and try very hard to put themselves in YOUR shoes first and tell you how they will get back your Cash-claims for you from these company blah blah blah, BUT WAIT! The terms and condition here is ---&gt; YOU HAVE TO PUT IN ANOTHER SUM OF MONEY, maybe $4000? $6000? $8000? Or even MORE if they realise that you have actually bought a hefty price from, LGM/GARRAWAY/SMITHS&amp;BARON/RCI/ORIENTAL...SO ON....</p>
              <p>The thing is your money will never ever gonna come back because? THEY DO NOT ACTUALLY HAVE A RESORT TO BUY YOUR MEMBERSHIPS! and bring your money back to justice because they will say, "You will have to give us, 6-12mths to settle everything" But from what we all know, Re-sell does not last long...</p>
              <p>All they do is get your money, you call their office.. they'd say "Oh yes, it is processing! pls give us sometime. Don't worry! everything is settled!" But then......</p>
              <p>*12 months later.....</p>
              <p>Try dialing their number and the respones is?</p>
              <p>" The number you have dialed is not available."</p>
              <p>.....</p>
              <p>That's when you realise, they are a scam, there goes your $4000-$10000.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So pls, do internet searchings before you attend their presentation.</p>
              <p>Nothing is free in this world.</p>
              <p>If you have the money to buy all these membership, why not just go for the holiday INSTEAD of putting in a lump sum of money and get nothing in return.</p>
              <p>Maybe you might be lucky to have invested in a good company like Marriot.. But please go for a WELL-KNOWNED presentation.</p>
              <p>Do not be greedy!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Internet is so convenient! A click, and you'll know all about it.</p>
              <p>Hope this helps all poor souls who have been cheated by those company and have woke up your minds.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p>sorry for going AWOL. Computer hang. Could not log in.</p>
              <p>I was successful in getting a order by SCT for them to return my money. It is due on 12 Feb. So far they delaying. They say will call but have not. I am now looking into the Writ of Seizure and Sale (WSS). Looking back they don't seem to have much to sell at Smiths &amp; Baron.</p>
              <p>By the way, let me give you this information. Smiths &amp; Baron is a company that is less than a year old. They claim to be 20 years in the business. This point can be used a misrepresentation as your claim can be that they lied and if you knew that they were only a few months old you would not have signed with them.</p>
              <p>Secondly, they claim to be affiliated with NATAS. Which is also a lie. Check the NATAS website. They will then claim that CTS (Concept Travel services) is affiliated with NATAS. Ask them to show.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Then their is their "wholesale" prices. This is also a lie. It is actually a discount of $10 - $40 dollars. </span></p>
              <p>Ask to see their website. It does not exists. Get their newsletter and compare prices. You will see that it is no different from what you can find in the papers or internet.</p>
              <p>Get them to show proof that they are affilliated with all those hotels and resorts that they claimed they were with.</p>
              <p>Basically, they are many things that you can use to sue them under the Consumer Fair Trade act. You just need to remember what they told you. Write it down.</p>
              <p>Most importantly, remember that at SCT you must be calm and in control. Tell the truth of how it the presentation went and what was promised and how it differed from the contract. If the judge says that you were silly or naive not to read it clearly then agree. But state that you trusted them and then say that you misled because they thought they were a reliable company on their fictious "20 years" in business.</p>
              <p>Anyway, you can call for witnesses as well as have statements from others to use in SCT.</p>
              <p>This experince has made me new friends as well so it was not all a loss.</p>
              <p>Finally, let me give you this "good thing" that I will do. As most of you do not know what to do and how to go about filing at SCT and what documents to prepare and so on. I will offer you my personal guidance. Just send me a mail via here, or just contribute you quires comments here.</p>
              <p>I will say again. We have nothing to lose. Have a Happy New Year. Roar.</p>

              <p>Well just to share on my case with GMC.</p>
              <p>So far I have written to them to cancel within the cooling off period, and they reply that the acknowledge that and will process the cancellation and give me a reply in 14 days. Do you  guys think they will return me my money then? Or will they possibly do nothing? What I am afraid here is that after 14 days, they will be nowhere to be found.</p>

              <p>Hi Paris1909</p>
              <p>Hearing is before a referee who will make the decision on whether you can cancel your contract and get your $$ back. If they did not state anything about a $500 cancellation fee in the contract, you better act fast and go to SCT.</p>
              <p>Hi Kenascam</p>
              <p>Did you call them to ask when will your cheque be ready for collection? I intend to do  that. </p>

              <p>Hi gh5128,</p>
              <p>I did call them. They were rude and told me that they would get back to me at the end of the day but could not tell me when that was. In the end they did not call back. You can try. Shobuna is very rude she slamed the phone down on me.</p>
              <p>Btw, anyone knows that if we use the Writ of Seizure and Sale (WSS) can we get go to the Director's house. I think there will be more things there than at Smiths &amp; Baron.</p>

              <p>Kenascam - wait for me. I also want to go the director's hse before you take all the valuable things!!! : )</p>
              <p>Frankly, as the company is a pte ltd, we are not liable to go to the director's hse but only the company. I have also read in the papers before and the only thing that we can sell is their office furniture, their computers, the poster of their castle maybe??? </p>

              <p>Kenascam - Hmmm maybe you can find out when their most busy time / day is and get the baliff to go during that time - so there is maximum impact!  At most - you can help other people from falling into their scam!</p>
              <p>Definitely cannot go against their directors personally.  I wonder how all these people sleep at night knowing that their whole life is all about scamming people!</p>

              <p>Hi Kena Scam/ gh5128</p>
              <p>I just got the court order from SCT to get full refund from Garraway.  Sad to say, by now Garraway could be only an empty shell and I might just win a paper judgement. Since S &amp; B is still in operation, you should pressure them constantly until they pay. Don't let them have time to transfer the money out and left nothing for you to claim. That is what happen to me now. Go to CASE and ask for a list of free legal advice. Get you money back fast.</p>
              <p>You can't claim against the director as it is a PTE comapny, this is the loop hole they are playing with it.</p>
              <p>If you found out how to apply for Writ of Seizure and Sale (WSS), please share. I want to apply for it too.</p>
              <p>What tomorrownevercome2009 suggest is good, may you should also call the police on site if they keep delay your payment. At least when the police is there you can press for payment date and it will be recorded in the police report. To all foreigner who got scam, file your complian to CASE, SCT and don't forget to file it with your embassy. The embassy should help you got scam here right? At least they got more right and know the law better then anyone of us. If they don't help you here, who can?</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>Just got home from a long presentation from GMC (3 hours!!!), signed up and paid $2000 deposit only to hit this forum and learn the slew of complaints and bad reputation this company has. Will immediately go to their office tomorrow and try to get a full refund although under clause (d) that says that there will be a 10% fee of the TOTAL membership price! Crap, because the membership is $6800 so that's $680 that I will be charged?</p>
              <p>The big question now is,</p>
              <p>1) Should I go tomorrow (Friday) and claim back with the fee? At least I am getting back something right?</p>
              <p>2) Don't bother going tomorrow but go through SCT and fight for a FULL refund?</p>
              <p>Tomorrow is my only option to take advantage of the cooling period of 5 days (inclusive of weekends and public holidays) because there are 4 non-working days thereafter.</p>
              <p>I'm so lost and stressed now... can anyone give me some guidance?</p>
