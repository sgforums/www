              <p>Hi to all GMC victims,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can we all meet this coming Saturday afternoon, let's say 2pm?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We can probably meet at city area. Suggested venues:</p>
              <p>Cityhall</p>
              <p>Sommerset</p>
              <p>Orchard</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If we want to get our money back or at least put a stop to these people behind GMC scam, then we need to act fast. It would be better if we act as a group so that the authorities can notice us and be alarmed as well that this company has a lot of victims and they should act to prevent other individuals from becoming victims as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As it is, the GMC people cannot be located. They are no longer at Maxwell House. They cannot be contacted through their hotline as well as email addresses. The glitterati88 email address is already returning a message delivery failure. They are not replying anymore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some of us already have filed a police report, filed at SCT, got a court order already for GMC to pay us back our money but this is useless since they cannot be located/contacted. No one is going to pay us back.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We need to meet up and discuss our options on how we can get our money back. The amount of money they got from us ranges from $3800-12000. This is big money and I'm sure all of us wants to get it back...wants justice. So please, let us take action before it's really too late and all is lost.</p>

              <p>They are not answering thier line . I understand that the office at Mawell is closed.</p>
              <p>They have gone on the run. Try calling them ........then make a police report the go to the small claims court at Havelock Rd and lodge a claim. If there are enough report the CAD police Dept may take up ther case.  Case Trust seems no to be a ble to help.</p>
              <p>If you are paying by credit card the card company will just keep deducting . If you aree paying by cheque stop paying and see if they contactt you. We need to all gather and take action.</p>
              <p>We need to stop them form cheating others.</p>

              <p>I paid $2000 deposit 12 months installment  by visa and the balance luckily not pay yet 3700 suppose to be by end of this month using credit card and another 3700 next year May 2011.</p>
              <p>I was so upset to find out all this ....one day late. What should i do to cancel the agreement. What is the consequence if i dont pay the coming 3700? can i still write to cancel the agreement? Should i go straight to CASE now?</p>
              <p>Pls help advice.</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>Shit just look into this forum last night....i just signed up
              last thursday 1st april...the cancellation period in my contract is
              3days ....minus the saturday, sunday and Good Friday i am already
              in the 4th day.</p>
              <p>I paid $2000 deposit 12 months installment  by visa and the
              balance luckily not pay yet 3700 suppose to be by end of this month
              using credit card and another 3700 next year May 2011.</p>
              <p>I was so upset to find out all this ....one day late. What
              should i do to cancel the agreement. What is the consequence if i
              dont pay the coming 3700? can i still write to cancel the
              agreement? Should i go straight to CASE now?</p>
              <p>Pls help advice.</p>

              <div class="post-header"></div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content">I wish we'd never come across this name, never had any contact with the group, for then we wouldn't be in such a fix at the moment!<br><br>It is such a bane and thorn in my life at the moment.<br>We signed up with the Glitterati marketing group initially, believing in their promises of great service and cost savings to be had. And paid up $12000. What fools we were. So easily taken.<br><br>Anyway, call it ESP or bad vibes, I chickened out pretty much soon after. Fortunately we were within the 5 day cooling off period and they gave us the termination letter after we made a surprise visit to their office. More promises. We should not have believed them. They told us we'd get the money back in 6 to 8 weeks.<br><br>After 6 weeks I started to get nervous and began calling them. Half the time the phone went unanswered. The other half someone ( different each time ) would pick up and promise to call back but never did. Same thing with emails.<br><br>8 weeks went by and it was time to find out for sure what was happening. The Chinese New Year holidays were already over. It took another 2 days before someone even picked the phone up, then we made a trip down to see them. That was dramatic. A short punk called Brian met us ( he didn't even know the security pin to get into the room!) and called himself "team leader". Then he disappeared for a good 15 to20 minutes claiming to find out what was happening to our refund. Finally he reappeared ( thank goodness) and gave us this piece of paper saying to call the bank to find out what happened to the money!! I was furious. He could not even explain himself adequately and I could see it was a waste of time even talking to him.<br><br>I noticed that the staff seemed to come from another area on the same floor so I made my way there to see if there was anybody more senior to speak to.<br><br>The back room was a shocking mess. A few desks, 4 staff sitting there with a Chinese dude calling himself Henry Lee saying he was the " General Manager" . He claimed he'd been "away" during the period that our contract was made and terminated, hence the mess. Then he showed me a slip of paper stating that he'd actually been in <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Changi</span> Prison! My heart sank. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">OMG</span>. He's a gangster.<br><br>Anyhow, he had a pretty glib tongue, managed to calm us down, and told us that the bank was freezing their credit card facilities due to large numbers of refunds that were <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">occurring</span>. We called the bank and that part was true, but the bank said that the money that was charged in December would have already been given to the company if the refund did not go through. Hence the onus was on the company to refund us directly!! So where does that leave us!!!<br><br>Promises later, we are still stuck in this conundrum and he has gone on to prove that he is a liar and an unreliable person. I guess we are now faced with having to go through the legal system to get our money back, or the possibility of "donating" $12k to their activities, whatever they may be.<br><br>Well... whatever the outcome, I really hope no one else would have this misfortune of meeting these people.... and it's a grim reminder to the 2 of us never to attend any more marketing talks! Expensive and painful lesson learned..</div>

              <p>I was able to get my money from GMC, sometime back. I filed a case them against STC. I gathered all of my documents and since I felt I had a strong case against them, I decided to file the case. So I urge all of those who have been scammed to spend some time gathering the docs and creating a statement or a document listing the events that had transpired. It takes time and effort, but if you win the case, it will all be worth it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please chase them since allowing them to escape scot-free will only  give them the reason to scam other people some more. Currently, some guys are still calling me on the phone. It's a different company this time, but the same modus operandi. They want to give free holiday vouchers if you are to attend a meeting with them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It amazes me how these scammers morph into a different company and tries to call people who have been scammed before. Is there anyone here who knows someone big in the government to report these scams so it will stop once and for all?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>For anyone who paid via credit card, call the credit card company and explain the problem. Tell them that you will be filing a case against them in SCT. Don't pay them yet! Explain to them to hold the amount in contention and request that no interest be applied to the said amount. But be sure to do your part which is filing your case in SCT. Like I've mentioned above, gather all your docs and create a statement saying all of the things that happened and emphasize the misgivings of GMC with regards to the contract. This is just my suggestion to help.</p>

              <p>Goodluck to all.</p>

              <p>Hi Peng.Jimmy1, I believe it would be best to ask the SCT officer about it. You can check their contact numbers in their webpage. I know it would be a hassle, but please make an effort to retrieve your hard earned money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hi Natl, every document that you see fit as proof that they did not act according to the contract would be valuable. For me, I included the agreement letter, my emails, I even kept their SMS messages, etc. When filing a case in SCT, you are also required to create a statement. It's more of describing the events that happened. Then emhasize the things that they did or did not do in the contract or agreement.</p>
