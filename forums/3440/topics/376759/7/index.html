              <p>Head Crunch  - dont be too concerned about the "weekend and public holiday" bit.  The Consumer Protection Act does not include weekends or public holidays in the calculation of time - 5 working days - so dont be fooled.  In any case, go check it out and file your notice to cancel ASAP!  Fax it in - nail it to their door - register post it!  Whatever to give them notice.  Dont bother with the fees either.  Go and get them to return your money and if they agree - take back whatever they will give you and then file a claim for the rest.  Just remember not to sign anything else. Take the money first! </p>
              <p>I dont think the law will allow them to add in this or that charges since the intention of the cancellation act is to allow you to be put in the position you were before - them with no money and you with all yr money.</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>For those have gotten their refund from S&amp;B, can you kindly contract me @ ongkl.hong@yahoo.com.sg.</p>
              <p>I need support from you guys as I have already filed with CASE. And a mediation session will be arranged anytime from now.</p>
              <p>If nothing can be settled thru mediation, then we've to go to SCT. My officer-in-charge told me it'll be best for me to get someone's (also a victim as me) help.</p>
              <p>Appreciate your help plz...</p>
              <p>I've signed up a $10K contract with S&amp;B for 10 years! My contract wasn't written any 'cooling off period'. When CASE questioned S&amp;B, they strongly claimed that they're NOT a TIME SHARE company, hence their clients are not entitled or the 5 days cooling off period!</p>
              <p>We also questioned S&amp;B about the price difference for the packages, as we found out from the forums that people are paying different prices compared to ours. S&amp;B just brushed off and said that they're just forum users only, it's as though forum users are just there to make noise.</p>
              <p>Hence, I really need help from you all.. to have a refund..</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Janethong - since S&amp;B has stated that they are not time-share, then go file your claim at the SCT. They are opened during lunch or you can download a form - fill in the details and then fax it in.  Think you can send your $10 by cheque.  Check the SCT website.</p>
              <p>Your case - if I am not wrong will be misrepresentation.  Most of us got conned into signing for timeshare or timeshare-esque contracts.  Usually that we would enjoy certain discounts which do not pan out when you actually try to book.  State down what you were told before you signed up and what you are offered after you signed up and if the description do not match - then you have them on misrepresentation.</p>
              <p>SCT procedure requires you to attend consultation and then if both parties cannot settle - the case will be heard before a referee.  If they dont turn up at the consultation, you might get a default order which means you can go do your seizure against them after they fail to meet the payment date.</p>
              <p>Good luck!</p>

              <p>Janethong - Let's put it this way - your $10 goes a lot further in SCT and you are more likely to see results at SCT than at CASE.  In any event - hope your mediation is fruitful.  I have not heard of any successful cases though - but we will keep our fingers crossed for you!</p>
              <p>Hope you get your money back soon!</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">To all who is a victim of S&amp;B</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Till to date, there are about 4 or 5 of the victims whom have successfully got their refund thru STC. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I will be submitting my case soonest to STC. Advices that I received form those who won their case with STC as follows: </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">1) Be calm.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">2) Jot down every bit of the entire conversation and any corrs as well.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">3) Fight for you not for others or Spore. You will understand more on this statement during the mediation. Some victims came too hard asking the Judge to sue S&amp;B on the fact that S&amp;B is doing scam etc. The judge can’t intervene in this manner as STC is meant to settle the situation amicably.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">4) Submit your case based on MISREPRESENTATION, focus to obtain REFUND ON YOUR MONEY but not to cancel your Membership. STC do not handle any membership cancellation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">5) STC will offer 30% or 50% refund in the beginning provided S&amp;B is agreeable. It totally depends on u if u r fine with the percentage. Some insists on 100% refund. Than the case will be brought forward again. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">6) Do take note, S&amp;B has change come of the wordings in the contract. They have added some new clauses. Go thru the contracts with someone that is well verse with it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The more victims come out and claim at STC, this will lead to further investigation. I have friends who used to work at S&amp;B and claimed that their business strategy is utterly ruthless. Different members were offered different membership fees. What was promise during the sales speech doesn’t come true. It’s an expensive lesson to all including myself. Please pursue this to STC. It cost $10 and a bit of your time. If you win, help others. If you loose, at least we try and take it that the lost is an investment that doesn’t pull thru and cont to help others.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Prepare yourself during the mediation. Judge will give a hard time so as to prepare you mentally. Many will simply wont bother to go thru the hassle, but for those who won, its worth it! Good Luck! </span></p>

              <p>HI Castle</p>
              <p>When you say GMC promised to refund you 100%, did they give you anything in writing or just verbal ? Did you get any orders from SCT or help from CASE etc ?</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I joined that membership last Jan 2010. Sadly, I only got suspicious this week coz I've been chasing them since end Jan for travel quotation and they just kept telling me that they're working on it and will get back to me. Only yesterday that I decided to go to their office at Maxwell to chase them personally but when I got there the office was close. Only yesterday did I search about Glitterati...<br>I need your help on how I can get my money back. I paid 3800. <br>I dont remember the name of the consultant...so stupid of me...</p>
              <p>Can any of you help me on how I can get my money back?</p>
              <p>Please contact me at this number: 82382986..</p>
              <p>I badly need advice on this...</p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>

              <p>did you try going to their office? They have 2 offices on the 4th floor of the building. Both seems to be closed and no one have been accessing for a few days according to a lady working in a nearby unit on the same floor. Not sure if this means they have closed for good. Will be verifying this and maybe planning some actions. If you interested to join, email me. </p>
              <p>Does any one know since the company is registered as a LIMITED EXEMPT PRIVATE COMPANY, if the directors of this company is liable for anything ?</p>

              <p>They have stopped replying to my emails that inquire about my refund!</p>
              <p>I joined on feb 4 and cancelled my subcription the very next day... I am due a refund of 950SGD which is after a 500SGD cancellation fee. I am accepting my losses of 500SGD at this stage and just wanna see the remaining balance of 950SGD. They were due to refund me 2-5 weeks after feb 5th. Needless to say it hasn't happened yet despite their email saying that they would.</p>
              <p>Since i am overseas they had to refund to amount into my C/C.</p>
              <p>Any advice fellas? I am even getting scared that the would bill my C/C some funny items in the future...</p>

              <p>good morning everyone. I have also filed mine through CASE. The officer-in-charge of my case told me that she will try her best and hopefully S&amp;B will respond to them. But I'm just so worried because different people from S&amp;B are sending me email saying that they will get their lawyer to act on their behalf if we don't settle the outstanding payment. Last time, we even got harrassed or threatened that they have all our information and we cannot get away with it. I'm really worried about this. I'm not really after the refund anymore, I just want them to cancel the contract and stop this.</p>
              <p>Can anybody advise me on this?</p>
