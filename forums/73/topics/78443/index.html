            <div class='col-md body'>Hello fellow networkers<br><br>I'm not good in drawing curiousity, so I might as well be frank and straigtforward:<br><br>Monarch Health Sciences - put together by former executives of another MLM giant*, as well as a team of professionals in the fields of weight management, obesity, psychology and health, is opening its door in Singapore in couple of weeks' time, right after its opening in USA in January, and Canada in April (thus makes Singapore the 3rd country in operation)<br><br>This is not another "weight loss" company that deals with just pills and stuff - but complete solutions in dealing with weight management. People who have been benefited including famous talkshow host, and weight loss consultants**.<br><br>The leaders and executives are already in town to deal with the launch matters as well as to meet up with local networkers to discuss on possibilities to work together.<br><br>I can go on and on and talk about this upcoming ground floor opportunity by taking up massive space and bandwidth of this forum, or you might as well give me a call at <strong>90660799</strong> for instant information. Sorry I have to make you call, as I will be running around the town to meet up with local pioneers for the rest of the weeks, thus little time to visit this forum.<br><br>Some people may tell you not to buy this "ground floor opportunity" or "pioneer status" saying, or your leader will tell you to stay focused with just one thing (in other words: stick to his organisation). I cant disagree with them, but I do have answers to justify them, and I will save it for the discussion when you come meet us. So, come meet us, yea?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">*this I can't reveal for principle matter, what I can say is: it's been voted People's Choice for 6 consecutive years, you figure the rest <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">**again, for the same reason I was not suppose to quote celebrity's name without approval from the corporate</span></div>

The ball is in your court now, if you are open to take a look at what Monarch is bringing to you, join us in our "Meet The C.O.O" session this Thursday, May 13, 6-8pm at Peninsula Plaza, 27th floor.

            <div class='col-md body'>The Meeting the C.O.O. session has been a successful event. Many have shown up.<br><br>I had the pleasure of meeting a couple of extraordinary people (you know who you are) who shown up, looked and discussed about the exciting opportunity, and even seized it immediately and signed up on the spot, thank you for your belief in us. You have my salute!<br><br>I would like to share with everyone this article I once read in an established publication, the researcher was comparing the aggressiveness of Hongkong's economy to Singapore's, they found out partly it has to do with people's attitude towards life. This is how the author described it:<br><br>When Hongkongers see money falling from sky, they will all rush towards and snatch like nobody's business. When Singaporeans see money falling from sky, they wait till the money reach the ground, wait till someone walks up, picks up a piece, checks on it and says, "hey, it's real money!", then everyone will start rushing towards and snatch...<br><br>A good point to ponder huh?</div>
