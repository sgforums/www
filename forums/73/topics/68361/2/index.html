Finally when comes to customer like us, already mark up a lot.<br><br>in MLM, others I don't know, but let me tell you something in Amway. in Amway, product price for everyone are the same, regardless your pin level and how long you join.<br>a RM20 products, you order from warehouse will be RM20, your upline even if he is a crown ambassador order the same product, he will have to pay RM20 too!!<br>there is no such thing as normal distributor RM20, diamond RM18 and crown ambassador RM16 in Amway.</span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From what i understand, MLM's about recruiting others to sell your products (correct me if i'm wrong) but even so this is still the core of their business venture.<br><br>Okay, back to the recruiting people :<br><br>There are 6.2 billion people on Earth today (roughly), let's say that they are all in MLM or Amway or NTI or whatever shit it is.<br>If they are all in it, that means that the company is making a loss all the time considering MLM is on a finite scale.<br>When the last 6.2 billionth person is recruited who else is there left to recruited - or rather con - that is unless he manages to get birds and frogs talking that is..<br>If you're gonna argue that it's impossible to get 6.2 billion people. I would just point it out to you that there can only be a certain grp of people that are interested and the rest are obviously not. SO when your pool of interested people is exhausted wouldn't you say that the term "making big bucks" takes a whole new perspective to it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i read with a lot of interest on these topics on MLM and Network Marketing in this forums. Sadly, most of the views, arguments (&amp; conflicts) are between a Amway guys and a bunch of others that are Anti-MLM (not sure if it is Anti-Amway).<br><br>Anyway, successful MLMers will not bother to waste time with the bunch of Anti-MLMers.<br><br>First of all, I am in MLM but not Amway. I am still building and I am proud to say my network is growing by the month. But then again, I must also say that I am not at all reach the level of success (anyway I am serious in it for 1+ yr only).<br><br>So facts just to share (no need to bash me if you dis-agree).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MLM vs Traditional Model</span><br>MLM base its business model on direct selling, just like how Dell sell PCs. Instead of channeling the bulk of the cost into advertising, this money are channel into paying distributors like myself.<br><br>In traditional retail model, all the cost goes into the various middleman. In any marketing/econ books, you will learn that the cost of a product is only 15% or less than what you actually paid for. It varies also with the level of advertisements. Take for example, the cost of Pepsi is about 6-7 cents but you actually pay $1 for it. When do those money goes ?<br><br>So in Network Marketing (NM), we cut all these middleman &amp; advert cost and pass back to the distributors. I do not know about other MLM company. We have done our study and 70% of the products cost below retail products you get from Cosmetics/Skin care stores or GNC/Unity/Guardian (like for like). The other 30% is unique &amp; patented products market don't have.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MLM is not all about Recruiting</span><br>Yes, many new up &amp; coming company focus a lot of recruiting. A good NM company must have<br>- good, unique consumable products<br>- good R&amp;D so products are up-to-date.<br>At the end of the day, you can have all the "amazing comp plan", but products are the only think that can sustain your consumers. Companies that do not base their vision on good products are essentially 'black sheeps' to the industry.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Saturation</span><br>When will MLM be saturated ? The answer is it will never be. For Example, will TV be saturated ? No, for more than 40 years, TV are still the top sellers in any electrical store (go ask Best, Harvey Norman). You will still be in biz if you are selling new-technology TVs at good price. Unless you are selling B&amp;W TVs, then too bad. That's why R&amp;D is the most important thing in a MLM (mentioned above pt). You can see whether the company is in the biz for long term by their R&amp;D strength. Many MLM companies have only a few products or their products remain the same for the last 5 years, then those are craps.<br><br>Back to saturation, YES, there are 6.2 million people on earth. Someone have actually calculated is we recruit people at a simple rate of 2 people a day, in 45 days we would have recruited the entire world population. But the question, has that happened ? No !<br><br>Everyday, there are people recruited, dropping out, MLM company close-shop...and the most important things that there are also millions of people turning 18 every single day. So how to saturate ?<br><br>NM is not a gimmick or a scam, it is a trend that will be here to stay as it had been for the past 50 years.<br><br>If you have not know, the concept of "Departmental Store" was outlawed in the 1920's and yet it is one of the most successful retailing concept in the 20th century.<br><br>Insurance was also a "scam" in the 1970/80s. Today, "financial advisors" is a respected career.<br><br>I shall stop here for the moment for you to think about.<br><br>I understand some of us here had bad experience with MLM. But I hope to engage in constructive and fruitful discussion, not blind bashing and throwing of temper.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>=========================<br>successful people build network, others look for work - Robert T Kiyosaki</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi bear<br><br>I have read most of those you have posted there... some before I joined, some after. All these articles are really worth reading.<br><br>Nevertheless its up to individual to believe whether it works or not.<br><br>On the similar note, I could easily pull out a hundred other links that promote the idea of MLM or Network Marketing. so there is little point in getting into it.<br><br>What is most important to know that MLM is legitimate and is here to stay. Then there are good companies offering good products, then of course a lot of other jumping in to make fast buck with fake products/fake services.<br><br>Someone did mentioned somewhere that there are people in financial problem after doing MLM for some time. He must have joined the wrong company and the wrong leaders. Good companies don't requires you to load up so much stocks...thus we always talk about low risk.<br><br>Then there are people talking about their failure in MLM....naturally! Its a business, and not everyone is expected to succeed. We just have to take a practical view of things. Just sit back and think, how many entreprueners have come and gone on the last 20 years before we got Mr Sim and his Creative Tech ? How much money was lost down the drain by all those failed entrepreuners ? It also doesn't add up ? We lost thousands of entrepreuners to have one Sim. The law of averages is the same whether you venture into traditional business or NM business.<br><br>The most important part is this, people venture into the MLM business with a employee/job-seeker mindset or some with a "try-try" mindset ... NO ! These people are sure to fail, you must think like a business owner to understand the little things that will help you succeed.<br><br>Network Marketing is for Everybody, but not Everybody is for Network Marketing.<br><br>From a more neutral standpoint, check out the Singapore Direct Selling Association (www.dsas.org.sg) . There will be details on Pyramid vs MLM and a list of associated members. That is a good list of start thinking, further from that, you have to consider their 4Ps.<br><br>At the end of the day, if u have doubts, don't start. Cos you are gonna be just another one of the statistics.<br><br></div>
