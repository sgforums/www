If you owned a company, of course you will employ someone. So you pay someone for 8hrs per day and buy his professional knowledge to assist you in your business.<br>in MLM, you no need pay a cent. All you need to do is to recruit new members, and change their products from X-brand to MLM brand. Change their buying habits from going to hypermarket to purchase from own MLM business.<br><br>MLM is not that horrible, we heard many people failed in many business and went bankrupt, or some even suicide.<br>But did you hear any news that someone failed in MLM &amp; suicide?</span></span></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Why should we study why people hate MLM?<br><br>Simple. Dude, they are your customers. And there's a limited number of customers on earth.<br><br>Many other companies also mark up their price 3 - 4 times. Apple Ipod cost only a quarter of its sales price to purchase.<br><br>Running a MLM is a business. True.</div>
