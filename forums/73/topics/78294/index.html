            <div class='col-md body'>Just a question for jedi.. have you ever thought that you are under the propaganda of Amway and those success stories are just fakes? I have been to a MLM company , indeed i see people who are successful with really encouraging life stories , yet i see only 17 out of 600 people? In the course of 2 years , membership grew from 100+ to 600.<br><br>One guy out of the 17 achieved the top status in 9 months , out of the other 500 , none did? Isn't this questionable?<br><br>And also , i notice that for the whole day , they kept telling me about the positive side , their stories , how their products helped , how the company is legal , how MLM can help you achieve success.<br><br>Not once did i encounter a person who told me of the actual METHOD he used to get to maybe.. 3rd highest?<br><br>Which got me thinking... , you may know the way to success , but what you know is from ONE person , or ONE company. Take everything with a pinch of salt , find out more from other sources.<br><br>I think people are buying this "hard work pays off" thing , work hard and you will get there! Sadly , how many actually do no matter how hard they work? Are you getting what im saying? I don't see the figures , i'm sure you don't either if you seriously ask yourself this question.<br><br>Where are the figures for those who managed to ahieve the top spot? Those who joined last year? or recently? or in Amway's case , 5yrs ago? How many?<br><br>I think this is similar to blindly believing in God to the point that you diss other religions.<br><br>I am not saying God is a product or that if you believe in God you will make money. But the level of belief in the MLM system is absolutely mind bloggling.<br><br>Also , i find that the revised MLM Act from the MTI states that a company cannot sell the distributor a product for resale and the company or the person selling is NOT allowed to get a commission of it. The product sold must also be sold at cost or discount price , after which the product may only be used for demonstration purposes.<br><br>This is in direct contrast to binary marketing isn't it? I have a friend in NTIparis , i was shocked to hear that he was in it , he paid 288 i think , to enter and he must ask 2 friends to join or his account won't be opened. What his account is and how it works , i have no idea , i only know he is in NTI and he paid to enter. When my other friend in another MLM company asked him abt the products NTIparis is selling , he doesn't know.<br><br>What am i saying here? I am saying that these MLM companies , although some are legit , some are not. Some may succeed , but those who succeed essentially feed off the mouths of those who don't. Morally right? Morals should actually be left out of this , it is a never ending topic.<br><br>Also , MLM companies "make use" of distributors to spread the word of their products , see this.<br><br>You know many fail , you also know a few succeed. Many VS a few. Another thing , the many who fail , they probably at least sold one product or just spread the word. Add them together , the company is making tons of publicity at no expense as many failed.<br><br>MLMS may be good , but why are so many who are aware of it BEFORE they were subject to it's tactics against it? My god sister went down for a job interview introduced by her friend , her friend wouldnt say anything abt the job and when she went down and heard it was a MLM related company , she got so angry they never contacted each other again. Breaking up friendships? You may think you are selling something good to your friends but are you really? NuSkin? ALA? Magnetic Beds?<br><br>I did some research on these 3.<br><br>NuSkin basically rubs off your skin , it's strong as hell , that's why it is so "effective".<br><br>ALA has 2 types. S-ALA and R-ALA. S-ALA is a byproduct created when producing R-ALA , it has no benefits when absorbed and may even hinder the helpful R-ALA type.R-ALA is produced in the human body and helps fight free radicals that cause harm.<br>ALA is Alpha Lipoic Acid btw.<br><br>Magnetic Beds, i think someone here mentioned about strip magnets and circular magnets , strip magnets being the better version. Not sure about it , didn't go much into it.<br><br>To me , MLM is making use of distributors to make use of friends and to those who succeed , good for them , but ask about their social life? Apart from company staff , who else do they hang out with?<br><br>I would love to take a neutral stand , but the points of arguments are not convincing enough to actually say that MLM is a beneficial company that helps you achieve financial freedom IF you work hard for it.<br><br>Let's not forget the law. What your company does may be legal , how the company works may not be.</div>

Breaking up friendships? </blockquote><span style="color: blue;"><span class="large">here comes another long question...<br><br>first, as what I can see, in your mind still hanging a question "how many succeed and how many failed"<br><br>I can tell you why people can success in anything, because they learn the mistake from those failure BUT they didn't give up.<br><br>what I can say about your god sister, she is not matured enough. her friend introduce her a MLM company, it is also a job opportunity that you can make some money!<br>Is it really that working means MUST sit in office?<br><br>to me, NO!! as long as it is a opportunity and it's making money, then go ahead.<br>I didn't lose any friendship with anyone at all!! my friend don't want to join can still be my users, if they don't like the products they can ask for refund.<br>example my friend using Darlie, I ask them buy from me. So if they don't like the taste or whatever, I pay them back 100%. If they like it, then continue to use it.<br>I don't see any chance for me to break the friendship.</span></span></div>
