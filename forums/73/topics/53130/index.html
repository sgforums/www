Now a Silicon Valley company believes Linux will do the same in the consumer electronics market. But here the incumbent isn't Microsoft. It's Alameda-based Wind River Systems, which has established itself over the past two decades as the leader in embedded software.<br><br>Lotus creator says there's no killer app for Linux, Jul 21 2003<br><br>Mitch Kapor, creator of the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet and co-founder of the Lotus Development Corporation, is leading a project called Chandler to create an open-source personal information manager package.<br><br>Apache Updates Popular HTTP Server, Jul 20 2003<br><br>Primarily a bug fix, Version 1.3.28 improves on 1.3.27 with more than a dozen patches including a new "ap_register_cleanup_ex" API function which allows for a "magic" cleanup function to be run at register time rather than at cleanup time.<br><br>Red Hat to change development model, abandon shrinkwrap, Jul 20 2003<br><br>Red Hat, the leading American distributor of Linux, is changing the way its distributions are developed the company is expected to announce Monday. Red Hat has also decided to abandon the shrinkwrap box retail channel, company representatives said late Saturday, though there is some doubt that this will be part of Monday's announcement.<br><br>IBM Servers to Pair Linux, New PowerPC Chips, Jul 20 2003<br><br>In a quest for a bigger piece of the entry-level server market, IBM Corp. has drawn up a three-year plan for producing and marketing systems that pair Linux and IBM's own 64-bit PowerPC family of processors, sources report.<br>According to sources, the Armonk, N.Y., company plans to take on Sun Microsystems Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. with Linux servers priced at the "enterprise entry level," which IBM defines as less than $25,000. Although the current share of Linux servers running on Power processors is marginal, IBM reportedly projects nearly a 20-fold increaseÂ—to almost half-a-million unitsÂ—by 2006.<br><br>Open source and liability, Jul 19 2003<br><br>Webmaster's note: I read but chose not to post Charles Cooper's original piece. It is linked in the article.<br>In response to the July 18 Perspectives column by Charles Cooper, "The next big Linux controversy":<br><br>In your piece, you wrote: "It's the next big Linux controversy: Who should be liable if customers wind up using software that was created from misappropriated intellectual property?"<br><br>Interesting question. But it has the same answer as this one: Who should be liable if (Insert closed-source vendor here)'s customers wind up using software that was created from misappropriated intellectual property?<br><br>Across the Country, Local Governments Are Giving Linux a Hard Look, Jul 19 2003<br><br>From Florida to Washington State, Linux appears to be infiltrating the IT departments of local governments across the country in much the same way it sprouted up in corporate IT shops: from the bottom up.<br><br>Toshiba notebook has Linux kybosh built in, Jul 19 2003<br><br>A Toshiba notebook is being furnished with Windows XP Home on a DVD so preventing end users from building dual boot systems.<br>According to a reader, the 17-inch Toshiba laptop, the P25, is advertised as being provided with Win XP Home.<br><br>But, he says, it doesn't come with the usual setup CDs for Windows, but instead uses a DVD with an already setup version of Windows XP Home and then transfers it to the notebook's hard drive.<br><br>SCO readies new Linux licensing program, Jul 19 2003<br><br>Webmaster's note: SCO must be afraid we're going to forget about them<br>The SCO Group is preparing a new Linux licensing program that it claims will allow users of the open-source operating system to run Linux without fear of litigation.<br><br>While the majority of Linux customers probably would not participate in a SCO licensing program, Haff predicted some companies might be willing to pay SCO for the security of knowing they would not be sued. SCO is "hoping that even if 99 percent of Linux customers laugh in their face, that there will be sufficient large companies who, for what is presumably going to be a relative drop in the bucket of their IT budgets, can potentially eliminate a cloud over their heads," he said.<br><br>Kernel release: 2.4.22-pre7, Jul 18 2003<br><br>2.4.22-pre7 has been released today.<br>See changelog for full details.<br>Files added: 585<br>Files changed: 2771<br>Files removed: 286<br><br>At Web sites, Windows outpaces Linux, Jul 18 2003<br><br>But the 88,400 versions of Windows Server 2003 account for only a very small fraction of the total market. There are 4.7 million active sites that use Microsoft's Web server, Netcraft said. Apache, which most often runs on Linux or various versions of Unix, is used at 13.2 million active Web sites.<br><br>Kernel release: 2.4.22-pre6-ac1, Jul 18 2003<br><br>2.4.22-pre6-ac1 has been released today.<br>See changelog for full details.<br>Files added: 305<br>Files changed: 728<br>Files removed: 23<br><br>SMBs see open source as alternative to Microsoft, Jul 18 2003<br><br>"At the very smallest end of the market, the buying pattern of businesses is very similar to that of consumers. They're more willing to experiment," he said. "They're very price-conscious, and the [logistical] impact of bringing Linux into a company with three employees or five employees is pretty minimal compared with bringing it to an enterprise with thousands of employees."<br><br>Linux, Open Source Remain Thorns in Microsoft's Side, Jul 18 2003<br><br>Linux and open-source software remain high on the list of core threats to Microsoft's business going forward.<br>In an analyst and press teleconference to discuss the Redmond software maker's fourth-quarter and full fiscal 2003 financial results on Thursday, Microsoft's chief financial officer John Connors outlined the five largest risks and drivers to Microsoft's business going forward.<br><br>SuSE 8.2: More Desktop Progress, Jul 18 2003<br><br>In all, SuSE 8.2 doesn't bring a lot to the table that SuSE 8.1 users don't already enjoy, but it does continue to polish the distribution into something serious desktop users will find comfortable and well designed. While earlier in its history, SuSE's distributions often suffered from a lack of refinement, this is certainly not the case any longer.<br><br>Linux Rules the Day at CA World, Jul 18 2003<br><br>CA is also proposing its current Event Notification Facility (ENF) as a stand-alone product for use in the Linux community. ENF is a set of interfaces that allow things like security products to directly plug into the Linux kernel without having to make source-level modifications.<br><br>Red Hat lets people try new Linux core, Jul 18 2003<br><br>Red Hat has made good on a promise to let people try out Linus Torvalds' test version of the new 2.6 kernel, or heart, of Linux. The Linux seller said Monday that it would release 2.6.0-test1 RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) update files.<br><br>Portable Ogg Vorbis decoder "ready for market", Jul 18 2003<br><br>FineArch, Inc., Tokyo Japan based semiconductor LSI design company, developed the system IP to decode the next generation digital music compression format, Ogg Vorbis(http://www. vorbis.com). FineArch successfully completed the Ogg vorbis sytstem IP to run at 12 Mhz. This is about 1/6 of the clock speed required to decode Ogg Vorbis with a single CPU system. This ultra low power IP fits well with the todayÂ’s portable music player market where battery life is critical factor.<br><br></div>
