I believed that there are other reasons for Alex to state that.<br><br>You do not need to listen to those leaders, yet how much do you really understand doing biz or even MLM? &amp; when do you think you can or how sure and confident are you that you can? You need to set your target, unfortunately, I don't see any from you.<br><br>What do you know about Share again?<br><br>As usual, Bill Gates doesn't talk about programming. You can be a very very good programmer, but seldom can your mindset be the same like him.  If not you wont be in present situation. It's not the person, but the mindset and his horizon that determine one's success or failure.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

But hey, one company(figuratively speaking) to provide for Singapore?<br><br>There is a point of equlibrium in all markets. And that happens to be the saturation point also.<br><br>There will come a point of saturation. Paper, stationary, toothpaste, toilet paper, hairdressors, transport. These are all consumuable products and services.

The other point to consider is patenting.<br><br>Photocopier industry is now ruled by Canon at 70% market share (if I remember the number correctly). It's freaking profitable and it's not a consumable product.<br><br>Why not enter into this industry?<br><br>Canon entered the market to push out Xerox. Canon patented what Xerox didn't. 2000++ patents on one machine.<br><br>(Singapore has only less than 500 for the whole country.)<br><br>Let's go back to the Gillette example. It's clearly a consumable product with a huge market.<br><br>Why don't others enter this consumable market?<br><br>Patents again.<br><br>Gillette patents everything from the angle the blade is tilted to how the grip is made. Everything.<br><br>Going back to toothpaste, it's the other consumable market. Why not more enter? Patents again.
