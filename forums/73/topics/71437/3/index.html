            <div class='col-md body'>had been reading the forum as a guest but only recently feel the urge to join.here's my feel,in mlm ,either u like it or u hate it...however mlm is definitely here to stay,although it will not replace traditional marketing totally..<br>however,mlm is currently at the stage of insurance industry was few yrs ago,bad name,black sheeps.etc  give it a few more yrs and it will gain the due recognization like insurance... of cos we oso need to think why ppl dun like it...some new distributors dunno anything then want to ask ppl out to present,end up throwing smoke on their prospects,thus give poor image..another is bad companies and digusied pyramid schemes..anyway we have to know network and mlm are different. mlm refers to the structure,the system but network marketing refers to a marketing technique thru your pool of ppl you know..u can be doing network marketing in other industry as insurance,property agents.etc   however,what MLMers should do is to be more sincere and not try to seem as though only trying to earn money from friends..this is main reason ppl dun like network marketing and not just in MLM. any comments?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just by simply reading a few threads in this forum one will realise Alex is Pro MLM, I can respect that.<br><br>But to compare God and the Christian faith to the MLM industry is the most stupid thing I have ever heard.<br><br>God is about love and freewill.<br><br>MLM is about greed, money, monthly maintenance, quotas and points.<br><br>If you don't have something else better to compare things with, then please don't. You are only setting yourself up to look like a buffon.<br><br>And for a business man with businesses in several countries you do seem to have a lot of time on your hands judgng from the time stamps of your posts.<br><br>If you are really successful in life, do yourself a favour (and your family if you have one) spend some quality time with, instead of wasting time here trying to defend MLM companies.</div>
