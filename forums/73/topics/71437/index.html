I don't encourage New company as it's like traditional biz, how well-plan and focus are they? New company need to look at different aspects of biz pt of views.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I look all from entreprise point of view and this can be related to both MLM &amp; traditional biz.<br><br>What I will take note :<br>1- It's NOT ONLY on local market,  not how many countries it has gone into as it'll means that there are lesser overseas opportunities. Market saturation?<br>2- How huge is the market? Are you bonded by some hidden rules?<br>If you want to go to an undeveloped country, are you allow to do it?<br>3- How long and how sure are you that it's goin to work? Looking at it with different pt of views &amp; perspectives. Not just what you tink alone. Of course, not many ppl can see foresights like Bill Gates, but you might be able to see if you can analyse the whole global market trends, directions, cycles and future.<br>4- Company's vision. Ask around for vision, it's not very surprising to know many don't know.<br>5- Boss's mindset.<br>6- Comparing on similar products, How unique and competitive?  Or there are too many options?<br>7- Safety of the products.How safe? Any national or government test report. I don't mean clinc trials n testings. Side effects after several years?<br>8- Education system is important. It's not just how good the products are, how grand the company is, the important thing is whether are they turning the mindset of normal people to being salesman or entrepreneur. Entrepreneur do not mean the context of S'pore.<br>9- How fair is the plan and what are the hidden factors? See it from  both angles, from the top and the bottom. If it's not healthy, you wont have or not many will be able to have what they claim.<br>10- Team players. You might have a good company yet the team might be lousy. How strong and motivated are the team players? What mindset are they? Do you have alot of successful people from other industries, PHD, directors. They might be experts in their own field, but they are not experts in MLM. Most of them are very employee mindset and boast of their capabilities....... If someone said that he has changed so many MLM companies and he's an expert, then may I ask is he working for a MLM company or is MLM system working for him?<br><br>Mix around with the people you want to be, and you will be like one of them.<br><br>I hope this helps.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Mindset!<br><br>Some are wealthy and others might even be filthy wealthy. The key thing is how much are you goin 2 earn?<br><br>I guess you <strong>never did biz </strong>before........... What do you think is the best earning products or parts in a car? Do you think a tire shop only sells tires? In addition,  do you know how many closed down every year?  How fast do the tires need to be change? That also determine when will be the next sales. Why shall the client also come back to you for the 2nd time when there are so many choices, <strong>why YOU</strong>?<br><br>For your info, Market in electronics is saturated with big brands. To be able to have a part of the pie and a pie size that is about the same like Sony, Sharp, Panasonic, you have to have different marketing strategy. Orelse you are just another small fly!!<br><br>Have you thought why did the old models last longer? It used to last like 10years, but recent products is already a good one to last up to 3 yrs.<br><br>Have you thought why did Sony only started selling TV, yet what are the range of products now? Everything in Electronics.<br><br>Can I know how many TV  do you have in your house? How long do you change your TV? Do you always buy from the same shop and at the same place?<br><br>&amp; if you are comparing with God, then  you are wrong!! <strong>He is not<br>a product!</strong><br><br>MLM is an industry but it does not mean that every companies is able to work, excel and even have more rooms to move. Try goin 2 China, you will understand what are the brands that are so common that no one is interested to do a biz out of it. In addition, there are still consumers yet how many more will be attracted to them as biz and really earn big bucks?<br><br>Of course, many aren't even able to go overseas.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

I am running my own business when I am 21.<br><br>if you talk about car, tire is a consumable item for a car, that's why we have to replace it from time to time.<br>Same to our home, household products are consumable item, everyday we brush our teeth, we will have to buy our toothpaste &amp; toothbrush maybe every 6-8 months.<br>So do you think market for household consumables item will be saturated?<br><br>About why me? ha!<br>this is depends on how unique your product is! and of course, how you handle this with your competitors.<br>If you have a product that is really good, and you applied patent for it, so you are the only one on this earth that can sell this product and use this formula to produce the product.<br>Do you think your customer will run away?<br>Powerful &amp; Huge MLM company will setup their own R&amp;D and then patent their new technology, example Sylodent from Amway &amp; ap-24 from NuSkin.<br>Of course you can insist on buying X-Brand toothpaste, if you are willing to risk your enamel layer, then just go ahead.

What are the usual companies that are staying around? They are usually the big ones. Small ones come and go without leaving anyone any impression they were there in the first place.<br><br>There's more that meets the eye to this saturation thing.<br><br>Let's take a look at the razor blade industry. Name one company that dominates this industry.<br><br>Gillette.<br><br>Maybe it's me or what, but I don't see many other companies selling razor blade. Is this market saturation? Why don't people enter this industry? People also change blades very often.</div></blockquote>Not everyone in this world change blades very often, and also NOT everyone use razor blade!<br>we can assume that this earth is equal, means we have 50% male and 50% female.<br>then we categorize them into 5 cat, A (from 0-20yrs), B (from 21-40yrs), C (from 41-60 Yrs), D (from 61-80yrs) and E (80 &amp; above)<br>People now can live until average of 67 years old.<br>So only category B, C &amp; half of D need to use razor blade.<br>It's just 25% people need razor blade in this world. But 100% people on Earth need toothpaste &amp; toothbrush and syampoo!!<br><br>But look at household consumables item, even when you are just a 1 month old baby, your mom have to wash your clothed and change your napkins. At the same time, your mom &amp; dad have to clean the house &amp; brush their teeth and etc!!<br>So, you actually consuming consumables item even when you are 1 month only!!<br>When you get old, even if you have no more real teeth (maybe due to insist of using non-sugarfree toothpaste), you will still use toothpaste to brush your fake teeth.<br><br>You start brushing your teeth from yr 1 to the day you die, but if you are a guy, you start to use razor blade when you are 20.<br>Can you see the difference between razor blade &amp; consumable item?<br><br>If you wanna compare with computer parts, can!! let's talk about HP printer.<br>in a HP LaserJet printer, there will be many parts such as heating elements and etc. Although HP printer is very famous in the world, but HP is the only company on Earth that produce heating elements for HP printers.<br>But let's look at toner &amp; cartridge, a lot of remanufacturer toner and refill cartridge running in the market.<br>Why these competitors do NOT want to produce heating elements and they start to bang the toner market?!<br>This is because to a printer, toner is a consumable item and heating elements is just a spare parts. Consumable item will never ever be saturated BUT if they start to produce heating elements, they will be in deep shit.<br><br>cheers! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
