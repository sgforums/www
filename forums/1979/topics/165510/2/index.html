(600) or either that when they clear the ghouls/treants and come for the talon/necromancer, you aim at the spot which they would stand at to attack it.<br><br>the other way would be the backstabbing/sidestabbing way, which is alot easier as they're usually caught off guard. (i havent met one who ran away before they got stunned, only does who evaded it accdiently cause they were after a hero)<br><br>so, generally these are the only 2 ways to use it. by anticipating their movement towards you, and by casting it when they're off guard.</div>
