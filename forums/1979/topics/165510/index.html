            <div class='col-md body'>I kinda feel at the start she can get VERY gay (not that i'm complaining.) With 3 attack spells, she easily pawns any other AGI or INT hero about the same level as her.<br><br>For example...lvl 9 bone fletcher...aprox...800 hp? All I have to do is come from the back, cast Light Strike, stun 1.6s, Dragon Slave, and Laguna Blade it, and its dead instantly, even at full mana and HP.<br><br>I mean...its so gay, I've killed tons of heros at full life in just slightly over 2 seconds. Plus a lvl 3 Laguna Blade coolsdown in about 90 seconds. Its kinda amusing about mid - late game when people at 2/3rd life think its alright and you just come out and zap them. =)<br><br>Pretty funny yesterday though...had a score of 38 2, and I pratically owned everyone in everything. Higest normal damage, higest HP, fastest attack speed, higest mana pool and best spells.<br><br>Items?<br>Power Threads<br>Guinsoo<br>Scepter<br>Refresher Orb<br>Eye of Skadi<br>Hyperstone<br><br>Initially all I did was go around blasting people with my spells...but at around lvl 20 I realized my normal attack was the higest, plus my speed was pretty damn fast too, so I kinda got lazy and just decided to use my normal attack...lol. Stupid Razor was scared of me even after I was at 1/2 life and I just used my Laguna Blade on someone else. And when I was pretty much VERY lazy I would just come out and hex someone, Laguna Blade it, Refresh and Laguna Blade it again...damn that was fun.</div>
