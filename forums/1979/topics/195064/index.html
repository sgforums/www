It has yet to fail me since, but it is of course subject to change at any time. This skill build gives you the general guidelines you should take so that you can follow the strategies for the rest of the guide effectively. You may have to make a few small changes depending on your situation, such as getting Song of the Siren earlier due to frequent ambushes.<br><br>Maxing out Ensare as the primary skill since it is just so damn useful. This causes a hero to be unable to move up to five seconds, and vulnerable to damage, which makes this useful in many ways. Use it early game for saving yourself, to kill an enemy hero that is escaping with a small amount of HP (that happens frequently in early game), and even net a hero near the tower.<br><br>Now for the Mirror Image and Critical Strike abilities, I like to mix those up mostly, but placing Mirror Images higher up the ladder than Critical Strike. Why? Because the extra damage you get from critical strike, even in early game, can give you the little extra damage you need to finish off the hero. I rank Mirror Image higher than Critical Strike because you gain an extra image per level for the first three levels of Mirror Image, and the more images you have the more damage, and it'll overwhelm your enemy.<br><br>I don't get Song of the Siren until level 10 (on all of my skill builds for Naga, no matter how I mess around with the others earlier) because it just really isn't needed. I don't find myself getting ganked so hard during those first nine levels of early game. And if I do get ganked in some way, I have the high level of Mirror Images to use, so that the enemy doesn't know which naga to target. And if a hero still keeps on chasing, I have Ensare to hold him down for my escape.<br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>Item Build:<br><br>Early Game Item Options: This depends on the game mode.<br><br>-AP: Ring of Regeneration and 2 Ironwood Branches/1 Flask of Sapphire Water OR Start with nothing, buy a Ring of Health when you can afford (this will help you eventually towards Linken's Sphere)<br><br>-AR: Nothing, buy Ring of Health when you can afford OR Boots of Speed and 4-5 Ironwood Branches/2 Flasks of Sapphire Water OR Ring of Regeneration and 5 Ironwood Branches/ 2 Flasks of Sapphire Water (I never like getting more than 2 flasks, a waste of money, and you'll be selling the Ironwood Branches back)<br><br>Core Items:<br><br>- Treads<br>- Manta Style<br>- Two Yashas<br>- Linken's Sphere<br>- Heart of Torrasque<br><br>Why Linken's Sphere? With Linken's if your images get nuked by a spell, your Linken's will block it from the real Slithice, allowing you to cast another image spell (since you have two) to fight back, or cast Song of the Siren. Mana bonus allows for more imaging (and that ult is so costly), and you get an Agility ad HP bonus to your images.<br><br>Why Heart? Again, Very huge bonus to your HP, so now it's even harder for the enemy to destroy your images. With the regen of this and your Linken's, that makes +17 HP/sec. regen. You should be living at the enemy's base  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> .<br><br>Advanced Items:<br><br>- Butterfly (The evasion and agility will really help out you and your images, and the reason you're getting this later as a 'trade-in item' is because Yasha is more cost-effective earlier.)<br><br>Other Items Considering:<br><br>- Soul Booster (This item works fine as an optional item to Linken's Sphere, since Soul Booster costs 2400 less gold. Linken's Sphere helps out more in the long run, but if you aren't getting cash fast, and are you running out of Hp and Mana fast, I'd suggest you give Soul Booster a try.<br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>Buying Order:<br><br>Boots of Speed, Robe of Magi, Blade of Alacrity, Diffusal Blade, Blade of Alacrity, Boots of Elvenskin, Yasha, Gloves of Haste, Power Treads, Vitality Booster, Manta Style, Yasha, Perseverance, Ultimate Orb, Linken's Sphere, Boots of Travel, Messerschmidt's Reaver, Vitality Booster, Heart of Torrasque<br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>Why Not Other Orb Effects:<br><br>- S&amp;Y: A small percent chance for maim, while Purge on Diffusal is a definite chance. Plain and simple, you don't get anywhere as much benefit from S&amp;Y as you do from Manta Style.<br><br>- Cranium Basher: Images don't have extra damage or bash.<br><br>- Battle Fury: Images don't have extra damage or cleave.<br><br>- Satanic: You gain more HP bonuses from Heart of Terrasque, and images don't gain life leech anyways.<br><br>- Burize: A +damage item does not benefit images. Sure, the images will get the crit, but it is unnecessary when you already 45% crit.<br><br>- Eye of Skadi: Takes forever to farm this item, and the images will not even have the frost attack. Not worht it at all.<br><br>- Maelstrom: No. Images donÂ’t have chain lightning. No.<br><br>- Stygian Desolator: It is a thought, lowering the hero's armour so that thereÂ’s more wailing on him with images... No. Images just donÂ’t benefit because it is a +damage item.<br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>Items:<br><br>Images DO NOT benefit from:<br>Items that increase the attack damage DIRECTLY, (i.e. Divine Rapier)<br>Items that give bonus to regenerations, be it Health or Mana. (i.e. Perseverence)<br>Items that increase attack speed DIRECTLY, (i.e. Hyperstone)<br>Items that give bonus armor and spell resistance directly i.e. Planeswalker's Cloak, platemail/ chainmail<br>The Fountain<br><br>Images benefit from:<br>Items that increase the Attributes of a hero, (i.e. Ogre Axe, Bracers)<br>Items that give extra HP or MP, (i.e. Soul Booster)<br>Items that increase movement speed, (i.e. Boots of Speed, Sange and Yasha)<br><br>Special items:<br>1. Basher<br>The real hero can bash, but the images can do a fake bash, where you see the icon which lasts for the duration of the bash, but the hero is not really stunned.<br><br>If a unit is fake bashed, and your real hero bashes that hero, this will only prolong the fake bash. On the other hand if your real hero bashes first with a real bash, the images can prolong this with their fake bashes.<br><br>2. Radiance<br>Images can deal radiance damage to nearby units, however, the radiance damage will not stack i.e. even if you have 10 images, you can only deal 40 hp/sec damage to nearby units.<br><br>3. Mekansm<br>Images do not benefit from Mekansm heal, but benefit from the armor buff.<br><br>4. Linken's Sphere<br>Images do not gain spell block from Linken's Sphere.<br><br>5. Lothar's Edge<br>Images will not be able to Windwalk.<br><br>6. Monkey King Bar<br>Images do not benefit from any of the bonus of Monkey King Bar. The only thing images gain is that it gives the FAKE animation effect.<br><br>7. Battlefury<br>Images do not benefit from cleave attack.<br><br>8. Blademail<br>Images with Blademail do not return melee damage.<br><br>9. Evasion (from Butterfly/ Radiance etc.)<br>Images have evasion.<br><br>10. Gem of True Sight<br>Images with Gem of True Sight have True Sight.<br><br>11. Buriza/Crystalis<br>Images do not benefit from the weapon damage, but they do have critical attack, and the critical attack is calculated by the real hero's base damage + stat items * Multiplier * percentage of damage that the images deal.<br><br>12. Eye of Skadi<br>Melee images do not have frost attack. Ranged images (like Terrorblade's images) can have frost attack under certain conditions.<br><br>13. Diffusal Blade<br><br>Images will have +18 damage and burns 18 mana if the target has mana. This damage can be blocked by magic immunity.<br><br>14. Manta Style<br><br>Images will have +32 damage and burns 36 mana if the target has mana. This damage can be blocked by magic immunity. ______________________________________________________________<br><br>Techniques/Strategies:<br><br>To give an overview, this guide's use of Slithice makes her a very effective hero killer, pusher, supporter, all around. There are a few combos to learn through the SS Tuts, and once perfected you'll come to find Slithice as a great hero.<br><br>Basic Combo: Ensnare, Mirror Image, Attack. or Mirror Image, Ensare, Attack.<br>The first is more surprising, but in the latter you have no delay of casting. I use the latter when working with allies, and the first when I am one versus one. After they are ensared, run up so that you are touching the hero, then you cast Mirror Image, so that you sourround him to give the images attacking room.<br><br>Purging Combo: Ensnare, Mirror Image, Attack, Purge (when ensnare wears out), Attack:<br>This combo can of course only be used if you have Diffusal Blade, and is very deadly. The Purge is very useful since net usually doesn't last long enough, you just need to cast these spells at the right time. Cast Purge after ensnare wears out, not during it. And when you cast purge, move yoour images ahead of where the enemy is retreating, then attack, almost like creating a wall, and so that you don't fall behind.<br><br>Song of the Siren - Destroying Towers/Barracks:<br>Song of the Siren is by far the best way to assault an enemy tower in my opinion. This spell sleeps all enemy units in a large area for quite a while. And your units can't attack them! That means all of your creeps will go straight for the tower, along with you yourself. A GREAT tactic is to use Song of the Siren near the tower, then use your images to attack the tower, it's very easy to get the tower kill this way. Don't use Song of the Siren until enemy heroes come into sight/AoE of Song of the Siren. It is useless disabling some creeps, allowing the enemy heroes to jump you effortlessly.<br><br>Song of the Siren: Counter Push + Saving Teamates:<br>You're likely to see some pushes to get at least the front towers down. You'll find your allies in some trouble sometimes, too. Your teamates are gettg attacked and all you gotta do in run in quickly from between the trees and cast Song of the Siren, allowing your ally an escape, and a chance for your forces to regroup to counter a push and hopefully save the tower.<br><br>Image Surprise: Attack, Mirror Image (Ensnare) :<br>Tricking a hero is always effective. First be sure that only one enemy hero is present. Now what you do is get in a little fight with them and don't use spells. Maybe use ensnare to make them think you're serious or think you don't have any mana. Once you're down to about half HP or a little less, use your Mirror Image and ensnare if you have it. Surprise! This trick takes experience though, because you have to be very careful. The hero could the same to you, and not use their spells until you've reached about half HP. In which case you're screwed, since you have low HP. I use this most when I'm in a solo lane and I get in one of those one on one battles early.<br><br>Images from Behind Tactic:<br>This tactic could be done during mid game, though I use more late game to kick off pushes. What you do is find some vulnerable enemies in a lane (no more than 2 unless you have many allies with you). Hide on the side behind them and create your images. Now move in for the kill, this is much better if you have an ally with you. In a battle like this where there are multiple enemies, you want to target the intelligence first because of your mana burn. In this situation there was Crystal Maiden and Axe. Naix attacked the Ogre Magi, seeing him more easy of a target than myself. Too late. I switched over to Axe, taking him out with all of my images still present (this would happen if your partner is strong and so are u  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> )<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Early-Game: During this time you need to concentrate on levels, using the 'last-hit' method for gold. Make sure you stay back and take as little damage as possible. A useful trick I picked up is ensnaring a hero when they come in range of tower (make sure they have only 1-3 enemy creeps with them), and with luck the tower will target them, along with you yourself. Don't expect a kill (unless they were low in the first place), but it'll keep your hero's HP down for later on, and also put up the intimidation factor.<br>Farming Alone: Without images. You will need to use the 'last-hit creep' method in order to farm this way. Generally easy wth Naga, especially once you start putting point into Critical Strike. Just wait for red HP on the creep, and attack. You are a meele hero though, so you'll have to anticipate when the creep will have the smallest amount of HP. If he is being attacked the most by your creeps, you'll need to attack sooner. If only 1-2 creeps are attacking it, you'll be attacking later. You get the idea. Keep in mind that the mages do more damage than the melee creeps.<br><br>Mid-Game: Mid game for Sllithice is when she has a couple levels in each skill and has acquired the Diffusal Blade item. At this point you should be using the aboves combos when given the opportunity. You'll also start working more with allies at this point; Purge can help them out, too, as well as Song of the Siren.<br><br>Late-Game: Big items, big damage, nasty images, what are you going to do? Attack the base. When Slithice is in a push, at least one building is taken out. Save your images for the tower/rax when pushing, and your enemies will be overwhelmed. naga Siren is an overwhelming hero. A useful strategy if you have Manta Style by now is to make copies of yourself for one building, then again for the next. Double-imaging is also an effective counter-push, though I'd suggest not to attack from behind since your images really don't have much HP to play around with.<br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>Slithice /w Other Heroes:<br><br>Counter/Counter the Counter<br><br>- Akasha (QoP) - AoE Skills are hard to avoid especially since Akasha has blink. You may need to use your Song of the Siren sometimes, since she also has Shadow Strike for the real naga. Your ensnare can keep her from blinking away, and feedback from diffusal/manta can keep her from use her AoE nukes.<br><br>- Bradwarden (Centaur) -  About his hoof-stomp I like to use the "fake-out" method. Simply click right next to the centaur, then once Slithice is just about there, click away immediately. If you're lucky, the centaur will fall for the trick and waste his stomp.<br><br>- Sand King - There is of course the casting time on Epicenter, so save your ensnare for that moment to cancel it. If you're unable to do this, use Song of the Siren. And even if ensnare ends up being too late and epicenter is casted, SK won't be able to move so you can run away and not take close-range ulse damage.<br><br>- Enigma - With a one second casting time of Black Hole, you might get lucky by cancelling it with ensnare, but don't plan on it. You may need Song of the Siren with this one, because after he uses his ultimate, and if it destroys yor images (which is probably will), he can use Malefice and the real you and you're screwed. Once you have Manta Style however, it shouldn't be a problem. Just craete images if he uses malefice afterwards to cancel it, then attack him or run if Hp is low.<br><br>- Ezalor (KoTL) - If your images are set up in a lane for this, then it should be because you're pushing. If Ezalor starts casting illuminate, just run out of the way.. If he is alone, run towards him and get behind him, and when he starts running ensnare him. If you have diffusal blade you should be able to snag a kill easily.<br><br>- Dwarven Sniper - There really isn't much you can do about scatter-shot, just be smart and don't use your images on creeps when an enemy Kardel is in that lane. He can easily be ensared, so don't set yourself up for this one.<br><br>- Krobelus - A safe bet would to just stay back until Excorcism deactivates (I like to lurk on the side behind her, so that as soon as it deactivates, I jump out and finish her). If it is dire for you to attack, like if she's pushing a tower, use Song of the Siren to disable her and cancel the ultimate. Your ultimate is a very useful counter to Exorcism.<br><br>- Tormented Soul - Avoid this hero until you gain diffusal, because there really isn't anything you can do. All of his spells will still work while he is ensnared, and keep in mind that diabolic edict will continue even after you cast Song of the Siren. Anyways, once you gain feedback you can burn out his mana so that his ultimate will stop working and he can't spam those nukes anymore.<br><br>- Leviathan - If ambushed by Leviathan, you may need Song of the Siren. Just don't fight back, because anchor smash gives him a large advantage against your images. Ensnare and run is a good choice, since he is a melee hero, and your ensnare lasts longer than is slow form Gush or stun from Ravage.<br><br>- Lina Inverse - Cast Mirror Image (if ready) during or after her Light Strike Array Dragonslave combo so that you can get targetted by Laguna Blade. Ensnare won't cancel spells like it does with other intels, since there isn't a channeling time on Lina's spells except for a 1 second one on Light Strike Array.<br><br>- Magnataur - Very difficult to counter this guy, since he doesn't rely as much on mana on Raigor. But your Diffusal Blade should still help, because you can purge off his empower.<br><br>- Morgul Kahn (Axe) - You're best off getting an ally to come with you whenever you attack Axe. Don't even try soloing him if he higher than half HP. If he's lower than half HP, and his level doesn't own yours, you can try a combo on him. Otherwise be careful, and use Song of the Siren if need be.<br><br>- Pugna - Avoid. Nether Blast has 2 seconds casting time, so running out of the way isn't difficult. You can always cast ensnare, too, to cancel it, then run in and use Mirror Image on him.<br><br>Hint: Also keep in mind that Mirror Image will cancel Decrepify  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> .<br><br>- Earthshaker - Diffusal Blade itself is a main counter. Otherwise you can't do much except use Song of the Siren to escape (if he brings down your HP enough, and pray there's a split second of time between the stunning to cast it).<br><br>- Treant Protector - If mirror image or manta is ready, cast it. It'll cancel overgrowth and allow you to escape fairly easily. A good strategy to use if ally heroes are there and you get ganked with Overgrowth, cast Song of the Siren. It lasts longer than Overgrowth, so your ally heroes will be free and can set up to attack those heroes ganking you.<br><br>- Crystal Maiden - Simply save yourself ensnare, because this ability cancels casting. So just when Rylai thinks she has you, cancel out her freezing field, use your images if you have already, and the rest should be a piece of cake.<br><br>- Sven - Once you have Diffusal Blade you can Purge Godstrength off of Sven. Otherwise you can always just Ensnare and run. Remember that heroes can still attack while ensnared, so don't make the mistake of attacking an ensnared Sven with Godstrength, because he'll rip you to bits.<br><br>- Tiny - He is one of your worst counters. Cast Mirror Image after his Avalanche and Toss combo is done. This is because of Tiny's slow attack speed. However, don't attack back, just run because this combo probably just took out most of your HP. You can also "fake-out" Tiny, by constantly running towards him. If you're running around close to Tiny he won't be able hit you with Avalanche, but be wary of Toss.<br><br>- Yunero -  Do your best to simply avoid Blade Fury, remember that ensnare can still be used on Yurnero if he's using Blade Fury. So you can ensnare him, let him spin, then run in for the attack.<br><br>- Slardar - Ensnare and run, Slardar is a melee hero. You can also use the same "fake-out" tactic I explained with Bradwarden, where you run in close next to Slardar, then run back.<br><br>- Venomancer - Cast an image spell to dispel the poisonova. This would be hopefully avaliable when you have Manta Style. With your feedback you should keep Venomancer from casting his ultimate in the first place, but remember it can be casted while he is ensnared.<br><br>Allies<br><br>- Omniknight<br>- Sven<br>- Skeleton King<br>- Sand King<br>- Treant Protector<br>- Heroes /w Stun-Lock/Permastun<br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>WELL THAT IS IT FOR MY THIRD GUIDE.
