            <div class='col-md body'>sniper gets owned easily, becuz he doesn't have a stun and has slow movement speed..<br><br>if u wana train on him, i suggest u get lothars edge as his first major item, to help u from feeding, unless the enemy really wana make u bad and place wards all over the place, but i doubt so in pubs..<br><br>try holding alt, see the creeps life, try to shoot it when its just about to die..<br><br>dun be so garang on towers, unless ur range is max, or when u have mnay creeps tanking for you..<br><br>also look at your map, if u dun see any enemy heroes of many of them are missing, and you're far down or up in a lane move back to your nearest tower for safety purposes, of course good teamates will always warned u, but better to train ur own awareness..<br><br>try to kill ppl thru backstabbing, and i suggest u aim for a single hero unit, meaning he's the only one in the lane..dun chase him past his tower unless u are sure u can get the kill..<br><br>this is about the basics, the rest u will learn the more u play..<br><br>also if you're a singaporean/msian go to USwest, more sg/ms games there..<br><br>oh and buy ring of regen as ur first item, not boots pls..<br><br>hope this helps.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
