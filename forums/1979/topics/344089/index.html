If he types -switch without the slot it lists the possible numbers that can be used. After a player uses this command, no one else can attempt a switch for 60 seconds, to prevent confusion. All players are then presented with a command to enter to accept, something like "-switch accept" or "-ok". If 100% of all player agree , then you take the slot of the player you swapped with and both heroes swap positions.  Players have until the 60 seconds are over to accept the offer.<br> <br><br> <br><br> <br>I hope everyone enjoys this update.
