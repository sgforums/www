            <div class='col-md body'>You know we can just search for the answers and get everything correct, right? Regardless, I'll try my luck.<br><br>Trial Question: Which DotA Hero is a mobile version of a building in the same game?<br><strong>Treant Protector.</strong><br><br>1. Give at least two pairs of heroes in DotA having THE SAME SETof speech sounds? (meaning they say exactly the same words and make the exactly the same sounds)<br><strong>Rogue Knight and Lycanthrope.</strong><br><br>2. The recipe of Buriza-do Kyanon was much cheaper before, how much did it cost back then? (Now it's 1250 gold.)<br><strong>No idea.</strong><br><br>3. DotA's awards and sprees (First Blood, Killing Spree, Godlike and so on) came from which game?<br><strong>Unreal Tournament (don't know which version).</strong><br><br>4. Who is the slowest hero from Scourge? What is this hero's movement speed? Then what skill in DotA uses the same animation as this hero's normal attack?<br><strong>I was thinking Pudge here, but the third question is a very good clue. Spent quite a few minutes before thinking of Death Prophet whose attack looks like Chaos Bolt. I have no idea what her movespeed is.</strong><br><br>5. What kind of creature is Razzil Darkbrew?<br><strong>Goblin on ogre.</strong><br><br>6. Who is this hero? ~~ He is half human, half night elf. His advocacy is to correct the unjust, and vanquish all evil. His weapon has a special property.<br><strong>Rogue Knight. I'll even throw in his weapon's name, Justice.</strong><br><br>7. If a Level 25 (all skills learned) Syllabear (Druid Form) has 2000 Hp, how many Hp would he have if he morphs into a Bear?<br><strong>3000.</strong><br><br>8. Among the following: Blades of Attack, Broad Sword, Claymore, Demon Edge and Sacred Relic, which item does not have a "partner"? And why?<br><strong>I have no idea what this question is about.</strong><br><br>9. If the Faceless Void has Level 4 Time Lock learned, and he is equipped with a single Cranium Basher, what is his effective chance to stun the enemy?<br><strong>40%? I'm not sure if the first Basher stacks diminishingly with innate Bash or not.</strong><br><br>10. Give at least 6 DotA heroes that have skills crafted from the Warcraf 3 <strong>Wind Walk skill. Any hero that can "Wind Walk" can be included.<br>Bone Fletcher, Bounty Hunter, Nerubian Weaver, Nerubian Assassin, Phantom Lancer. Wild guess for the last one would be Broodmother's Web, since it gives a movespeed bonus and invisibility (among other things).</strong><br><br>11. What is the maximum number of "stolen" intelligence points Obsidian Destroyer can have, at a time?<br><strong>16, I think.</strong><br><br>12. Complete the sentence: The Orb Effect of Sange and Sange and Yasha, Maim, slows the target's ________ by ___.<br><strong>Speed, 40%. Another wild guess.</strong><br><br>13.

The enemy will just push while you are there, or gank you. FV might have an invis rune and can Chrono you before you split.</strong><br><br>17. Answer the following :<br>a) What happens when Magina and Boush activate Black King Bar?<br>b) After Terrorblade activates Manta Style, how many images could he possibly have and describe these images?<br>c) What happens when Rigwarl activates Manta Style?<br>c.1) When he's not yet in a Warpath<br>c.2) When he's already in a Warpath<br><strong>Magina gets the Metamorphosis skin from his ladder equivalent, the Demon Hunter. Boush gets the tank skin from his ladder equivalent, also the Goblin Tinker.<br>Metamorphosis and Conjure gives 2 ranged images, Manta dispels Metamorphosis, giving you 2 melee images.<br>Warpath is dispelled. His images get Warpath if it activates after he splits (not sure about this one, could just be the appearance).</strong><br><br>18. Give one stunning non-ultimate spell used by a Strength Scourge Hero that is accompanied with another effect aside from the stun? BONUS (3 points): Give the original names of the Warcraft 3 spell/s this skill was patterned after.<br><strong>Are you kidding? This is ridiculously easy. Skeleton King's Storm Bolt (stun and damage), taken straight from ladder.</strong><br><br>19. Who is this hero?<br><br>- This hero came from a world far, far away, possibly 2 worlds...<br>- This hero is unusually agile. Aided by mysterious energies, this hero can chase enemies with ease, then proceed to slay them with weapons that are imbued with the same kind of powerful force.<br>- This hero's persona resembles that of some inhabitants of Kalimdor, but its true motives may differ.<br><strong>Dark Seer. Draenei.</strong><br><br>20-a.<br><br>Give two DotA auras that have the same animation, and the heroes that have them. Aura from items are not included.<br><strong>Night Stalker's Hunter in the Night and Troll Warlord's Fervor Aura. Undying's Heartstopper Aura and Necrolyte's Diffusion Aura. I just spent a few minutes recalling all the heroes.</strong><br><br>Bonus: From which Warcraft 3 characters were these heroes taken from? And which Warcaft III campaign did they appear in?<br><strong>Dreadlord, Dalaran Zombie and Kel'Thuzad (necromancer spirit form). Not sure about the Troll.</strong><br><br>20-b.<br><br>How much more mana is regenerated by an Arcane Ring (assuming it's activated every after cooldown) than a Vladimir's Offering over 1 minute?<br><strong>Arcane Ring will give 405 mana in 1 minute.

So basically same comulative price.<br><br>Question 3 - Unreal Tournament Series<br>All the sprees and awards from DotA came from UT--First Blood! Double Kill! Godlike! But here's a trivia, in UT, Wicked Sick is 30 straight kills without dying, while Godlike is only 25. So Wicked Sick is better in UT, unlike in DotA.<br><br>Question 4 - Lion and Krobelus, MS = 280, Scream of Pain resembles Lion's attack, Chaos Bolt resembles Krobelus's attack.<br>Nuff' said.<br><br>Question 5 - Goblin<br>The Alchemist is the goblin riding the ogre. So basically, the Intelligence is his, while the Strength and Agility belongs to the fat guy he's experimenting on.<br><br>Question 6 - Sven the Rogue Knight<br>According to DotA Lore, he is the son of a knight and a night elf, which caused him to be outcasted. For years, he trained in isolation, preparing himself to battle evil and fight for justice. Plus, his weapon cleaves!<br><br>Question 7 - 3000 HP<br>Synergy gives + 400 Hp, while True Form gives + 600 Hp, making a total of 1000 bonus Hp. 2000 + 1000 = 3000.<br><br>Question 8 - Sacred Relic<br>This is a tricky question. What you have to notice first is the fact that all items are +damage items. Now, compare their prices, then compute for the cost of each damage point per item. You will see that Claymore and Broadsword then Blades of Attack and Demon Edge has the same damage/gold ratio. Sacred Relic is the only one with no partner, and is also the most cost-efficient item among the list.<br><br>Blades of Attack - 650/9 = 72.22 gold/dmg<br>Demon Edge - 2600/36 = 72.22 gold/dmg<br><br>Broadsword - 1200/18 = 66.66 gold/dmg<br>Claymore - 1400/21 = 66.66 gold/dmg<br><br>Sacred Relic - 3800/60 = 63.33 gold/dmg<br><br>Question 9 - 36.25 %<br>Dark Terror has a 25% chance to stun with Time Lock. With a Basher, 15% is added to the stun chance. BUT, there is also a chance that both stuns hit at the same time. This means that we can't just add 25% to 15% making 40% because the chance of them both hitting is counter double here. So we simply subtract from 40% the chance that both stuns hit.<br><br>25% x 15% = 3.75% --&gt; the chance of them both hitting.<br>40% - 3.75% = 36.25%<br><br>Question 10 - Clinkz, Gondar, Anub'arak, Anub'seran, Azwraith, Mangix<br>The original WC3 Wind Walk gives bonus MS and backstab damage. Clinkz adopted the bonus MS, Gondar the backstab damage, Anub'arak both. Anub'seran got only MS bonus and have a short duration, Azwraith, bonus MS but the spell was modified so that it produces an illusion upon cast. Mangix has the original Wind Walk from Primal Split - Storm.<br><br>Question 11 - 32 points<br>Harbinger can cast Astral Imprisonment 3 times a minute, 4 if he has Refresher Orb. 4 x 8 (int points stolen per cast) = 32.<br><br>Question 12 - The Orb Effect of Sange and Sange and Yasha, Maim, slows the target's Movement Speed and Attack Speed by 35%.<br><br>Question 13 - Harbinger the Obsidian Destroyer<br>Originally an obsidian construct, it was brought to life by the Lich King's necromancers... All its spells are intelligence oriented, and deal with the manipulation of mana and psychic energies.<br><br>Question 14 - 9 units.<br>Level 4 Paralyzing Casks bounce 8 times after first target so 9 units can be hit.<br><br>Question 15 - Guinsoo's Scythe of Vyse, Refresher Orb, Aghanim's Sceptre, Hood of Defiance.<br>All items from Oblivion Staff lose the bonus damage and IAS. Aghanim's lose the regen properties of Soul Booster. Hood of Defiance no longer carry the armor bonus from Helm of Iron Will.<br><br>Question 16 - Katzkie's warning meant she knew that Jordie was being set up. Vengeful Spirit is atop the cliff overlooking ward spot, ready to swap her to that isolated place.<br>The full story is this -- Faceless Void time walked to the cliff then Venge Swapped with him. Now Faceless Void is challenging Naga to a 1v1 along the river. Once Naga comes within range of Swap, Venge swaps her to that unreachable spot.<br><br>Question 17<br>a) Magina becomes a Metamorphosed Soul Keeper. Boush becomes a Goblin Tank.<br>b) Terrorblade could have 4 images after Manta Style. 2 from Conjure Image, 2 from Manta Style.<br>c.1) Rigwarl does not enter warpath by casting Manta Style but his images gain warpath when he casts Goo or Spikes.<br>c.2) He and his images all gain warpath when he casts Manta Style when already in a warpath.<br><br>Question 18 - Slardar's Slithereen Crush is a stun accompanied by a slow. It's taken from Mountain King's Thunder Clap and Tauren Chieftain's War Stomp.<br>Slardar's Crush produces a 4.5 second slow and a 2.5 second stun. So after the stun duration, targets are still slowed for 2 seconds.<br><br>Question 19 - Lanaya the Templar Assassin<br>She came from the Protoss Homeworlds - Aiur and Shakuras. She is aided with psionic energies. Traps make her chase enemies with ease then her Psi blades and Meld bonus damage plus Refraction make killing heroes easy for her. Lanaya looks a lot like the night elves of Kalimdor (her portrait is actually a Watcher/Warden from WC3) but her advocacies are definitely not night elf.<br><br>Question 20 - a - several possible answers<br><br>Moon Rider's Lunar Blessing and Drow Ranger's Trueshot Aura have the same animation. Moon Rider is Naisha; she appeared in Sentinel Campaign of TFT. Drow Ranger can be Sylvanas from Scourge Campaign of TFT.<br><br>Undying's Heartstopper Aura and Necrolyte's Dispersal Aura have the same animation. Undying is a zombie from Human Campaign in ROC. Necrolyte is Kel'thuzad's ghost in Undead Campaign in ROC.<br><br>Question 20 - b<br><br>Arcane Ring : 2*135 - 2*25 = 220 MP per minute<br>Vladimir's Offering : 0.8 MP/s -&gt; 0.8*60 = 48 MP per minute<br>220 - 48 = 172 more MP from Arcane Ring<br><br>Divine Rapier has 250 damage. 250*60 = 15000 gold<br><br>Divine Rapier 7800/15000 = 0.52<br>Eye of Skadi x/7050 = 0.52<br>x = 0.52*7050 = 3666<br>7050 - 3666 = 3384 gold should be rebated<br><br>Question 20 - c<br><br>a) Ulfsaar - Ursa is a furbolg. He belongs in the Ashenvale Forest and Felwood tilesets.<br>b) Akasha - Queen of Suffering / succubi. She belongs in Outland and Black Citadel tilesets. (Draenor)<br>c) Slardar - He is a Naga and belongs in the city of Najzatar or in the Sunken Ruins tileset.<br>d) Nortrom - A Bloodelf from Quel'Thalas. He belongs in Lordaeron tilesets.<br><br>a) Ulfsaar - 95-99 dmg - least base damage<br>b) Akasha - 100-108<br>c) Slardar - 118-126 - the most base damage<br>d) Nortrom - 99-121 dmg<br><br></div>
