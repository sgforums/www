            <div class='col-md body'>Mainly some common tactics that i use to share with you guys, or you might want to pick up  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Chasing Off Heroes:<br>a) Controlled Spamming from lvl 1 onwards<br>PROVIDED ENEMY HERO:<br>1)does not have ring<br>2)you have 2/3 clarities)<br><br>Imagine you have a hero that can do spell damage from a distance. And in dota, you recover Health/mana for every level.<br>What i will do is that, I will learn that skill(as above) first, then once Im level 1, i will use my spell, then not cast any spell till I reach level 3 and add the skill point to the skill that does spell damage. Stop casting spell, when you reach level 5, cast the spell again.Also, since i usually buy 2 or 3 clarities along with me. So if for eg i have my clarities now, I will use 1, then i will use the lvl 3 spell again. Upon reaching level 7, I will add the skill point to the spell and spam another time, followed by eating a clarity and spamming another time. By right, that hero should have gone back to base or camp at that tower. Then you can start farming <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Farming for meelee heroes:<br>a)<br>Sometimes you might be alone in the lane with another ranged enemy hero, i might recommend just staying back and leech the experience, ask for backup to chase the hero away to base, and you can farm. Alternatively, when there are group fights, do not join them and farm at your own lane(useful as they might take around 2-3mins to fight finish, respawn/heal/walking distance) *but not recommended if your team is shorthanded, has newbie*<br><br>b) Scaring away/Controlled Spamming<br>Many meelee heroes have ranged spells that does damage. Refer to "Chasing Off Heroes". After scaring them off, you can farm. A very blunt idea thought by me though.<br><br>Running away when you have low health:<br>It may be the best way to run straight to base but i feel that there are 2 requesites to decide where to run:<br>a)when the enemy is chasing you-<br>I will run towards the river first, then decide where else to run, since the river branches out to many other locations and you can see whether there are<br>runes to help you out. Then i look at the mini map and see which hero is      missing, then i can avoid the common route(hard to show here) the enemy will take.<br><br>b) Noone is chasing you-<br>I might want to use a town portal scroll at the tower. Or there is a possibility a enemy will wait for you at the empty space between 2 of ur towers, I might ask a friend to follow me while i stick at the tower(not recommended as the enemy might be able to kill you with a spell and be able to run off without dying). Likewise, i will go to the river(same as top)<br><br>I wil be posting more in time to come, do correct me if im wrong<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
