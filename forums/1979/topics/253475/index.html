            <div class='col-md body'>For those who still does not know what DOTA rules are all about, you can view the list of those rules from this website:<br><br>http://jango.netheads.com/dota/rules.htm<br><br>The purpose of creating this topic is to allow players to be aware that such rules exist but it does not mean it is applied everywhere.<br><br>What I want to point out is that these rules are created for Tournaments. When there are Tournaments, it usually involves money, a place to gather players physically so that they can be monitored for fair game play, are official in their own rights, and are recognized/accepted by authorities who allow such tournaments to take place.<br><br>I would like to also stress that these rules "DO NOT" take place in custom games.  Briefly, custom games are games created by players and hosted by them to allow other players to join up and play, be it in BNET, LANCRAFT, Hamachi or in other means.<br>Obviously, Custom games do not fit the conditions that are stated above for tournaments. It will be really annoying if players in custom games keep repeating tournament rules while playing in custom games, especially when theres no physical prize to be given to the team that wins.<br>I personally feel that these are petty issues, especially when losing teams get very agitated and 'kao pei' alot.<br>*Kao pei --&gt; complain.<br><br>Also, in custom games, there are other much more important issues that will ruin the fun and players seem to encourage them. Unfortunately, such issues are not solved in custom games. For example, map hack.<br>So does that mean it gives players a reason or excuse to continue using it, to have an edge in custom games? Do players really need to cheat to win and not through personal skill? Do we report such game plays to the so called administrators, and who are the administrators are we talking about for custom games? Its applied in tournaments, but is not applied in custom games?? wtf with that....<br>Again, the answer is, custom games are not tournaments. Players do as they seem fit and there are no third parties to monitor and prove who is cheating or not. And since this issues have not been resolved over the many years with different versions of DOTA in Custom Games, please do not even bring up the tournament rules here.<br><br>Next, I personally find that this particular tournament rule, that is stated below, seems to be a bit mis-understood by most players.<br>*Backdooring in games is allowed. However, instances of "teleport abuse" are not allowed. You cannot use any form of teleport (furion skill, ignis fatuus, or Boots of Travel) to enter an enemy base UNLESS your creeps are already present in the base. So, for example, teleporting with Boots of Travel onto an ignis fatuus that runs in to backdoor is illegal. Another example is having your teamates backdoor and enter an enemy base and then teleport to your teamates as Furion. This is illegal because your creep wave is not present.<br><br>So in another words, if a solo character walks into the enemy's base, invisible or not, and starts destroying bases, with or without his/her friendly creeps/allies, is ALLOWED. So, to players who are hosting DOTA games, before you start accusing others of BDs and kicking them out, understand this statement first before you want to apply the above rule into custom games, if not you will end up sounding like a noob who does not really know about tournament rules.<br><br>Lastly, I would like to sum up the entire message by saying this: "RULES ARE MEANT TO BE BROKEN!!!", especially when you are in Custom games. It is also stated that rules will be changed accordingly when needed, so nothing is permanent. Blunt, but true, theres nothing fair when cheating is allowed, blah blah blah..<br><br>In anyways, have fun with DOTA.<br><br>ps.. if I need to edit this page, I will lol</div>
