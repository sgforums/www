            <div class='col-md body'><strong><br>The worst case i've evered encountered up to this day, was a guy using the Sniper Rifleman on our team. He took the left lane. Seeing that my other allies have taken position, 2 in the middle and 1 on the right, I followed him to the left.<br><br>He asked for solo. I said its too late for me to back to right, or have fucking 3 people in mid lane. Hearing that, he offered himself to the enemy. Got firstblooded. Upon revival, came back again, drop some thornwoord branches at the enemy's feet, and got K.O`ed again. Rinse and repeat. Eventually, even the host, whom we're playing against banned him.</strong><br><br>Yah. That's this dumb shit called championarsenal (SG player) who only demands for solo lane when you reach the tower with him. If you don't go away, he will feed and spoil the game.<br><br>I played another game against him some time later, and he once again solo'ed. He then kena killed (1st blood) and left game. Really retarded.<br><br><strong>And there'll be some people on the opposite team, even though 3 of their allies have already left the game, they stayed on with the odds against them. You take a look at their inventory, and becuz their mates left early, there's not really much items they can combine and Tier up the level with. At this point, i'll normally thank them for staying on, and they'll reply back, and its a nice kinda feeling. I will then remember their nicks and invite them for a game together the next time i host. </strong><br><br>You so lucky. I once stayed in a game when 2 of my team mates left. So it's 3 v 5. The 2 leavers were noobs and only had boots and ror. Early game some more. The remaining team mates and I decided to stay back to play for good sport.<br><br>The enemies raped us repeatedly (my team had no stunners, so suay right?) and pushed to our throne. Then one of the enemies started saying crap like "You noobs shouldn't have stayed. You don't have a chance!". My team mates and I were like "Wtf??".<br><br><strong>People shouldn't emphasize so much on heros, but i say the player is what makes the heros work. I never work alone. Never ask for solo lanes, or complained about kill-stealing. </strong><br><br>Die die some heroes better than others. Spiritbreaker is a super broken hero, in my opinion.<br><br><strong>DoTA's a fun game really, I used to fancy playing Slithice, Magina and Akasha alot. Simply becuz they're not the easiest of character to use. But I told myself i've had my fun, and its time to dedicate these hours to something more constructive and prominent ; )</strong><br><br>Magina and Akasha are good to use, 'cause they can blink to escape/kill. I m also getting sian of DotA liao. Sometimes I try my best to play properly but team-mates do all sorts of weird things, then get owned, then start blaming and spoiling game. Damn sian lor.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haha Rest in Peace, quit lor. Thatz what i did. If got a chance to play with well self-respected DoTA players, play again. By that I mean people with good DoTA-spirit.<br><br>Yeah yr 3v5 situation is up against some really crude opponents. In the end, its a good waste of an hours time eh? People not appreciating yr spirit of the game, snuffing the flame off the wick instead.<br><br>I used to have a good bunch of khakis, but ever since I went abroad(in Wellington now), we split. Before I gave up, I joined afew NZ games. They love -AR games, but ironically, I can say NONE of these game ever wraps up with a 5 by 5. So I reckon I shouldn't waste my time dabbling in this game anymore.<br><br>Its true some heros are edged better than the others. But 5 hero killer characters in one team does not equate to a good team lor. There needs to be a fair balance of stunners, disablers, AOE casters etc.<br><br>I'm not sure. Maybe this forum can start looking for self respected DoTA players. By that, it means players with polished etiquette. People who are able to talk/joke and discuss about their own defeat rather than victory. If there is a handful, playing along them will give you more value for your time ba ; j</div>
