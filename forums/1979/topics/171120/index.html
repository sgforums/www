WTF!! so you mean 5 mins ago you weren't sleepy so you joined a game?!?!!?! WTF!!<br><br>and you know how some players are damn unsporting... they suicide themselves or put their items so the other team can pick up? that's usually cause the team is arguing amongst themselves.. over stupid things such as fighting over the leaver's items. or "why you never save me"<br><br>well this one takes the cake.... this idiot dropped all his items and left JUST BECAUSE HIS TEAM WOULDN'T PUSH WITH HIM!<br><br>wat the hell.<br><br>anyway... we now have both sides of the argument.. and i can only conclude that it's too hard to get a decent bnet game..<br><br>if you're really a true hardcore dota player... with all the ethics you proclaim to have, then go play on lancraft where the real pros are.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow, and I thought Indonesian players was the worse...&gt;.&lt; People would normally restart their computer if they are very lagging (2 seconds delay, wtf???), and some would leave because they feel it's not balanced (d**n, if u wanna always win, then play AI, don't come to bnet).<br><br>It's worse on LAN especially if u're playing in an internet cafe at noon with all the n00bies. They'd leave if they don't get first blood or they were fb-ed! Night time playing is the best, 95% no leaver if u play at 9pm-5am...<br><br>I wonder how it's like playing in Kalimdor, we don't get to play there cause of the extreme lag (d**n protocol with the IIX!!!) It'd be nice to get to play with other countrymen once in a while....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thatz the rason I gave DoTA up completely. Having a different focus, away from an addiction. But for those that're in the field now, there is hope really,here're some of the odd sides i've explicitly encountered during my DoTA era:<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>BAD SCENERIO</strong></span><br>The worst case i've evered encountered up to this day, was a guy using the Sniper Rifleman on our team. He took the left lane. Seeing that my other allies have taken position, 2 in the middle and 1 on the right, I followed him to the left.<br><br>He asked for solo. I said its too late for me to back to right, or have fucking 3 people in mid lane. Hearing that, he offered himself to the enemy. Got firstblooded. Upon revival, came back again, drop some thornwoord branches at the enemy's feet, and got K.O`ed again. Rinse and repeat. Eventually, even the host, whom we're playing against banned him.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>GOOD SCENERIO</strong></span><br>But there're some nice ettiques i've encountered, as well as executing them myself. I was low on health, a tower hugging Akasha, when an ally of mine, same lane, dropped a Ring of Health? 4hp regen/sec into my inverntory. There goes my fountain trip, and hello experience + gold. Sometimes, i buy sapphire water? Look around the map for allies in the red or orange health, particularly melee dudes, and cast it on them.<br><br>And there'll be some people on the opposite team, even though 3 of their allies have already left the game, they stayed on with the odds against them. You take a look at their inventory, and becuz their mates left early, there's not really much items they can combine and Tier up the level with. At this point, i'll normally thank them for staying on, and they'll reply back, and its a nice kinda feeling. I will then remember their nicks and invite them for a game together the next time i host.<br><br>People shouldn't emphasize so much on heros, but i say the player is what makes the heros work. I never work alone. Never ask for solo lanes, or complained about kill-stealing.<br><br>DoTA's a fun game really, I used to fancy playing Slithice, Magina and Akasha alot. Simply becuz they're not the easiest of character to use. But I told myself i've had my fun, and its time to dedicate these hours to something more constructive and prominent ; )<strong></strong><strong></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's a different story if you play with your friends on the same team. There would be more teamwork and less of those "ksing" issues..</div>
