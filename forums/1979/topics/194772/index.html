            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>1. Chen - i saw many people hear posted that Chen suck because they hate doing micro and recruiting,but for me Chen is the most strongest support hero ever. A great pusher and killer and a mass heal ulti. I also like using this hero in matches. A nightmare in team matches... (got nerfed now so to heck with this...)<br><br>2. KoTL - he does not suck he is also one of the strongest supports in the game,just partner him with earthshaker or sniper in 5v5 matches and put them on the mid lane,casting fissure or scattershot everytime without worrying about mana. He is also a good farmer. And he's mana leak sure is annoying espicially his ulti w/ aghanims a supper pusher hero. A nightmare in team matches...<br><br>3. Pudge - is a strong hero and a good farmer. hooking is not that bad if you got good timing and its a good starter skill for executing a gank. Plus if he get 2 or 3 HoTs he would be unstoppable. Just practice his meathook and you will own anyone with Pudge. Just click the ground where you would assume the enemy hero would go if your trying to hook him not the hero itself because the meathook will turn sideways and you will certainly miss.<br><br>4.Enigma - doesnt suck,he is strong at ganks and hero clashes. imagine your enemies got all caught with the blackhole and his 3rd skill and put rhasta's wards inside the blackhole,sometimes all of the enemy heroes will get stuck inside rhasta's wards,and all of your teammates starts whacking them and they all die. Triple Kill<br><br>5.Treant Protector - also one of my favorites, a good support,hero killer,gank starter and a tanker. Just get him a SnY and a refresher orb and then he can kill heroes fast.<br><br>6.Panda - he's a damn immortal,when gets redlife just use his ulti and pops into 3 pandas of imbaness. can cast euls,taunt,stun,and removes buffs.<br><br>7.Ogre Magi - you say this hero is boring,Tinker is more boring than him. Did you happen to see a level 25 clinks got knockout using only one skill?<br><br>8.Faceless Void - a good killer support hero,just give him a buriza,battlefury and mask of madness,cast his ulti along with Lich's chainfrost the results would be a quad kill.<br><br>9.Rhasta - excellent versatile hero,good for killing,ganking,support and pushing. i really love to ward trap enemies. a nightmare in team matches...<br><br>10. Omniknight - one of the most strongest heroes in DotA,along with my dreamteam in sentinel : Chen and KoTL,there would be no one to stop your team pushing. A nightmare in team battles.<br><br>11. Pugna - great hero killer and pusher,cast a level 4 wards hidden in a tree and w8 for a caster like lina to attack you,and she will just damage herself,after that cast deceprify and do a blast and lifeleech combo.<br><br>12.Sven - the powerhouse secret weapon of Sentinel. with GS youll be making enemy heroes your snack. But there is a Gorgon on the scourge side,so what? Just let your teammates initiate the attack w8 for gorgon cast purge,after she casted it use GS and stun her and use mask of madness and whack her and her allies to death.<br><br>13. Lich - for several reason, Lich is one of the strongest heroes starting from level 1-8. Examples, frostnova then dark ritual. His nova is used as nuke, thus getting fed so much in beginning, later hard to take down.<br><br>14. QoP - one of the best nukers in early game. Her ult dealing mass damage while she has shadowstrike and even scream. Blinking for running away or blink /w scream. Each spell dealting a good amount of damage.<br><br>15. Mercurial (Spectre) - Very much like terrorblade in the sense of... great AGI growth, good dmg, super low starting HP. Very vulnerable against nukers. Pretty slippery, so physical attacks will only work if the avatar lets you, or get disabled. Starts getting godlike once getting butterfly with 2 or 3 bashers buriza, bot. dagger deals good amount of dmg in beginning and character phases. Like i said, she is heroes such as Mortred or terror... starting out with good dmg, but dies easily.<br><br>16. Terrorblade - one of the deadliest chars. once getting skadi, butterfly, buriza, and uses image, terror is very deadly. agi increasing armor while skadi giving off +10 stats including HP and even more AGI. a great midgamer when sunder with dagon.<br><br>Now my list for my most hated heroes to use in DotA :<br><br>1. Nerubian Weaver - this is the most f**kd up hero in DotA he sucks and useless without a divine,buriza and aegis. His hp is too low, DragonKnights level 4 firebreath can get you go a trip to the fountain. His skills suck,shukuchi does only 90 damage,it tickles any hero late game. His double attack doesnt hurt if you dont have high damaging expensive items like buriza or divine. His ulti also sucks,lets say its a 5v5 match you got laid out by your enemy heroes,then you cast your ulti,yep you regain your life but goes back to your last position,meaning you are just returning to your own graveyard. 5 heroes will start whacking you to death. A useless pooling dependent hero. I wish someone could remake his skills and buff his stats because he really needs it.<br><br>2. Abbadon - yeah,this hero is also one of the f***d up hero in DotA,he's boring,useless and sucks at hero killing and pushing. Now i know his ulti is now change to active then a passive when cooling down,so what? He is still useless when he uses his ulti just euls or guinsoo him,after that his ulti has run out,and all 5 heroes whacking you to death because you are a free kill.. He also needs a complete skill remake. Sorry but he really needs it.<br><br>3. Visage - this hero is only meant for pushing. no gank skills,disable skills,and his ulti is also weak and not dependable.<br><br>And my list for the most annoying enemies in DotA:<br><br>1. BoneClinks - King of Backdooring. The most gay character of all time,armed with multiple divines and an aegis its an instant gg.<br><br>2. Rikimaru - the second gayest character ever,backstabbing,scouting and hiding. Later on,he got pooled by his teammates and they armed him with SnY,BoT,butterfly,divine and aegis and starts backdooring because they are loosing.<br><br>3.Venomancer - another gay character,give him an aghanims and lothars edge,and he will start killing all of you,sure the only counter for his ulti is mekanism and hand of god and guardian angel,but his ulti really hearts chen doesnt have time to heal...<br><br>4. Phantom Lancer - another gay character,he multiplies like a freak,and when your team starts attacking him,he will gayfully dopplewalk and leave you dissapointed.<br><br>5. Gondar - strong backstabber and killstealer and a gay windwalk skill. He will surely own if he farm good items or gets pooled by his teammates.<br><br>6. Lich - beginning of game... one of the best nuker in beginning. he starts of with frost nova and dark ritual. ChainFrost has pretty good range for ulti and later leaving u mad when Lich starts owning in beginning of game.<br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>TOOK AN HOUR... -__-</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with your views about LoA and Nerubian Weaver. They are inherently weak and hence rather too item dependent and not very useful in terms of team application. LoA can own with Aphotic Shield and Frostmourne at the start but late game he just becomes a sitting target. Nerubian Weaver's base damage and stat gain are just too low. Germinate Attack is a nice skill actually but cooldown (at 4 seconds) is just too high. Watchers is basically a useless skill though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hm I've been really trying to use Weaver, but it's just too difficult to use or something. He's probably the current lowest ranking character due to buffs to AoV(Spectre), Bristleback and LoA. I think Icefrog likes his watchers or something, because although many people asked that skill to be removed, he just tries to buff the watchers again and again...<br><br>And somebody from the DotA forums suggested Time Lapse as a regular skill...and give him a new ulti...i think that would increase the effectiveness of Weaver.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nerubian weaver, dont underestimate her prowess, level 7 she can pester agi and int away with her shukichi, 90 damage is nothing, but after doing that 5 times, it will bring them to yellow life. By the way, imo most agi heroes in early-earlymid game need helpers to kill. The double hit can also pester heroes in early game  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
