            <div class='col-md body'>HELLO TO FOLKS WHO ARE READING THIS.<br>THIS IS MY 2ND GUIDE IN THIS FORUM. MY PREVIOUS ONE WAS<br>A GUIDE ABOUT TORMENTED SOUL. PLEASE ENJOY.<br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>Rhasta<br>Range: 500 | | Move Speed: 275 | Primary: INT<br>Str: 16 + 1.6 | Agi: 16 + 1.6 | Int: 21 + 3<br>Damage: 42 - 49 | HP: 454 | Mana: 273<br><br>Pros:<br>1. Ranged hero; which means farming would not be as difficult as is the problem of other heroes.<br>2. One of the best, if not the best disabler among all dota heroes.<br>3. Strong Early and Mid Game (a con if not played properly later on).<br><br>Cons:<br>1. Very very fragile, too low hp pool.<br>2. Slow movespeed, 2nd in the game after Techies.<br>3. Needs practice if you want to own with this hero.<br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>Skill Descriptions:<br><br>Forked Lightning - Calls forth a cone of lightning, hitting multiple enemy units for damage.<br><br>Level 1 - 75 damage to 3 targets.<br>Level 2 - 150 damage to 4 targets.<br>Level 3 - 225 damage to 5 targets.<br>Level 4 - 300 damage to 7 targets.<br>Mana Cost: 95/ 105/ 135/ 160<br><br>Voodoo - Transforms an enemy unit into a random critter, disabling special abilities.<br><br>Level 1 - Lasts 1 seconds.<br>Level 2 - Lasts 2 seconds.<br>Level 3 - Lasts 3 seconds.<br>Level 4 - Lasts 4 seconds.<br>Mana Cost: 110 / 140 / 170 / 200<br><br>Hero Shakles - Magically binds a target enemy, so that it cannot move or attack and deals 40 damage per second.

The wards last 30 seconds, deal piercing damage (200% damage to creeps, 50% damage to heroes and 35% damage to buildings) and are immune to magic. Each ward has a range of 600 and has 0 armor type Heavy.

Why max out Forked Lightning First?<br><br>Forked Lightning is the only single nuke that Rhasta can make; it is essential for farming and harassing hero, hence a good finishing skill and essential in getting good items, remember in dota money is power, otherwise heroes such as KOTL and Techies would be one of the weakest.<br><br>2. Why Shackles First before Voodoo, isnÂ’t Voodoo essential for ward trapping?<br><br>I believe that Shackles is more powerful than Voodoo, especially early game with the 40/sec damage and the longer duration of disable. Plus, the main player in ward trapping early on is cyclone, so no problem there. I would learn 1 level of Voodoo though, in place of Shackles if there are Heroes with crazy channeling spells, like Crystal Maiden, Sand King or Enigma in my lane just to stop them from Casting their ultimates.<br>Note: if you want to practice ward trapping, then you can learn voodoo first, but in competitive games, always max out shackles first before learning voodoo.<br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>Item Build:<br><br>Core Items:<br><br>- Boots of Speed<br>- Eul's Scepter of Divinit<br>- Soul Booster<br>- Blink Dagger<br>- Necronomicon<br><br>Why dagger? I thought only Bradwarden, Rylai and Slardar uses it? Well for being a pusher, hero killer and support caster, Rhasta pays for it dearly with having so low hp pool and so slow movespeed.<br><br>Advance Items:<br><br>- Guinsoo's Scythe of Vyse<br>- Aghanim's Scepter<br>- Aegis<br><br>Other Items Considering:<br><br>- Mekansm (Boosts survivality)<br>- Manta Style - (Buy this if u know how to use necro and split image...)<br>- Refresher Orb (Ult. cooldown)<br>- Stygian Desolator (The only reason I put this item in here is for us to know that this item complements Rhasta's wards and possibly if you have a necro book. Look at the price of the item and the bonuses that it'll give you, its ridicolous!)<br>- BoT (Buy this once you have the "rich" feeling, use this to go around and creep, very important when being ganked. Example such as Chaos Knight with ally running to you. The CK was rushing madly with his ally Anti-Mage to I had a red life, dagger would not save me. So I just Voodoo Magina and Sheepstick Nessaj, and ask them to guard you from harm as you teleport away. Need Boot in these situation)<br>- Linkin Sphere (Linken's Sphere adds a little bit of everything. I suggest getting it if you are the type of person who don't like the dagger and who often buys a perseverance.)<br><br>Question and Answers to Other Items Considering:<br><br>No dagon? RhastaÂ’s an Int and no Dagon?<br>Ah DagonÂ… So easy to use, just click it and point the hero and Voala, damage done. This item is good, but is not suitable for Rhasta. Dagon would be out of place in your combo skills (and if you notice, Rhasta needs all the mana that he can get, since his first three skills has a very fast cooldown, you just spam and spam forked lightning with the disables, so why would you need Dagon?). Anyway compare Dagon to Necronomicon, Necro is much better, it costs less, gives more relevant stat (weÂ’d rather have a + for str than a plus from damage for Rhasta), it has less mana cost, and can deal more damage than Dagon. Check about the Neronomicon.<br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>Buying Order:<br><br>&gt;&gt;Starting Items&lt;&lt;<br><br>Chicken<br>Flask x2<br><br>&gt;&gt;Early Game (Levels 1-10)&lt;&lt;<br><br>Voidstone<br>Boots of Speed<br>Optional: Scroll of Town Portal/Flasks<br>Robe of the Magi<br>Staff of Wizardry<br>Eul's Scepter of Divinity-&gt; forms EulÂ’s Scepter of Divinity<br>Point Booster<br><br>&gt;&gt;Mid Game (Levels 10-1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">&lt;&lt;<br><br>Staff of Wizardry<br>Belt of Giant Strength<br>Necronomicon Recipe -&gt; forms Necronomicon 1<br>Dagger of Escape<br><br>&gt;&gt;Late Game (Levels 18-25)&lt;&lt;<br><br>Necronomicon Recipe Upgrade 2<br>Vitality Booster<br>Necronomicon Recipe Upgrade 3<br>Energy Booster -&gt; forms Soul Booster<br><br>&gt;&gt;If the game Continues&lt;&lt;<br><br>Mystic Staff -&gt; forms Aghanim's Scepter<br>Robe of the Magi<br>Quarterstaff<br>Sobi Mask -&gt; forms Oblivion Staff<br>Guinsoo Recipe -&gt; forms Guinsoo, Scythe of Vyse<br>Plate Mail<br>Planeswalker Cloak<br>Stout Shield<br>Aegis Recipe -&gt; forms Aegis of the Immortal<br><br>Pros and Cons of this Build:<br><br>Pros:<br>1.) Relatively easy to build<br>2.) You have higher chance of survival (Dagger and Soul Booster)<br>3.) Easier Ward Trapping (Dagger)<br>4.) You have additional disable (EulÂ’s)<br>5.) Not reliant on wards. (Necro)<br>Cons:<br>1.) Do not have hp regen.<br>2.) More micromanagement due to Necro and Blink Dagger.<br>3.) Slow Movespeed unless BoT.<br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>Techniques/Strategies:<br><br>Things to Remember During Early-Game:<br>1. Get a void stone ASAP.<br>2. Complete the Voidstone into a Euls.<br>3. Harass your enemy lane partner with Forked Lightning. 2 to 3 forked lightning would force your enemy lane partner to go back to the fountain. Do it again and again and rely on your Voidstone/Euls for the mana regen.<br><br>Things to Remember Durnig Mid-Game:<br>1. Be the most dominating player in the game, by hero hunting and farming in every oppurtunity possible. Make the enemies know that you are to be feared. Kill those enemies who outlevel you by doing the cyclone+wards+shackles combo.<br>2. You can also deal with 2 heroes at once.<br><br>Things to Remember During Late-Game:<br>1. Never ever ever go solo, always go with a team mate.<br>2. Should circumstances provide you a 1 on 1 battle, then do not be afraid, you have unending disables. Thier life could only last so much...<br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>HOW TO USE THE "WARD TRAP"<br><br>Now the question, just how do you encage those wards to a moving target? Answer: Practice. Just remember these three things.<br>1.) The larger the collision size, the harder it is to trap him.<br>2.) The nearer you are to the hero, the easier it is to trap him.<br>3.) It is almost impossible to trap heroes who are in 500 range of you, especially if you did not reduce his collision size. The casting range of wards is 400 I think.<br><br>Now there are four ways of pulling off a successful ward trap, and that is:<br><br>1. Manual Ward Trap - Manually and without any help from any skills and items. This is almost impossible to pull of unless with luck. I usually TRY to do this early game when I have no cyclone or voodoo yet. To pull it off, click on the spot where you think the hero would be (it is easier to trap ranged hero since they donÂ’t move while attacking, and heroes that are near you, in about 300 range or less). However, most of the time the enemy wonÂ’t be trapped, but whatÂ’s important is you follow up with a shackle. So that even though they may not be encaged, they would still be shackled near the wards.<br><br>2. Cycloned Ward Trap - This is the easiest to pull off, even noobs could do it, just cyclone the enemy and exactly on the point where he is flying cast the wards. Should some misclick or other circumstances made you miss, you could cover the opening yourself by going to that spot.<br><br>3. Voodooed Ward Trap Â– This one is easier than Manual WT and harder than Cycloned WT. First voodoo the hero that you wish to trap (know that heroes have the smallest collision size when hexed, thatÂ’s why its easier to trap them). Should the voodooed hero be too shocked to move, then simply cast the wards at his feet. Experienced players would move in erratic paths to make your ward trapping more challenging. If this happens, try to predict its movement and cast the wards. If you miss, thereÂ’s always shackles  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> !!<br><br>4. The Unexpected Ward Trap Â– Lastly, this is when youÂ’ve ward trapped an enemy due to some event not intended in the normal course of using Rhasta. For example, youÂ’ve picked up an Â‘invisibilityÂ’ power up or tree ent gave you natureÂ’s guise or your allied hero just stunned the enemy and his position is saying Â“please trap meÂ” Anyway, given these unusual circumstances, make the best out of it. If you got an Â‘invisibilityÂ’ power up, take your time and cast the wards on the enemy when he is alone or when they are only 2, shackles the other one. If you see medusa running away and your allied Sven just storm bolt(ed) her near you, then do it quick.<br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>Rhasta /w Other Heroes:<br><br>Counters:<br><br>- Chen<br>- Omniknight<br>- Silencer<br>- SA<br>- Nerubian Assassin<br>- Windwalkers/Blinkers/especially...Tankers<br><br>Allies:<br><br>- Fast Killers such as Phantom Assassin, Ursa Warrior, Anti-Mage, Razor<br>- Treant Protector<br>- Naga Siren<br>- Bane Elemental<br>- Witch Doctor<br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>10 Tip You Should Remember When Playing /w Rhasta <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> :<br><br>1. In competitive games, never skip EulÂ’s. You could opt not to buy it only if you are practicing your ward trapping techniques, and in this case learn voodoo first before shackles.<br><br>2. Be creative in ward trapping. Remember that the reason why you try to ward trap is so that the enemy canÂ’t move. Think of other ways to do this (Like Tree EntÂ’s OG, or outside the Chronosphere, or inside ProphetÂ’s Sprout).<br><br>3. Trees also act as good blockers for ward trapping. Meaning if you see an enemy hero standing beside a tree, trapping him is easier.<br><br>4. Try not to cast your wards inside the range of the towers since towers always hit your wards first. If you want, you could cast it just outside its range earning you 2 creep waves at the most.<br><br>5. The value of the dagger to Rhasta is worth every penny paid. It helps in ward trapping, it saves your ass, and it opens the door to some other skills that Rhasta could do.<br><br>6. If Rhasta has no items adding to intelligence, he would be unable to complete the combo (which is Voodoo, Wards, Shackles and Forked). The importance of this information is during death match mode. That is why items such as nulls, soul booster and eulÂ’s are there to help you out. By the way, refresher combo of instant 16 snakes, Rhasta normally could not support such mana consuming technique without Soul Booster or Guinsoo.<br><br>7. Double click on one of the wards to Mass Select them. Always do this when ward trapping.<br><br>8. If youÂ’re having difficulty pulling of a successful ward trap, remember to always get near the hero (at about 200-400 range). The nearer you are to the hero, the easier it is to trap him.<br><br>9. You can always enclose yourself with your wards. Melee attackers would have to break one of your wards in order to hit you. This is a technique I use when caught in a tight spot.<br><br>10. Always remember this tip  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> .<br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>THESE ARE MY FINAL WORDS:<br><br>TO WHOM IS READING THIS, THANK YOU ALL. IN THE FUTURE, I WILL TRY TO MAKE MORE GUIDES AND THANK YOU. THESE ARE MY FINAL WORDS.<br><br>So with that it brings an end to my very second guide.<br>Rhasta: Don't worry... Be Happy...<br></div>

Why Shackles First before Voodoo, isnÂ’t Voodoo essential for ward trapping?<br><br>I believe that Shackles is more powerful than Voodoo, especially early game with the 40/sec damage and the longer duration of disable. Plus, the main player in ward trapping early on is cyclone, so no problem there.
