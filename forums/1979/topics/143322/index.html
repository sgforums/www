            <div class='col-md body'>Alright dota players.. we've all seen it happen.. what do you all think? Is backdooring a legitimate strategy (that means from the onstart, item and skill builds should be geared to prepare for backdooring late game) or should backdooring be illegal?<br><br>I've spent sometime reading the argument over at dota-allstars.com (from now on known as DAS). TDA defines backdooring as "teleporting into base and taking out buildings".. the grey area occurs when a pumped up sven or a manta-ed medusa or a windwalking clinkz WALKS (keyword: WALKS) into the base and SOLOs the base. Is that backdooring?</div>

The outer most two towers in each lane are not considered as border of base.

Heroes that can teleport (Furion) and backdoor will be banned for exploit. This includes teleporting onto the KOTL ultimate(not just furion, anyone with BOT). <strong>All other heroes may backdoor. To further clarify, you CAN backdoor with furion / KOTL... what you cannot do is use any type of teleportation such as teleporting onto KOTL ulti with BOT or using furion's teleport spell (even with morph) to TP inside the enemies base. You can teleport near it, like in the forest below it, and then walk in, that is ok. </strong>You simply can't TP directly inside their base, or right next to a tower in their base etc... This is not in black in white as to the radius of how far you need to be to not get banned for TPing into their base, as usual, mods will have full discretion when deciding, don't be stupid about it. "<br><br>(<a href="http://leagues.theigs.com/dota/Rules.asp" rel="nofollow">http://leagues.theigs.com/dota/Rules.asp</a>)<br><br>So if we clearly define backdooring as teleporting into opponent's base it's not allowed. But what about windwalking to the person's base? What about an overpowered Sven who solo's towers and bases?What about furion running in raising treants and teleporting out of base?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there is really nothing wrong with late game backdooring.. i used to be very against it as well but if you think about it.. if you allow the opponent's naix or sven or clinkz or bounty hunter to become so powerful that they can solo a tower then you deserve to be backdoored. After all there are plenty of ways to counter backdooring.. u just have to be smart about it and take your dota game to the next level..<br><br>But it is still infuriating when you're playing a 3 v 5 game after 2 of your teammates leave early (hence not much pumping of items) and you manage to hold your ground.. then when you start to push.. the enemy uses its numerical superiority to defend and send one hero to backdoor your base..<br><br>I think what we are addressing here is an issue with late games. When its a 5 v5 late game and all the heroes are equally matched at level 25.. even if one team of heroes reaches level 25 first and seem to be on the verge of winning, it's only a matter of time before the other team reaches lvl 25 and gets crazy items as well.. then what happens? i've been in games lasting over 2 hours 5 v 5 (pub games leh) and the end result is that both teams frantically farm and try pumping one hero with aegis and rapier, then sending them out to try soloing or doing something outrageous..<br><br>How can dota's game play be improved so that "late game-play" doesn't become so stereotyped and still manage to remain as dynamic as the game is in "early game"??</div>

When Death Penalty is activated, any hero who die will be out of the game.<br><br>This will ensure that the game will not drag to a stage where people start doing outrageous things. A good Dota game should not last more than 1.4 hours.<br><br>Another alternative is to rely on the scoresheet to decide who is the winner.<br>This method can be used if there is no conclusive winner after 1.4 hours.</div>
