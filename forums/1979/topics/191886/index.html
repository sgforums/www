            <div class='col-md body'>The Skeleton King had saw Tiny the stone giant coming towards him and started to retreat back to his tower.<br>Tiny was no longer tiny, he was huge. He was almost twice as tall as Skeleton King and every step Tiny took shook the ground. Skeleton King stood at his tower and raised his sword. Tiny was moving at an incredible speed for his huge size.<br><br>As he lowered his sword fiercely, the scourge army charged forward. Tiny sent a lot of rocks forward and stunned them all, injuring many. The Skeleton King recovered quickly and sent a storm bolt flying through the air to stop tiny from doing more damage. With a few hits, the Skeleton King regained his health, but surprise, Tiny threw the Skeleton King upwards and laughed. While skeleton king was on his way down, Tiny sent a punch of tremendous power through his ribs and skeleton king was sent flying backwards. It was a punch so powerful it broke his ribs.<br><br>The tower was doing all it can, throwing damage at Tiny. But Tiny laughed because the damage was nothing to take note of. As Tiny prepared to summon the rocks again, Skeleton King got back to his feet and launched another storm bolt at him. He quickly attacked Tiny to regain some health, but Tiny recovered from the stun and sent the rocks flying and started raining some really massive punches on Skeleton King. In a few moments, the skeleton king was dead. Tiny started to back away, delighted with his victory over the Skeleton King. All this while the tower was attacking Tiny, and Tiny was hurt pretty bad. But while Tiny was backing away, the Skeleton King came back to life. Tiny turned around to take a good look at the battlefield but when he saw the Skeleton King, he got the shock of his life. Tiny started running, but the Skeleton King threw another storm bolt at him. Skeleton King ran up to him, and with a few furious slashes of his sword, and another storm bolt, ended the giant's killing spree. Tiny collasped to the ground, sending dust through the air.<br><br>Suddenly, right before his very eyes, the Skeleton King saw the Prophet dropped down from the skies.<br><br>"What the hell?" Skeleton King muttered to himself. Out of the corner of his eyes he saw he saw the Dwarven Sniper aimming a shot at him, from afar.<br><br>"Dammit. I am so dead." He said to himself.<br><br>The Prophet planted a ring of trees around the skeleton king. These trees were so hard and strong nobody has ever gotten out of it before. He had only heard of Spiritbreaker, one of his close friends, get out with a charge of darkness. But he wasnt Spiritbreaker.<br><br>"You are so dead, Skeleton King. you shall pay for killing a member of the Sentinel, Tiny !!!" The Prophet Furion cried as he attacked the skeleton king madly. The Sniper unleashed a hell of a long range shot, which almost caused the Skeleton King to collapse.<br><br>Suddenly, Skeleton King could feel two of his rib bones being tugged at by something cold, and hard. He flew out of the trees and before he could turn around to see what was going on, he heard the familar voice of Pudge the Butcher.<br><br>"Ruuun, my friend !!!"<br><br>The Skeleton King started running back to the Scourge's fountain to refuel himself. And he lived to fight another day.</div>
