            <div class='col-md body'>how many of you has been challenge to a 1v1 game after overwhelming the other team.. all the accusing of mh.. then flaming .. then finally challenging you to a 1v1 game .. daring you to do so ..<br><br>personally, i find that 1v1 is for noob.. the geography of a 5v5 game &amp; a 1v1 game is so much different. 5v5 require teamworks, tactic and flexibility. whereas 1v1 is so fixed, once the heroes are choosen.. the result is more or less confirm if both side know how to play.. u only has to learn a gay hero to win...<br>everyone will be using a gay hero =.= ..  1v1 is so boring..<br>let's say i use bloodseeker, the other party were to use rhasta or skeleton king. surely the bloodseeker would hardly have a chance to kill .. but if it's a 5v5 game .. the result would be different.. u need to cooperate to win .. u dont have to have the highest kill to be pro ..<br><br>i feel that 1v1 are for people who are unable the grasp the concept of team dynamic.. some just farm for the whole 5v5 game without defencing, at the cost of the rest team dying .. middle rax gone .. in the end getting the highest kill proclaiming themselves to be pro .. saying that their teammates are noob.. but still losing the game ..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>DoTA is a team game. Sure, you can play 1v1, but that just kinda takes the fun out of it. I agree when one plays 1v1, every little decision counts, because there's not teammate to back you up, whether it's to gang a hero or to cover your mistake. But 5v5 requires a WHOLE lot more skill, micro, intuition, and teamwork. That said, 1v1 is good for practice, like (mentioned above) lane control.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True enough, Dota itself is a team game. It is proven that, a single hero will not win over 3 or more heroes on NORMAL basis.<br><br>But then again, Its we players who actually experiment the game. And eventually find out some other ways to play the game as well.<br><br>True enough, perhaps 1v1 dota defeats the purpose of DOTA but its fun nevertheless. Besides, there are also competitions for it. So somehow, Its actually recognized as a different playing way <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>EDIT:<br>To add, Im sure some of you might had played some draft matches before as well. And often there will have a single hero soloing; Viper, Warlock, Qop, Thd etc. etc.<br><br>So perhaps 1v1 dota isn't that dumb, But perhaps it might act as a training to the form of LANE CONTROL. Which isn't so bad after all? What say you guys?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sexyfats:</div><div class="quote_body">i agree 1v1 and 5v5 requires different skill. but you get lost about the part when you say 1v1 is dumb.<br><br>im not eloquent but i'll try my best here. there are people who just keep winning in 1v1s and those who lose. the reason is that they just know what it takes to win. i know im not the best at 1v1s. 5v5 is more my thing. but i do understand 1v1 requires possesion of a skill that im practicsing so as to become better at lane control in 5v5. in 1v1, you try to get into your opponent's head.<br><br>people bet money on 1v1 matches. money. 1v1 does require skill. it makes you think so very hard, every decision of yours counts alot. it teaches you to adjust your item build, and the perfect time to use your skills as everything counts. eventually you are sharpened and you can take this to 5v5 where the people i meet usually do not think. im not a bad player, humbly speaking. but i lost to an sa with enchant 1v1. granted em and i was slacking. but he was definately great in 1v1. played with him alot since and becoming quite bloody good now.<br><br>having said that. you cant beat bane 1v1. </div></blockquote>True enough, If we were to start the game with 3500 1v1. Bane would have a upper hand. But as far as I know it, Some of the 1v1s competitions I had played. They often started with 500 gold(Including hero pick) . I guessed it isn't only the hero that was chosen that gurantee the win, But there are also other factors such as, Terrain knowledge? Farming? Etc etc.</div>
