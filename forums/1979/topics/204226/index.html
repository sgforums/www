So whats the use of having her to deny the opponent fighter, if the fighter can just ask his teamate to buy the items for him.<br><br>Individual skills are needed for these and teamwork skills are needed for big battles.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, it's quite unfair as certain heroes like RockeY mentioned are able to take on 3 - 5 players alone, especially Naix, Phantom Assasin and Terrorblade when they have the proper equipment.<br><br>If the last player is going to be someone like Lich or Zeus (people who can't run, no disable), who the heck is going to care? Even if they had infinate money no one is going to be scared of them. Just gang them and they'd die patheticly.<br><br>On the other hand, if it's a late-game hero (must have healing) like any of the 3 which I mentioned above, the other team is probably doomed. For example, Naix with his gay 40% lifesteal can probably just go around biting everyone up while the victim's teammates try but fail to kill Naix.<br><br>And yes, it is possible. Sometime ago I was playing Terrorblade, and my teammates were getting owned upside down so they all left, and so I took their items, pawned some of them for cash, and in the end I had Treads, S&amp;Y, Aegis, Rapier, Skadi. I tried to fight their team, but lost because I got disabled too much, and their Naga Siren burned away all my mana.
