            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all...<br><br>I've been playing DotA for decently long... Maybe more than a year plus, can't really remember.<br><br>I m going to relate my long story about my DotA experiences. Please bear with me. Anyway...<br><br>Back in the old days (version 5.5x), the dotA community is a lot happier &amp; noob free. Every one watches his team mates' backs, and very few finger pointing happen, if at all. Most players are nice and mature, and very few people do stupid things, like spoiling the game or feeding on purpose.<br><br>However, sometime during the release of 5.84c, there is a huge intake of new DotA players, especially in Singapore. Then we have people forming clans. And then we have all these new 3rd party software (maphacks, banlist) appearing.<br><br>Programs like banlist, I don't mind, since it helps us to keep tabs of those jokers who leave or spoil games. However, maphacks really spoil the game, which I m sure you all already know. I have played games where the enemies know exactly where my team mates and I were. Every damn time. Even if I were to go farm on neutral creeps, all of a sudden, the whole enemy team appears out of nowhere and gangbang me. I checked the replay, and the enemies have no wards, and neither were they using treant-protector or any invisible units. Go figure....<br><br>Now, about clans... What can I say. Some clans are really good, while some clans plain stink. Even some of the more "pro" clans are hoaxes. When the enemies start owning them, they start using programs to flood the enemies' internet connection and make them lag out. I m sure some of you know what I m talking about. Ever being disconnected from a game INSTANTLY before, even though there is nothing wrong with your modem and ISP? I played in a team with this really notorious SG clan (not putting name here), and they started to call their friend (the host) to "kick" the enemy who was making things hard for them. Seconds later, that enemy really got dropped from the game! Then this clan started to laugh at the enemy team and calling them noobs and leavers.... YA RIGHT!<br><br>People always say that clan players are good, but in my opinion, that's because clan players always pick some really smelly combination (such as VS and CM). I have no issues with smelly combinations, but to see some clans boast that they are pro just because they have a full team of stunners really sicken me. I've seen some xia lan clan members play in non-clan games (that means, without their clan mates), then they get owned like siao, then they leave.<br><br>Another thing that is really irritating about many players is that they complain that they kena gangbang by enemies. I mean, HELLO? DotA is a team game. Why do you think DotA is created as a 5v5 game? If your teamwork sucks and you dare to run around alone when you are as weak as a kitten, it's not the enemies' fault that they take you out easily. You either learn teamwork, or quit DotA altogether.<br><br>I also cannot stand some players who are super kan cheong. It doesn't hurt to farm a bit (as long as the enemies ain't pushing too hard). Some players keep on nagging and nagging to push all the way, then they get owned (because they are under-levelled &amp; have sucky items), then they blame you, then they leave. It is a no brainer that if you are using a late-game hero (PA, Naix mainly), you MUST farm. Going toe-to-toe with early-game heroes like CM or Sandking is suicide.<br><br>Another type of player that totally cannot make it, is the type who wants you to report enemy hero status to them every damn time. I mean, early game, when most heroes stick to their lanes, it is fairly easy to see which enemy heroes are missing and report accordingly. However, mid-game onwards, most heroes tend to run around like siao, hoping to backstab or gangbang. You cant expect me to report and report and report every fricking 5 seconds, right? If you don't see any enemy heroes on the map, use your brain and DON'T push so far out alone.<br><br>Anyway, I got to go &amp; that's all I have to say for now.<br><br>What are some of your experiences with really irritating players in DotA so far? Please share!<br><br>Cheers!</div>
