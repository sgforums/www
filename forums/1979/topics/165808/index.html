            <div class='col-md body'>An example.....(not my story)<br><br>The Fight Against Time<br><br>Magina pulls a cloth across his eyes. To him, the time of day has no meaning. He has never seen the life of light, nor has he seen the cold of night. What lies behind his tattered mask was for no one to see. Not even his enemies. Especially, his enemies. Magina sits leaning against the great oak tree. Magina hears the river that stretches across Aezaroth. River Salare. He recognizes the river by the way it flows, the sound it makes as it crashes upon the rocks. Just like a musical note. Magina hears the world playing its music, each sound unique and different, each sound a brushstroke painting a picture in his head. A picture of intense black and white. A picture of the world. His ears are his eyes. What he is able to see behind his mask is the light of life, known as mana. Every living creature has mana. The trees, the animals; the Scourge. Mana flows throughout the body of living creatures, allowing Magina to see the form of a living creature; shapes of blue.<br><br>Magina looks up at the sky. The red sun hides itself behind a mountain. All he sees is white. White that bleeds off onto the black mountains. He remembers blue. Not the blue that he sees ever so often, but the blue only made possible by the sky. He remembers the colour of the sky. The last thing he saw with his true eyes before they burned. Burnt by the insatiable power which blinded him; burnt by mana. His screams echoed throughout Hyjal. Creatures of his race sought to help. They rushed to the wheat fields where he was on his kness savoring his eyes and screaming. His eye lids were sealed shut; melted flesh onto melted flesh. His people tried to persuade him back to the village, but he pushed away anyone who tried to help. He no longer cared about the excrutiating pain and pryed his eyes open with his bared hands. At that instant, no longer was he able to keep the insatiable power in control....<br><br>The sound of a snapping twig jerks Magina out from his dream. He leaps onto his feet and draws both of his weapons, the Moonblades, a two-pronged curved blade. He listens. The grinding stones and the ruslting of leaves on Aezaroth soil paints a mental picture in his head. Not an animal, not a friend; he smells the air; the smell of a Scourge. The sudden burst of mana clouds him in a sea of blue. He has no time to react. Not with this Scourge.<br><br>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br>xxxxxxxxx<br><br>The creature takes cover from behind the trees, careful not to give his position away.<br><br>He's sensing me. I need to strike now.<br>Time... Time.<br><br>The creature got into a state of frenzy. focusing on the mana within him, he creates blades of focused energy that cuts through time. Time is sliced into many layers. Spaces within the layers were empty voids; timeless. The creature moves swiftly, weaving in and out of the layers cullingly. By slicing time, he can leap in and out where time stops for him in the voids. In less than a breath, the creature leaps out of the last void, standing right infront of the Anti-Mage. Without a trace of emotion on his face, the faceless creature raises his hammer.<br><br>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br>xxxxxxxxx<br><br>Blinded by the cloud of blue, Magina can only hear what is coming next. As the Hammer of the Faceless Void cuts through the air, Magina can only react by raising his blade to block the blow. The impact is so immense that is throws Magina of his feet. He slides across the ground, stunned by the blow. He tries to get back on his feet. The pain is excrutiating. He torques his head. The creature stops infront of him.<br><br>MAGINA<br>"Dark Terror..."<br><br>Dark Terror tilts his head a little, looking at Magina through voided eyes.<br><br>In Magina's head, he sees the black hammer raising into the white sky. Tha hammer dawns down on him, rippling the air. The hammer craters the ground. Only the ground.<br>Magina is gone.<br><br>Although voided of emotions, Dark Terror looks down, as if curious to where Magina is. All of a sudden, he drops to his knees. He felt the cold blade skewed in his back. If he can only scream.<br><br>MAGINA<br>"You blinked."<br><br>Magina whispers from behind his ear. The stench of blood from the Scourge lingers in the air. Just as Magina is about to rax the faceless void with his other Moonblade, he is drowned is a sea of blue once more.<br><br>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br>xxxxxxxxx<br><br>Dark Terror forces himself up, eradicating the blade peirced in his back. As he pulls his hammer out from the ground, he turns around and stares at the Anti-Mage. Magina, locked in his sphere of voided time. He is too weak to fight. Dark Terror drags himself away, away from the frozen Anti-Mage.<br><br>Dark Terror<br>Another place. Another Tiiiime.<br><br>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br>xxxxxxxxx<br><br>Magina slices his blade into thin air. He raises his blood stained blade to his face.<br><br>MAGINA<br>"An eye for an eye, makes the world go blind."<br><br>In a blink...<br><br>he's gone.</div>
