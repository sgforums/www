            <div class='col-md body'>DevilÂ’s Own<br><br>The waves splashing onto the shore could be heard as I awake. Reynar was still sleeping by my side. I got up from the bed, put on my robe and went into the balcony. The sea breeze was already messing up my hair, but the feeling was refreshing.<br><br>I went to ReynarÂ’s side, gave me a gentle peck on his cheek and when I turned around he hugged me by surprise. We playfully fought for a while. Â“Alright, that is enough. I need to wash up. ItÂ’s getting late,Â” Reynar said, Â“we shall continue with this tonight.Â” With a wink, he went into the bathroom.<br><br>I strode into our walk in wardrobe and took out his favorite suit. I could hear him singing in his shower, as I picked out my clothes. I laid his suit on the arm chair, and went into the kitchen to fix him some breakfast.<br><br>Coffee and toast were ready when he finally got dressed. He gave me a peck on my cheek and left for work about half an hour later. I turned on the audio system and went to wash up.<br><br>Wearing his oversized tee shirt, I went into the study room, and look through my materials. IÂ’m working in an event management company and I only have to report to work when I have projects on hand. The current event that IÂ’m organizing will be held in a new club.<br><br>This eventÂ’s publicity caught the attention of the public. The event is the launching of the new club. With the hire of part time dancers as the crew of the night, I would expect a lot of men to come to the event. However, I would want women to be interested in the programs, so I gave the orders that ladies enter the club for free. The highlighted program in the club is that, on all Wednesdays, only singles are allowed into the club. The club would be divided into 2 sections for the individual sexes. From there on, the host of the night; would pick out 5 of the most eligible man, and one female who is being selected from a box full of their names. A series of entertainment will be carried out. For those that were not selected, they are free to mingle around after the entertainment.<br><br>This plan was approved by my company within 3 days and the preparation of it took months. Surveys, marketing research and the facility itself, have brought me and my colleagues much headache.<br><br>I called up my colleagues, Joshua and Mel for a last meeting back at the office in 2 hours time. I wore my favorite white cotton sleeveless top, Mango pinstripe pants and blazer. As I was getting ready, the phone rang. ReynarÂ’s voice was on the other side, Â“Darling, IÂ’ll be going partying with my colleagues tonight, so will be home late.Â” I replied, Â“Ok, IÂ’ll be working late as well, so see you in the morning.Â”<br><br>When we got married half a year ago, we came to a compromise not to ask each other about our work. As my job consists of certain information not to be divulge, I do not bring my work home unless necessary. Reynar serves the army in a special confidential unit. He, too, have many information not to be shared with anyone including his wife. ThatÂ’s where the compromise comes in.<br><br>I drove my black Mitsubishi Lancer to the office. I was greeted by my superior as I entered the spacious, futuristic dÃ©cor of my office. Â“Van, thatÂ’s a great proposal for tonightÂ’s event. I donÂ’t care how you handle it; I want it to be the talk in town.Â” Ramie said, with a smile. Â“Ramie, IÂ’ve been in the company for 4 years, and youÂ’ve seen my work. Have I ever let you down?Â” I inquired with a raised eyebrow. He winked at me and left.<br><br>About 5 minutes later, Joshua and Mel arrived in my office. We went through some important points again, and contacted the necessary departments that everything is going well.<br><br>ItÂ’s about 2 hours once the meeting is over and the time is 6pm. We decided to go for dinner and head straight down to the club. The launch is to take place at 9pm sharp. We went to the deli across the street.<br><br>The club was still quiet when we got there. All the logistics and operations staff has arrived, awaiting orders from Joshua and Mel. IÂ’m only there to supervise and manage the event.<br><br>The club, named DevilÂ’s Own, is well known among all the youngsters and the executive crowd. With the area of about half a football field, it has 5 bars and 2 dance floors. It had an additional wine bar on the second level where they play jazz instead of club music.<br><br>The reporters have swarmed in around the club at about 7.30pm, just in time to set up their equipment. The crowd starts coming in at about 8, all clad in their best. Special guests came with their invitation cards were directed to a special area in the club reserved for them. They include higher management staff from the media, the advertising industry, the lawyers, bankers and some well known traders. These special guests are not eligible to join the entertainment later on, due to their prominent status.<br><br>Â“This is going to turn out to be the best event of the year.Â” Joshua claims excitedly. Â“Relax dude, this is going to be, if your coordination is good.Â” I smiled at him. I was seated in the bar with the managing director, Simon, looking at the great response. Â“Van, you are doing a really good job, IÂ’ve no regrets engaging your company.Â” He was grinning from ear to ear. I sipped my wine and smiled.<br><br>I signaled Mel, to come over when heÂ’s engaged in a conversation with the door bitch, Amber. Â“Hey, youÂ’re supposed to be screening the crowd and liaise with the bouncers to do crowd control, and not to hit on to that girl. You can do that after the event.Â” I reprimanded. Mel nodded his head and apologized. He always listened to me like an elder sister. The important thing is he obeys instructions. Â“He would make a good soldierÂ” the thought suddenly crosses my mind.<br><br>Â“Hey Van, I think itÂ’s time we do our socializing with the special guests in the VIP chamber.Â” Simon whispered into my ear.  I nodded and he took my hand into his arms.<br><br>Upon entering the VIP chamber, I saw many familiar faces such as Mr. Steiner from Global Entertainment Enterprises; Miss Jade from the LawyerÂ’s Association; Mr. Dennis, the advertising tycoon; and several others. We exchange formalities and engaged in several conversations. The time is 8.30pm. I excused myself to supervise the launch.<br><br>I went to get hold of Joshua. Joshua is in charge of the entertainment sector of the launch as well. Â“Are the dancers and the host of the night here yet?Â” I asked as we walked to the dressing room. Â“Yes, allÂ’s well. Just waiting for the countdown.Â” Joshua replied.<br><br>The first program of the night is the host introducing the highlights of the night, the dancersÂ’ performance. The second program would be the launch of DevilÂ’s Own with Simon introducing what the club is about. Then the most awaited game, the host will pick out 5 guys for one lucky lady to choose.<br><br>As the launch took place, I went around the club, socializing with the VIPs and the management of the club. The launch was very successful. After the event, it was about 4 in the morning. We tidy up, and sent everyone packing up the equipment. As I had been drinking, I called Reynar up.<br><br>Â“Darling, are you able to fetch me home?Â” I asked. Â“Alright, where are you? IÂ’ll take a cab down.Â” He replied. I gave him the address and he arrived in 15 minutes. I gave my orders to Joshua and Mel, and told them to take a rest tomorrow.<br><br>Reynar took my stuff and placed it in the boot. I got into the car. On the way home, I could see that ReynarÂ’s mind was thinking about something else. Â“Are you ok?Â” I asked with concern. Â“IÂ’m fine, baby, maybe a little tired.Â” Reynar replied.<br><br>When I got into the office the next day, there were quite a few bouquets of flowers on my desk. Caught by surprise, I ask my secretary who send them. Â“Not sure though. All delivered by the florist. Cards are in them,Â” Lena replied.<br><br>I took out one card and it read, Â“It was great having you around last night, terrific party. Good work. Yours sincerely, SimonÂ”. I called him at his office and thank him for the flowers. He insisted I have lunch with him and will pick me up. I couldnÂ’t find a reason to reject and agreed.<br><br>Reynar was training his platoon to be the best in the upcoming marksman competition. He was thinking of what happened the night before and he was glad he did the right thing.<br><br>He was having drinks with his army friends at a wine bar. A lady who is around her early twenties entered the bar, turning numerous heads. Gorgeous and breathtaking, sheÂ’s indeed beautiful. Sitting alone and sipping her wine, a few young men approached her. She rejected them straight away. Reynar was paying quite some attention to her. Tilting her head up, she saw Reynar looking at her and gave a seductive smile. Reynar smiled and turn back to his group of friends.<br><br>To their surprise, she came over and introduced herself as Violet and asked to be seated with them. As sheÂ’s the only female and the guys were all married, Reynar declined her. With a smile, she said, Â“No problem.Â”<br><br>The night with the boys ended quite early and he was getting into the car, Violet appeared in front of his car. She suggested that Reynar give her a lift home. Sensing some hidden agenda, Reynar told her firmly, Â“IÂ’m happily married and I wouldnÂ’t want to do something hurtful to my wife. All I can do for you is to help you fetch a taxi.Â” VioletÂ’s face changed, and said, Â“You really do not know how to appreciate beautiful woman, do you?Â” Â“IÂ’m ending this conversation now.Â” With that, he drove away.<br><br>Reynar was not a man easily tempted by beauty, wealth and fame. He was very satisfied to have Van as his wife, nothing and nobody could take that away from him. He had very much want to tell Van about the incident when he went to fetch her home, however he decided not to.<br><br>He decided to call Van and asked her out for dinner. Although both of them are happily married, Reynar feels that married life should be the same as the courtship, that the relationship often needs some spice in it. Â“Hello, itÂ’s me. Want to date you for dinner tonight, you free?Â” Reynar asked. Â“Ok, you decide the place and let me know.Â” Van answered, smiling in her heart.<br><br>Â“WhoÂ’s that?Â” Simon asked. Â“Oh, thatÂ’s my husband.Â” Van said, smiling happily. Simon was caught in a surprise. Â“I didnÂ’t know you are married, because on you name card, your name is Ms Van.Â” He enquired, disappointedly. Â“I just got married half a year ago. Well, I believe work is work, so thereÂ’s no intention of changing my name card.Â” She answered, failing to see SimonÂ’s disappointment.<br><br>As Van eats her lunch, Simon was admiring her good looks and petite figure. At the age of 25, she looks like a college girl. Who knew that she is so capable and married at such a young age? Van felt him staring and looked up, Â“WhatÂ’s wrong? SomethingÂ’s on my face?Â” Van said, quickly feeling her face for some weird object. Â“No, no. Was just thinking about something.Â” Simon said, blushing. With some careless chatter after their meal, Simon drove her back to the office.<br><br>Â“It was nice having lunch with you,Â” Van said, Â“Hopefully we will have more projects to do together.Â” Van was taking it as a corporate lunch, when Simon was not. Â“ Even if it is not business, I presume I could still ask you out for lunch, can I?Â” Simon teased. She nodded, gave a smile and went into the lift.<br><br>IÂ’m not giving her up, Simon thought. With that thought, he decided to date and know more of Van.<br></div>
