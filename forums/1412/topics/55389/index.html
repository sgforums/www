            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: orange;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What Are Wuzzles? </strong></span></span></span><br><br>Wuzzles are winged creatures that are two animals in one and live in the Land of Wuz.  Legend says that somewhere on Earth there is such a place but no one knows where it is.  Wuzzles use the same things that we find in our own house such as a sink, knives and forks, and the telephonograph(?).  Okay so some things that they use are a little different, but then again we have broomvacs.<br><br>There was an animated television series from Disney called "Disney's Wuzzles" which aired back in 1985.  This series featured superior animation techniques, more cells and frames, and vivid colours.  The result is a very smooth flow of animation.  There were only thirteen episodes of the Wuzzles and one of them was released in the theaters.  I'm guessing that there was plans for more episodes, but the series didn't make it to the second season.<br><br>Just before the series, there was a huge toy line of the Wuzzles released by Disney and Hasbro Bradley.  Stuff from plush Wuzzles, posable figures, miniatures, radios, bed sheets, books, clothing, and possibly other stuff.  From what I know, the plush toys were dated back to 1984.  A second set of the original Wuzzles was released with six new ones through 1985 to 1986.  This new set of Wuzzles had a new series of books.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://members.fortunecity.com/matthewl/images/jpg/series/bumblelion/bumblelion3.jpg"><br><br>Bumblelion (part bumble bee and part lion) is the most courageous out of all the Wuzzles next to Rhinokey, though there's some situations were he'd rather not be.  His house is a large bee hive and it has an Olympic style race track circling it.  Out side his front door is a chin-up bar and a podium.  He has high interests in Butterbear.<br><br><img src="http://members.fortunecity.com/matthewl/images/jpg/series/rhinokey/rhinokey3.jpg"><br><br>Rhinokey (part rhinoceros and part monkey) is a taxi cab driver and a full-time practical joker.  He's got practical jokes from fake hands to whoopee cushions.  He's bad at arithmetic and hates hostile audiences.  At any moment, he always tries to get the last laugh, especially if it involves Hoppopotamus.  He lives in a treehouse that has a banana peel-like roof and some other strange features.  If you're dropping by to visit, I'd rather knock on the front door than using the doorbell.  It might be booby-trapped with one of his jokes.  I think it exploded the last time.  Some of his friends call him Rhiny.<br><br><img src="http://members.fortunecity.com/matthewl/images/jpg/series/eleroo/eleroo1.jpg"><br><br>Eleroo (part elephant and part kangaroo) is all nerves, a little clumsy, and has been known to eat the restaurants out of business (almost.)  He stores things in his pouch but sometimes has trouble looking for what he wants.  He collects all sorts of stuff from pianoharps to telephotographs.  If you want it, he's got it.  That's if you're into very unusual stuff.  He wishes that he could fly because his little wings aren't strong or big enough.<br><br><img src="http://members.fortunecity.com/matthewl/images/jpg/series/butterbear/butterbear3.jpg"><br><br>Butterbear (part butterfly and part bear) is the nature lover.  She bakes all sorts of goodies and treats.  She also puts canning jars out whenever there's a tropical fruit storm occurring.  She'll go over the limit to help her friends or enemies.  She's an excellent gardener too, she can even make cement grow!  As far as I know, she's the only Wuzzle I've seen who can fly.<br><br><img src="http://members.fortunecity.com/matthewl/images/jpg/series/moosel/moosel1.jpg"><br><br>Moosel (part moose and part seal) has a very vivid imagination that gets him into trouble.  He lives in a lighthouse (that sounds pretty normal) and owns a chugboat.  His favourite food is liver-spinach sandwiches (yuck!)  He usually has some good ideas to help out his friends.<br><br><img src="http://members.fortunecity.com/matthewl/images/jpg/series/hoppopotamus/hoppopotamus4.jpg"><br><br>Hoppopotamus (part hippopotamus and part rabbit) is the heaviest of all the wuzzles and loves to act and sing.  Believe me, her singing will move the audience out of the town.  She also tries her best to get a good compliment from Bumblelion, but is usually harassed by Rhinokey's jokes.  Her friends call her Hoppo.<br><br></div>
