            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Rosemarie, the only girl in a family of boys, went fishing with her dad.

They just came out of the water!" -- Ruby Braun (grandmother of Rosemarie) of Wautoma, Wisconsin.</span><br><br>_______________________________________<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Betty's grandson James, 3, was expecting a baby sister.

Unfortunately two met untimely passings. Paige wanted to know where cats and dogs go when they die. Her grandmother told her a story about "Rainbow Heaven" for pets and that satisfied Paige. Then her puppy, Alfalfa, got run over. That evening they were having a funeral for him and Paige asked everyone to say a prayer. When it was Paige's turn she got shy and said, "I don't know what to say". Her mom told her to just say what she'd like for Jesus to have Alfalfa do to have fun in "Rainbow Heaven." Paige bowed her head and with all seriousness said, "Jesus, don't You let Alfalfa mess with my cats up there!" On that note the funeral ended. -- Patsy Campbell (grandmother of Paige) of Portland, Tennessee.</span><br><br>__________________________________________<br><br><span style="color: blue;">When Caitlin was 2 they lived in an apartment complex with a pool.

Irma put down the word "sir" and Adriana said, "What's that word?" Irma told her, "sir." Then Adriana looked at her tiles and put down the word "up" in front of "sir."  Irma said, "Upsir is not a word."  Adriana said, "Yes, it is, Mommy, you know 'that's upsir.'" (Adriana meant, "That's absurd!")  -- Irma Cisneros of Detroit, Michigan.</span><br><br>__________________________________________<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Victoria, 6, often visits her neighbor Linda and feels free to ask for just about anything she wants to eat or drink.  But there are times she needs to check with her parents to see if she can eat certain things because she has acid reflux.  In a recent conversation, Victoria said, "I had some chocolate and it didn't throw me up!"  -- Linda Whittaker of South Carolina.</span><br><br>___________________________________________<br><br><span style="color: indigo;">Terry, 2, went shopping with his mother Shirley.  They were standing at the meat counter and Shirley let him choose the Thanksgiving turkey. Naturally, he chose the biggest one.  The butcher was nearby and volunteered to take Terry into the meat locker.  When he returned, Shirley asked, "What did you see in there, Terry?"  As loudly as he could, he responded "DEAD HORSES!"  To this day, 44 years later, that butcher says Terry ruined his business with just two words!  -- Shirley McGinnis of<br>Illinois.</span><br><br>___________________________________________<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Janice's granddaughter, 4, came over with bandages on both knees.

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">It was Sunday morning and time for the children's message.  The children had all come forward to the front of the church and were gathered around the pastor.  His topic was based upon the scripture passage, Ephesians 2:8: "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works, so that no one can boast."  The pastor asked the children, "Does anyone know what you have to do to get to heaven?"  There was a short silence, then one child said, "Well, you have to die."  -- Judith Hersel of Boulder City, Nevada.</span><br>________________________________________________<br><br><span style="color: indigo;">Jay and his wife took their granddaughter Baillie, 5, to a nearby farm owned by a close friend.  Jay's friend was telling them that two wild ducks had decided to build nests on his farm and one had taken up residence next to the main house and very close to his wife's flower garden.  He said the<br>mother duck was using the flowers to build her nest.  On the way home Baillie broke the silence with, "I know why that mama duck built her nest with the flowers -- so her babies will smell good!"  -- Jay Miller of Slaterville, Utah.</span><br><br>________________________________________________<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Alex started to learn numbers in preschool.  One day he brought home a 6 and his mom asked him to read.  He said "six."

She was doing some cleaning, and she asked Allison to take the broom and sweep off the large front porch. Allison didn't hesitate. When the grandmother saw the 3-year-old watching her big sister sweep, she was afraid she would feel left out so she asked, "Ashley, why don't you help clean off the porch." Ashley stuck out her lower lip, rolled her eyes and said, "I'm NOT your Cinderella!" -- Lottie Royal (grandmother of Ashley and Allison) of Wray, Georgia.</span><br><br>______________________________________________<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Gene decided to get a curly perm. Getting the curly perm made him about two hours late getting home. Stephen, 2, had never seen his father with curly hair. He had been waiting at the door, watching for his father. When his dad came through the door, Stephen did not go immediately to his father. He looked at his father for several minutes -- almost as if he didn't know him -- and then said, finally, "Dad, you got circles in your hair!" -- Reba Wagner (mother of Stephen) of Dunlap, Tennessee.</span><br><br>________________________________________________<br><br><span style="color: indigo;">Cody, 6, was watching a show on the Discovery Channel about underwater animals.

They were all outside enjoying the beautiful spring weather. Ashlyn, 7, and her friend Vanessa were coloring Mother's Day cards for Lora outside on the picnic table. Evan, 10, was playing football with his dad, and Alysia, 3, was sifting sand, gravel and rocks through a sifter. Alysia got Lora's attention when she yelled proudly, "Look, Mommy, I drew you a picture, too!" It was on the hood of Lora's brand new car. She did it with a rock! Lora explained to her that what she did was very bad, and it would have to be repainted. Alysia said crying, innocently, "Oh Mommy, I'm very sorry, but can I help you paint it?
