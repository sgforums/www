She wants to be one of the group, and the whole village accepts her as a treasured member of the community.<br><br>Wicket W. Warick: Wicket is well-liked by everyone in the village, because he is friendly and caring, and full of energy. Out of everyone in his family, Wicket is the the funniest. He is interested in all aspects of life in his Ewok village; he loves the magic, the special ceremonies, and he loves his Ewok friends.<br><br>Latara: A natural-born trickster, Latara is always ready to have fun. She is the opposite of the dreamy, introspective Teebo, but she is always trying to get Teebo to notice her. Latara will try anything, from standing on her head, to playing her flute outside his hut, to decorating his secret treehouse with sweet-smelling flower vines.<br><br>Teebo: Besides Princess Kneesaa, Teebo is one of Wicket's closest friends. Although he is considered lazy and a dreamer by the others, he is a dreamer and a poet. Teebo loves nothing better than to get out of the village and go exploring.<br></div>

He has a tender side as well, for he loves to tell the Woklings many stories and legends in front of a campfire. The whole village sleeps better at night knowing Chief Chirpa is watching over them.  Logray: Once a brave young Ewok warrior, the village witch doctor now serves as an advisor to Chief Chirpa. Usually Logray spends his time alone in his hut, studying or experimenting with new spells and potions. His knowledge of history, science, and magic has saved his village from many threats-- both from Endor and from other worlds.</div>

These distant cousins of the Ewoks turned away from the trees to worship the unseen and evil Night Spirit and made war on the gentler Ewoks. They are gangly, lanky creatures with pointed ears and long tails. Their fur is always full of itchy fleas, and they smell terrible.<br></div>
