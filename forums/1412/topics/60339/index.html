Three successful sequels followed it.<br><strong>TelevisionÂ—</strong>The Care Bears starred for two seasons on an ABC television network series. They also starred in their own syndicated series and two specials.<br><strong>PublishingÂ—</strong>Care Bears appeared in children's books, comic books, coloring and activity books. Over 45 million books were published.<br><strong>AudioÂ—</strong>Care Bears collections of children's songs were best-sellers in their category.<br><strong>Greeting CardsÂ—</strong>American Greetings sold over 70 million Care Bears cards in the 80s.<br><br><img src="http://www.care-bears.com/history/img/t_funfacts.gif"><br>Code name: Care Bears<br>The Care Bears characters were created in 1981 at American Greetings, but weren't sold as toys and other products until 1983. To keep the character program secret until it was ready to be advertised, it was called Project II by American Greetings and the company's partners. They were called this because Care Bears was the second group of characters American Greetings and these partners createdÂ—the first being the well-known and hugely successful Strawberry Shortcake characters.<br><br><strong>Care Bears Name Game </strong><br>It's never easy to get a group of people to agree on what something should be called. Before the final name is selected, most products or characters have numerous names called working names. What was the working name for Care Bears? Well, actually, it wasÂ…drum roll pleaseÂ… Care Bears! Everybody seemed to love this name right from the start!<br><br><strong>A Colorful Care Bears Switcheroo </strong><br>If you really, really know your Care Bears, you might be able to answer this question: what two Care Bears characters actually swapped their colors? When the first Care Bears teddy bears were being made, someone made a goof and Bedtime Bear, who is blue, got his color switched with Wish Bear, who is aqua. The mistake was discovered and the bears were switched back to their appropriate hues. No one thought anyone would notice, but the kids did. A special Care Bears story was written to explain how, on an important caring mission, Wish Bear needed to change to Bedtime Bear's blue to get into the land of dreams. If you know someone with an aqua Bedtime Bear or a Blue Wish Bear, you should let them know they have a very magical bear indeed!<br><br><strong>Care Bears and the Stars</strong><br>The Care Bears Movie, the characters' first feature length animated film, was a box office hit in 1985. The voices behind the bears and the human characters in the film included the famous actor, Mickey Rooney, who played the part of Nicholas, the story's narrator and a key character. The actress behind one Care Bear's voice in the film was Georgia Engels, who played Georgette on The Mary Tyler Moore Show. The movie's theme song, Care-a-lot was penned and performed by singer/songwriter Carole King. One of the favorite songs from the flick was Nobody Cares Like a Bear, written and sung by John Sebastian, formerly of the 60s pop group The Loving Spoonful, which produced such hits as Summer in the City and Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind. Sebastian also wrote and performed the theme song for the 70s sitcom, Welcome Back Kotter.<br><br><strong>It Don't Mean a Thing If It Ain't Got That Heart</strong><br>Each Care Bear has a special mark of authenticity on it. Do you know what it is? It's a heart button labeled "Care Bears" that only appears on the bear's right hip. So that's the simple testÂ—a true-blue Care Bear has its heart in the right place. But if yours has a heartless right hip, then you've got a bogus bear on your hands.<br><br><strong>Care-a-lot/Camelot?</strong><br>One point of inspiration in the Care Bears story was the legend of King Arthur. The name Care-a-lot was a play on Camelot, King Arthur's wonderful castle. The Bears all met in Care-a-lot castle aroundÂ—not a round table as in the Arthur legendsÂ—but a heart-shaped table. Like the Knights of the Round Table, the Care Bears set off from their castle into the world on missions of caring representing the powers of good. Even Love-a-lot Bear owes a lot about her name to the old tales. Her name is based on Sir Lancelot'sÂ—one of the Knights of the Round Table.<br><br></div>
