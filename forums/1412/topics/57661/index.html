Enhanced Strength. Ablity to speak to fish and other sea creatures.<br><br><strong>Origin</strong>: Aquaman rules Atlantis along with his wife, Mera. He strives to bring peace to Atlantis whatever the cost, even if it means wiping out the surface world, though he would rather come to a more peaceful solution.<br><br><strong>Comments</strong>: Whereas Aquaman in Superman: The Animated Series was the orange-suited, short-haired pansy, Aquaman in Justice League is the long-haired, badass, hook version. Aquaman isn't a member of the League in the series, mainly because his chief responsiblity is to protect Atlantis. Except him to show up in the future, though not as a regular member.<br><br>As an intresting note, the comics version of Aquaman lost his hand when Pirahanas bit it off, whereas he cuts his own hand off to save his son in the animated version.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: indigo;"><strong> Aresia </strong></span></span><br><br><img src="http://www.jlanimated.com/episodes/furypart2/snap0551.jpg"><br><br><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Julie Bowen<br><br><strong>Powers</strong>: Amazon strength and agility.<br><br><strong>Origin</strong>: As a child Arestia's family was a victim of a war. While escaping, her ship crashed and the ship's captain helped Arestia make it safely to Themiscyra. The captain died saving her life and is the only man buried on Themiscyra. The Amazons gave Arestia their strength and agility, but Arestia was vengeful, and blamed men for the death of her family. She develops a bio-chemcial weapon that will wipe out men, and enlists the remenants of the Injustice Gang to help her spread her weapon. The Justice League manage to stop her and as her weapon explodes, Arestia is killed in the blast.<br><br>Comments: It's sort of unclear how to spell "Arestia." I believe the show uses Aresia, while the trading card series uses Arestia.<br><br>The creators of the show took "The Fury", who was part of Wonder Woman's supporting cast and turned her into Aresia. "The Fury" was actually Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor's daughter in the Golden Age, and is likely what the name of the episode she appears in refers to.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Batman</strong> ~ Dark Knight.</span></span><br><br><img src="http://www.jlanimated.com/comm/08.jpg"><br><br><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Kevin Conroy<br><br><strong>Powers</strong>: Olympic level athlete. The world's greatest detective. Keen scientific mind. Access to overwhelming amounts of weaponry, armory and "gadgets".<br><br><strong>Origin</strong>: Bruce WayneÂ’s parents were ruthlessly murdered when he was a child. Bruce swore that he would embark on a crusade, not to avenge his parentsÂ’ death, but to insure that the same thing doesnÂ’t happen to others. Training both mentally and physically, Bruce has become the worldÂ’s most dangerous man. Roaming the streets of Gotham City as Batman, he strikes fear in the hearts criminals everywhere.<br><br><strong>Comments</strong>: Batman is the only member of the Justice League without superpowers. What he lacks in raw strength, he makes up for with intelligence. Batman has a plan for every situation, and there is rarely a mystery that he canÂ’t solve. Although he arguably one of the best martial artists in the world, he serves the league by directing itÂ’s raw strength with the precision of a scalpel. Enemies will likely underestimate the Batman since heÂ’s only a Â“man,Â” but they should realize heÂ’s probably the most dangerous member of the League.<br><br>Batman rules through fear, and there is little doubt that he scares even some members of the Justice League. Whereas he trusts proven allies such as Superman and Martian Manhunter, he has little tolerance for brash superheroes who make mistakes. Batman wonÂ’t put up with The FlashÂ’s antics, or inexperienced superheroes. He may resent some members of the League who seem to rely too much on the powers, but understands that their power is the only answer to threats on a global scale.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Draaga </strong>~ War World Champion.</span></span><br><br><img src="http://www.jlanimated.com/episodes/warworldpart2/Image195.jpg"><br><br><strong>Voiced by</strong>: William Smith<br><br><strong>Powers</strong>: Super Strength<br><br><strong>Origin</strong>: Draaga was caught by Mongul and when he refused to fight in Mongul's gladiator games, Mongul threatened to destroy his home planet. Draaga agreed to compete, and soon dominated the other competitors to become the top fighter.<br><br>Draaga eventually was defeated by Superman, but Superman refused to kill Draaga. Draaga eventually made his way back to War World, and Superman convinced him to help defeat Mongul. Draaga took his place as the new ruler of War World.<br><br><strong>Comments</strong>: I would have liked to have seen Draaga, become a bigger villian and show up later with a vendetta against Superman, but his storyline is firmly rooted in comic history, and the writers didn't really want to change it. In any case, Draaga makes for a good character the way he's written, and I'd like to see him reappear if Mongul ever makes another apperance.<br></div>

Magical bolts. Super-Strength<br><br><strong>Origin</strong>: Jason Blood was a knight in King Arthur's court. When Morgaine Le Fay seduces Blood, she uses him to gain access to the castle. With Blood's help, Morgaine fells Camelot. Blood betrays his master and then Morgiane betrays him. As punishment, Merlin binds the demon Etrigian to Blood, and his is doomed to wander the Earth to atone for his betrayal.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Hawkgirl </strong>~ Thanagarian Warrior </span></span><br><br><img src="http://www.jlanimated.com/comm/02.jpg"><br><br><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Maria Canals<br><br><strong>Powers</strong>: Flight. Thangarians have access to a large arsenal of alien weapons. From the trailers, it seems as if Hawkgirl will wield an energy mace.<br><br><strong>Origin</strong>: Hawkgirl is part of the Thangarian police force.<br><br><strong>Comments</strong>: All right, IÂ’ll admit that I know nothing about Hawkgirl/Hawkman. I remember them from my superpowers action figures, but by the time I got back into comics they had already entered continuity hell. The animated version of Hawgirl is supposed to be a warm and friendly character, but when the action starts sheÂ’ll break out into Â“berserkerÂ” mode ala Wolverine.<br><br>Hawkgirl was added to provide another female character on the team. Though itÂ’s not a forced fit, since Hawkman and Hawkgirl have been long standing members of the League. I personally would have liked to see Black Canary, but I think that Hawkgirl fits better into the whole intergalactic action that the animated Justice League will have.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Hippolyta</strong> ~ Queen of the Amazons</span></span><br><br><img src="http://www.jlanimated.com/episodes/secretorigins/077.jpg"><br><br><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Susan Sullivan<br><br><strong>Powers</strong>: All Amazons are skilled fighters.<br><br><strong>Origin</strong>: Ruler of Themyscira. Queen Hippolyta rules the Amazons. She is the mother of Wonder Woman. She believes that Amazons have no place in Man's world, and discouraged Diana from particpating in affairs oustide of their home.<br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Justice Guild, The</strong></span></span><br><br><img src="http://www.jlanimated.com/episodes/legends1/legends065.jpg"><br><br><strong>Powers</strong>: Tom Turbine - Genius, Turbine Belt.<br>Green Guardsman - Power Ring<br>Black Siren - Sonic Scream<br>Catman - Skilled in fighting skills<br>The Streak - Super-Speed<br><br><strong>Origin</strong>: The Justice Guild of America exist on an alternate Earth. In the Justice League's Earth, writers would tell the JGA's stories in comic books. For some reason those writers stopped writing those comics.<br><br>When the Flash accidently sends the Justice League into the JGA dimension, it's discovered that the comic book writers actually had a connection to the alternate dimension and when the JGA died, the comic book died as well.<br><br>After the JGA died saving the world, Ray Thompson, the JGA's biggest fan recreated them with his mutant powers. The JGA gave their lives once again to defeat Ray and free the people under his control.<br><br><strong>Comments</strong>: The Justice Guild was supposed to be the Justice Society of America. When the creators of the show came up with the idea, DC comics didn't want them to portray the JSA as cheesy golden age heroes. It's not that the JSA weren't cheesy golden age heroes, but the modern age JSA was far from cheesy and it wouldn't be good to portray one of the leading superhero teams as the JGA was portrayed in Legends. The Justice Guild was the compromise.<br><br>Each Justice Guild Member has aspects from comic JSA superheroes.<br><br>Tom Turbine resembles the Atom and Golden Age Superman. Black Siren much like Black Canary, and acts much like other golden age heroines. Catman is a cross between Wildcat and Silver Age Batman. The Streak is the Golden Age Flash, Jay Garrick. Green Guardsman is The Sentinel, Alan Scott, The Golden Age Green Lantern.<br><br>Tom Turbine is voiced by Ted McGinley<br>The Streak is voiced by David Naughton<br>Catman is voiced by Stephen Root<br>Black Siren is voiced by Jennifer Hale<br>Green Guardsman is voiced by William Katt<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Martian Manhunter</strong> ~ Otherworldly Visitor </span><br></span><br><br><img src="http://www.jlanimated.com/comm/03.jpg"><br><br><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Carl Lumbly<br><br><strong>Powers</strong>: Flight. Super-Strength. Telepathy. Invisbility. Can change shape and density.<br><br><strong>Origin</strong>: J'onn J'onzz, the Martian Manhunter is the last of his martian race. In the comics, The Martian Manhunter is the only hero who has been in every incarnation of the Justice League. In the animated series, his strength is diminished to distinguish him from Superman and Wonder Woman. Instead his shape shifting powers and telepathic ability will be emphasized. HeÂ’ll also be able to phase and alter his density. JÂ’onn has always been the silent center of the league. He doesnÂ’t talk much, and is always brooding, but he is by far the most experienced of the league.<br><br><strong>Comments</strong>: In the comics, JÂ’onn is the telepathic communication center of the League, serving as a focal point so that all the leaguers can communicate with each other instantly. In the animated series, he hasnÂ’t been as powerful, but heÂ’s often used his telepathic powers to communicate with one or two members of the league. JÂ’onn doesnÂ’t shapeshift much in show, often choosing to use his phasing ability to surprise his foes. The Martian Manhunter is the least Â“kidÂ” friendly of all the heroes. ItÂ’s fortunate that he wasnÂ’t left out of the animated series, as itÂ’s not the Justice League, if thereÂ’s no Martian Manhunter.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Orion </strong>~The Dog of War </span></span><br><br><img src="http://www.jlanimated.com/episodes/twilightpart1/twilight0688.jpg"><br><br><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Ron Perlman<br><br><strong>Powers</strong>: Super-strength. Astro glider enables him to fly.<br><br><strong>Origin</strong>: When New Genesis and Apokolips formed a peace treaty after years of war, Highfather and Darkseid exchanged sons to seal the deal. Orion, Darkseid's son, was given to Highfather, and Mister Miracle was given to Darkseid. Eventually Mister Miracle found his way home to New Genesis, leaving Darkseid with nothing. Even though Orion is one of the "good guys" it is obvious that he is Darkseid's son. His temper and tendency for violence are trademarks of his father. It remains to be seen if Orion will someday take his father's place as ruler of Apokolips.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Solovar</strong></span></span><br><br><img src="http://www.jlanimated.com/episodes/braveandtheboldpart1/snap0010.jpg"><br><br><strong>Voiced by</strong>: David Ogden Stiers<br><br><strong>Powers</strong>: Super intelligent gorilla. Gorilla strength.<br><br><strong>Origin</strong>: Solovar is the chief of security of Gorilla City, hidden in Africa. He believes that the Gorillas there have no business dealing with humans, and keeps the city hidden behind an invisible barrier. He only ventures from the city to stop his rival Grodd from destorying Gorilla City.<br><br><strong>Comments</strong>: In the comics Solovar is actually the leader of Gorilla City, and has mental powers equal to that of Grodd. In fact, Grodd steals the secret of mind control from Solovar, instead of inventing it on the animated series.<br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Superman</strong> ~ Man of Steel </span></span><br><br><img src="http://www.jlanimated.com/comm/07.jpg"><br><br><strong>Voiced by</strong>: George Newbern<br><br><strong>Powers</strong>: Superhuman strength, speed and senses. X-Ray and Heat Vision. Ability to Fly. Invulnerable.<br><br><strong>Origin</strong>: KryptonÂ’s Last Son, Kal-El aka Superman, is the figurehead and leader of the Justice League. SupermanÂ’s parents Jor-El and Lara, sent their son to Earth in an effort to save his life as their home planet, Krypton, was destroyed. After landing in Smallville, Kal-El was discovered by Martha and Jonathan Kent, who raised him and kept his origin a secret. Clark Kent grew up with a normal childhood, but it was soon evident that he wasnÂ’t like the other kids. ClarkÂ’s alien DNA gave him the ability to harness the power of the EarthÂ’s Yellow sun. Eventually, Clark stored enough energy to perform superhuman feats. When Clark moved to Metropolis to work at the Daily Planet, a nationwide newspaper, he also adopted the guise of Superman to better serve and inspire the American Public.<br><br><strong>Comments</strong>: Superman is the pinnacle of superhuman achievement. Not only does he inspire normal people, but other heroes look up to him as well. The rest of the Justice League looks to him for leadership and guidance. The public trusts Superman and as long as remains the figurehead of the League, the public will place their confidence in them.<br><br>Superman has an interesting relationship with the other heroes. Whereas the Â“warriorsÂ” of the group, Wonder Woman and Hawkwoman respect him for his awesome strength, others such as The Flash simply stand in awe of the living legend. Of course, the most interesting dynamic lies in BatmanÂ’s relationship with Superman. They both respect the otherÂ’s accomplishments and skills, but their different approaches often cause their personalities to clash.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>The Flash</strong> ~ Fastest Man Alive </span></span><br><br><img src="http://www.jlanimated.com/heroes/flash.jpg"><br><br><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Michael Rosenbaum<br><br><strong>Powers</strong>: Can run at light speed, by tapping the speed force. Flash can also run through solids, causing them to explode. Flash can also lend his super-speed to other objects.<br><br><strong>Origin</strong>: Wally West possesses a unique ability to tap an energy known as the Speed Force that gives him his superhuman speed. Before he was the Flash, he was Kid Flash and assumed the mantle of the Flash when his mentor Barry Allen died during the Crisis of Infinite Earths. (Comic continuity)<br><br><strong>Comments</strong>: Wally West is the youngest and most childish member of the League. Often the jokester of the League he enjoys stardom and the popularity he gets from being the Flash. Whereas the other members of the League are out to save the world, The Flash is also looking to impress the ladies. Nonetheless his super speed is an invaluable asset to the League, and nobody can respond faster to emergencies than the Flash.<br><br>In the current comic version of the league, The Flash and The Green Lantern make up the Â“rookieÂ” section of the league. However, since John Stewart isnÂ’t the prankster that Kyle is, Flash often finds himself making jokes where they are not appreciated. Nonetheless, Flash serves as much needed comic-relief when everybody else is busy worrying about saving the world.<br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Green Lantern</strong> ~ In Brightest Day..</span></span><br><br><img src="http://www.jlanimated.com/comm/05.jpg"><br><br><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Phil LaMarr<br><br><strong>Powers</strong>: Possess the most powerful weapon in the universe, a Green Lantern Power Ring. The ring can create light structures of anything Lantern imagines. The ring must be recharged every 24 hours, and has a weakness against the color yellow. (It is unkown whether the "animated" Green Lantern's ring possess these weaknesses)<br><br><strong>Origin</strong>: The Green Lanterns are an intergalactic police force for the entire universe. The Green Lanterns are governed by The Guardians, a small diminutive race of blue aliens. Each Green Lantern is given a Power Ring that grants him near unlimited power, and assigned a sector to protect. John Stewart is the Green Lantern of Sector 2814, Earth.<br><br>In the comics, John was chosen by the Guardians of the Universe as a backup for Hal Jordan. This was during the Neal Adams and Denny O'Neil days of social awareness. Basically they created John to represent the disenfranchised, angry and misunderstood black youth. He was brash and headstrong and had an obvious disliking for authority. Hal, of course, didn't trust him, but John quickly proved himself as a noble hero. Over the years the character has evolved from into a much more seasoned and levelheaded veteran.<br><br><strong>Comments</strong>: When the Justice League cartoon was first announced, John Stewart was the most controversial of the members. Most people had expected either Hal Jordan or Kyle Rayner to be Green Lantern, especially since Kyle had appeared during the Superman Animated Series. John was chosen to add ethnic diversity to the lineup, as well as add a stoic soldier to the team dynamic. The writers have said that theyÂ’ll pit Green LanternÂ’s serious personality against the FlashÂ’s prankster nature. As an interesting side note, JohnÂ’s eyes are Green from the radiation that comes off of the ring. This has never happened in the comics before, but itÂ’s darn cool nonetheless.<br><br>IÂ’m not too sure if John would have been a better Green Lantern than Kyle. Kyle's attitude and artist background let him create interesting light structures such as big huge robots and gigantic dinosaurs. John doesn't do much aside from shoot beams from his ring. Even Hal was creative enough to make big boxing gloves. John is great character, he simply isn't as fun as Kyle or Hal would have been.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Guardians</strong> ~ Green Lantern's Light!</span></span><br><br><img src="http://www.jlanimated.com/episodes/inblackestnightpart1/c0000000007.jpg"><br><br><strong>Powers</strong>: Ultimate power stemming from the Green Lantern Battery on Oa.<br><br><strong>Origin</strong>: The diminutive Guardians are the keepers of the Green Lantern Battery. Originally, the Guardians created a number of robots, The Manhunters, who were to be the guardians of the galaxy. When the Manhunters proved incapable of determining between right and wrong, the replaced them with the Green Lanterns who were chosen based on the moral character. Each Green Lantern receives a power ring that is capable of generating light structures. Every ring must be recharged every twenty-four hours by reciting the Green Lantern Oath. All rings receive their power from the Green Lantern Battery on the GuardianÂ’s home planet, Oa.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Wonder Woman</strong> ~ Amazon Princess</span></span><br><br><img src="http://www.jlanimated.com/comm/06.jpg"><br><br><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Susan Eisenberg<br><br><strong>Powers</strong>: Superhuman strength and speed. Flight. Her magic lasso is unbreakable and forces its captive to speak the truth. Her braclets deflect bullets.<br><br><strong>Origin</strong>: Wonder Woman, an Amazon princess, was born out of clay and given the powers of the gods. Raised on the island of Themyscira with her other Amazon sisters, Wonder Woman is often shocked at the way things are in the outside world. She decides to leave the island when alien invaders threatened to conquer the Earth. Since then she has remained in ManÂ’s world as an active member of the League.<br><br><strong>Comments</strong>: There have been many incarnations of Wonder Woman overtime ranging from a hardened Amazon warrior, to being typecast as the Justice LeagueÂ’s secretary. Whereas the current comicsÂ’ version of Wonder Woman is second in command to Superman, the animated version of Wonder Woman is fresh of the island of Themyscira, and the rookie of the league. What she lacks in experience she makes up for in raw strength.<br><br>IÂ’m hoping that Wonder Woman will maintain the bold and strong Â“Xena-LikeÂ” attitude she has in the comics. It would be fun to get some Superman/Wonder Woman tension into the group, but who has time for romance when youÂ’re saving the world?</div>
