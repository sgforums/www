            <div class='col-md body'>On the last day before Christmas, I hurried to go to the supermarket to buy the gifts I didn't manage to buy earlier. When I saw all the people there, I started to complain to myself: 'It is going to take forever here and I still have so many other places to go...'<br>Christmas really is getting more and more annoying every year.<br>How I wish I could just lie down, go to sleep and only wake up after<br>it. Nonetheless, I made my way to the toy section, and there I<br>started to curse the prices, wondering if kids really play with such<br>expensive toys.<br><br>While looking in the toy section, I noticed a small boy of about 5 years old, pressing a doll against his chest. He kept on touching the hair of the doll and looked so sad. I wondered who this doll was for.<br>Then the little boy turned to the old woman next to him: 'Granny,<br>are you sure I don't have enough money?'<br>The old lady replied: 'You know that you don't have enough money<br>to buy this doll, my dear.' Then she asked him to stay here for 5<br>minutes while she went to look around. She left quickly. The little boy was still holding the doll in his hand. Finally, I started to walk towards him and asked who he wanted to give this doll to.<br>'It is the doll that my sister loved most and wanted so much for this<br>Christmas. She was so sure that Santa Claus would bring it to her.'<br>I replied to him that maybe Santa Claus will bring it to her, after<br>all, and not to worry. But he replied to me sadly. 'No, Santa<br>Claus can not bring it to her where she is now. I have to give the doll to my mother so that she can give it to her when she goes there.' His eyes were so sad while saying this.<br>'My sister has gone to be with God. Daddy say that Mummy will<br>also go to see God very soon, so I thought that she could bring the<br>doll with her to give it to my sister'.<br><br>My heart nearly stopped.<br><br>The little boy looked up at me and said: 'I told daddy to tell mummy<br>not to go yet. I asked him to wait until I come back from the<br>supermarket' Then he showed me a very nice photo of him where he was laughing. He then told me: 'I also want mummy to take this photo with her so that she will not forget me.'<br>I love my mummy and I wish she doesn't have to leave me but<br>daddy says that she has to go to be with my little sister'<br>then he looked again at the doll with sad eyes, very quietly.<br><br>I quickly reached for my wallet and took a few notes and said to the<br>boy. 'What if we checked again, just in case if u have enough money?'<br><br>'Ok' he said. 'I hope that I have enough.'<br>I added some of my money to his without him seeing and we<br>started to count it. There was enough for the doll, and even some<br>spare money. The little boy said: 'Thank you God for giving me enough money' then he looked at me and added: 'I asked yesterday before I slept for God to make sure I have enough money to buy this doll so that mummy can give it to my sister. He heard me' 'I also wanted to have enough money to buy a white rose for my mummy, but I didn't dare to ask God too much. But He gave me enough to buy the doll and the white rose.'<br>'You know, my mummy loves white rose'<br><br>A few minutes later, the old lady came again and I left with my<br>trolley. I finished my shopping in a totally different state from when I<br>started. I couldn't get the little boy out of my mind. Then I remembered a local newspaper article 2 days ago, which mentioned of a drunk man in a truck who hit a car where there was one young lady and a little girl.<br>The little girl died right away, and the mother was left in a<br>critical state.The family had to decide whether to pull the plug on<br>the life-assisting machine, because the young lady would not be<br>able to get out of the coma. Was this the family of the little boy?<br><br>Two days after this encounter with the little boy, I read in the<br>newspaper that the young lady had passed away.<br>I couldn't stop myself and went to buy a bunch of white roses and I<br>went to the mortuary where the body of the young woman was<br>exposed for people to see and make last wish before burial.<br>She was there, in her coffin, holding a beautiful white rose in her<br>hand with the photo of the little boy and the doll placed over her<br>chest. I left the place crying, feeling that my life had been<br>changed forever.<br><br>The love that this little boy had for his mother and his sister is still, to that day, hard to imagine. And in a fraction of a second, a drunk man had taken all this away from him.</div>
