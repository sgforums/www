In the 80s and 90s, the gothic movement really took hold and books, movies and TV shows about vampires abounded. One of the more famous movies was Interview with a Vampire starring Tom Cruise.<br><br>Here are some quotes from Interview to get you started:<br><br>Armand: They had forgotten the first lesson: that we must be powerful, beautiful, and without regret.<br><br>Lestat: Evildoers are easier, and they taste better.</div>

You jump over boulders, splash through lakes. and sure, if someone gets in your way, you tend to push them away rather harshly.

Their power is in their mind, their cunning and intelligence. They don't mind doing a bit of gathering and a bit of mixing in order to create their potions and spells. They can plan out their revenge, track down a target from afar and set it loose without warning. They do like to let their target know what is going on, so the target can suffer even more, knowing who caused it. A nice parchment or sign left behind will do the trick!<br><br>Be sure to keep a crystal ball around to glance into the future, and some incense and sweet drinks with which to seduce the unwary. But watch out for those resistant to your spells - if they get close, they can be your undoing.<br><br>(cool! ive oways wanted to be one!) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Witches, Warlocks, sorcerers and sorceresses have been known throughout time.
