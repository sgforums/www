            <div class='col-md body'>Another cool cartoon.....<br><img src="http://www.ninjaturtles.com/comics/logodreamwave.gif"><br><img src="http://www.ninjaturtles.com/logos/logoanim.gif"><br><img src="http://www.ninjaturtles.com/logos/logo97.gif"><br>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles<br><br>Picture it. Japan. 1965. Oroku Saki, a devilish and jealous young chap, double-crosses Hamato Yoshi, his fellow member of the Foot Clan, by stabbing his shirt to the wall, which keeps him from bowing to their master. When Hamato pulls the knife from his shirt, everyone suspects a murder plot, and he's banished from the clan forever. Hamato soon takes over and leads them to a way of crime, forever changing the scope of ninja acceptance forever, and the eventual size of Hamato's tail to boot.<br>In disgrace, Hamato moved to the sewers of New York City. Hamato moves into the sewers, because he's too poor to move anywhere else and too new to have heard about the myriad Spanish trailer parks outside the city that even someone on a ninja's salary could afford, and his only friends are the rats. Until, that is, some poor kid trips and his bowl full of little turtles falls on his head.<br><img src="http://www.x-entertainment.com/pics3/tm15.jpg"><br>Weird pink ooze spills into the sewer, and Hamato is most unpleased. He doesn't know it's mutagen yet, but honestly, it's ooze and it's in a sewer, so no matter what it is, it's not something he wants to clean off the turtles.<br>But indeed, it is mutagen, the rare experimental gloppy stuff that turns whatever touches it into the animal it's been in contact with most recently.<br><img src="http://www.x-entertainment.com/pics3/tmani1.gif"><img src="http://www.x-entertainment.com/pics3/tmani2.gif"><br>The little turtles morph into big turtles, and Hamato inexplicably morphs into Splinter, despite very clearly having touched turtles ten seconds prior. Guess the mutagen has a selective memory. Over time, he taught the turtles the ancient art of ninjitsu, which according to the show involves a lot of weapon-twirling and party hollars. And that's how they became the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!<br></div>

He is Splinter's star pupil and a true student of Ninjitsu.<br>He spends his spare time training diligently and reading up on strategy.  His high expectations are often confused with a need for utter perfection.  Leonardo's hard work and dedication keep him prepared for anything.<br><br><img src="http://images.countingdown.com/images/countdowns/movies/28904/1011/274149_thumb.jpg"><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Donatello </strong></span><br>Weapon: Bo (Staff)<br>Donatello is the brains of the Ninja Turtles. He is studious and industrious and can repair just about anything.  He often spends his spare time inventing gadgets.<br>Of the four turtles, he is the most reserved, with a tendency to be a little too preoccupied with his own thoughts.<br>Donatello would rather talk things out than fight, making him an unlikely combination of a Ninja warrior/pacifist. But more often than not, talking things out is not an option.<br><br><img src="http://images.countingdown.com/images/countdowns/movies/28904/1011/268953_thumb.jpg"><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Michaelangelo </strong></span><br>Weapon: Nunchakus<br>Michaelangelo is the fun-loving member of the turtles.  His philosophy of life is pretty much summed up with the quest for happiness and contentment. He is certainly the most relaxed of the Ninja Turtles.<br>But his value should not be overlooked, nor should his fighting skills be underestimated.  His light-hearted nature provides a crucial balance to the well-being of his brothers, and in the heat of battle, Michaelangelo will fight to the finish.<br><br><img src="http://images.countingdown.com/images/countdowns/movies/28904/1011/281150_thumb.jpg"><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Raphael </strong></span><br>Weapon: Sais<br>Raphael is the "dark" one. The Cynic. The Pessimist. The Crazy. The Angry Young Man.<br>He's the unpredictable one with a short fuse, and when someone irks him, they'd better watch out because Raphael will bring down a world of hurt on them.<br>Most of the time, Raphael would rather be left alone, and when he's in one of those moods, it would be wise to do just that.<br><br></div>
