Lilo is a lonely Hawaiian girl who adopts a small ugly 'dog', whom she names Stitch. Stitch would be the perfect pet if he wasn't a genetic experiment that escaped from an alien planet and crash-landed on earth. Through her faith and unwavering belief in "ohana" (the Hawaiian concept of family), Lilo helps unlock Stitch's heart and gives him the one thing he wasn't designed to have--the ability to love.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.chud.com/graphics5/stitchpost.jpg">You know, deep down inside, weÂ’re all Disney fans.<br><br>It began a long time ago with a man, a mouse, and a dream. And in those early years, Disney not only introduced the world to the possibilities of feature-length animated films, but for better or worse, they defined the genre. Along the way, Walt and his team of Burbank animators crafted many of the classics of the medium. Films like SNOW WHITE, FANTASIA, BAMBI, DUMBO, PINNOCHIO, and SONG OF THE SOUTHÂ… just to name a few. Films that many of us were raised with, and films that many of us are raising our own children on as well.<br><br>But that was a long time ago. And Disney isn't what it used to be.<br><br>As giants are want to do, DisneyÂ’s success led it down the path of sloth &amp; gluttony. As a company, it grew far larger that it ever should. It embraced the principles of vertical integration with reckless abandon, gorging itself on entertainment outlets, television networks, a far-flung array of theme parks and even a number sports franchises. It became enamored with its own invulnerability, and it failed to embrace the waves of technological change that were sweeping the industry. The only game in town, Disney produced one forgettable film after another.<br><br>But nothing lasts forever. When change finally came, Disney was ill-prepared. It was trapped by the layers upon layers of dogmatic ideas &amp; rampant political correctness that had piled up over the years. They tried recycling the same formulaic ideas theyÂ’d used before, in an attempt to recreate their past successes. Films like POCAHONTAS, TARZAN, HERCULES, MULAN, and THE EMPERORÂ’S NEW GROOVE flowed from the studio in a vain attempt to pull it all back together.<br><br>But the magic was gone.<br><br><img src="http://www.chud.com/graphics5/stitch1a.jpg">Until now.<br><br>LILO &amp; STITCH is the best Disney film since ALADDIN. Bar None. ItÂ’s succeeds not because of the Â“classic Disney formulaÂ”, but in spite of it. The characters donÂ’t sing, the animation style is decidedly retro, the families are non-traditional, and itÂ’s mildly violent. But itÂ’s got two things that have been sorely lacking at Disney of late. HeartÂ… and balls.<br><br>ThatÂ’s what itÂ’s always been about, really. On the surface, this film is nothing like any Disney film thatÂ’s come before it. Yet, underneath it all is that same feelingÂ… that same SOUL that the classics contained so many years before. LILO &amp; STITCH will either be remembered as the last great Disney hand-drawn animated feature, or the one where they figured out what they were missing, and put it all back together. Either way, youÂ’ll need to see this film.<br><br>ItÂ’s the story of experiment Six Two Six, a genetically engineered alien designed to wreak havoc on an epic scale. When his creator is brought up on charges for bringing him into existence, Six Two Six is banished to a remote planet on the edge of the galaxy, where he might live out his days in isolation.<br><br>But of course he escapes.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.chud.com/graphics5/stitch4a.jpg">Stealing a spaceship (the red one), he sets the hyperdrive to a random location and shoots off into the ether. He ends up crash landing on EarthÂ… specifically, Hawaii. After a freakish hit &amp; run accident, he awakens in an animal shelter. HeÂ’s been mistaken for a dog. On the lam from the galactic authorities, he needs a place to hole up. He gets himself adopted by a nontraditional Hawaiian family, Lilo &amp; her older sister Nani, who finds herself raising the girl after the untimely death of her parents. Six Two Six, or Stitch, as Lilo calls him, is a genetically engineered monster, and he's a long way from home. HeÂ’s the ultimate orphan, really, and he becomes enamored with the idea of having a family of his own. TheyÂ’ll have to face down the department of child welfare, an intergalactic police force, and a host of bounty hunters if they want to keep their fledgling family together.<br><br>ItÂ’s an interesting story, and despite the science-fiction elements, itÂ’s perhaps the most realistic Disney flick. Ward &amp; June Cleaver donÂ’t really exist anymore, and Disney admirably embraces the concept of a non-traditional family. Remember the effect of ROSANNE on sitcoms? How stupid it made THE COSBY SHOW look? This is the same thing. Along the same lines, Stitch &amp; Lilo are more realistic characters that we are accustomed to seeing in Disney flicks. TheyÂ’re flawed, yet beautiful in their own way. Stitch is a monster. He takes delight in creating a perfect San Fransisco skyline, only to trounce through it like Godzilla. Lilo just never fits in. ThereÂ’s a scene with her and her dollÂ… they have a love-hate-relationship.. itÂ’s just perfect. Nani isn't a perfect mom. She tries, butÂ… sheÂ’s just not. The casting of Ving Rhames as the voice of Cobra Bubbles, the child welfare officer. Yeah, I know. But it works. These are real characters, with flaws. You can empathize with them. I never felt like I was Simba, or John Smith, or that Damnedable Donkey. But I can relate to these guys.<br><br>The film has a touch of violence as well. Stitch uses guns. And chainsaws. And cars. At times, this feels more like a Roadrunner cartoon than a Walt Disney film. But itÂ’s most often implied. And itÂ’s nothing IÂ’d be afraid to let my kids see, had I any kids. Again, itÂ’s just a reflection of the world we live in.<br><br><img src="http://www.chud.com/graphics5/stitch3a.jpg">As I mentioned before, there really isn't any music in the film. No breaks for introspective songs by Peabo Bryson. No smash single for the radio mix. ItÂ’s all Elvis, and itÂ’s all background. Parts of me want to think that DisneyÂ’s moved past that Â– ATLANTIS didnÂ’t feature any music either - But the better angels of my nature tell me that hit songs are risky, and hard to predict. Why bother writing a hit single when you can just buy one that you KNOW will work? In the end, you donÂ’t care. The Elvis music works. It works well, itÂ’s integral to the story, and IÂ’m very glad somebody had the stones to cut the check.<br><br>The art of the film is amazing. For the first time since DUMBO, some 60 years ago, Disney put down the acyclic, and returned to a watercolor process. The results are astounding. Instead of trying to compete on a technical basis with the wizards at Pixar, Disney went back to what it knew best: Classic, hand-drawn animation: and nobody does it better. Admittedly, IÂ’d been spoiled by the 3D approach that modern technology allows. I didnÂ’t like the look of the first 15 minutes of the film. The backgrounds are static, and the picture lookedÂ… wellÂ… flat. But gradually, I warmed to the look. By the end of the picture, I was simply in awe of what the Florida studio had produced. Art, you see, is never a literal representation. ItÂ’s an interpretation of reality, not reality itself. The Disney artists had created a world which was both more and less real, in all the right ways, and at the same time. While Pixar may overwhelm us by their ability to make CG animation look real, DisneyÂ’s ability to make art simply destroyed me.<br><br>Anybody can take a picture.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.chud.com/graphics5/stitch2a.jpg">Disney did something else a little different in this film. Their female characters had realistic proportions. There werenÂ’t any Barbie dolls here. People were fat. Women had hips. Men had guts. Chests were understated. And the people looked real. Everything had a soft, rounded look to it. This is the kind of PC I can live with. Nice work, Disney.<br><br>What problems I have with the film exist in the last act. As many of you know, the original ending for the film had to be dramatically reworked after the 9/11 attacks. Simply put, it shows. It just doesnÂ’t have the grace that the rest of the film has. Perhaps a DVD release will contain the other ending, and we can see how things were supposed to turn out. Overall, itÂ’s a small flaw on a great film.<br><br>ItÂ’s ironic. DisneyÂ’s been harping on family entertainment for years. And when they finally get it right, they advertise the film with a soundtrack by AC/DC. ItÂ’s called reinventing yourself. You have to do it every so often, or you cease to be relevant. You have to strip away all the crap that doesnÂ’t matter, and get back to the core of who and what you are. With LILO &amp; STITCH, DisneyÂ’s done just that. Not only have they gotten back to the soul of the Classic Disney pictures that came before, theyÂ’re swinging a sledgehammer at everything theyÂ’ve become.. those dogmatic beliefs that had kept them from being who and what they are.<br><br>Good for them.<br><br>Â‘Cause deep down inside, weÂ’re all Disney fans.<br><br>Ratings: 9.1 out of 10</div>

He's too heavy to swim, and he was created to destroy large cities, so where does he find himself but on an island with no cities at all. He ends up in an animal shelter. There he tricks a little girl, Lilo, into adopting him as a puppy, and uses her to protect him from the aliens who want to imprison or destroy him. From Lilo, however, and Lilo's sister Nani, he learns to care and comes to understand the meaning of ohana, family.<br><br>Voice: Chris Sanders<br></div>

Lilo is an Elvis fan, swims like a dolphin, feeds peanut butter sandwiches to the local fish, beats up her friends when they tease her, locks her sister out of the house, and has a wall full of pictures of obese people, whom she considers "beautiful". Her most unusual act, however, is to adopt a destructive little alien named Stitch as her "puppy" and to teach him the meaning of ohana ~ "Family. Family means nobody gets left behind. And nobody gets forgotten."<br><br>Voice: Daveigh Chase<br></div>

In Lilo and Stitch,, Mr. Bubbles is the social worker who thinks Lilo's sister Nani can't raise Lilo properly. He has a menacing manner that makes his suggestions to Nani sound like "do it or die" ~ literally. He also has an interesting past, but that would be a spoiler.<br><br>Voice: Ving Rhames<br></div>
