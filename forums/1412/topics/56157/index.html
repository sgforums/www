There was a Tops trading card in the 1970's that spelled his name as 'Zeddemore', with the extra 'e' in the middle.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">background:</span><br><br>Winston is strongly Christian and thinks 'Jesus is neat'. He has a girlfriend. When he was younger, he worked on his father's construction crew. A rift grew between himself and his father when he joined the Ghostbusters, it was worked out later when they were captured by the Keeper of Lost Objects and his father saw that ghosts were real. Winston may be going to night school to earn his college degree. Even thought he started out as an employee of the Ghostbusters he may be a full partner before 1-2 years have gone by.<br>There is lots of magic in his background. He had a magician ancestor who defeated the Undying One, a powerful demon, hundreds of years ago in Africa. His grandmother used to tell him stories of Santeria (SP), magic, and Africa. His family were the keepers of the key to the Keeper of Lost Objects kingdom Â— the two parts of the key were given to the Keeper by Winston and his father to save the guys and set the Keeper free.<br>He had at least one tour of Viet Nam in the army as a helicopter pilot. He worked in a garage as a mechanic. He also worked at his father's construction company, and walked the girders on tall buildings.<br>He likes the Panthers, a baseball team that never wins.<br>He is very level headed and down to earth. He keeps the other guys from going off the deep end with their experiments.<br><br></div>

He went to live with his Aunt Lois, a very wealthy widow.<br>Aunt Lois loves Ray dearly but is ditzy and doesnÂ’t understand him. Aunt Lois also lives in the family ancestral home in New York. It's a rather large town house filled with family heirlooms from Russia.<br>Ray also has an Uncle Andrew who is a Laird in Scotland. After his Uncle's death, Ray inherited both the castle and title, along with the ghosts. After getting rid of the ghosts, with the help of the other Ghostbusters, Ray gave the castle to the townspeople.<br>Ray was rather shy as a child and spent a lot of time reading instead of playing with other children. He cultivated a love of comic books, horror movies, and paranormal digest magazines that has stayed with him into adulthood. Ray's a bit of a nerd as a child, and seemed to have more adult friends rather than children his own age.<br>After the death of his parents he was sent to live with his Aunt &amp; Uncle on their farm in Morrisville, in upstate New York. He's still shy and an outsider. His best friends seem to have been the animals he'd constantly drag home, or was helping; both feral and tame animals. The people in Morrisville considered him quiet but odd because of all his strange pets.<br>Ray grew up to be socially and physically inept, and no one in Morrisville ever thought he'd amount to anything. He graduated from high school and went to Columbia University where he met Egon and Peter.<br>Peter and Egon turn out to be the best thing in the world for Ray. They are his best friends and brothers in all but blood, in spite of, or maybe because of their different backgrounds and personalities.<br>Some of Ray's hobbies are: the study of magic, prestidigitation, and building anything he can think of.<br><br></div>

He may have a near photographic memory, but this is never said outright.<br>school: Columbia University<br>degrees: psychology, engineering, parapsychology<br>parents: Mother: unknown<br>Father: where ever a con takes him<br>ancestors: possibly Polish<br>siblings: unknown, although he is believed to be an only child<br>hometown: Brooklyn, New York<br>religion: unknown but Christian orientation<br><br><span style="color: blue;">background:</span><br><br>Peter was raised tough in a tough neighborhood in Brooklyn. He went to Woodstock at age 12, where he took drugs. His parents divorced when he was about 12-14. His father is a con artist. Not much is known about his mother except she had to work hard and was alone a lot. His father neglected him; missed a lot of Christmases.<br>Peter is basically a skeptic and unbeliever in the supernatural. He sounds like a used car salesman or game show host. He got into the paranormal as a scam rather than a belief system. HeÂ’s a good psychologist but a better con artist.<br>His father is a con artist and Peter both loves and hates him. He knows he can never fully trust his dad because he tells so many lies -- his dad might actually believe some of them himself.<br>Peter has great regret where his mother is concerned. He knows she worked too hard trying to raise her wild son and was alone too much of the time. He loves his mother very much. He speaks of his mother as both living and reading movie magazines, and as if she were dead. She may have died some time during the show but it wasnÂ’t shown on the series.<br>Peter may have been involved with gang activity when he was a teenager.<br>He has relatives in Iowa, on a farm. This is possibly where his father is originally from. After the incident with the Hob, he tells the guys that he's sending his father home to the farm, and it doesn't seem logical that those would be his mother's people.<br>He belonged to a fraternity in college: Tri Cuppa Brew. He once ran his underwear up the flagpole while he was still wearing them, which is still remembered and talked about in the fraternity. He played football and possibly other sports and was a big man on campus. He might've had a football scholarship, but it is unknown how he paid for his college tuition and fees. It's believed that he did have some sort of job or jobs in college to help pay for his education.<br><br></div>

The whole family is considered above average in intelligence and is fairly wealthy.<br>Egon looks exactly like his mother and his Uncle Cyrus. It is possible that his Mother is a Spengler cousin since he so strongly resembles both her and his Uncle, and it's unknown what his father looked like. His father is only mentioned once in entire series.<br><br>There is a possibility that his father:<br><br>A) died when he was very young and Egon doesnÂ’t like to talk about it.<br>B) does not like or believe in the Ghostbusters and has disowned his son.<br>C) his father was in some way cruel to Egon and so he never speaks of him.<br><br>At one point, Uncle Cyrus comes to Ghostbuster Headquarters to take Egon back to Ohio with him to work in Spengler Labs. A long time ago, Egon had promised his uncle that he would help him out if he was needed. Since Uncle Cyrus doesn't believe in ghosts, and never sees one since his glasses are broken early in his stay, he believes he's doing the right thing in taking Egon away from his work with the Ghostbusters. Egon is unhappy working for his Uncle, but he has made a promise and he's honor bound to keep it. The guys visit with a tale that they need Egon for one last bust, and talk Uncle Cyrus into going back to New York City with them. Uncle Cyrus finally sees a ghost, comes to know that Egon loves his life with the Ghostbusters, and releases him from his promise.<br>Egon has real magicians and sorcerers in his background.<br>Egon was raised to be a genius. His parents would not speak to him for an entire week one time when he brought home an 'A-' on a report card. As a child, he had the largest ant farm in the state of Ohio. He likes the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team. He collects spores, molds, and fungiÂ—possibly to keep the women away. He also likes to go to scientific movies: "Life of a Spore", etcetera.<br>EgonÂ’s mother is a very much a New York mother and has a tendency to baby him. She gives him, and everyone else, the Spengler family recipe when they have colds.<br><br></div>

She's never been anyplace else, never had many options in life. She comes from a large family who all look alike and have bad manners.<br>She has a big crush on Egon, which is not reciprocated in kind. Although later in the series Egon seems to come to like her, and even dates her a couple of times and goes to her parents' home to meet them and the rest of the family.<br>As the show progresses, she becomes more uptown, meaning she must be taking classes in diction and speech as well as manners. Her dress style improves. She may be taking night classes or college courses.<br>In one episode, she comes under the spell of a Makeoverus Lotsabucks who changes her appearance. She becomes taller and thinner, her eyes change color, etcetera. She does all this because she wants to be more sophisticated, more like someone Egon would want to date. At the end of this episode, Janine and Egon are seen watching the sun rise, and, perhaps, talking about their relationship.<br><br></div>

Peter did not reciprocate the affection for a long time, at least publicly, and only wanted to get rid of him.<br><br>There is the possibility that Slimer is the ghost of some long-dead fat man who had an obsession with eating to compensate for a life of loneliness, where no one loved him. He has an almost constant compulsion to eat anything and everything, even though he is only a torso with arms and a head, and there is nothing below the waist. He does like all kinds of sweets and junk food, and frequently goes through the neighborhood garbage cans. Once, when Egon and Slimer's essences changed places, Egon commented that everything tasted like chicken.<br><br></div>

The idea was good and they actualy had good characters. It was very interesting to watch Garrett in the Episodes and how the animators moved him around with the wheel chair and all. They did a great job. I am actually sad that the show was cancelled. The show takes place 15 years after the original movie and the GB have gone their seperate ways. The only GB left in New York is Egon. He lives in the firehouse with Slimer and the containment unit. After new ghosts start to appear, Egon recreuts a new team of Ghostbusters. They are Garrett, Edguardo, Kilie and Rolland.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ghostbuster Training Manual<br>Â© 1984 Columbia Pictures Industried, Inc. Written by Christopher Brown<br>Last Updated: July 21, 1997<br><br><span style="color: blue;">A Guide To Catching Ghosts</span><br>Are you bored with your life? Are you tired of the same old routine? Then consider this: You too can have an exciting career as a GHOSTBUSTER! This manual is designed to start you on your way. Everything you need to know about the science of Ghostbusting is right here on the net!<br><br>To earn your Ghostbusting degree, (coming soon) study each lesson carefully, print out the certificate. Sign your name on the Official Certificate of Achievement, and ...you're a Ghostbuster! Now, lets get started!<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="color: indigo;">Lesson 1: Ghostbuster Headquarters </span><br>Of course, every beginning Ghostbuster needs a headquarters. Preferably it should be a run-down fire station, but some other building such as an abandoned railroad depot, an old army barracks, or a bankrupt chicken ranch, can be substituted. The important lesson to be learned is that the professional Ghostbuster headquarters must have a certain laid-back atmosphere in order to reassure clients frightened out of their wits. Also, and most importantly, these dumps are cheap to buy!<br><br><span style="color: green;">Lesson 2: Ghostbuster Transportation </span><br><br>Fast, dependable  transportation is important to a Ghostbuster. A converted hearse is, of course, the best - note photo of Ectomobile. Not only is a hearse roomy enough to carry all your scientific Ghostbusting equipment, but it is also weird and attracts attention. In other words, it's good business. If you are unable to locate a suitable hearse, consider an old garbage truck or even a war surplus armored personnel carrier. Remember, however, that at first business will be slow - so get something cheap!<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><br>Lesson 3: Proton Pack </span><br>The most important piece of Ghostbusting equipment is, of course, the proton pack. This device consists of a nuclear accelerator and a particle thrower. The ion stream produced by the proton pack is extremely destructive, but it is also the only known method of cornering a ghost. Acquiring a proton pack is not easy - nuclear accelerators have to be liscensed. However, with a little inventive genius, almost anyone can designe and build one. CAUTION! Never point your particle thrower at anything but a ghost!<br><br><span style="color: orange;">Lesson 4: Ghost Trap </span><br>The next most important piece of Ghostbuster gear is the ghost trap. This is a complicated electronic device used for transporting a captured ghost. It consists of a foot pedal and cord attached to a long flat metal box approximately two feet long. Although trapping a ghost is no easy task, it is a skill the beginning Ghostbuster must master. Particularly difficult to trap is the Class Five Full Roaming Vapor. Watch out or you will get SLIMED!<br><br><span style="color: olive;">Lesson 5: Ecto-Containment Unit </span><br>Another essential piece of Ghostbusting gear is the Ecto-Containment Unit. No Ghostbuster would be complete without one. What's the point of catching a ghost if you don't have any place to keep it, right? The storage facility is a concrete block vault in the basement of Ghostbuster Headquarters. A powerful electronic grid prevents evil spirits from escaping. But be careful! Too much psychokinetic entergy (PKE to Ghostbusters) and BANG! A ghost explosion like you wouldn't believe!<br><br><span style="color: brown;">Lesson 6: Ghostbuster Courage </span><br><br>A Ghostbuster must develop amazing courage in order to face up to the job. Teeth chattering, knees knocking, and hands shaking, the Ghostbuster is required to complete the assigned task no matter what. Nothing can interfere with ridding the world of ghosts. A Ghostbuster is always professional. Remember the Ghostbuster motto:<br><br>Back Off Man! I'm a Scientist!<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Lesson 7: Class Five Full Roaming Vapors </span><br><br>As previously mentioned, this type of ghost is particulartly difficult to trap. Horribly ugly, trailing smelly ectoplasmic goo, roamers inhabit places where food is plentiful. They will eat anything and everything, but are known to like leftover pizza best.* People who encounter one are usually so offended that they can't move. This allows time for the roamer to perform his favorite trick - SLIMING! Once slimed, a Ghostbuster never forgets!<br><br>* especially if the anchovies are cold and smelly.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Lesson 8: Terror Dogs </span><br><br>Luckily these evil creatures are rare. They are demons which occasionally occupy old fashioned buildings like post offices or museums. During the daylight hours, they appear to be made of stone. But every expirienced Ghostbuster knows better! These bests are real dogs! Sometimes Terror Dogs are mistaken for bears or cougars, but the red eyes are a dead give-away. Don't let them corner you.<br><br><span style="color: violet;">Lesson 9: Your Final Exam </span><br><br>What's that? Coming down the street! Oh no, it's the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man crushing everything in his path. The crowd screams with terror and begs for help. Who ya gonna call? That's right, Ghostbusters!<br><br>A full-fledged Ghostbuster must be prepared to deal with any crisis, even the evil Destructor. Spooks, roamers, ancient demons - nothing stands in a Ghostbuster's way. Remember the Ghostbuster battle cry:<br><br>I Ain't 'Fraid O' No Ghosts!<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Lesson 10: Graduation Day </span><br><br>A Ghostbuster must be ready, day or night, to answer the call of duty. "H-h-help! A Ghost!" If you crave excitement, adventure, thrills, chills... if you've got what it takes...consider yourself a Ghostbuster. From now on, when someone says, "Who ya gonna call?" They are gonna call<br><br>YOU!<br><br>Upon completetion of the course, be sure to register with Ghostbusters International and the GB PBEM RPG.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
