            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://thundercats.vpga.com/bios/lion_o_bio.jpg"><br>Lion-O:Lion-O, the Lord of the Thudercats, is not as he appears. Although his body is fully developed, his mind is that of a child. With the Sword of Omens and enchanted claw shield at his side Lion-O has powers that rival those of all the Thundercats. With Jaga's guidance, in "spirit" form, Lion-O has learned to trust in the Sword of Omens and the Code that binds all Thunderians.<br><br><img src="http://thundercats.vpga.com/bios/Panthro_bio.jpg"><br>Panthro: Panthro, the eldest living member of the Thundercats, is a mechanical wizard and engineering genius. His advanced fighting technique, with battle-sticks (which can contain any concoction or weapon he places inside), proves to make him a vital team memeber. His vast mechanical knowledge helped him construct the Thundertank from pieces of their wrecked spacecraft. After creating Cat's Lair with the Robear Berbils help, Panthro was then able to craft many new vehicles in his High-Tec workshop.<br><br><img src="http://thundercats.vpga.com/bios/Tygra_bio.jpg"><br>Tygra: Without Tygra there would be no Cat's Lair. Under his guidance the Robear Berbils constructed Cat's Lair in only three days. Tygra's flaming/exploding bolo-whip is a formidable weapon. With it Tygra can become invisible to almost any Third Earth being. Tygra's agility and cunning help him in times of battle and make him an invaluable asset to the team.<br><br><img src="http://thundercats.vpga.com/bios/cheetara_bio.jpg"><br>Cheetara: Cheetara is the fastest of the Thundercats. Her lightning quick speed, though somewhat limited in use, and hand-activated bo-staff make her nearly invincible. Cheetara also has a mysterious "sixth-sense" that provides her with premonitions about the future or an accurate portrayal of the past. Although her use of this special "sixth sense" provides accurate information, it is also very limited.<br><br><img src="http://thundercats.vpga.com/bios/willykit_bio.jpg"><br>WillyKit: WilyKit is WilyKat's annoying sister. Although she is WilyKat's twin she often disagrees with her brother. With her "bag of tricks" WilyKit can defend herself by temporarily baffling her aggressor.<br><br><img src="http://thundercats.vpga.com/bios/willykat_bio.jpg"><br>WillyKat: WilyKat is the most curious of the twins. He and his sister both are highly agile. Although her is usually left in charge he often leads his sister and himself into serious danger. Don't be fooled, his sister also makes poor decisions as well.<br><br><img src="http://thundercats.vpga.com/bios/snarf_bio.jpg"><br>Snarf: Snarf was Lion-O's "nursemaid" on Thundera, and he has a hard time dealing with the fact that Lion-O is no longer in need of his "protection". Although he's somewhat cowardly, Snarf does manage to gather his wits and help when needed.<br><br><img src="http://thundercats.vpga.com/bios/Jaga_bio.jpg"><br>Jaga: Jaga is the eldest and wisest of the Thundercats. He was once the chief advisor and protector of Lion-O's father, Claudis. After the destruction of Thundera, he gave his life piloting the Thundercats to Third Earth so they could survive in the only remaining suspension chambers. Jaga was once the keeper of the Sword of Omens and now appears to Lion-O from his mystical plane of existence.<br><br></div>

He possesses incredible magical powers, and is also the wielder of the awesome Sword of Plundarr. His only weakness is a limited stamina; he needs often to return to his Pyramid to regenerate.<br><br><img src="http://thundercats.vpga.com/bios/Pumra_bio.jpg"><br>PummRa: Mumm-Ra disguised as a Thundercat. He used this disguise in an early attempt to steal the Sword of Omens.<br><br><img src="http://thundercats.vpga.com/bios/driller_bio.jpg"><br>Driller: A mercenary Third Earthian who works for diamonds. He requires diamonds or other such hard material to maintain his drill point.<br><br><img src="http://thundercats.vpga.com/bios/Ancient_spirits.jpg"><br>Ancient Spirits:The four god-like focii of all evil, whose statues stand in the Black Pyramid. They give Mumm-Ra immortality in exchange for perpetual servitude, and possess nearly unlimited powers. However, they require other beings to serve their demands, and cannot intervene directly in worldy affairs.<br><br><img src="http://thundercats.vpga.com/bios/Ancient_evil.jpg"><br>Mirror Wraith: A phantasm capable of travel through mirrors. In failure to destroy the Thundercats, the Ancient Spirits of Evil apparently destroyed him.<br><br></div>

He can maneuver easily admist the treetops, and wields a magic shield capable of firing cannonballs or energy blasts.<br><br><img src="http://thundercats.vpga.com/bios/Jackalman_bio.jpg"><br>Jackalman: A canine mutant skilled with the axe. He can sometimes be more ambitious for his own good, but is often too cowardly to fulfill his aspirations.<br><br><img src="http://thundercats.vpga.com/bios/vultureman_bio.jpg"><br>Vultureman: Perhaps one of the most ambitious of all the Mutants, Vultureman is a dangerous and crafty inventor. It is he who is responsible for all the Mutant technology and weapons of destruction. However, his loyalty to his fellow Mutants is questionable, as he has often allied himself with Mumm-Ra or the Lunatacs instead.<br><br><img src="http://thundercats.vpga.com/bios/plundarian_warbot_bio.jpg"><br>Plundarian Warbot: A virtually indestructable war machine.
