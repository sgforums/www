            <div class='col-md body'>The Ultimate Personality Quiz: Your Results<br>Your type: Independent Individualist<br><br>As a Friend:<br>Not one to follow the crowd, youÂ’re fiercely independent and can come across as a bit of a loner. Really, you just have high expectations and you wonÂ’t compromise your beliefs to fit in. If youÂ’re not the most popular gal in school, remember that many people secretly admire your strength Â‘nÂ’ individuality, and wish they had the self-confidence not to follow the herd. Once you find a gang, youÂ’re always one of the team. You can party till the sun comes up, and your sense of adventure, spontaneity and outgoing nature never lets you say no to a good time.<br><br>At School:<br>YouÂ’re enterprising, ambitious and entertaining. But you have a restless energy and can get bored easily, leaving many projects not-quite-finished, especially if youÂ’ve had too much outside input. But with your logical, analytical mind and natural curiosity, youÂ’re a great problem solver who probably does well in maths and science-based classes. YouÂ’ll stay interested in school if you constantly face new challenges, so try to keep your courses varied and practical.<br><br>In Love:<br>A bit jaded and skeptical, youÂ’ll either love Â‘em and leave Â‘em or you simply wonÂ’t bother at all, unless a guy can prove heÂ’s really worth spending your time on. Although your tough-girl, carefree attitude attracts plenty of bad boys, you can be a little intimidating to some of the nicer lads. Try to temper your tough side with a little softness - it wonÂ’t kill you! The right guy will bring out your sweeter side...even if he is the only one who sees it.<br><br>Your Career:<br>YouÂ’re a logical and practical person with a mind open to many points of view. Ruled more by your head than your heart, you've got real strength of character and you like a challenge. You also like to challenge the system, and you can be powerful and determined when you believe in a cause. Your never-give-up attitude Â‘nÂ’ fighting spirit is perfect for a career in social work, law or politics.<br><br>Deep Down:<br>YouÂ’re easygoing and open-minded. The most important thing to you right now is the freedom to have fun and experience everything life offers. YouÂ’ve got a sharp mind and youÂ’re quick with witty or sarcastic come-backs. YouÂ’re confident, ingenious and persuasive. You love to argue and play devil's advocate. Just remember, not everyone finds arguing as much fun as you do, and some could see you as just plain argumentative. Fearless, impulsive and energetic, you also have a tendency to be unpredictable, reckless and irresponsible. You sometimes forget or ignore rules and limits - but donÂ’t forget that youÂ’re not immortal!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your type: Girl Next-Door<br><br>As a Friend:<br>Always ready with a listening ear or a heartfelt compliment, you know the meaning of true friendship and loyalty, and your mates know it. Although youÂ’re hesitant till you know people well, youÂ’re affectionate, open and warm with people you trust. You have a close circle of core friends, Â‘nÂ’ you'll do anything for 'em. Caring, thoughtful and good-hearted, people know they can count on you to be around when they need you, and you take pride in being a good friend. A genuine and sincere person, you are a giving, trustworthy and steady pal.<br><br>At School:<br>YouÂ’re well-read and curious about the world, your grades reflect your intelligence. Easily intrigued, youÂ’re constantly reading, listening, watching and finding new ways to challenge your mind. You do well at whatever you put your mind to, and teachers say youÂ’re a diligent and conscientious student. Subjects like history and geography probably have the most appeal to your analytical mind.<br><br>In Love:<br>Natural and unpretentious, youÂ’re friendly but not intentionally flirty. Videos and snacks on the couch with a nice bloke is your ideal date, and most guys are over the moon to find a gal they can hang out with and just be themselves. DonÂ’t settle for less than you deserve though, hon. Your sweet and undemanding manner can sometimes makes you vulnerable to being taken for granted, so make sure you donÂ’t put up with any mind games. Once you find the right guy, youÂ’ll be your manÂ’s best mate as much as his girlf, and your loving nature will make him want to hang on tight and treat you right.<br><br>Your Career:<br>You're an ambitious and reliable lass, who likes to gather all the facts before coming to an informed decision. Observant, focused and dedicated, you can tell the difference between fact and opinion easily. YouÂ’d make a fantastic journalist, doctor or nutritionist.<br><br>Deep Down:<br>Living a stable life and helping other people are your most important goals. You set high standards for yourself and other people, which means that you sometimes get down on yourself and are easily hurt and offended. YouÂ’re gentle, responsible and organised, but you can be cautious or even a little afraid of changes and new experiences. Sometimes this makes you feel too 'normal', and you wish there was a little more drama in your life. Try not to turn down new experiences out of habit; trying new things can help you feel stronger and more confident, and you might discover a great new friend or hobby.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
