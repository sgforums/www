They wished you well, they celebrated your birthday with you, they picked you up when you were feeling down never before has touchy-feeliness had such an ally in a toy.<br><br>The original Care Bears were twelve-inch plush animals, each a different color, and each with a different embroidered symbol on its belly symbolizing the sentiment that the particular Bear was named after. There were the Tenderheart, Cheer, Funshine, Good Luck, Birthday, Wish, Friend, Grumpy, Love-a-Lot and Bedtime Bears. And in Britain, Australia and Canada, there were Sea Friend and Forest Friend bears. All the bearsÂ’ rear ends (American and British rear ends alike) had plastic hearts imbedded within the fur a plush animal equivalent to a birthmark, if you will, just to make sure nobody fell victim to any seemingly caring imposters.<br><br>According to the fiction that surrounded them, the Care Bears lived in the land called Care-a-Lot, where they chased the blues away and matched wits against depressive bad guys like Professor Coldheart and No-Heart. And when they needed to pull out the big guns, they used their patented "Care Bear Stare", standing side by side and focusing their kindly power into a rainbow of Care-power at whatever foul emotional state stood in their way. And thereÂ’s not a bad mood out there that can stand up to a weapon like that.<br><br>Kenner soon released more Care Bear characters, and all the Bears were issued in more sizes there were six-, thirteen-, eighteen- and thirty-six-inchers. There were also Care Bear patterns that allowed the more domestically-savvy toy lovers out there to create a little Caring magic at home; there were bed linens, books, puzzles, novelty kid items and periphery merchandise galore; there were plastic Bears and special ceramic and porcelain Bears. There were also the Care Bear Cousins, which were animals besides bears. And lest you think the Bears didnÂ’t know what topical issues of the day were, there were ecologically-themed Bears in the early 1990Â’s. Then, to try and grab a piece of that late 90Â’s Beanie Baby pie oÂ’ hype, Kenner issued six Beanlings: Tenderheart, Friend, Cheer, Share, Bedtime and Good-Luck bears.<br><br>In the mid-to-late 1980Â’s, the Care Bears frolicked up on the silver screen, first in the The Care Bears Movie featuring the voice of Mickey Rooney and songs by Carole King and John Sebastian and then in two sequels after that. The Bears got two of their own animated series also: The Care Bears and The Care Bear Family. The notorious 80's Brat Pack actors didnÂ’t have that many starring turns, now did they? It just goes to show you, decency pays. </span><br><br></div>

Her visions of love, of peace, of true happiness have inspired many people to do extraordinary things. Her weakness is of course her tendency to not pay attention. This has come back to haunt her more than once, but her dreams often save the day</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: green;">FOREST FRIEND BEAR</span><br><img src="http://members.citynet.net/weluvcarebears/images/forestfriend.jpg"><br>An advocate for wildlife, it is the job of Forest Friend Bear to remind us all to be respectful of Nature. The symbol on his tummy, a scene featuring a bear, a rabbit, and a tree, helps us to remember that the forest is home not only to beautiful trees and other foilage, but also to many types of animals</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HARMONY BEAR</span><br><img src="http://members.citynet.net/weluvcarebears/images/80.jpg"><br>Harmony Bear believes that all people and animals can live in harmony with one another, keeping nature's delicate balance. Peaceful by nature, she is also quite a talented singer and songwriter. She loves all kinds of music- from rock/pop, to country, to punk, to oldies, to heavy metal. While she has a long ways to go before she achieves world peace, she will never stop trying to achieve it.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SEA FRIEND BEAR</span><br><img src="http://members.citynet.net/weluvcarebears/images/seafriend.jpg"><br>His love for the sea and all of its inhabitants is what motivates Sea Friend Bear. It's his job to remind us that we must take good care of all the water in all the seas and keep it polution free, as there are many plants and animals that call it their home.

Her strong maternal spirit led her to take in the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins when they were orphaned cubs and raise them as her own. She is the one that all the Care Bears look up to, and aspire to be like. Although all her qualities make her a wonderful role model, most importantly she ALWAYS tells the truth. True Heart's tummy symbol, a heart inside a multi-colored star, reminds us to always be truthful to others, as well as be true to ourselves.</span></div>

The Environmental Bears remind us that there are many things in the world that we need to protect and respect, including trees, flowers, plants, animals, oceans, rivers, lakes, the sun, the stars, and the sky. Do your best to conserve all the wonderful things in nature and keep them pollution free. We even need to be mindful of noise pollution, it also disrupts the peacefulness of nature. Let's all help the Care Bears make the world a better place and follow a few simple rules: Don't waste or pollute water, it's very precious; Take good care of trees, don't cut them down or pull them out, and better yet, plant some more in your neighborhood; Don't litter, and if you see that somebody else has littered, pick it up and place it in the garbage where it belongs; and last but not least, Recycle!</span><br><br><img src="http://members.citynet.net/weluvcarebears/images/proudheartbear.gif"><br><span style="color: blue;">Proud Heart Bear</span><br><br><img src="http://members.citynet.net/weluvcarebears/images/enviro6.jpg"><br><span style="color: indigo;">Funshine and Tenderheart</span><br><br><img src="http://members.citynet.net/weluvcarebears/images/enviro5.jpg"><br><span style="color: blue;">Bedtime and Friend</span><br><br><img src="http://members.citynet.net/weluvcarebears/images/enviro4.jpg"><br><span style="color: indigo;">Wish, Cheer, and Love-a-lot</span></div>

She is both proud and vain, and she has ever been caught off guard (despite her heightened feline senses) while trying to get her fur just right. She pays attention to every tiny detail, but sometimes she gets so engrossed in the details, she forgets to look at the larger picture. Proud Heart is quite clever, and often has some sneaky way of solving a given problem.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Swift Heart Rabbit</span><br><br><img src="http://members.citynet.net/weluvcarebears/images/swift.gif"><br><br>Swift Heart Rabbit is the fastest creature alive. 'Swifty' as she is called by her friends is a happy go lucky sort who is enthralled by speed. Fast cars, fast planes, fast boats, if it goes fast, she loves it. She does take time out of her fast paced life to show others that there is always time for the important things in life, such as showing others how much you really care. She can be rather annoying at times due to her hyperactivity.</span><br><br><span style="color: brown;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Treat Heart Pig</span><br><br><img src="http://members.citynet.net/weluvcarebears/images/treat.gif"><br><br>Treat Heart Pig enjoys treating both herself and everyone around her. Though she has a tendancy to be, well, piggish, she always shares with others. She enjoys cooking, and loves eating even more. She tries (unsuccessfully) to watch her weight, but she just can't help herself. She wouldn't be herself if she didn't snack, and the others know that and love her for her.</span><br><br><span style="color: green;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Noble Heart Horse</span><br><br><img src="http://members.citynet.net/weluvcarebears/images/noble.gif"><br><br>Noble Heart Horse is the oldest and wisest of the Care Bear Cousins. He's been around since day one, and the entire Care Bear Family holds alot of respect for both he and True Heart Bear. He and True Heart raised all of the other Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins from the time they were cubs. Noble Heart has a set of ideals he believes in, and he has taught them to all of the other Care Bear Cousins, making them the caring group they are today.<br></span><br><br><img src="http://members.citynet.net/weluvcarebears/images/cousins2.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://members.citynet.net/weluvcarebears/images/cousinscard.jpg"><br><br></div>
