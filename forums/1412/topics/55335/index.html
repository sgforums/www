Looking for a way to further increase the success of Masters of the Universe they asked Filmation to go beyond animating mere toy adverts, and create sixty-five episodes of what was to become known as He-Man and the Masters of the Universe.<br><br>Mattel wanted a simple cartoon that advertised its action figures and nothing more. What they had not counted on was that these episodes would have writers trying to prove themselves, trying to breakthrough into the animation industry. Filmation was known as being a great place for opportunities, thus a lot of great animation writers started out here, Paul Dini, Larry DiTillio, Bob Forward and J. Michael Straczynski to name a few.<br><br>The series had limited animation, thus it relied on its storytelling and animation direction more than anything. The talent at Filmation turned He-Man and the Masters of the Universe from a simple action figure advert into one of the most memorable animated shows ever produced! He-Man and the Masters of the Universe had a total of one hundred and thirty animated episodes, two made-for-TV specials and a spin-off series. But that's another story...<br></div>

The one problem; the show was targeted towards the male species! Working closely with Filmation once again, Mattel created She-Ra, the twin-sister of He-Man. The action figure for girls was launched and initially everything went well.<br><br>Mattel once again asked Filmation to create sixty-five episodes of She-Ra Princess of Power. As before they wanted a simple cartoon that advertised their action figures and nothing more. As production on the He-Man and the Masters of the Universe series was halfway through season two, Filmation began animating She-Ra Princess of Power. The problem they faced was that according to the toy line She-Ra's greatest threat came from "jealous beauty" Catra. The Evil Horde from the Masters of the Universe action figure line had yet to be featured in the He-Man animated series, so a decision was made to have the Evil Horde as She-Ra's villains!<br><br>Filmation and Mattel planned something big to launch She-Ra Princess of Power, so they combined the first five episodes that had been animated, known collectively as "The Sword of She-Ra," and pieced them together renaming the film "The Secret of The Sword." It may not have broke box office records, but it was a good start for the She-Ra series.<br><br>This time around the writers were even stronger and more cohesive than they had been for the start of the He-Man and the Masters of the Universe series. Larry DiTillio, Bob Forward, J. Michael Straczynski and Robert Lamb shaped the world of Etheria.<br><br>Unlike the He-Man series, She-Ra had less limited animation due to a slightly larger budget, more consistent writing and most notably, superb visual direction from the ex-storyboard staff who were now directors, Tom Tataranowicz the man to watch!<br><br>Unfortunately even though the series was very good it was not as profitable as the He-Man series had been. Mattel wanted one last push so they gave the green light for a second season of twenty-eight episodes to be produced. These episodes had some of the best animation and directing that Filmation had ever seen. Sadly sales plummeted and the worlds of Eternia and Etheria were no more.<br><br>She-Ra Princess of Power had a total of one ninety-three animated episodes and one theatrically released movie.<br></div>

Mattel had also remembered what made the toy so popular all those years ago, and in early 2002 the company announced that to tie-in with the new action figure line a new animated series would premiere later in the year. He-Man and the Masters of the Universe was back on the air!<br><br>Mike Young Productions were approached by Mattel to bring He-Man back into the world of animation. He-Man had been away for a long time and the animation industry had changed greatly over the years mainly due to ex-Filmation artists like Bruce Timm and Tom Tataranowicz! Fortunately Mike Young Productions knew exactly what to do and produced a new animated series that took He-Man's visual style to the next level.<br><br>Unlike the original series this new series features very impressive continuity. Mattel went to the trouble of contacting Michael Halperin (who wrote the original Series Bible for the Filmation series) asking him to write a new Series Bible. Mattel also hired this site's very own James "Busta Toons" Eatock and Zadoc Angell to write a huge Encyclopedia regarding the original series.<br><br>As of writing Mike Young Productions have animated one season's worth of twenty-six episodes, with thirteen more due later in the year...<br><br></div>
