            <div class='col-md body'>Girls and glam were all the rage back in the late 80s (yeah, only in the late 80s) ...and Jem and the Holograms were there to provide us with more than our fair share of all the fashions and strange lingo of a decade since past. What little girl didn't want to grow up to be just like the princess of rock, Jem? What little boy didn't want to grow up to be Rio, Jerrica's boyfriend and Jem's stage manager. Poor Rio...he's in love with both and doesn't have the brains to figure out they're the same person. Rio also had to compete for Jem's affections against Riot, the lead-singer of the Stingers who managed to look twice as effeminine as me and the entire cast of the Holograms combined.<br><br>The Jem and the Holograms music group was owned by Starlight Music, a black sheep in the music industry due to their actual caring about causes such as charity and housing foster children. Constantly on top of the charts, their only real rivals were the evil rock group, The Misfits. Pizzazz, who has pea-green hair and army camoflauge paint on her cheeks, leads the group and will even break the rules to get on top.<br><br>When Jerrica uses Synergy, a girl somehow connected to the star earrings she wears, she'll turn into Jem, grrl-rockin'-kinderwhore era-supreme pop star who's here to save the day!<br><br></div>
