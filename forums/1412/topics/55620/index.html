Merchandising rapidly followed and more than 100 different Voltron products were on shelves around the world.<br><br>World Events' more recent program, Voltron: The Third Dimension, was the first full 3D CGI series produced solely in the United States. Produced by the creators of Babylon 5 and the Prince of Atlantis, this Voltron series contains action- packed storylines that appeal to viewers of all ages. In 1999-2000, this Daytime Emmy Award winning series was ranked number one among weekly syndicated kids in the United States. The show currently airs in 60 percent of the world and continues to host successful toy and home video lines.<br>World Events Productions anticipates that the best is yet to come. With the renewed interest and recent success of resurrected superheroes from the 1980's, there is no doubt that Voltron is poised to launch its global return. A Voltron comic book is already in development and a new interactive Voltron series is soon to be announced.<br><br></div>

The universal forces of good have consolidated into a Federation called THE GALAXY ALLIANCE. This coalition of planets and star systems works for peace and justice in the universe, exploring new planets, helping those in trouble, and fighting the dark forces of evil.  <img src="http://www.voltronforce.com/images/G_ALLIANCE.jpg"><br>Unfortunately the universe is filled with sinister villains who beleaguer the outnumbered forces of the Galaxy Alliance. The most powerful of these enemies is KING ZARKON, supreme monarch of PLANET DOOM. Aided by his son LOTOR, and a formidable witch called HAGAR, Zarkon has spread terror throughout the stars, bringing back countless unfortunate slaves who he reigns over from the heart of his empire, CASTLE DOOM. <img src="http://www.voltronforce.com/images/ZAR-LOTOR.jpg"><br>One of the places which was conquered by Zarkon is an idyllic little planet called ARUS. Zarkon knew that Arus possessed a very special defense weapon; five fierce lion-robots which could combine into one great robot warrior named VOLTRON - but in a devious attack, Zarkon has Hagar magically neutralize the giant robot and hide its five separate parts in different places on the planet.<br><img src="http://www.voltronforce.com/images/ALLURA-CORAN.jpg"><br>Without Voltron, Arus was helpless. Zarkon invaded with an evil armada of spaceships and waves upon waves of robot raiders. KING ALFOR, the beneficent ruler of planet Arus, put up a valiant defense, but his forces were overwhelmed by Zarkon's superior numbers. Alfor himself did not survive Zarkon's ruthless invasion. However, the good king had a young daughter named ALLURA who did survive; protected by Alfor's most trusted counselor: CORAN.<br>When Zarkon's fleet finally left Arus, this once lovely planet was but a sad shadow of its former self. Those who had survived the attack now lived in caves and dark forests, afraid to come out lest Zarkon renew his offensive. The once beautiful CASTLE OF LIONS, where Alfor had reigned, lay in ruins. Yet, unbeknownst to Zarkon, the Castle's secret chambers were still inhabited by two clandestine occupants, Coran and Allura, who lived on in hopes that someday the secret of Voltron would be recovered and planet Arus would be restored to its former state.<br><img src="http://www.voltronforce.com/images/ZARKONFLEET.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">THE RESURRECTION OF VOLTRON</span><br><br>Years have passed since Zarkon's invasion of Arus. A team of Space Explorers approaches the planet. Young but determined, these explorers have been sent by the Galaxy Alliance on a special mission: to search for the secret of Voltron. The team of explorers consists of five brave young men: KEITH, PIDGE, HUNK, LANCE, and SVEN. Upon landing on Arus' barren surface, the team begins a careful investigation of the planet. After a close call with some of Zarkon's sinister surveillance ships, the team finally locates the ravaged Castle of Lions where they are met by Coran and his charge, Princess Allura, who has grown into a radiant young woman.  <img src="http://www.voltronforce.com/images/v_force.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.voltronforce.com/images/lions.jpg">All five explorers are smitten by the beautiful princess, but the real fireworks begin when the space explorers are visited by the GHOST OF KING ALFOR who declares ceremoniously that their arrival is a fulfillment of destiny. Through Coran, he bestows upon them the special knowledge that they need to resurrect Voltron!<br>The five space explorers prove equal to the challenge, going through a series of dangerous adventures before recovering the five parts of Voltron - the Robot Lions - and bringing them together to form the incredible super-robot. Zarkon does everything he can to prevent the resurrection of Voltron, but to no avail. The indomitable young space explorers outmaneuver him and, with the help of the mighty Voltron, treat him to a humbling defeat. <img src="http://www.voltronforce.com/images/voltron.gif"><br><br>As Zarkon slinks off to plot his revenge, the cave dwellers of Arus emerge triumphantly into the sunlight. The royal castle is restored, the princess is restored to her throne, and the people set about the happy task of re-establishing peace and justice on their beloved planet.<br>The space explorers, in turn, are constituted as a permanent VOLTRON FORCE taking up residence in the Castle which they use as a base of operations por protecting Arus and surrounding environs.<br>Zarkon repeatedly returns to Arus, mounting one attack after another - but all are foiled by the mighty Voltron. In one of these encounters, Sven was badly wounded and was hospitalized on a neutral planet. Volunteering to take his place, Allura quickly proved herself a courageous fighter, earning a spot as a permanent member of the Voltron Force.<br><img src="http://www.voltronforce.com/images/lets_go.jpg"><br>The first campaigns Zarkon launches against Arus are led by a gruff general named YURAK, but after many repeated defeats by Voltron, Yurak is replaced by Zarkon's son, PRINCE LOTOR. An arrogant brute, Lotor has a personal motive for his attacks, enchanted by the beautiful princess Allura, he wants to capture her and make her his bride.<br><br>These are the continuing adventures of space explorers as they battle the evil Zarkon and work for peace and justice throughout the universe.<br></div>

The envoys have come to speak with the prisonÂ’s most dangerous inmate Â– Lotor.<br><img src="http://www.voltronforce.com/images/LOTOR.jpg"><br>Three years ago, LotorÂ’s Fleet of Doom was defeated by Voltron. In the final battle, a megablast ripped LotorÂ’s command ship to pieces. LotorÂ’s twisted body was found in the wreckage; he was barely alive. Alliance doctors stitched and welded Lotor back together, using iron plates, and bionic parts. His hideous new metallic face was almost unrecognizable. When he was healed, the galaxyÂ’s highest court found Lotor guilty of war crimes. He was sentenced to life in solitary confinement, maximum security. The judges said they would reconsider the sentence if Lotor would reveal the location of his secret FORTRESS, but he refused.<br><img src="http://www.voltronforce.com/images/DOOM.jpg"><br>Indeed, throughout the trial, Lotor did not utter a single word, and has not spoken since. From the moment he saw his new, repulsive form, he has been consumed by a silent, burning rage against the one responsible for his downfall--<br><br>But has he?. . . Lotor is not just motivated by ego and greed, but by love for the beautiful princess. He loves the princess obsessively and will not rest until he can make her his queen.<br><img src="http://www.voltronforce.com/images/BLUE.jpg"><br>These are the elements that distinguish Voltron from other similar shows and account for its continued popularity. The new series emphasizes the mythical elements revealing aspects of the Voltron legend. The episodes uncover new information about the Lions, the Castle, and Princess AlluraÂ’s royal destiny, and encounter new, deeper mysteries and enigmas.<br><br><img src="http://www.voltronforce.com/images/CITY2.jpg"></div>

He is the creator of Voltron. It isn't explained how Alfor died but I'm assuming he was killed by Zarkon. I think, though, that Alfor and Zarkon had a duel in the Valley of Zoar, on Arus. Every time the Voltron force talks about Alfor, Zarkon's name is mentioned. If Zarkon was the one who killed Alfor (with his own hands, sword) it's the perfect story line as to why Allura hates Zarkon so much, other than the fact he's trying to conquer Planet Arus and took most of the Arus population as slaves. Though Alfor is dead, he appears once in a while to assist and give advice to the Voltron Force, which gets Allura out of trouble fairly often.<br><br></div>
