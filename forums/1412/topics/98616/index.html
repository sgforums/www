            <div class='col-md body'>My sweetie pie likes this very much... As much as I agreed that they looked wonderfully detailed and very nice, I can't imagine having them displayed in the house.... Anybody collecting these?? Do you guys really display them???<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Attila the Hun</span><br><img src="http://www.spawn.com/toys/horror/monsters3/attila/images/monsters3_attila_photo_04_dp.jpg"><br>Infamous leader of the bloodthirsty Huns, fifth-century inhabitants in modern-day Hungary, who led devastating plundering raids into western Europe. Known as the Scourge of God, Attila led a vast and merciless mounted army, which left a swath of devastation and death across much of Europe. Attila is said to have died of a nasal hemorrhage on his wedding night.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Billy the Kid</span><br><img src="http://www.spawn.com/toys/horror/monsters3/billy/images/monsters3_billy_photo_04_dp.jpg"><br>One of the most noted gunfighters of the American Wild West, Billy the Kid is described as both a cold-blooded murderer and a modern-day Robin Hood. Billy was at the epicenter of the New Mexico-based cattle wars and saw a lifetime of violence before his own demise at age 22. He's said to have killed more than 20 men in his short life.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Elizabeth Bathory</span><br><img src="http://www.spawn.com/toys/horror/monsters3/elizabeth/images/monsters3_elizabeth_photo_04_dp.jpg"><br>The Blood Queen of Hungary, who struck terror throughout that region in the late 1500s and early 1600s, and is said to have killed more than 600 young women. A member of the ruling class, Bathory tortured servants throughout her life. Later, with concern for her fading beauty, she began bathing in the blood of slaughtered young girls as a perverse form of a fountain of youth.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jack the Ripper</span><br><img src="http://www.spawn.com/toys/horror/monsters3/jack/images/monsters3_jack_photo_04_dp.jpg"><br>One of the world's most notorious serial killers, noted more for the mystery surrounding his identity than his body count. Brutally killed and mutilated at least five prostitutes with a straight razor on the dark, foggy, dangerous streets of 1888 London. Although it's the subject of much speculation, to this day, Jack the Ripper's true identity remains unknown.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rasputin</span><br><img src="http://www.spawn.com/toys/horror/monsters3/rasputin/images/monsters3_rasputin_photo_04_dp.jpg"><br>A debauched, illiterate Siberian peasant who turned his sinful life into that of a quasi-religious faith healer and fortune-teller in 19th-century Russia. By "curing" Tsar Nicholas II's son of hemophilia, the "mad monk" became a powerful political and social force in St. Petersburg. This led to an assassination attempt in which Rasputin was poisoned, shot, beaten and eventually drowned.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vlad the Impaler</span><br><img src="http://www.spawn.com/toys/horror/monsters3/vlad/images/monsters3_vlad_photo_04_dp.jpg"><br>The true Prince Dracula, known as Vlad Dracula (translated as Son of the Devil), Vlad Tepes and Vlad the Impaler. An important figure in 15th-century Romanian history, Vlad Dracula is known as a patriot, but he was also bloodthirsty, slaughtering between 40,000 and 100,000 of his subjects -- usually by impalement -- during his reign.<br></div>
