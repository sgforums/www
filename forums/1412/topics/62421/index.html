Super Robot Lifeforms" and "Transformers 2010". This did not directly mirror the events of TF:TM, but instead gave alternate introductions for several characters. However, its main centre was the "scramble power" of the combining teams - the ability to swap arms and legs around to gain the advantage in battle.<br><br>Of course, this was not shown in the American cartoons, where each gestalt had a set configuration.<br><br>The episode was released as an OVA [Original Video Animation] in Japan, on Laserdisc. This laserdisc is now a highly-priced collectors' item. The episode ended on a cliffhanger, with the Destron Dinosaurer rising out of the sea and facing the Cybertrons. A second part was never made, leaving the serial incomplete. It is likely that the first part did not make back its costs, and the decision was made to simply resume the American continuity. The opening portion of the episode recapped the Transformers' story so far, including clips from "More Than Meets the Eye" and "The Master Builders". The remaining scenes were all newly made.<br><br>On top of this Scramble City Toys was made, to showcase the toys designated as being released in the "Scramble City" range - the combining teams, Ultra Magnus, Galvatron Metroflex and Dinosaurer, as well as the existing leaders, Convoy and Megatron, and Broadcast and the Buildtrons/Devastar. The plot is largely the same as the first part, but a little compacted and using fewer characters, plus less intricate fights. Some clips from existing episodes are also used, and the episode, around 14 minutes in length, ends with a all-out commercial, displaying each toy and giving its price. This film is often incorrectly referred to as Scramble City 2.<br><br>Another interesting sidenote are that the other TF:TM deaths are not shown - allowing Prowl and Ironhide to appear in "Headmasters", and Wheeljack to turn up in "Victory".<br><br>Both are quite freely avaliable on the internet, although the only known rip of SC: Toys is of rather poor quality. Low-quality versions of the episodes are avaliable here. A better-quality version is avaliable on the Comic CD Bonus Disc.<br><br>The toyline was mainly the first wave of US 1986 releases - the first four combining teams, the two 'city' Transformers and the set of Minibot repaints. In addition, several 1985 US toys not released in Japan before were issued.<br><br><img src="http://www.tfdatabase.com/japanese/scramble/intro/scramble_intro.jpg"></div>

Super-Robot Lifeforms" and the release of "Scramble City", the next step was to buy and rework the third series of the American cartoon. With the Japanese having not received Transformers: The Movie as yet, the series was presented as simply being in the future. The ungiven explanation for the change was that simply after 20 years, things would change. "Transformers 2010" constisted of dubbed versions of all 30 US Series 3 episodes, and was transmitted from November 14 1986 to June 26 1987. The names of some episodes were obviously changed, e.g. "The Return of Optimus Prime" became "The Return of Convoy".<br><br>The show again had some characters renamed, and had its own toyline to support it. Little is known about any changes made to the episodes [because of its direct relation to the Movie, "Five Faces of Darkness" was re-edited; among other things, Dinosaurer is reactivated by the Buildtrons rather than built, as he appeared in the "Scramble City" animation], although "Return of Convoy" was certainly the finale of "Transformers: 2010" as it was for the US third season. The toyline was made up of the second half of the US 1986 toyline, with some left-over toys from the 1985 line. A new title sequence was commissioned, again with a new theme tune [for the lyrics to this, click here].<br><br>The Transformers line also continued its association with TV Magazine during this period. "Transformers: 2010" was a resounding success once more both on TV and in the toy shops, and its reception persuaded Takara to invest in their own TV series, as the next batch of American cartoons consisted of only 3 episodes.<br><br><img src="http://www.tfdatabase.com/japanese/2010/intro/2010.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.tfdatabase.com/japanese/headmasters/headmasters.gif"><br>Transformers : Headmasters [1987-1988]<br><br>For the 1987 toyline, Takara decided to go in a slightly different direction to that taken by its American sister company Hasbro. Helped partially by the ongoing success of the Transformers line in Japan, as opposed to the dwindling interest in the line in the United States, Takara commissioned a 35-episode series, named "Headmasters" after the principle toy gimmick of the 1987 toy line. The series ignored the 'Rebirth' serial, continuing instead from the end of Transformers 2010, the Japanese equivalent of season 3. A recap was given at the start of the first episode, 'Four Warriors from the Sky', which recalled the<br>battle of the Transformers so far, including the death and resurrection of Convoy, and the replacement of Megatron with Galvatron.<br><br>Set in the year 2011, rather than being robots binary-bonded to Nebulans, the Headmasters are small robots who have built themselves large exo-suits which transform. The Cybertron Headmasters are Chromedome, Hardhead, Highbrow, Brainstorm and Fortress. Chromedome and Fortress are the principal characters, and both were redesigned for the show. Chromedome's visor was replaced with two eyes, while Fortress was based more directly on the Cerebros toy. Brainstorm and Highbrow both also had their heads redesigned, the former having a mouth and nose instead of a faceplate, and the latter getting a recolour. Galvatron also has three Headmasters in his service as the story starts, Weirdwolf, Skull and Wipe. These used the same character designs as 'Rebirth'.<br><br>The series started off with Galvatron launching an attack on Seibertron. Convoy heads for the battle from the Cybertrons' base on Signia, while Ultra Magnus leads reinforcements from Earth via the spacebridge, including the Trainbots, based on an old Diaclone combining robot who predated the Transformers toyline. Also introduced this episode was Sixshot, a Destron ninja. Thoughout the series, but especially in these opening episodes, existing Fight! Super Robot Lifeforms characters get cameo appearances, such as Meistar, Lambor, Hound, Prowl, Inferno and Tracks. The battle is turned when the Cybertron Headmasters appear. In the second episode Blaster and Soundwave had a big showdown which resulted in both being blown apart, though they were rebuilt as Twincast and Soundblaster respectively to tie in with repaints of their toys. In the third episode Convoy dies once again, allowing his energy to save Seibertron, and Hot Rodimus again becomes Rodimus Convoy. More new characters were introduced in the fifth episode, namely the Monsterbots and Battle Beasts. Battle Beasts were released as a seperate toyline to Transformers in most countries, but in Japan Takara decided to tie the two together.<br><br>The series was much more action-orientated, and as the Japanese television networks allowed the series to be shown in order, an ongoing story arc was able to be developed. This really began to gather speed as Scorponok arrived, and blew Seibertron up. Later on, Fortress displayed his ability to merge with his ship and become the mighty Fortress Maximus, while Scorponok does the same, becoming Megazarak. And then Mars gets blown up. In episode 24, Ultra Magnus was slain by Sixshot, while new characters were introduced: the Clones [Cybertron and Destron], the Doubletrons and the Horrorcons. Just an episode after the death of Ultra Magnus, Galvatron was removed from the series, buried under the ice by the Cybertron Headmasters. The next few episodes concentrated on the search for Megazarak's weak spot, and the introduction of the Cyberton and Destron Targetmasters. Then Sixshot began to doubt his allegiance and befriended Daniel Witwicky. The series ended with a massive battle in the Arctic. The Destrons are beaten, with a little help from Sixshot, and Megazarak is destroyed by Fortress Maximus.<br><br>The accompanying toyline was the last with any great similarity to the Western one, though there were significant differences. The Trainbots were issued in Japan only, as were the repaints of Blaster and Soundwave and four new Cybertron cassettes. Also several Destron cassettes were reissued, and Fortress Maximus was issued with a large sword.<br><br>Headmasters was a success, and a follow-up series, Masterforce, was commissioned. The series has never aired in America, though Star TV [badly] dubbed it into English for airing in Hong Kong. It receives mixed feelings from fans, however, and while its epic plot and high points are revered, its low points and seemingly purposeful attempt to follow the style of the US series often see this rated as the poorest of the Japanese series.<br><br><img src="http://www.tfdatabase.com/japanese/headmasters/intro/headmasters.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.tfdatabase.com/japanese/masterforce/masterforce.gif"><br>Transformers : Super God Masterforce [1988-1989]<br><br>With Headmasters an unqualified success in Japan, a follow-up series was commissioned immediately. The anime was based on the 1988 line, with Takara's releases now taking an even more radical departure from Hasbro's Western counterpart. The basic plot of the series was that even though the Destrons were kicked off Earth at the end of "Headmasters", a small group of Pretenders led by Metalhawk remained on Earth to guard it. Pretenders were Transformers who were able to conceal themselves inside suits which ressembled<br>humans. However a group of Destrons led by the mysterious Devil-Z begin activity on Earth, and Metalhawk and his group must try to stop them.<br><br>More Transformers with different concepts were introduced throughout the series. Both sides had a trio of school children join them, and these children were all given Transtectors - giant transforming suits. Later on the Godmasters were introduced - the name being a translation of Power Masters. These again followed the Transtector pattern, and the largest Powermaster was Ginrai [or Jinrai], who took over from Metalhawk as Cybertron leader. The Ginrai toy was a slightly-reworked version of the 1988 Powermaster Optimus Prime, and this led to much confusion as to whether or not they were the same character. However, it is certain that Ginrai is not Convoy. More transtctors were introduced for both sides' Godmasters [a literal translation of Powermaster]. The Destrons' new leader Overlord was introduced later in the series, as was the wandering Cybertron Sixknight, and the huge Destron Black Zarak.<br><br>Unlike the ambiguity present in Headmasters, the Masterforce characters were clearly not the same as the US characters with which they shared toy moulds. The Japanese Headmaster Jrs were simply children with mobile suits, whereas America's Siren, Nightbeat and Hosehead were sentient Transformers, binary-bonded to Nebulan partners. Some sites [don't ask me who and I won't say!] have caused massive confusion by attempting to name characters as their American 'counterparts', when actually they're totally different. Minerva and Nightbeat are even different sexes... This state of confusion was not helped by Hong Kong company Star TV's dubs of the series. For these reasons, there is no character guide for this series as all the characters are effectively new.<br><br>The toy line was beginning to take a big change to the Western equivalent. Only a handful of toys were released unchanged in both territories, with the majority of the Japanese versions being repainted. In addition Japan got several interesting exclusives. Among these were the Destron double-Godmaster Overlord [later issued in Europe in 1991], Godbomber, who could merge with Super Ginrai to form God Ginrai, Microman repaint Browning, Scorponok retooling Black Zarak and Fortress Maximus retooling Grand Maximus. The association with TV Magazine continued throughout the year, with the strip now featuring characters from the Masterforce series. The series was again a big success, and a follow-up series, Victory, was commissioned for 1989.<br><br><img src="http://www.tfdatabase.com/japanese/masterforce/intro/masterforce_intro.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.tfdatabase.com/japanese/victory/victory.gif"><br>Transformers : Victory [1989-1990]<br><br>"Masterforce" had built effectively on the success of its predecessors, and a sequel series was commissioned straight away. Takara decided to make the toyline totally independant of Hasbro's US line, with much more futuristic, Gundam-style robots. "Victory" was set in 2025, with the Cybertrons setting up the Space Defense Force in conjuction with the human authorities. The all-new cast was led by Star Saber, a Brainmaster, and consisted of several new teams - the other Brainmasters [three robots with giant exo-suits, who could them combine again to form Road Caesar], Multiforce [six robots with over 30 combined forms, including the giant robot Landcross] and Rescue Force<br>[a team of four Microtransformers]. The Cybertron force also included Galaxy Shuttle, a giant transforming transport, and their human friend Jan. They squared up against the Destrons, who were now led by the Breastmaster Deathsaurus, and their main aim was to conquer Earth and steal its energy. Deathsaurus' force initally consisted of 4 other Breastmasters, including second-in-command Leozak, and the Dinoforce [Six Pretenders with dinosaur shells who could combine to form the giant Dinoking]. The latter provided most of the comic relief.<br><br>Brainmasters were something of a cros between Headmasters and Powermasters, with the smaller robot forming the larger one's face and "brain". Breastmasters had breatplates that could transform either into a small companion, or a gun. These attachments were known as Breast Attackers. Breastforce had one each, while Deathsaurus had two. Microtransformers were small Transformers, not much bigger than humans, who hailed from the planet Micro.<br><br>Although much of the series takes place on Earth, the forays into space lent the series an epic feel, and it was an immediate success. New characters were introduced throughout the series: the Cybertron six-changer Great Shot; the Destron Crossformers Black Shadow and Blue Bacchus; two more Breastmasters, Hellbat and Gaihawk, and thus the Breastmaster gestalt Leokaiser. In addition there were appearances by past characters. The Cybertrons' previous leader, God Ginrai, appeared in the middle of the series, and was mortally wounded. However, Perceptor, Wheeljack and Minerva were able to place his mind in a new body, and Victory Leo was born. He was then also able to merge with Star Saber to form Victory Leo.<br><br>The series was another great success, with the toyline still selling well, unlike its American counterpart, which was beginning to flag. Plans for a follow-up series, Transformers: Zone, were drawn up.<br><br><img src="http://www.tfdatabase.com/japanese/victory/intro/victory_intro.jpg"></div>
