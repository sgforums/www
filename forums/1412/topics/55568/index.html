            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.turner.com/planet/static/graphics/captain.gif"><br><br><span style="color: green;"><strong>CAPTAIN PLANET</strong></span><br><br>An environmental super hero with the powers of nature, Captain Planet is a composite of the five Planeteers and their powers - Earth, Fire, Wind, Water and Heart - magnified. At his disposal are all of the elements and forces of the natural world.<br><br>Intellectually, Captain Planet has an encyclopedic knowledge of the universe; emotionally, he is a blend of the five disparate personalities and imaginations of the Planeteers. He is the combination of their hearts and souls, and a metaphor for their teamwork and cooperation.<br><br>If Captain Planet is exposed to toxic wastes, smog, acid rain and other pollutants, his powers are temporarily weakened, and he must return to the Earth to "recharge."<br><br>Captain Planet has a powerful empathic sense and "feels" the suffering of all fellow creatures - even evil ones. Hence, he does not like to inflict pain, which often requires him to use his wits in addition to his incredible strength to defeat the enemies of Earth. He's also quick-witted and usually has a comic line for the villains.<br><br>Although he is an environmental super hero, he also realizes that he is not the long-term solution to the world's ecological problems. He stresses that people must accept responsibility for the future of Earth. This is exemplified in his recurring line "The Power is Yours!", a reminder that people, indeed, have the power to bring about change.<br><br>Captain Planet only appears in his Captain Planet garb. These are not clothes but elements of the Earth that are integral to his composition. He is able to rearrange his molecular structure to transform himself into the various powers and elements of nature, e.g., water, wind, fire, ice, etc. Captain Planet's outfit does not represent a specific culture. He has grass-green hair, sky-blue skin, earthy brown eyes, blood-red chest, gloves and boots, and sunlight-yellow insignia/globe. The globe on his chest sometimes flickers and turns gray when he is losing power or is exposed to high levels of pollution.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.turner.com/planet/static/graphics/gaia.gif"><br><br><span style="color: green;"><strong>GAIA</strong></span><br><br>Gaia (Guy-uh), the spirit of Earth, is the protector of the planet. She brought the Planeteers to her home base on Hope Island to help her in the battle to save Earth.<br><br>Gaia's health is connected to the health of the planet and she feels anguish whenever damage is done to the planet, its seas, atmosphere, or any living creatures. When this occurs, Gaia spurs the Planeteers into action. In a sense, she is an "Eco-Alert Early Warning System."<br><br>Gaia is a source of wisdom and advice both for Captain Planet and the Planeteers. She helps the Planeteers to identify environmental problems via Planetvision, a series of crystalline screens located on Hope Island. These "monitors" track the events of the present and can predict their ultimate outcome by extrapolating current ecological trends and displaying the results if left unchecked.<br><br>Gaia is the archetypal mother. She loves Earth's children unconditionally. Though she is saddened by what they've done and worried about the future, she is eternally hopeful that all will turn out for the best.<br><br>Gaia always appears in her long flowing gown. While the Planeteers each represent a specific culture, Gaia represents all cultures and is protector of all life on the planet. Her appearance - swarthy skin, black hair and blue eyes - is ethnically ambiguous. She is unable to materialize in tangible form anywhere except Hope Island, appearing elsewhere only as an ethereal, translucent being who can interact verbally but not physically.<br><br></div>

From Africa, he has seen forests turn into deserts and wildlife disappear. He does everything in his power to save the world's endangered species.<br><br>With his "green thumb," Kwame can grow almost anything, and his earthy wisdom provides a firm foundation for the other Planeteers. He is quiet but firm in his convictions and often assumes a leadership role. Though fundamentally serious, he has an impish sense of humor and often delivers off-the-wall lines in perfect deadpan.<br><br>Kwame's element is  Earth. He can create small, localized earthquakes; move rocks in the earth; cause holes or furrows in the earth for planting; create tiny islands by raising rocks from the shallows of the ocean; and turn mud into solid ground.<br><br><img src="http://www.turner.com/planet/static/graphics/wheeler.gif"><br><br><span style="color: green;"><strong>WHEELER</strong></span><br><br>Wheeler is an impulsive, street-wise teenager from Brooklyn, always ready with a flip remark. He loves to provide comic relief to his fellow Planeteers and to goad the villains.<br><br>Wheeler is the least knowledgeable Planeteer when it comes to ecology. Although he sometimes fails to understand the issues at hand, his heart is in the right place. He fancies himself the "ladies' man" and flirts incessantly with Linka, the Planeteer from Eastern Europe.<br><br>Wheeler's element is  Fire. He can call up tiny bolts of lightning or create and direct small fires.<br><br><img src="http://www.turner.com/planet/static/graphics/linka.gif"><br><br><span style="color: green;"><strong>LINKA</strong></span><br><br>Linka is the most cerebral of the five Planeteers. She is analytical, with a strong background in computers and music. Hot-tempered and feisty, she is nonetheless a master of logical deduction.<br><br>Linka's analytical approach to problem-solving provides the perfect foil to Wheeler's emotional impulsiveness. Linka is drawn to her American ally, yet put off by his boisterous, aggressive nature. Nevertheless, it is evident she cares about Wheeler by her reactions when he's in trouble.<br><br>Linka's element is  Wind. She can command it to swirl or gust, or create small tornadoes.<br><br><img src="http://www.turner.com/planet/static/graphics/gi.gif"><br><br><strong><span style="color: green;">GI</span></strong><br><br>Gi (Ghee) is from Asia and is a mixture of refined culture and high tech/high style. A student of marine biology, she has a strong scientific understanding of the various ocean ecosystems.<br><br>Gi is an athlete - her favorite sport is surfing. She is at home with the sea and its creatures and has a particular fondness for dolphins. She's also a rock 'n' roll fan as well as a natural linguist. She is a team player, though she can be a bit too impetuous at times.<br><br>Gi's element is  Water. She can control any water source, be it a well, faucet, river or sea. She can even summon the ocean to do her bidding, calling up waves or water spouts.<br><br><img src="http://www.turner.com/planet/static/graphics/ma-ti.gif"><br><br><strong><span style="color: green;">MA-TI</span></strong><br><br>Ma-Ti (Mah-Tee) is the youngest of the group. Raised by a Kayapo Indian shaman, he has the hidden knowledge of the rain forest, including the unique healing powers of the great forest's plants.<br><br>Ma-Ti is a friend to animals - he has a pet spider monkey named Suchi  - and communicates with them verbally and nonverbally. His empathic abilities with animals allow him to feel emotions that often produce clues to aid the Planeteers. He also serves as the Planeteers' emotional link to the Earth and human kind.<br><br>Ma-Ti's element is  Heart, which enables him to communicate telepathically with the other Planeteers and with Gaia. He is the essence of caring and concern, always willing to give of himself for the benefit of the whole.<br><br></div>
