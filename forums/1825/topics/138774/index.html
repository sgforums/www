            <div class='col-md body'>Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The chief executive of the United States was reported to have met daily Chosun Ilbo journalist Kang Chol Hwan, an alleged defector from the north, at the White House on June 15 and talked about "human rights situation" in the DPRK. Explicitly speaking, we do not know such word as "defector".<br>If there be any, they are just a handful of hooligans and criminals who are not in a position to look up at the clear blue sky over the country with an easy mind for the crimes committed against it and its people.<br>It is hard to expect to hear anything from such human scum and we, therefore, do not care at all about whatever nonsense they talk.<br>Given the fact that the chief executive of the world's only "superpower" did sit face to face with such a human trash and conferred with him over "human rights performance" and other "serious matters," it is not hard to guess the political level and stature of the present U.S. administration.<br>There are American military deserters in the DPRK, too, but we do not use them for a political purpose. Yet, the authorities of the U.S. ill-famed for the worst human rights abuses are resorting to such clumsy propaganda.<br>The present U.S. administration orchestrated such poor farce as the White House boss's "interview with the north Korean defector." This goes to prove that it is a group of wicked elements who do not bother to meet even good-for-nothing to serve its sinister political purpose, regardless of whether this behavior suits its stature and authority or not.<br>What matters here is why they are making such painstaking efforts and spending precious time for such a cheap charade.<br>This farce was staged at a time when the international community and the countries concerned became increasingly assertive for creating an environment and atmosphere favorable for the resumption of the six-party talks. Herein lies the real point of the issue.<br>Explicitly speaking, the U.S. chief executive's interview with the north Korean "defector" was part of the human rights offensive against the DPRK as it reflects the U.S. policy toward the DPRK.<br>It is the U.S. policy and strategy to bring down the dignified DPRK and its socialist system at any cost.<br>It tries to make the "collapse of the system" in the DPRK an established fact by peddling even the non-existent "human rights issue", not content with trumpeting about the nuclear issue, under the showy signboard of the "spread of freedom and democracy."<br>To this end, the U.S. has long worked hard to secure leverage and gain time to stifle the DPRK inside and outside the venue of the six-party talks and it is set to go on with this tactics in the days ahead.<br>This is clearly proved by the remarks made by American heavyweights persistently raising this or that issue not related to the solution to the nuclear issue. They asserted that "another issue arousing apprehension next to the nuclear issue is a human rights issue" and "not only nuclear issue but human rights, terrorism, drug and other issues should be addressed if the U.S.-DPRK relations are to be fully normalized".<br>The U.S. has never skipped an opportunity to assert that it wishes the resumption and progress of the six-party talks and it recognizes the north as a sovereign state, but all the facts go to prove that those are nothing but hypocrisy.<br>The human rights piffle again let loose by the U.S. high echelon suggests that Washington is not firm in its stand to recognize the DPRK as its dialogue partner and respect it. This, therefore, cannot be construed otherwise than an act of throwing a wet blanket on the efforts to resume the six-way talks.<br>The U.S. oft-repeated "human rights" issue is quite contrary to the purport and the agenda of the talks.<br>The U.S. should clearly understand that bringing such issues to the negotiating table will only result in confusing the talks.</div>
