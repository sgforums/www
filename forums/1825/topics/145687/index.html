            <div class='col-md body'>Community<br><br>Pyongyang, August 1 (KCNA) -- If Japan wants to be a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, it should sincerely fulfill its commitments to be trusted by the international community. Rodong Sinmun Monday observes this in a signed article.<br>Drawing attention to the recent reckless remarks made by Japanese heavyweights denying the decision made by an international tribunal against militarist war criminals of imperial Japan, openly supporting and justifying the distortion of history in textbooks and backing the visits to the "Yasukuni Shrine," the article says: All these moves of Japan are a challenge to human conscience and an act of swimming against the trend of the times.<br>These rash actions would not help Japan get international confidence and hold a responsible post at the U.N. If Japan is to take a new road of development, it should not repeat the wrong acts perpetrated as regards the relations with other countries in the past but reflect on them and opt for developing the true ties of friendship with them. The Japanese imperialists committed too hideous crimes against the world and humankind as a most barbaric aggressor, plunderer and murderer in the first half of the 20th century. Had Japan felt even an iota of guilty conscience and responsibility for the crimes committed in the past, it would not have tampered with history and sought militarization so undisguisedly.<br>The world regards Japan as one of the most dangerous forces of aggression in the 21st century.<br>The danger of the Japanese reactionaries' moves for militarization finds a more vivid manifestation in its establishment of war-time system, arms build-up and escalated military presence overseas. In case Japan rushing headlong into militarization is allowed to sit on the U.N. Security Council, it will perpetrate aggression and war in different parts of the world without hesitation by abusing the power of the U.N. and bring horrible misfortune and disasters to humankind, while behaving as a political and military power. How can the world trust such country as Japan and permit it to hold a responsible post at the U.N which handles important international issues. The more desperate efforts of the Japanese militarist forces to grab other countries' territories, justify visits to the "Yasukuni Shrine", distort history and revive militarism would only render Japan further isolated in the international community. Japan would be well advised to behave itself to be trusted by the world community, well aware of how the world views and approaches it. What is essential for Japan is to redress its past crimes. This is top priority for Tokyo.</div>
