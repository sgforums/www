            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Arsenal vs Chelsea</strong><br><br>First take on second on Sunday when Chelsea travel to Highbury looking to land a near-fatal blow to Arsenal's hopes of retaining their Premiership crown.<br><br>Jose Mourinho's side will open up an eight-point gap on the Gunners if they emerge victorious, but go into the game on the back of only their second defeat of the season.<br><br>The Blues lost 2-1 at Mourinho's former club Porto in the Champions League on Tuesday, but the game was of little importance as the Stamford Bridge outfit had already secured top spot in the group.<br><br>Last weekend Chelsea overcame stubborn resistance from Newcastle United before netting four unanswered goals in the final 27 minutes and it is performances like that that has got the rest of the Premiership title-chasers worried.<br><br>They have conceded just six times in 16 league games, with goalkeeper Petr Cech and centre-backs Ricardo Carvalho and John Terry seemingly able to stifle any domestic opposition.<br><br>Midfield general Frank Lampard has been the best player in the league so far this term and wingers Arjen Robben and Damien Duff have also been in outstanding form in recent weeks.<br><br>With Â£24million striker Didier Drogba back to full fitness it is difficult to identify any weaknesses in Chelsea's first-choice team.<br><br>That, of course, is the situation that the Gunners found themselves in last season, but since their 49-game unbeaten Premiership run ended at Manchester United they have looked anything but the country's best side.<br><br>A run of six points from six games ended last weekend with a 3-0 thrashing of Birmingham City, which was followed by a 5-1 victory against a disinterested Rosenborg side in the Champions League.<br><br>However, Arsene Wenger's problems are far from over, with the form of his goalkeepers his chief concern.<br><br>Jens Lehmann was dropped after a series of dodgy displays, but his replacement Manuel Almunia does not look like a Premiership quality shot-stopper and his weakness on crosses will be an area the Blues will look to exploit.<br><br>Arsenal's other major problems come in midfield where Patrick Vieira has been way below his best. The inspirational skipper misses Sunday's clash through suspension, but with Edu and Gilberto Silva both injured it will be left to youngsters Cesc Fabregas and Mathieu Flamini to try and match Lampard and his experienced colleagues.<br><br>Chelsea have not won a league game at Highbury since 1990, but did manage to knock Arsenal out of the Champions League at the quarter-final stage with a 2-1 win in North London last season.<br><br>A repeat of that result will put Mourinho's men in total control of the title race.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Preview</strong><br><br>It may be billed as Â“Judgement DayÂ” but ArsÃ¨ne Wenger knows SundayÂ’s clash between Arsenal and Chelsea will decide nothing in itself.<br><br>Jose MourinhoÂ’s side have looked ominously efficient in recent weeks; taking over at the top of the Premiership and breezing through to the Champions League Knockout Phase. Arsenal, meanwhile, have been less fluent since losing their unbeaten run at Manchester United at the end October. But they have produced a pair of convincing home wins, over Birmingham and Rosenborg, to stay hot on ChelseaÂ’s heels in domestic football and match their achievement thus far in Europe.<br><br>SundayÂ’s game will receive hours of television coverage and miles of newsprint. Arsenal were flavour of the month before Old Trafford, the West Londoners are the team to watch now. But unlike that Champions League Quarter-Final last March, nothing will be finally decided at Highbury on Sunday and ArsÃ¨ne Wenger believes the back-stretch of the title race could work in his young sideÂ’s favour.<br><br>Â“We had three big targets last week: to beat Birmingham, Rosenborg and Chelsea,Â” he said. Â“The first two of those have helped us to believe we can achieve the third.<br><br>Â“We know we have lost one or two games this season. But it is just that we have been extremely successful before. You have to accept that last season was exceptional. It does not mean we cannot lose a game.<br><br>Â“The spirit was never a problem in recent weeks, it was the confidence. But we have a very young squad and I believe time will work for us. In March these young players will be better and more experienced. Then in April they will be better than in March.Â”<br><br>Wenger is expected to rely on Mathieu Flamini, 20 and Francesc Fabregas 17, in central midfield because Gilbert (vertebrae), Edu (broken toe) and Patrick Vieira (suspended) are all out. Pascal Cygan (back) is also injured but Lauren is back from a ban.<br><br>Freddie Ljungberg has been in training after recovering from his migraine and a decision will be made on him on Saturday.<br><br>As for the issue of the goalkeeper, the manager has made his choice between sticking with Manuel Almunia and bringing back Jens Lehmann but he wonÂ’t be revealing it until just before kick-off.<br><br>It was Claudio RanieriÂ’s Chelsea that ended ArsenalÂ’s Champions League dream last season. Mourinho, backed by the money of Roman Abramovich, has undoubtedly improved the side but Wenger already saw them as a real threat.<br><br>Â“DonÂ’t forget Chelsea finished higher than Manchester United last season,Â” he said. Â“They were second in the league so it is no miracle they are fighting for the title. They played in the Semi-Final of the Champions League and were unfortunate to go out because they could have knocked out Monaco. They only lost the championship at Easter at Aston Villa. We are not at Easter yet so it is all open. I still think Manchester United will be there and even Liverpool can come back.<br><br>Â“But we know how to win the championship and we know we want to win the big games at home. That has an importance on the outcome of the season.Â”<br><br>So Sunday will be important, even vital, but it will not be decisive. The final judgement day rarely arrives before late April or May.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Prem Preview: Arsenal-Chelsea</strong><br><br>In the biggest game of the season so far, Arsenal host Chelsea at Highbury. The country's two best sides go head to head in a game that will have a massive impact on where the title ends up this season.<br><br><strong>BACKGROUND </strong><br><br>Arsenal go into the match on the back of two morale-boosting victories after they dispatched of Birmingham 3-0, and hammered Rosenborg 5-1. Both results come after a terrible run that saw the Gunners pick up fewer points than their title rivals as their form suffered following defeat at Old Trafford. After having dominated the Premiership since the opening day, WengerÂ’s team finally surrendered their unbeaten run, suddenly looking vulnerable to the rest of the sides in the league.<br><br>ArsenalÂ’s defensive frailties have been well documented this season, individual errors, keeping mistakes and poor marking have left the Gunners far more exposed this term. With the awesome array of attacking talent at WengerÂ’s disposal, Arsenal can afford to concede against the PremiershipÂ’s smaller sides but slack defending against a team such as Chelsea will be punished. One reason for ArsenalÂ’s vulnerability is the injury list at Highbury. Brazilian defensive midfielders Edu and Gilberto have been missing from action during ArsenalÂ’s poor run. With less physical presence to protect their back four, and Viera not at his best, Wenger knows that his choice of central midfielder will be vitally important.<br><br>In their defeat of Rosenborg on Tuesday, Arsenal looked to have finally recovered from their shaky run. Whilst keeper Manuel Almunia did not inspire much confidence in goal, his team-mates seemed to have found their rhythm once again. With ArsenalÂ’s attacking fluidity restored to its breathtaking best, Sunday has come at the perfect time for the Gunners.<br><br>Chelsea fans know only too well how difficult it has been for them to beat the Gunners. The Stanford Bridge outfit have yet to beat Arsenal at Highbury since the Premiership began, but came close last season. The West Londoners lost both league fixtures and an FA Cup tie to Arsenal, but managed to nock WengerÂ’s men out of the Champions League. With a new manager and a host of new recruits, Chelsea fans know that they may have their best chance yet to claim their first victory at Highbury.<br><br>As the early season plaudits went to Arsenal, MourinhoÂ’s men were branded boring and defensive by the press. Whilst the team continued to grind out important results, Mourihno waited for his star names to return from injury. With Arjen RobbenÂ’s introduction to the first team, Chelsea were transformed into a devastating attacking unit. The DutchmanÂ’s pace and guile has tormented Premiership defence since his return to action. Chelsea made the most of ArsenalÂ’s blip, replacing them at the top of the table and now lying five points clear. A victory this weekend would widen the gap to a massive eight points clear, which would devastate ArsenalÂ’s confidence.<br><br>Given ArsenalÂ’s injury and suspension problems, Wenger may play the inexperienced duo of Flamini and Fabregas in central midfield. This area will be key for the Gunners, with less physical presence in the team their performanceÂ’s against the likes of Makalele and Lampard will decide which way the game will go.</div>

With Viera suspended and Gilberto injured, Flamini should start with Fabregas again. Edu may play some part after recovering from a broken toe. Cygan is suffering from a back injury, and will be replaced on the bench by Senderos.<br><br><strong>Chelsea:</strong> After his performance against Newcastle, Drogba is ready to face the Gunners. The Ivory Coast international will be joined by Duff and Robben as Chelsea go in search of their first Highbury victory.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">PLAYERS TO WATCH </span><br><br>Arsenal:</strong>  After a storming performance against Rosenborg on Tuesday, FabregasÂ’ performance will be vital. Stepping in for Viera is no men feat, and at 17 years old, this is easily the youngsterÂ’s biggest game. Against Rosenborg, Fabregas dictated play with his vision and passing, scoring a stunning goal in the process. As the youngsterÂ’s lack of physical presence could see him struggle against Chelsea, Wenger will be looking for another master class from one of the gameÂ’s biggest prospects.<br><br><strong>Chelsea:</strong>  Arjen Robben has not yet faced Arsenal and will be raring to against WengerÂ’s men. The DutchmanÂ’s game is perfectly suited to MourinhoÂ’s tactical set up, with his pace and skill a problem for any Premiership defence. ArsenalÂ’s back line will need to be at their best if Robben performs to his usual high standards.</div>
