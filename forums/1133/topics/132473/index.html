            <div class='col-md body'>Competition: <strong>Woodlands Wellington FC vs Sinchi FC </strong><br>Date &amp; Time: 17 May 2005 7:30:00 PM<br>Venue: Woodlands<br><br>Whose fortunes will keep rising?<br><br>On Tuesday, both Woodlands Wellington and Sinchi FC will be looking to maintain their winning ways when they clash off at the Woodlands Stadium.<br><br>Both teams opened the second round of nine matches in this yearÂ’s NTUC Income Â– YeoÂ’s S-League with victories. And the fashion in which they had done it has similarities.<br><br>The Rams had gone to Hougang Stadium last week probably thinking Payar Lebar would do a repeat of their opening season loss when they fell 1-4 at Woodlands. But a much more disciplined Punggol outfit showed up and victory was not assured until the last 10 minutes.<br><br>The Chilins as well, laboured for their victory against Albirex Niigata, relying on a short but inspired performance by their substituted substitute Prime League top goal-scorer Zhou Fanqiang.<br><br>That win brought Sinchi three valuable points as they look to get out of the gutter and improve on their lowly ninth placing. It is about time the team from Jurong fulfil their potential and prove that they are not in the S-League simply to make up the numbers.<br><br>Led by Chen Â‘The CitadelÂ” Bo, the Chilins have played much better as of late when compared to their early performances. Heat and humidity were reasons given for their largely lethargic displays, but it seems that the players have gotten used to that.<br><br>And when you do sit back and analyze their losses, most of them were not due to the lack of trying. Sinchi is one of teams in the S-League where all the players play for one another. They defend as a team and no one individual has been made responsible for the squadÂ’s lack of success.<br><br>As the season got on, and with new players acclimatizing to the weather and the pace of Singapore football, the Chilins have been growing from strength to strength. Last weekÂ’s victory over fellow foreigners Albirex surely has given them an extra boost of confidence ahead of tomorrowÂ’s tie.<br><br>Woodlands meanwhile will look to replicate their early season victory over Sinchi.<br><br>Their mid-season coaching change has done wonders for team spirit and morale, and Karim BencherifaÂ’s philosophies seem to be well accepted throughout this talented squad of players.<br><br>Even though the Rams are the only side in the top seven of the league with a negative goal difference, they currently lie pretty in third. But the players know that they cannot rest on their laurels with Balestier, Home United and the Young Lions breathing down their necks.<br><br>Mercurial midfielder Ahmad Latiff Khamarudin will most surely want to be a factor in this tie, having been chosen Man-of-the-Match the last time these two sides met. He also netted the goal which finally assured Woodlands victory last week against Paya Lebar.<br><br>Irregardless of who wins, this tie will most definitely be a lively affair. Both teams are improving, with each set of players hungry for success. Coupled with the fact that each wants to keep their own momentum flowing: that always makes for good football.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Competition: <strong>Tampines Rovers FC vs Young Lions </strong><br>Date &amp; Time: 19 May 2005 7:30:00 PM<br>Venue: Tampines<br><br>Stags and Young Lions do Battle at Tampines Stadium<br><br>Tampines Rovers will look to bounce back from the disappointing defeat at the hands of SAFFC last weekend Â– when they host the Young Lions at the Tampines Stadium this Thursday.<br><br>However, the Stags will have to play without talismanic captain Nazri Nasir, who will be serving a one-match suspension.<br><br>Coach Vorawan Chitavanich could opt to include defender Satria Mad into the centre of the StagsÂ’ defence or move Mustafic Fahrudin back to partner Sead Muratovic and Zulkarnaen Zainal.<br><br>Either way, the StagsÂ’ coach has the strength in depth in his squad to handle NazriÂ’s absence Â– although his defensive and leadership qualities will still be sorely missed by his team-mates.<br><br>In any case, the Stags should feel pretty confident of getting something out of this fixture.<br><br>Both Agu Casmir and Jamil Ali will be ruled out of this game due to injuries. Midfielders Ridhuan Muhammad and Shahril Ishak are still serving their national service.<br><br>And key player Tengku Mushadad is involved in his schoolÂ’s tournament; therefore it is highly unlikely that the defensive midfielder will be fresh for this fixture.<br><br>The Stags have also defeated the Cubs in the earlier corresponding fixture at the Yishun Stadium.<br><br>Midfielders Steven Tan and Azlan Alipah were the unlikeliest heroes that day, though coach Vorawan will not mind who the goal scorers are, as long as he can get a repeat performance from his team come this Thursday.<br><br>However, playing against the Young Lions will not be an easy proposition.<br><br>Their recent 3-1 win against Balestier Khalsa have shown that the team have impressively sharpened their offensive forays, whilst still maintaining the same defensive stability that have only leaked in only fourteen goals in ten games.<br><br>Coupled with the fact that Nigerian midfielder Greg Nwokolo is firing on all cylinders after his impressive Man-of-the Match performance in the game, the Young Lions will definitely prove to be worthy opponents for the Stags.<br><br>Whatever the outcome is, the game will be a cracking one as two quality teams do battle at the Tampines Stadium.</div>

On the other hand, SAFFC have gone unbeaten since losing to champions Tampines in the first game of the season, and topped it all by taking revenge on Tampines last week, and overtaking the Stags to be in pole position at this point in the season.<br><br>Indeed, the Warriors have blossomed under the tutelage of coach Kim Poulsen, and now look like one of the firm favourites to wrestle the title from Tampines this season.<br><br>Poulsen will once more look towards his sideÂ’s attacking prowess to get the points in this game. Thai midfielder Therdsak Chaiman was inspirational in his sideÂ’s win over Tampines last week, and Home will let him run free at their own peril.<br><br>Aleksandar Duric has also done well in his first season at the club, but he has to pay tribute to the excellent service he has gotten down the flanks. Wingers Ali Imran Lomri and Noor Ali have been two big reasons why the Warriors have been so impressive this season, and one feels the key to stopping the Warriors may be to stifle the play down the wings from these two players.<br><br>The Warriors will be missing the presence of Vladan Seric, as the defender serves a one match suspension due to successive bookings. Still, the Warriors should have enough in reserve to make up for his absence.<br><br>Home will be quietly confident that they can get the points in the bag, as they have run into a spot of good form, after a slow start to the season by their standards. Some may point to the distraction of the AFC Cup, but the fact remains that Home, touted as one of the title contenders, are lying in fifth spot, seven points behind leaders SAFFC.<br><br>Peres De Oliveira will be one player especially eager to score on the night, as a solitary goal would make him the fifth player to notch up a century of goals in the S.League. This is some achievement, for a player deployed mostly as a midfielder.<br><br>He would then join fellow teammates Egmar Goncalves and Indra Sahdan in the Â‘100Â’ club, which is an insight into the potential firepower Home United have to unleash.<br><br>Notably, Indra took his tally to eight for the season with his brace against Geylang last week, and is now joint top scorer. IndraÂ’s goalscoring ability has never been doubted, and he will need to be at his most clinical to break down the WarriorsÂ’ defence.<br><br>So expect a vintage display of attacking ability come Thursday night. SAFFC have been unbeatable since the start of the season, and with Kim PoulsenÂ’s Â‘one match at a timeÂ’ policy, they certainly look very capable of returning the S.League trophy to the Choa Chu Kang Stadium.<br><br>Armed with home advantage and their recent form, it may very well be Home that stands the best chance of derailing the Warriors march towards the title.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Competition: <strong>Balestier Khalsa FC vs Paya Lebar Punggol FC </strong><br>Date &amp; Time: 20 May 2005 7:00:00 PM<br>Venue: Toa Payoh<br><br>Karim wary of the Seahorses' threat<br><br>Balestier Khalsa coach Abdul Karim Razzak will not allow complacency to creep into his players when his high-flying Tigers take on the leagueÂ’s bottom side Paya Lebar Punggol this Friday.<br><br>Â“Despite their league position, Paya Lebar are not an easy side to beat. I believe it will be a very tight match this Friday and it is important for us to score the first goal.<br><br>Â“Moreover, Paya Lebar have no pressure on them whereas all the pressure is on us to get the three points. Therefore, there is simply no room for complacency.Â”<br><br>Initially tipped at the start of the season to struggle together with the Seahorses, Balestier has now become the leagueÂ’s surprise package which has seen them looking down on some of the more illustrious clubs.<br><br>However, the Balestier locomotive had been slowing down in the past week when they first found themselves knocked out of the RHB Singapore Cup by SAFFC and then lost their league match 1-3 at the Young Lions, but Karim does not believe that the defeats will derail their season.<br><br>Â“Strictly speaking, you canÂ’t say that we lost two games last week - I did not consider the cup game against SAFFC as a defeat because it is just a one-off game.<br><br>Â“Our problem then was that my players have not reached the stage whereby they can play two or three games within a short space of time. Even Tampines and Home United also suffered everytime they return from an AFC match.Â”<br><br>Indeed, cup distractions will not be used as an excuse this Friday after Paya Lebar saw their cup aspirations prematurely ended by a narrow 1-2 loss to Peter WitheÂ’s Indonesia U-23 team.<br><br>Currently the holders of an unwanted losing record in the S.League, Chow Kwai LamÂ’s Seahorses will want to see FridayÂ’s game as being worth more than just three points Â– club pride comes into play as well.<br><br>But the wily Malaysian tactician must first sort out the malaise that has been plaguing his team since day one Â– their inability to score goals.<br><br>Averaging just 0.5 goals per match and with defender Moudourou Moise being their top scorer on two goals, the magnitude of ChowÂ’s problems is pretty much evident.<br><br>However, opposite number Karim believes Paya Lebar are slowing peaking in their game and it is just a matter of time when they starting picking up points.<br><br>Â“They have improved tremendously since our previous meeting, and after watching their last game against the Indonesia U-23s last Saturday, I am even more convinced of that view.<br><br>Â“I believe that no team will ever go through a season without getting a single point Â….. I just hope that they wonÂ’t do it against us on Friday!Â”</div>
