            <div class='col-md body'>Competition: <strong>Balestier Khalsa FC vs Woodlands Wellington FC </strong><br>Date &amp; Time: 28 April 2005 7:30:00 PM<br>Venue: Toa Payoh<br><br>One more time. Balestier Khalsa could be dancing to this tune as a win over Woodlands Wellington on Thursday will see them go top of the S-League table for the first time in ages.<br><br>The air in the Balestier camp is one of optimism. Said assistant coach Abdul Karim: Â“We have already beaten last yearÂ’s champions and defending champions. Definitely we are motivated.<br><br>Â“However, positions in the table never really bother us. We just plan to take one game at a time. LetÂ’s wait till October or September before we look at the table.Â”<br><br>But he remains cautious of a Rams rebound. Woodlands Wellington will want to return to winning ways after last weekÂ’s 0-4 drubbing by Home United.<br><br>Â“Woodlands will be definitely looking to bounce back. But, we are going to do our normal work, roll up our sleeves, dig our heels in and go for a win.Â”<br><br>The optimism could also be felt over at the Woodlands camp.<br><br>Club manager Lawrence Lau believes that last SundayÂ’s poor show will not continue against the Tigers.<br><br>He said: Â“The defeat against Home United had been exaggerated. We have moved on and are preparing for our next game. Our boys are professionals so we aim to win our next game.Â”<br><br>The return of the mercurial midfielder Ahmad Latiff, who missed last SundayÂ’s match through suspension, will be a boost to his side.<br><br>Said Lau: "LatiffÂ’s return will be a big boost to us. His pace and ability was missed last Sunday. With him, the team definitely can rise to the occasion at Toa Payoh.Â”<br><br>The maverick will definitely provide penetrative abilities to the RamsÂ’ midfield and give them the spark of creativity needed.<br><br>With both teams are currently separated by only two points and with the Tigers in top form at the moment, the match looks to be pretty evenly contested.<br><br>And that would make for an intriguing clash at the Toa Payoh stadium this Thursday. Not least for the Balestier fans.<br><br>You can almost hear them singing now: One more time...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Competition: <strong>Paya Lebar Punggol FC vs Albirex Niigata FC (S) </strong><br>Date &amp; Time: 28 April 2005 7:30:00 PM<br>Venue: Hougang<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â“We will try every game for our first points!Â”</span><br><br>That was what coach Chow Kwai Lam vowed after seeing his ten-man side, narrowly go down to Tampines Rovers at the Tampines Stadium.<br><br>Then, it was promising to see the Seahorses providing a far stiffer challenge to their opponents than before.<br><br>However, three weeks since, Paya Lebar have yet notched up a point on the table, nor have they even scored a goal since a narrow 2-3 loss to Sinchi FC in the third week of the season; and that means a whopping 360 minute Â– not including time added on Â– goal drought.<br><br>This trend is set to continue today as they again start without main forward, Megouna Protais who got himself needlessly sent off early on in the game against the Stags.<br><br>Without Protais, the Seahorses are left with only S. Senthilan as their out and out forward, and it is hard to see the 23-year-old striker troubling the Albirex defense-line.<br><br>After all, even with Senthilan possessing the requisite pace, he does not have the physical presence to unsettle the White SwansÂ’ defence; all of whom have a distinct weight and height advantage over him.<br><br>Add to that the lack of support from his other teammates coming forward, it will be an uphill battle for Senthilan and his strike partner Â– whoever coach Chow picks to be his makeshift collaborator.<br><br>Albirex on the other hand will look forward to this game for some reprieve after a trying fortnight in the league.<br><br>The high of grabbing a draw against reigning champions Tampiones and subsequently a thumping defeat of Home United, gave way to a new low for the White Swans, with a defeat against SAFFC following another loss to Woodlands Wellington over the past two weeks.<br><br>Four points out of a possible twelve in the past fours games has seen Albirex drop to third from bottom, four points adrift of clubs in mid-table, and dangerously close to fellow-foreign side Sinchi FC two points further back.<br><br>Any slip-up may be dear as Sinchi may be able to slip above them in the standings.<br><br>Third-from-bottom is definitely an unacceptable position for the Japanese side which has potential in their ranks to do much better than they have shown.<br><br>Albirex should come away with three points tomorrow night, but they will have to take points off better teams Â– and soon too Â– to have any chance of their targeted top-three finish.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Competition: <strong>Tampines Rovers FC vs Home United FC </strong><br>Date &amp; Time: 29 April 2005 7:00:00 PM<br>Venue: Tampines<br><br>Muratovic return to tip clash of the titans?<br><br>Without him, Tampines Rovers still set the pace for much of the first round. So how much more can the defending champions do now that they have their best defender Sead Muratovic back?<br><br>Potentially, a lot. Although the Stags have been churning out results in his absence, his command of the defence and thunderous freekicks have been sorely missed.<br><br>Not surprisingly, coach Vorawan Chitavanich has said that the 26-year-old will be pencilled into the first-team after finally passing his Beep test.<br><br>Muratovic, the stylish Serb, has also been fitter, shedding several kilogrammes in his attempts to meet the mandatory Beep test mark of 12-6.<br><br>So, theoretically, just imagine Muratovic, that composed figure in defence but faster and fitter than circa 2004's and possibly even the previous years'.<br><br>With him back, last seasonÂ’s Young Player of the Year Mustafic Fahrudin can be moved up to augment the midfield.<br><br>It is another option that Vorawan will welcome with open arms. For he has been bothered with opponents starting to pack their defence against his side.<br><br>He said: Â“This season, when teams play against Tampines, they tend to be more defensive. They are giving us much less space and are definitely more cautious.<br><br>Â“We are playing with more confidence, but this confidence is a double-edged sword. On the other hand, we must not be over-confident and underestimate weaker opponents.Â”<br><br>As such, Vorawan paid the respect reserved for a worthy opponent. He said: Â“Home is a very strong team with a lot of experienced players. Although we have beaten them at home last season, they are always very difficult to play against.Â”<br><br>Home will continue to play without Thai international Sutee Susomkit, who is expected to be out for another month due to a reported ankle injury.<br><br>His absence has given ex-international Azhar Baksin the chance to reinstate his place.<br><br>Last week, Azhar gave one of his best performances since returning from a double knee operation against Woodlands Wellington and was bestowed the S-League.com Man-of-the-Match award in that 4-0 win.<br><br>While the Rams were ripped apart by the Protectors with relative ease, expect the Stags to put up a much more resilient defence. With a partisan home crowd behind them, Vorawan expects a good performance from the Stags. He said: Â“I am confident of at least a draw.Â”<br><br>Last season, Home United chased Tampines all the way until the Stags finally sealed their historic first-ever league title. In this very fixture last term, Tampines defeated the Protectors 2-1 in a high tempo match, en route to winning the title. In retrospect, that victory must have been one of the StagsÂ’ most crucial.<br><br>This season, both teams had experienced somewhat different fortunes.<br><br>The Stags picked up from where they left off last season and charged ahead in the standings early on with five wins in their first six games. The hiccup at Toa Payoh Stadium last week had been the only botch in TampinesÂ’ otherwise near-perfect domestic season.<br><br>On the other hand, the boys from Bishan had only found their winning touch recently. However, with two straight domestic victories, the Protectors are beginning to erase memories of their jittery start and propelled themselves straight back into the race to the title.<br><br>Tampines will return to top spot with just a point. Will it happen? We're not so sure.<br><br>What we're more certain of: Somewhere in Bishan, Steve Darby is shaking his head at his monitor as he reads this.</div>
