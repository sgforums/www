            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: blue;">United make their play for top spot</span></span></strong><br><br>Despite their patchy form in domestic competitions, Manchester United FC will bring an unbeaten record against French opposition in European competitions into their top of the table clash against Olympique Lyonnais on matchday five. In seven meetings to date against French clubs, United have won five and drawn two.<br><br>Opening day goalscorers at the Stade Gerland, Cris and Ruud van Nistelrooij, battle for possession<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Frequent visitors</span></strong><br><br>The last two seasons in which United have faced French opponents in European club competitions, they have done so twice in one season. In 1999/2000, United played Olympique de Marseille and FC Girondins de Bordeaux at different stages in the competition, while a similar occurrence took place in 2001/02 when Sir Alex Ferguson's side played both LOSC Lille MÃ©tropole and FC Nantes Atlantique. Old Trafford has been a fortress on all four occasions with home successes for the home side, their last match being their most conclusive as Nantes were handed a 5-1 defeat after having had the audacity of taking the lead through FrÃ©dÃ©ric da Rocha. United hit back through David Beckham, Ole Gunnar SolskjÃ¦r (2), MikaÃ«l Silvestre and Ruud van Nistelrooij.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Van Nistelrooij double</span></strong><br><br>For Lyon, they have faced English opposition on five occasions to date in UEFA competitions, and Paul Le Guen's side will be eager to put their opening day draw against United at the Stade Gerland to the back of their minds. Two goals ahead at the break through Cris and Pierre-Alain Frau, Lyon came unstuck during the second half as two goals from Ruud van Nistelrooij around the hour mark salvaged a point for Sir Alex Ferguson's side.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Arsenal held</span></strong><br><br>Lyon's trip to England will only be their second in the UEFA Champions League having faced Arsenal FC in the 2000/01 season at the second group stage. Arsenal left Lyon with a 1-0 victory thanks to their French international striker Thierry Henry, while at Highbury eight days later, both teams shared two goals with Dennis Bergkamp's 33rd minute goal cancelled out by Edmilson's last-gasp equaliser. Both sides would end the group stage on eight points, five behind FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen, but Arsenal advanced thanks to their better record in head-to-head engagements against Lyon.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One victory</span></strong><br><br>On their travels to England, Lyon have won one match, draw once and lost twice. That single victory came in the first round of the 1998/99 UEFA Cup against Blackburn Rovers FC when Jacek Bak's 86th-minute goal provided the French side with an advantage they would keep in the return leg two weeks later when they shared four goals with their English opponents, before ultimately losing to Bologna FC in the quarter-finals of the competition.</div>

Sir Alex FergusonÂ’s achievement is quite remarkable given the fickle nature of football fans and more importantly football boards in the modern game. To manage a single club through the highs and lows of 1000 football matches, amongst the elite of the game, must take itÂ’s toll, and yet Fergie shows no signs of packing it in yet.<br><br>He tried to retire a few years back, and just couldnÂ’t do it remember, so expect him to match Sir Matt BusbyÂ’s United record of 1068, and just keep on going. Added to his 700 or so games in Scotland, Sir Alex Ferguson has managed more matches then anyone in the British game, including the likes of Brian Clough and Dario Gradi. He truly is one of the legends of the game, and like him or loathe him it is difficult not to respect him.<br><br>It is against this backdrop that United welcome Lyon to Old Trafford for an enticing tie. It is almost appropriate that is on a special European night, when the atmosphere is that bit sharper and Fergie himself comes that little bit more to life, that this landmark is reached.<br><br>The game itself however, cannot be overlooked for a second. Lyon showed in going 2-0 up against United earlier this season that they are not to be messed with. That they lead the group, and if they avoid defeat will probably top the league proves they cannot be taken lightly.<br><br>The sophisticated French side, led by the imperious Juninho, will be out to confirm their growing reputation on Tuesday night. They may have fallen victim to a second half Ruud Van Nistelrooy rescue act, but proved that they have the ability to take it to the top teams. Had it not been for an unbelievable miss by Nilmar then they certainly would have taken the three points at home.<br><br>The game is the group decider, two attacking teams, one goals, it may not have the profile of a Barca-Milan or a Juve-Bayern, but it is certain to be just as entertaining.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: blue;">Fergie: Players Must Be Adaptable In Europe</span></span></strong><br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson admits his team were thrown off guard by Olympique LyonnaisÂ’ in SeptemberÂ’s clash with the French champions.<br><br>A stunned United trailed Lyonnais 2-0 at the break two months ago Â– the Reds caught out by the speed of their opponentÂ’s attacking play.<br><br>Ferguson has counselled his players on the unpredictability of European football, adding that the ability to adapt to tactical changes during a game is an essential ingredient in the Champions League.<br><br>"They did surprise us," Sir Alex told Manchester United Radio ahead of the game. "I keep telling the players about this experience in European football Â– itÂ’s that experience of the roof falling in on you. IÂ’ve had it many times and so have the players.<br><br>"You can watch the [opposition] team, give your players details about how they play - a complete run-down, a synopsis of how you expect them perform. But they can change on the night. ItÂ’s a different game Â– tactically they can change.<br><br>"Over in Lyon they certainly surprised us. The speed of their attack was very good. Their performance against us was nothing like how they play in their league games. We are aware of that now, but it took 45 minutes for us to get to grips with that in Lyon.<br><br>"Lyon surprised us. You can [scout] the opposition, give your players details about how they play - a complete synopsis of how you expect them to perform. But they can change on the night."<br><br>"Once we did, we were okay. We werenÂ’t brilliant but we were okay. I think both teams had opportunities to win it late on. They hit the post and missed an absolute sitter. And we had chances as well."<br><br>A win on Tuesday will put United on 11 points in Group D and through to the knockout phase of the competition. A point against Lyon would see the Reds needing a draw in Turkey against Fenerbahce to progress. But Ferguson will target top spot at Old Trafford this week.<br><br>"We expect Lyon to attack us because that is the strongest part of their game," he said. "But the initial target has always been to get to ten points. If we win against Lyon then it puts us in a strong position to win the group."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: purple;">Preview - Manu vs Lyon </span></span><br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson has admitted he regards Manchester United's two European Cup wins as inadequate given the Old Trafford club's standing in the world game.<br><br>Going right back to his time at Aberdeen, the lure of European combat has always given Ferguson an added thrill, so it is fitting his 1000th game in charge of United should be in the Champions League.<br><br>Yet it remains a major source of disappointment that despite reaching the quarter-finals seven times on the trot from 1997, United have added to their 1968 triumph under Sir Matt Busby just once, on that never-to-be-forgotten night in Barcelona six seasons ago when victory over Bayern Munich saw the club the lift the prestigious Champions League trophy.<br><br>It leaves the Red Devils two titles adrift of Bayern Munich, Ajax and Liverpool, four behind AC Milan and a massive seven away from the undisputed European kings Real Madrid.<br><br>And that is a statistic Ferguson will devote the remainder of his career to rectifying.<br><br>``Some of the greatest moments I have had here have been European matches, so to mark my 1000th match as manager with a Champions League tie is just perfect,'' said Ferguson, who will celebrate his 63rd birthday on New Years' Eve.<br><br>``Anyone of my age brought up in Scotland watching European football will never forget the night back in 1960 when Real Madrid beat Eintracht Frankfurt 7-3 at Hampden Park.<br><br>``After that you have a dream of being in a European Cup and playing against the great teams.<br><br>It's only since the advent of the Champions League that you have all these teams together in one competition but that has just made it harder to win.<br><br>``Even so, I think it's a fact that in terms of the general history of our club we should expect to have won it the same number of times as the likes of Ajax, Bayern and AC Milan.<br><br>``I divorce Real Madrid from this scenario purely because the number of times they have won it is quite exceptional.<br><br>``But certainly for the other powers in Europe there is no reason why we should not be thinking of winning it the same number of times.''<br><br>Victory over Lyon on Tuesday will ensure United's customary progress into the knock-out phase, while even a draw would do providing Ferguson's side managed to avoid a four-goal drubbing by Fenerbahce in their final group outing on December 8.<br><br>However, given the significance of the night, the Red Devils will want to mark the occasion with a performance to remember.<br><br>Lyon, meanwhile, are top of Ligue 1 and are unbeaten in the league with nine wins from their 15 matches so far.<br><br>However, Paul Le Guen's team were frustrated on Friday night as they were unable to break down 10-man Paris St Germain in a goalless draw at the Parcdes Princes.<br><br>Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas has confirmed the fixture at Old Trafford will be a special occasion for Les Gones, who are looking for their fourth consecutive domestic title.<br><br>``It is a dream that will be realised on Tuesday,'' Aulas told L'Equipe on Monday.<br><br>``To play at Old Trafford when you are top of the group and trying to stay there makes it an immense occasion.<br><br>``We feel they are solid, cool under pressure, and know how to adapt themselves when they are in difficulty. It will be necessary to show respect because they score a lot of goals at their place.''<br><br>Lyon striker Sidney Govou believes that Lyon have nothing to fear from their trip. ``They have more experience than us, but we will go over there without a complex, and knowing that it is possible (to get something),'' he said.<br><br>``You have to approach every game thinking that you can win, and Manchester United is no different.''<br><br>Midfielder Florent Malouda added: ``You have to try not to focus too much on the opposition. We need to concentrate on the match and then analyse things afterwards.''<br><br>Former Arsenal forward Sylvain Wiltord made his first appearance since the end of October when he played for 75 minutes at PSG on Friday. The striker seems to have shaken off a right thigh injury, and is expected to play a part in Manchester. </strong></div>
