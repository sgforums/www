            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Birmingham v Rovers preview</strong><br><br>Blackburn RoversInevitably much of the focus has been on Robbie Savage ahead of Blackburn's trip to Birmingham on Saturday.<br><br>Savage left Blues for Rovers in typically acrimonious fashion - and the former have insisted Blackburn honour a gentleman's agreement not to play the combative midfielder in the game.<br><br>The decision is understandable considering the relative positions of the two teams in the league table.<br><br>Both started the season with aspirations of playing European football next year - but Birmingham have never really got their season started and Rovers have only just moved clear of the relegation dogfight - thanks mainly to a renaissance since Mark Hughes took over as manager.<br><br>Birmingham are now two points behind Blackburn and depriving them of their star midfielder seems a straightforward proposition.<br><br>Hughes and Steve Bruce are old Manchester United colleagues, but there will be no love lost in the chase for higher league position and better prize<br>money.<br><br>Birmingham are still without former Rovers star David Dunn, who is out for the rest of the season and Muzzy Izzet is also a long-term absentee.<br><br>Doubts remain over the fitness of Jamie Clapham who is recovering from a gashed foot and Julian Gray is recuperating from a calf strain.<br><br>Blackburn are waiting on Paul Dickov's fitness but will be hopeful that their top-scorer can feature - whilst the match has come too soon for Jay Bothroyd.</div>
