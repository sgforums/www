            <div class='col-md body'><strong>PLAYER TO WATCH:<br><br>Man United : Roy Carroll </strong><br><br>Roy Carroll is yet to sign a new contract at the club, and is likely to be put up for sale in January. Ferguson is aware that he needs to raise funds for any transfers next summer and so is unlikely to let the player leave for free. CarrollÂ’s refusal to sign a contract is strange, and is apparently based around his belief that he will never be fully considered as the number 1 at the club. The likes of Sebastian Frey and Carlo Cudicini have been linked with moves to the club, and Roy Carroll needs to stamp out any Lyon type mistakes if he is to really claim the jersey as his own.<br><br><strong>Southampton : Rory Delap </strong><br><br>Delap is a solid performer in the Southampton side and his two goals at Arsenal show that he can do it on the big day. Needs another showing like that at Highbury if he is to help his team get a share of the spoils.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>TEAM NEWS:<br><br>Man United :</strong><br><br>Louis Saha and Kleberson are the only United absentees, and so Ferguson is likely to field the same, or similar side that has featured in the last few league matches.<br><br><strong>Southampton: </strong><br><br>Antti Niemi has recovered from the knee injury that has sidelined him over the past couple of months. Kasey Keller could remain in goal for this one though. James Beattie is back from a calf strain and should lead the attack with Phillips. Lundekvam has recovered from a virus.</div>

Paul Scholes is scoring, Giggs is starting to play well, the back line looks solid, confidence is peaking.

Giving Norwich their first win of the campaign is one of a number of inauspicious lows so far. Things donÂ’t look as though they will get any better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Prem Preview : Man United-Southampton</strong><br><br>The countdown to Christmas has begun and Sir Alex Ferguson will be hoping that his team get into the festive mood a little early with a good win against visiting Southampton.<br><br><strong>BACKGROUND </strong><br><br>Manchester United are moving into form, Southampton have been having an awful struggle at the wrong end of the table. Is it possible that they are to re-invent the role of cannon fodder?<br><br>A phenomenon once seen six or seven times a season at Old Trafford, a small, supposedly established Premiership team, arrives in Manchester revealing to the media that the United players are great and that it is an honour to be playing on such a big stage. They would then proceed to go and make a hash of things on the pitch, be completely outplayed and concede a hatful of goals in the process.<br><br>This has been a scarce commodity over the last few years. But with six wins on the bounce, and against a Southampton team treading water, it could be about to re-emerge.<br><br>So what does poor Steve Wigley do about it all? IÂ’m not entirely sure there is much he can do. WeÂ’ve all see him on the television, softly spoken, probably a thoroughly nice bloke, but he just doesnÂ’t inspire all that much confidence does he? A team going to get something at Old Trafford needs to be fired up just the right amount, needs to be inspired to go to greater lengths, run that bit faster, jump that bit higher, tackle that bit harder. And that all comes from the manager. A Gordon Strachan, now thereÂ’s someone to fiery the heart of young athlete, but Steve Wigley, IÂ’m not so sure.<br><br>Is that it then? Is the match done and dusted. Of course not. This is football after all, that most inaccurate of sciences. The FA Cup second round takes place simultaneously on Saturday, but the shock of the day would surely come if Southampton turned over Man United.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Man Utd vs Southampton preview</strong><br><br>Southampton have been boosted by the return of three key players for the daunting trip to Manchester United.<br><br>Steve Wigley has a difficult decision over whether to recall fit-again Antti Niemi as Kasey Keller has deputised effectively in the Finn's absence - but the signs are suggesting the latter will keep his place.<br><br>On-loan Keller has performed superbly at Old Trafford during his time with Tottenham and is tipped to keep the Finn on the sidelines.<br><br>James Beattie (calf) and Claus Lundekvam (virus) are also available again with Dexter Blackstock likely to make way for Beattie. Kevin Phillips will be keen to partner Beattie after scoring twice in the fixture last season.<br><br>Marian Pahars made his comeback in the reserves in midweek but is still a few games away from a first team recall. Michael Svensson, Neil McCann and Matt Oakley are also still missing.<br><br>Former Red devil Danny Higginbotham must be determined to have another chance to try and show United were wrong to let him go.<br><br>In-form United have won 11 and drawn one of their 12 home Premiership games against Southampton and star striker Ruud van Nistelrooy has bagged six goals in six league games against Saints.<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson will make sweeping changes to the shadow side that edged past Arsenal in the Carling Cup quarter finals in midweek, although Wes Brown should retain his place.<br><br>The Scot was impressed with the performance at West Brom last weekend and will resist making too many changes although Darren Fletcher's midfield slot could be under threat. Liam Miller was impressive against Arsenal and Alan Smith is always another starting option. Cristiano Ronaldo, who was on the bench last weekend, is also in the frame.<br><br>Disappointing Brazilian Kleberson was stretchered off on Wednesday and Louis Saha is still sidelined after picking up an injury whilst on international duty with France.<br><br>Ryan Giggs, who has scored more Premiership goals against Southampton than any other team (7 in 19 games), should start after being involved in all three of the goals at The Hawthorns. The Welshman, linked with a move to Newcastle United in Friday's press, can expect to play in his usual left wing role.</div>

Only eight of the 20 clubs competing in the top League this season are Premiership ever-presents, and the clubs in combat at Old Trafford are two of them. The match pits United, the most prolific winners and biggest scorers (946 goals) against Saints, who have lost more Premiership matches (20<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> and conceded more goals (693) than any other club. United are unbeaten at home in the top League this season - Southampton are yet to win away.<br><br>United have won their last six games in all competitions, including Wednesday's Carling Cup Quarter-final, home to Arsenal. They've lost just once in 23 League and Cup games and are chasing a fourth maximum on the spin in the Premiership. They're becoming a threat once again for the title, and victory here could see the so-called big three, Chelsea, Arsenal and the Red devils filling the top three League places in the country by Saturday night.<br><br>United hold an unbeaten home Premiership record against Southampton and are chasing a fifth successive Old Trafford win against them. Ruud van Nistelrooy bagged his first hat trick for the Red devils in the 6-1 victory on 22 December 2001.<br><br><strong>SOUTHAMPTON</strong> are back in the relegation zone, just two points off the foot, as they prepare for the trip to the Theatre of Dreams. Under pressure manager Steve Wigley knows that defeat could see his side at the foot for the first time this season, but conversely victory might lift them four places in a tight bottom seven.<br><br>Saints have made their worst start in six years to a Premiership campaign. They've won just two League games and one in the last 13 outings. The 2-1 home victory over local rivals Portsmouth is their only maximum since Wigley was appointed head coach. They've managed just two points on their travels, but those came from draws at Charlton at Arsenal.<br><br>Louis Saha scored on his Manchester United debut in last season's corresponding fixture. Paul Scholes added a second, but Saints drew level courtesy of a Kevin Phillips brace. Ruud van Nistelrooy won it on the hour with his 99th goal for the Old Trafford outfit. Southampton have lost 14 and drawn two of their 16 League trips to the Theatre of Dreams. Their only victory in 31 League engagements on United turf spanning 33 years was 0-2 in the top flight on 16 January 1988.</div>
