            <div class='col-md body'>Competition: <strong>Woodlands Wellington FC vs Tampines Rovers SC </strong><br>Date &amp; Time: 7 May 2005 7:30:00 PM<br>Venue: Woodlands<br><br>Showtime for S-League aspirants Tampines Rovers SC<br><br>They have made their intentions clear of joining the S-League. What better way for Tampines Rovers SC to prove themselves on Saturday night when they face a weakened Woodlands Wellington side.<br><br>With Woodlands playing their second match in four days and having four S-League players out, it has paved the way for amateur outfit Tampines to claim the scalp of an S-League side.<br><br>Although there may be tired legs amongst the ranks of the Rams, coach Karim Bencherifa cannot afford to rest any of his players due to injuries to several others.<br><br>He said: Â“I cannot give any of my players a break. If you watched our last game, I had only 10 S-League players that I can use. The rest are from the Prime League.<br><br>Â“We have injuries in our squad now. Gusta Guzarishah is out injured and Jaslee Hatta will be out for six to eight weeks. Our two foreigners are out also.Â”<br><br>While coach Karim may not have the depth in squad to rotate his squad, they have the undoubted quality.<br><br>With the likes of Daniel Bennett, Goh Tat Chuan and Ahmad Latiff Khamarudin, Tampines, the NFL Division One side, will have their work cut out.<br><br>While Woodlands come into this match after a heavy 3-0 defeat in the S-League, Tampines earned themselves a morale-boosting 4-1 win over Police SA last week.<br><br>Not surprisingly, Bencherifa was at the game to gather intelligence for this Singapore Cup clash.<br><br>Although the Moroccan coach does not underestimate the NFL outfit, he wants his team to put up a solid performance and earn a good result.<br><br>He said: Â“It is important to get a good win. A comfortable win will allow us to build on it for our next league game.Â”<br><br>A comfortable win will also give any side a psychological advantage for the quarterfinals of the Singapore Cup should Woodlands Wellington or Tampines advance.<br><br>Last year, the Rams only managed to get to the quarterfinals as they were stopped in their tracks by Geylang United. The Eastern side beat them over two-legs to deprive the Rams of a semi-final place.<br><br>The NFL side's involvement in last yearÂ’s Singapore Cup was restricted to just one match as they crashed 4-1 to Sinchi despite putting up a brave performance.<br><br>Tampines will certainly want to see themselves go beyond the first round this time and prove their mettle against the big boys of the S-League. And for that, Woodlands Wellington better not expect it easy from them.</div>
