            <div class='col-md body'><strong>All to play for in Stuttgart</strong><br><br>Two sides on the cusp of qualifying for the knockout stage meet at the Gottlieb-Daimler stadium as VfB Stuttgart host NK Dinamo Zagreb for the second time in UEFA club competitions.<br><br><strong>Stuttgart success</strong><br><br>The clubs were paired together in the second round of the 1989/90 UEFA Cup, and Stuttgart took the lead at Zagreb with a 3-1 win thanks to goals from current German national coach JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann, Fritz Walter and Michael SchrÃ¶der, who took them to a 3-0 lead before home forward Drazen Bezek grabbed a consolation. In the return leg, Radmilo Mihajlovic closed the gap even further with a 62nd minute goal before Walter eased Stuttgart worries with an equaliser six minutes later, as Stuttgart advanced 4-2 on aggregate. The Germans reached the final where they lost to Diego MaradonaÂ’s SSC Napoli 5-4 on aggregate.<br><br><strong>Mixed fortunes</strong><br><br>Stuttgart have played two other Croatian teams in UEFA club competitions. In 1981/82 the Germans were eliminated by HNK Hajduk Split from the UEFA Cup at the first round stage by 5-2 on aggregate, while in 2002, Stuttgart advanced to the finals of the UEFA Intertoto Cup after winning both games against FK Slaven Koprivnica in the semi-final. Two goals from Thomas Schneider gave Stuttgart a 2-1 home win, and Sean Dundee scored the only goal of the return leg, as Stuttgart went on to beat LOSC Lille MÃ©tropole in their final. The German side defend an unbeaten home record of one win and two draws against Croatian clubs, and an overall record of three wins, two draws and one loss in their six previous games.<br><br><strong>Dinamo defeats</strong><br><br>But Dinamo have yet to beat a German club in UEFA club competitions. The Croatians have lost their three previous ties, where the six games have produced two draws and four defeats. Besides the games with Stuttgart, Dinamo lost both legs to FC Schalke 04 by 3-1 and 1-0 in the quarter-finals of the 1969/70 UEFA Cup, while their other meeting was with a club then based in the German Democratic Republic, namely 1. FC Magdeburg. The two sides met in the second round of the 1976/77 UEFA Cup, and after losing the first leg 2-0 in Magdeburg, the Croatians were held 2-2 at home despite two goals from Zlatko Kranjcar. The former striker is now the Croatian national team coach, while his son is the current Dinamo captain.<br><br><strong>State of play: Group G </strong><br><br>SL Benfica have qualified and VfB Stuttgart will follow them through if they avoid defeat at home to NK Dinamo Zagreb. The German side could lose and still advance if SC Heerenveen fail to win at home to KSK Beveren, who are already out. Dinamo are ahead of Heerenveen on goal difference and are sure to qualify if they match the Dutch club's result against Beveren. A draw will take Heerenveen through should Dinamo lose.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>First place targeted</strong><br><br>Â“It is important for the players to know that they are fit, but every game starts at 0-0,Â” said VfB coach Matthias Sammer at todayÂ’s press conference ahead of the UEFA Cup match against Dinamo Zagreb in the Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion on Wednesday even, after seeing his side take a 2-2 draw from the trip to FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen on Saturday. Nonetheless Sammer is certain that the performance in the Olympiastadion has boosted his playersÂ’ confidence ahead of the final game of 2004, but also warned his players from resting on the laurels earned in a different competition. Â“We are in a comfortable situation, but I donÂ’t want to hear anybody saying that the match on Wednesday is already in the bank or that Bayern are a much better side than Dinamo Zagreb. We will have to repeat the good performance we showed in the Olympiastadion and confirm our run of form,Â” said Sammer, warning his players that the Croatian side shouldnÂ’t be underestimated.<br>Soldo definitely out<br><br>Sammer continued to admit that the match against FC Bayern was special for his side and Â„took a huge amount of concentration,Â“ but also stated that his players had put the Bundesliga behind them now and were concentrating on their chance of achieving something in a different competition. Â“I am happy that the game will be on Wednesday and not on Tuesday. That gives us enough time to recover. If any player has got a problem motivating himself, which I donÂ’t expect, then I wouldnÂ’t at all be able to understand it,Â” said Sammer before adding that the match against Zagreb was very important and that he was keeping a close eye on his playersÂ’ performances in training. Elsewhere Sammer will definitely not see Zvonimir Soldo return to full team training before the match on Wednesday. The midfielder has been able to train lightly, but he wonÂ’t be fit in time for the match against his former club.<br><br><strong>Hleb, Meira and Szabics doubtful </strong><br><br>Alexander Hleb is also having to take things a bit slower after the match in Munich. The VfB playmaker is suffering from Achilles tendon problems, but Sammer believes that the medical staff will be able to get him fit in time for the match on Wednesday. Fernando Meira, who missed the match in Munich due to a back problem, should also be able to return and striker Imre Szabics is also expected to recover from a cold. Both Meira and Szabics want to train with the side later this afternoon. Marco Streller is the only other absentee along side Soldo, as he is still recovering from a broken leg, with all of the other players ready for action. Stand-in captain Silvio MeiÃŸner is also fit and received some warm words from Sammer for his performance in the Olympiastadion. Â“He played brilliantly and is a very important player. Meise is respected by the whole team and therefore he has the right to speak out. His performances are well documented by the goals he scores and sets up,Â” said the VfB coach.<br><br><strong>"We know what to expect" </strong><br><br>Elsewhere Sammer insisted that he knows what to expect against Zagreb after having the Croatians watched on numerous occasions. Â“I have got enough information and will take a closer look at a few more things. After that I will decide on our approach, because sometimes small things decide matches at this level,Â” said Sammer, refusing to comment on whether he will return to a back four or look to a three man defence like he did on Saturday once again. The VfB coach described Dinamo as a skilful side that plays as a tight unit and has been disciplined by new coach Ilija Loncarevic. Â“They are capable of turning out outstanding displays. Therefore we know exactly what to expect, but I am still optimistic that we will win our group. We have targeted winning the group, even though we all realise the unexpected can happen on Wednesday. Hopefully that wonÂ’t happen and we will still be in the competition in the new year,Â” said Sammer. Elsewhere the VfB coach will be kept up to date on the score in Heerenveen, but insisted, Â“It is professional to know the score of the other game, but we will have to concentrate on our own game.Â”</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Interesting facts on the game</strong><br><br>Spanish referee: Eduardo Iturralde Gonzales from Spain will be in charge of the match. He will be assisted by his compatriots Rafael Guerrero Alsonso and Carlos AndrÃ©s Lopez Villate. The fourth official is also from Spain and his called Javier Turienzo Alvarez.<br>One defeat: The match against Dinamo Zagreb will be VfBÂ’s fourth tie against an opponent from Croatia. Back in the 1981/82 season VfB were knocked out of the UEFA Cup by Hajduk Split after a 3-1 defeat and a 2-2. In 1988/89 VfB came up against Dinamo Zagreb in the second round of the UEFA Cup and qualified for the third round after a 3-1 win and a 1-1 draw. Back in 1989 VfB went all the way into the UEFA Cup final. VfB last came up against a side from Croatia in the 2002/03 UEFA Intertoto Cup campaign. VfB took on NK Slaven Belupo and won twice (2-1, 1-0).<br><br>36,000 tickets sold: Once again the crowd will flock to the Gottllieb-Daimler-Stadion for the last game of 2004. So far 36,000 tickets for the match against Dinamo have been sold. The remaining tickets can be purchased from the VfB main office (MercedesstraÃŸe 109, 70372 Stuttgart, Mo. Â– Fr. 08.30 CET Â– 17.30 CET) and from the ticket offices at the stadium that will open at 12:00 CET on Wednesday.<br><br>Draw on Friday: If VfB reach the third round of the UEFA Cup they will be handed their next opponent on Friday, December 17 2004. The draw will start at 13:45 CET. The group winners will be handed a team that finished third in the group stage, whereas the second placed sides in each group will take on one of the eight teams that finished third in the their UEFA Champions League groups. Two teams from the same country can not be paired against each other in the third round.<br><br>MeiÃŸner facing suspension: If VfB midfielder Silvio MeiÃŸner picks up a yellow card in the match against Dinamo Zagreb he will have to sit out the first leg in the next round. MeiÃŸner has already been booked twice in the competition this season and a third yellow would lead to a one match suspension. Dinamo midfielder Jasmin Agic is already acquainted with the rule. He will miss the match in the Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion after picking up his third booking in the match against SV Heerenveen.</div>
