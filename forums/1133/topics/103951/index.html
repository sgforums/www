            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: green;">Ajax desperate to revive flagging fortunes</span></span></strong><br><br>AFC Ajax travel to Turin to face the already-qualified Juventus FC more in hope than expectation as victory may be required against one of only two teams to have won all four matches to date in this season's UEFA Champions League if the Dutch side are to advance past the group stage of the competition.<br><br>Two Pavel Nedved goals in four outings have provided Juventus FC with six points in this season's UEFA Champions League<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Familiar foes</span></strong><br><br>Both teams are familiar foes having met in European club competitions on nine occasions to date, a record among all the teams drawn together in the 2004/05 Champions League stage. But the sides most memorable occasions have come in two final meetings, the first coming in their first ever clash in UEFA competition when Ajax won the 1972/73 final with a fifth-minute goal from Johnny Rep.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Revenge</span></strong><br><br>All of 23 years later, the sides met again in their second final, but this time Juventus exacted revenge after extra-time and penalties. Fabrizio Ravanelli put Juve ahead after 12 minutes of the contest held at Rome's Olimpico stadium, but Jari Litmanen levelled five minutes from the break and neither team added to their tally leaving penalties to decided the winner. Vladimir Jugovic ensured that Juve won, scoring their fourth penalty en route to a 4-2 success after Edgar Davids and Sonny Silooy had missed their spot-kicks.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ajax struggling</span></strong><br><br>But the 2004/05 season has been a struggle for the Dutch side. Having lost matches to each of their group rivals, Ronald Koeman's side have only three points from four outings, level with Maccabi Tel-Aviv FC their conquerors on matchday four, but only three points behind FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen, whom they meet in Amsterdam on the final matchday.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Economical Juventus</span></strong><br><br>Juve, meanwhile, have won each of their four matches by the narrowest margin without conceding a goal. Economical in terms of goalscoring despite having former Ajax striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic in their ranks, Fabio Capello's side will look to continue the momentum of their efficient performances into the post-Christmas knockout phase.</div>

Also the bianconeri will also have their heads on next SundayÂ’s clash against Inter in Milan.<br><br>On the other hand, Ajax desperately need the three points to still stand a chance of qualifying to the next stage. A win would at worst keep the Dutch side three points away from Bayern Munich and the qualification will be decided in the direct encounter in the last match day.<br><br>However, Fabio Capello has already stated that the Old Lady will not give Ajax any favour and KoemanÂ’s side will have to fight hard to earn the three points at stake. In fact, the Juve mentor will field a near full-team as he doesnÂ’t want his side to lose its second consecutive match following last FridayÂ’s Coppa Italia defeat at the hands of Serie A rock-bottom side Atalanta.<br><br>Ajax are not going through their best season in recent years as they lie in fourth place, 10 points behind leaders PSV. Still, the Amsterdam side was able to win convincingly in their last game as they defeated away from home last-placed De Graafschap 5-0.<br><br>Juventus are doing better than expected this season in all the main competitions as they have gained a 6-point advantage over second placed Milan in Serie A and another 6-point lead over Bayern Munich in the Champions League.</div>
