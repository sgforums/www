            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Valentine's Day Gift: It's the thought that counts</strong><br><br>A young man wanted to purchase a gift for his new sweetie for Valentine's Day. As they had not been dating very long, it was a very difficult decision.  After careful consideration he decided a good gift would be a pair of gloves.  Accompanied by his sister, he went to the store and bought the gloves. His sister purchased a pair of panties at the same time. The clerk carefully wrapped both items but in the process got them mixed up. The sister was handed the gloves and the young man got the panties. The young man mailed his Valentine's Day gift with the following note:  This special Valentines Day gift was chosen because I noticed you are in the habit of not wearing any when we go out in the evenings.  If it had not been for my sister, I would have chosen the ones with buttons, but she prefers short ones that are much easier to remove.  These are a lovely shade, the lady I bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and they were hardly soiled. I had her try yours on for me and they looked quite lovely.  I wish I was there to put them on you for the first time; no doubt, other hands will come into contact with them before I have a chance to see you again.  When you take them off, remember to blow on them lightly before putting them away as they will naturally be a little damp from wearing.  Just think how many times I'll be kissing them in the future. I hope you'll wear them Friday night for me.<br><br>Love,<br>Honey Bear<br><br>P.S. The sales lady says the latest style is to wear them folded down with just a little fur showing.<br><br>*************************************************************************************<br><br><strong>Genie Grants Wish</strong><br><br>Two friends were in a bar drinking a beer when one pulled out a cigar but he didn't have a lighter so he asked his friend if he had one.  "I sure do," he replied and reached into his pocket and pulled out a 10 inch Bic lighter.<br>"Wow!" said his friend, "where did you get that monster."<br>"I got it from my genie."<br>"You have a genie?" he asked.<br>"Yes, he's right here in my pocket."<br>"Could I see him?"<br>He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a very small genie.<br>The friend says, "I'm a good friend of your master. Will you grant me one wish?"<br>"Yes I will," the genie said so he asks him for a million bucks and the genie hops back into his master's pocket and leaves the man standing there waiting for his million bucks.<br>About this time, a duck walks into the bar followed by another. Then more ducks come pouring in. Before long the entire bar has ducks everywhere.<br>The friend tells his buddy, "What is going on here, I asked for a million bucks not ducks!"<br>He answers, "I forgot to tell you the genie is hard of hearing. Do you really think I asked him for a 10 inch Bic?"<br><br>*************************************************************************************<br><br><strong>Pick up Line</strong><br><br>A rather confident young man walks into a bar and takes a seat next to a very attractive young woman. He gives her a quick glance, then casually looks at his watch for a moment.<br>The woman notices this and asks, "Is your date running late?"<br>"No," he replies, "I just bought this state-of-the-art watch and I was testing it."<br>Intrigued, the woman says, "A state-of-the-art watch? What's so special about it?"<br>"It uses alpha waves to telepathically talk to me," he explains.<br>"What's it telling you now?", she asks.<br>"Well, it says that you're not wearing any panties...".<br>The woman giggles &amp; replies, "Well it must be broken then, because I am wearing panties!"<br>The man exclaims, "Damn-- this thing must be an hour fast!"<br><br>*************************************************************************************<br><br><strong>Wish Gone Wrong</strong><br><br>A man was sitting in the bar when he noticed another patron a few stools away. The guy had a body like Arnold Schwarzenegger, but his head was the size of a grapefruit.  The first man said "Excuse me for staring, but I cant help but be curious as to why your body is so well developed, but your head is so small?"<br>The man said "buy me a drink and I'll tell you." The drink was ordered and the story began.  I was in the navy and my ship was sunk by a torpedo. I was the only survivor and I managed to swim to a deserted island a few miles away. I had been there for several months and was walking on the beach one day looking for food and when I looked up I saw a beautiful mermaid sunning on a nearby rock.  She swam over to me and told me that she was a magical mermaid and could grant me three wishes.  That's great I said. I'd like to be rescued. She slapped the water with her tail and a ship appeared, sailing straight for my island.<br>Next I asked for a body like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Another slap of the tail and I was built like a Stallion.  Then, noticing how beautiful she was and only one wish left, I asked if I could make love to her. She said no it just wouldn't work her being half fish and all, so I said, "well, how about a little head then?"<br><br>*************************************************************************************<br><br><strong>A Drunk Confessional</strong><br><br>A drunk was staggering down the main street of town. Somehow he managed to make it up the stairs to the cathedral and into the building, where he crashed from pew to pew, finally making his way to a side aisle and into a confessional.<br><br>A priest had been observing the man's sorry progress and figuring that the fellow was in need of some assistance, proceeded to enter his side of the confessional. But his attention was rewarded only by a lengthy silence. Finally he asked, "May I help you, my son?"<br><br>"I dunno..." came the drunk's voice from behind the partition. "You got any toilet paper on your side?"<br><br>*************************************************************************************<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Firm It Up</strong><br><br>One morning while making breakfast, a man walked up to his wife and pinched her on the butt and said, "If you firmed this up, we could get rid of your control top pantyhose." While this was on the edge of intolerable, she kept silent.<br><br>The next morning, the man woke his wife with a pinch on each of her breasts and said "You know, if you firmed these up, we could get rid of your bra."<br><br>This was beyond a silent response, so she rolled over and grabbed him by his penis. With a death grip in place, she said, "You know, if you firmed this up, we could get rid of the gardener, the postman, the poolman and your brother."<br><br>*************************************************************************************<br><br><strong>Preacher's Horse Racing Exploits</strong><br><br>A preacher wanted to raise money for his church and on being told that there was a fortune in horse racing, decided to purchase one and enter it in the races.<br><br>However at the local auction, the going price for horses was so high that he ended up buying a donkey instead. He figured that since he had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races. To his surprise, the donkey came in third! The next day the local paper carried this headline: PREACHER'S ASS SHOWS<br><br>The preacher was so pleased with the donkey that he entered it in the race again, and this time it won. The paper read: PREACHER'S ASS OUT IN FRONT<br><br>The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity that he ordered the preacher not to enter the donkey in another race. The paper headline read: BISHOP SCRATCHES PREACHER'S ASS<br><br>This was too much for the Bishop, so he ordered the preacher to get rid of the donkey. The preacher decided to give it to a nun in a nearby convent. The paper headline the next day read: NUN HAS BEST ASS IN TOWN<br><br>The Bishop fainted. He informed the nun that she would have to get rid of the donkey, so she sold it to a farmer for $10.00. Next day the headline read: NUN SELLS ASS FOR $10.00<br><br>This was too much for the Bishop, so he ordered the nun to buy back the donkey, lead it to the plains where it could run wild and free. Next day, the headline in the paper read: NUN ANNOUNCES HER ASS IS WILD AND FREE<br><br>The Bishop was buried the next day.<br><br>*************************************************************************************<br><br><strong>Money In The Coffin</strong><br><br>An old man was on his death bed. He wanted badly to take all his money with him. He called his priest, his doctor and his lawyer to his bedside. "Here's $30,000 cash to be held by each of you. I trust you to put this in my coffin when I die so I can take all my money with me." At the funeral, each man put an envelope in the coffin. Riding away in a limousine, the priest suddenly broke into tears and confessed that he had only put $20,000 into the envelope because he needed $10,000 for a new baptistery. "Well, since we're confiding in each other," said the doctor, "I only put $10,000 in the envelope because we needed a new machine at the hospital which cost $20,000." The lawyer was aghast. "I'm ashamed of both of you," he exclaimed. "I want it known that when I put my envelope in that coffin, it held my personal check for the full $30,000."<br><br>*************************************************************************************<br><br><strong>A Poor Choice of Snack</strong><br><br>Two tigers were stalking through the jungles of Asia. Suddenly, the one to the rear reached out with his tongue, and licked the posterior of the tiger in front of him. The startled front tiger turned and said, "Cut it out." The rear tiger apologized, and they continued onward.<br><br>About five minutes later, it happened again. The front tiger turned, growling, "I said stop it." The rear tiger again apologized, and they continued.<br><br>Another five minutes passed, and again the front tiger felt the unwanted tongue. The front tiger turned, giving the rear tiger a ferocious glare, angrily hissing, "What is it with you?"<br><br>The rear tiger replied, "I'm sorry -- I really didn't mean to offend you. But I just ate a lawyer and I'm trying to get the taste out of my mouth!"<br><br>*************************************************************************************<br><br><strong>Tatooed Penis</strong><br><br>This fellow was so deeply in love that just before he was married, he had his bride's name tattooed on his love muscle. Normally, only the first and last letters were visible, although when he was aroused, the tattoo spelled out W-E-N-D-Y. Now they're on their honeymoon at a resort in Montego Bay. One night, in the men's room, this fellow finds himself standing next to a tall Jamaican at the urinal. To his amazement, he notices that this man, too, has the letters W-Y tattooed on his penis. "Excuse me," he says, "but I couldn't help noticing your tattoo. Do you have a girlfriend named Wendy?" "No way, mon, I work for the Tourist board. Mine reads, "Welcome to Jamaica, mon, have a nice day.'"<br><br>*************************************************************************************<br><br><strong>Windows Support</strong><br><br>An unfailingly polite lady called to ask for help with a Windows installation that had gone terribly wrong.<br><br>Customer: "I brought my Windows disks from work to install them on my home computer." (Training stresses that we are "not the Software Police," so I let the little act of piracy slide.)<br><br>Tech Support: "Umm-hmm. What happened?"<br><br>Customer: "As I put each disk in it turns out they weren't initialized."<br><br>Tech Support: "Do you remember the message exactly, ma'am?"<br><br>Customer: (proudly) "I wrote it down. 'This is not a Macintosh disk. Would you like to initialize it'?"<br><br>Tech Support: "Er, what happened next?"<br><br>Customer: "After they were initialized all the disks appeared to be blank. And now I brought them back to work, and I can't read them in the A: drive; the PC wants to format them. And this is our only set of Windows disks for the whole office. Did I do something wrong?"<br><br>*************************************************************************************<br><br><strong>Hungry Cock</strong><br><br>A guy approaches the window of the movie theater with a rooster under his arm, and asks for 2 tickets. The girl at the counter wants to know who is going in with him. He replies, "Well, my pet chicken, of course!" The girl tells him that he CAN'T take a chicken into the theater, so he goes around the corner, stuffs the chicken into his trousers, and returns. He buys his ticket and goes in. Inside the theater, the chicken starts to get hot and begins to squirm, so the man unzips his fly so the chicken can stick its head out - get some air and watch the movie. Sitting next to him is Agnes. She elbows Myrtle and whispers, "Myrtle, this man over here has just unzipped his pants!" Myrtle whispers back, "Oh, don't worry about it.....you've seen one, you've seen them all." Agnes says, "I KNOW......but this one's eating my POPCORN!"<br><br>*************************************************************************************<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A girl asks her boyfriend to come over Friday night and have<br>dinner with her parents. Since this is such a big event, the<br>girl announces to her boyfriend that after dinner, she would<br>like to go out and make love for the first time.<br><br>Well, the boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so<br>he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get some condoms. The<br>pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour. He tells the boy<br>everything there is to know about condoms and sex.<br><br>At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms<br>he'd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family pack. The boy<br>insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather<br>busy, it being his first time and all.<br><br>That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parents house and<br>meets his girlfriend at the door. "Oh, I'm so excited for you to<br>meet my parents, come on in!"<br><br>The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the<br>girl's parents are seated.

One day, two boys filled<br>up a bucketful of nuts and sat down by the tree, out of sight, and began<br>dividing the nuts. "One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me,"<br>said one boy. The bucket was so full, several rolled out towards the fence.<br><br>Cycling down the road by the cemetery was a third boy. As he passed, he<br>thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to<br>investigate. Sure enough, he heard, "One for you, one for me. One for<br>you." He knew what it was. "Oh, my goodness!" he shuddered, "It's Satan<br>and St. Peter dividing the souls at the cemetery!"<br><br>He cycled down the road and found an old man with a cane, hobbling along.<br>"Come quick!" he said, "You won't believe what I heard. Satan and St.<br>Peter are down at the cemetery dividing the souls." The old man said,<br>"Shoo, you brat! Can't you see I'm finding it hard to walk as it is!"<br><br>After several pleas, the man hobbled to the cemetery and heard, "One for<br>you, one for me. One for you, one..." The old man whispered, "Boy, you've<br>been tellin' the truth! Let's see if we can see the Devil himself."<br>Shivering with fear, they edged toward the fence, still unable to see<br>anything, but they heard, "One for you, one for me. One for you, one for<br>me. And one last one for you. That's all. Let's go get those nuts by the<br>fence, and we'll be done."<br><br>They say the old guy made it to town 10 minutes before the boy!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There was this businessman who was getting ready to go on a long<br>business trip. He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he<br>thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while<br>he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her<br>screwing someone else. So he went to a store that sold sex toys<br>and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex<br>doll, but that was too close to another man for him.<br><br>He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something<br>special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man<br>behind the counter. He explained his situation. The old man<br>said, "Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the<br>trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on,<br>but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for<br>weeks, except -- " and he stopped.<br><br>"Except what?" the man asked.<br><br>"Nothing, nothing."<br><br>"C'mon, tell me! I need something!"<br><br>"Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the<br>'voodoo dick.'"<br><br>"So what's up with this voodoo dick?" he asked.<br><br>The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old<br>wooden box, carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there<br>lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and<br>said "Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this<br>shop!"<br><br>The old man replied, "But you haven't seen what it'll do yet."<br>He pointed to a door and said "Voodoo dick, the door." The<br>voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and<br>started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the<br>vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the<br>door could split, the old man said "Voodoo dick, get back in<br>your box!" The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and<br>lay there, quiescent once more.<br><br>"I'll take it!" said the businessman.<br><br>The old man resisted, saying it wasn't for sale, but he finally<br>surrendered to $700 in cash. The guy took it home to his wife,<br>told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had<br>to do was say "Voodoo dick, my pussy." He left for his trip<br>satisfied that things would be fine while he was gone.<br><br>After he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny.<br>She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her,<br>but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and<br>said "Voodoo dick, my pussy!" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch<br>and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever<br>experienced before. After three orgasms, she decided she'd had<br>enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still<br>thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing<br>worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off.<br>So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help.<br>She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to<br>the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the<br>way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she<br>was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and<br>then asked how much she'd had to drink.<br><br>Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been<br>drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and<br>wouldn't stop screwing. The officer looked at her for a second,<br>and then said "Yea, right. Voodoo dick, my ass!"<br><br></div>
