            <div class='col-md body'><strong>TNS KEEPER LOOKING FORWARD TO ANFIELD TEST </strong><br><br>TNS goalkeeper Gerard Doherty believes he will in for a busy night at Anfield in the Champions League qualifier but is hoping to make a good impression on the big stage.<br><br>Doherty said it would be a dream to keep a clean sheet at Anfield and said this is a once in a lifetime chance for him and his team-mates.<br><br>Doherty said: "From my point of view it would be fantastic to keep a clean sheet, but realistically my aim is just to perform well. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity, chances like this don't come along that often.<br><br>"When we lost 5-0 to Manchester City I didn't have the best of games and a couple of the goals were down to me. I was very low after the game but now I have my chance to make up for it against the European champions.<br><br>"When I played two years ago, I didn't have many games under my belt but now I've got more experience which is vital for a keeper. Hopefully, I've learned a lot since.<br><br>"I've just had a very good season in the Welsh Premier, as did the whole of our defence, but unfortunately the league does not get a lot of coverage.<br><br>"But there's going to be a lot of people watching tonight with it being Liverpool's first game since winning the Champions League so I'm really keen to do well.<br><br>"I've been to Anfield to watch a few games but it's going to be amazing to run out onto the pitch in front of their fans. It will be easy to get over-whelmed but I've just got to block it out and hope the experience of playing in Europe before will put me in good stead.<br><br>"The Anfield crowd are very generous and, with us having a lot of Liverpudlians in the side, I'm sure they will give us respect."</div>

Their leading goalscorer was Marc Lloyd Williams who hit 33 goals. They also have someone who started his career across Stanley Park in midfielder Steven Beck, who made one appearance for the Everton first team in a friendly against Chester City in July 2002.<br><br>Striker John Toner was a former Liverpool trainee and is the club's record goal scorer and longest-serving current player.<br><br>Total Network Solutions play in the Welsh village of Llansantffraid which has a population of just over 1,000.
