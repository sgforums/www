            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Preview</strong><br><br>With next weekend's potential Serie A title showdown with champions AC Milan looming, Juventus coach Fabio Capello has ordered his side to give their total concentration to Sunday's trip to struggling Bologna.<br><br>The match has the words "banana skin" written all over it a week before the Stadio Delle Alpi hosts leaders Juventus and the second-placed Rossoneri in a battle royal which will be the ideal 2004 finale before Serie A hangs up its boots for the festive season.<br><br>All the more reason why Capello will want to maintain that four-point lead over the champions as it would at least ensure they end the calendar year in pole position, even if they lose the summit meeting in Turin.<br><br>"It is absolutely essential that we get all three points at Bologna," said Capello ahead of the trip to the Stadio Dell'Ara.<br><br>"We must be absolutely sure that we do not have our minds on the match with Milan and we must look for victory (at Bologna) with absolute determination."<br><br>Although Bologna are in the middle of a dismal run that has left them in the promotion-relegation play-off spot, Capello is expecting a tough encounter with the team coached by Carlo Mazzone.<br><br>"We will be playing a team that has been playing good football even if they have not been having much luck recently," said Capello. "I hope that their luck does not return against us."<br><br>Bologna defender Alessandro Gamberini, who was on the books of Juventus as a youngster, is looking forward to the game - and has earmarked where the danger will come from.<br><br>He told www.bolognafc.it: "I have always played for Bologna and never thought of anything else. I was very young when I started playing for Bologna and it was a dream for me and wearing the jersey has always been a source of great pride for me.<br><br>"Juventus are a team full of great players, but if we show the right attitude and determination, we can get a result.<br><br>"(Zlatan) Ibrahimovic has always impressed me even when he played for Ajax. For me he is a great player because he is physically very strong and has the skill of a great player.<br><br>"He has also settled in very quickly in Italy and in my opinion will become one of the greatest forwards in the world."<br><br>Bologna have drawn four of their last six games and lost the other two, while Juve have won four of their last six. However, Gamberini believes that the results don't depict the real story of their recent form.<br><br>"We have been a little unlucky and we were looking good against Lecce and Fiorentina before losing both games," he said.<br><br>Bologna expect to have former Juve striker Giacomo Cipriani back from a two-game suspension while Valentin Nastase and Fabio Petruzzi are suspended and will be replaced by Juarez and Gamberini.<br><br>The Bianconeri are expected to name an unchanged line-up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Serie A Preview: Bologna-Juventus</strong><br><br>The Bianconeri travel to BolognaÂ’s DallÂ’Ara stadium having maintained their unbeaten run in Europe this week. With Bologna scrapping for points, the Turin giants will need to keep their concentration if they are to keep up the pace at the top.<br><br><strong>BACKGROUND </strong><br><br>Juventus have not had it all their own way in recent weeks. After a poor first half against Lazio, CapelloÂ’s men found themselves behind with Ibrahimovic finally rescuing them with a late winner. In Europe the Bianconeri were not quite at their best, drawing 1-1 with Maccabi Tel Aviv but doing enough to remain unbeaten. CapelloÂ’s men continue to brush past all before them in Serie A as the likes of AC Milan lag behind. Despite their good results, Juventus will need to keep focussed against a determined Bologna, as they have recently shown signs of tiring a little.<br><br>Capello has restored a winning mentality to Juventus, with every player ready to scrap and fight for the good of the team. Whilst no single match decides a championship, it is the games against sides such as Bologna that must be won. Whilst the Bianconeri are not the most entertaining team around, their ability to get the necessary results is what makes them so special this season.<br><br>Bologna are struggling again in Serie A after recovering last year from a similar start. Carlo Mazzone needs his current crop of players to repeat last yearÂ’s turn around and begin picking up results as quickly as possible. Rossoblu fans have had little to cheer about, looking nervously down at the three teams below them in the table.<br><br>With the strength of the squad available to Mazzone, the Rossoblu are most definitely underachieving in the league. Despite good performances, Bologna have failed to score enough goal to win matches, netting only 13 times so far. Mazzone will be desperate for is team to find the right result on Sunday as the Rossoblu host an exceptional Juventus side.</div>
