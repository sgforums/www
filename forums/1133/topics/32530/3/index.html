She exclaimed, " I don't have that kind of money, but I will do anything to get a message to my mother in China !<br><br>" The Italian smiled, arched an eyebrow and asked, " Anything ? " " Yes, I promise...anything ! " she said.  With that, the Italian said, " Follow me."<br><br>He led her to the next room and said, " Come in and close the door. " " Get down on your knees ! " he ordered.<br>She did. " Unzip me ! " he said. She did. Then he said, " Go on...take it out. "<br>She did and grabbed it with both hands excitedly. The Italian closed his eyes and whispered, " Go ahead girl, what are you waiting for ?"<br><br>Ms China pumpkin girl slowly brought her lips closer and said loudly, " Hello....hello Ah Ma !!!..can you hear me ?<br><br></div>

I come once-a-more. Two asses come together again. I come again and pee twice.Den I come one lasta time."<br><br>"You foul-mouthed swine," retorted lady indignantly.

            <div class='col-md body'>In a crowded city at a busy bus stop, a beautiful young woman wearing a tight mini skirt was waiting for a bus. As the bus stopped and it was her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was<br>too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step of<br>the bus.<br><br>Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she<br>reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little, thinking that this would<br>give her enough slack to raise her leg. She tried to take the step, only to discover that she couldn't.<br><br>So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little more, and for the second time attempted the step.<br><br>Once again, much to her chagrin, she could not ! raise her leg. With a little smile to the driver, she again reached behind to unzip a<br>little more and again was unable to take the step.<br><br>About this time, a large Texan who was standing behind her picked her up easily by the waist and placed her gently on the step of the bus.<br><br>She went ballistic and turned to the would-be Samaritan and yelled,<br>"How dare you touch my body! I don't even know who you are!"<br><br>The Texan smiled and drawled, "Well, ma'am,normally , I would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured we was friends."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It was the first day of school and a new student, the son of a Japanese businessman, entered the fourth grade. The teacher said, "Let's begin by reviewing some American history.<br>Who said "Give me Liberty, or give me Death?" She saw a sea of blank faces, except for Suzuki, who had his hand up. "Patrick Henry, 1775." "Very good! Who said, "Government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth?" Again, no response except from Suzuki: "Abraham Lincoln, 1863." The teacher snapped at the class, "Class, you should be ashamed. Suzuki, who is new to our country knows more about its history than you do." She heard a loud whisper: "F**king Japanese." "Who said that?" she demanded. Suzuki put his hand up. "Lee Iacocca, 1982." At that point, a student in the back sighed, "I'm gonna puke." The teacher glares and asks "All right! Now, who said that?" Again, Suzuki says, "George Bush to Japanese Prime Minister, 1991." Now furious, another student yells, "Oh yeah? Suck this!" Suzuki jumps out of his chair waving his hand and shouts to the teacher, "Bill Clinton, to Monica Lewinsky, 1997!"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There was a guy sunbathing in the nude on the beach. He saw a little girl coming toward him, so he covered himself with the newspaper he was reading. The girl came up to him and asked, "What do you have under the newspaper?"<br><br>Thinking quickly, the guy replied, "A bird." The girl walked away, and the guy fell asleep. When he woke up, he was in a hospital in tremendous pain. The police asked him what happened. The guy says, "I don't know. I was lying on the beach, this little girl asked me a question,  after that I guess I dozed off, and the next thing I know is I'm here."<br><br>The police went to the beach, found the girl, and asked her, "What did you do to that naked fellow?" After a pause, the girl replied, "To him? Nothing. I was playing with his bird and it spit on me, so I broke its neck, cracked its eggs, and set its nest on fire!"<br><br>Moral of the story ...<br>Never lie to girls.<br><br><img src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/emoticons/16.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It was 5:00 in the morning at the U.S. Marine boot camp, well below freezing, and the soldiers were asleep in their barracks. The drill sergeant walks in and bellowed, "This is a birthday suit inspection. I wanna see y'all formed up outside butt naked now!"<br><br>So the soldiers quickly jumped out of bed, naked and shivering, and ran outside to form up into three ranks. The sarge walked out and yelled, "Close up the ranks; conserve your body heat!" So the men closed in tightly.<br><br>The captain came along with his swagger stick. He went to the first soldier and whacked him right across the chest with it. "Did that hurt?" he yelled.<br><br>"No, sir!" came the reply.<br><br>"Why not?"<br><br>"Because I'm a U.S. Marine, sir!"<br><br>The sergeant was impressed and walked on to the next man. He took the stick and whacked the soldier right across the rear. "Did that hurt?"<br><br>"No, sir!"<br><br>"Why not?"<br><br>"Because I'm a U.S. Marine, sir!"<br><br>Still extremely impressed, the captain walked to the third guy and noticed he had an enormous erection. Naturally, he gave this new target a huge WHACK with the swagger stick. "Did that hurt?"<br><br>"No, sir!"<br><br>"And why not?"<br><br>"Because it belongs to the guy behind me, sir!"<br></div>

"Please help me," he begs, "I can't have sex because all the women who see my penis run away screaming in terror."<br><br>"Well, son," says the doctor, "ethically it would be<br>impossible for me to shorten a perfectly good penis, but as<br>it happens I do know a witch in the forest who might be able to do something for you."<br><br>Well, the man is a bit skeptical, but he is desperate, so he takes the doctor's advice and instructions about how to find the witch and sets off to look for her. Sure enough, when he follows the path into the forest, he finds her mixing spells inside her hovel. "Witch," he says, pulling out his penis to show her, "the doctor tells me that you can help me shorten my penis so that women will have sex with me."<br><br>She scratches her head, blinks in amazement, then says: "I can help you. What you must do is go deeper into the forest and find the magic frog who sits on the stone in the pond.You must ask him to marry you, and each time he declines your proposal, your penis will shrink ten inches."<br><br>Being desperate, he'll try anything, so off he goes. And sure enough, before long he finds the magic frog croaking  gently to himself. "Frog," he shouts, "Please marry me!"  The frog doesn't think twice. "Sorry!" he croaks, "I can't  do that. I'm a magic frog and you're a man. No." The man looks down - sure enough, his penis has shrunk by ten inches! FANTASTIC! he thinks, but it's still too long for sex! "Frog," he demands, "please marry me!" The frog looks a bit annoyed, and croaks back "NO!"<br><br>The guy looks down - yep, it's true, his penis is only thirty inches long. What a whopper, he thinks happily, but it's probably is still too big. If I can just get it down to twenty inches, I'll be happy. He looks at the frog, and yells across the pond, "Oh, go on, froggy, marry me, pleeeeeease!"<br><br>The frog looks angrily back at him across the pond, shakes his head and shouts, "No .......NO.....AND FOR THE LASTTIME.....NO!"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Two priests decided to go to Hawaii on vacation. They were<br>determined to make this a real vacation by not wearing anything that would identify them as clergy. As soon as the plane landed, they headed for a store and bought some really outrageous shorts, shirts, sandals, sunglasses, etc.<br><br>The next morning, they went to the beach, dressed in their<br>"tourist" garb.They were sitting on beach chairs, enjoying a drink, the sunshine and the scenery when a "drop dead gorgeous" topless blonde in a thong bikini came walking straight towards them.<br><br>They couldn't help but stare. As the blonde passed them, she smiled and said "good morning, Father, good morning, Father", nodding and addressing each of them individually, then passed on by. They were both stunned. How in the world did she know they were priests?<br><br>So the next day, they went back to the store and bought even more outrageous outfits. These were so loud you could hear them before you even saw them.<br><br>Once again the two priests in mufti settled on the beach in their chairs to enjoy the sunshine. After a while, the same gorgeous topless blonde,wearing a string, taking her sweet time, came walking toward them.<br><br>Again she nodded at each of them, said "good morning, Father" and started to walk away.<br><br>One of the priests couldn't stand it any longer and said. "Just a minute young lady."<br><br>"Yes?" she replied.<br><br>"We are priests, and proud of it, but I have to know, how in the world did you know we are priests dressed as we are?"<br><br>"Father, it's me, Sister Angela," she replied.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One day, in line at the company cafeteria, Jack says to Mike behind him, "My elbow hurts like hell. I guess I better see a doctor."<br><br>"Listen, you don't have to spend that kind of money," Mike replies. "There's a diagnostic computer at the drugstore<br>at the corner. Just give it a urine sample and the computer'll tell you what's wrong and what to do about it. It takes ten seconds and costs ten dollars...a hell of a lot cheaper than a doctor."<br><br>So Jack deposits a urine sample in a small jar and takes it to the drugstore. He deposits ten dollars, and the computer lights up and asks for the urine sample. He pours the sample into the slot and waits. Ten seconds later, the computer ejects a printout: You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water and avoid heavy activity. It will improve in two weeks.<br><br>That evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was, Jack began wondering if the computer could be fooled. He mixed some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, urine samples from his wife and daughter, and masturbated into the mixture for good measure.<br><br>Jack hurries back to the drugstore, eager to check the<br>results.<br><br>He deposits ten dollars, pours in his concoction, and  awaits the results. The computer prints the following:<br>1. Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener.<br>2. Your dog has ringworm. Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo.<br>3. Your daughter has a cocaine habit. Get her into rehab.<br>4. Your wife is pregnant...twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer.<br>5. If you don't stop playing with yourself, your elbow will never get better.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A woman gets on a city bus. She looks at the driver and holds up one hand the driver holds up two hands. Next, the woman points up, the driver points down. Then, the woman grabs her breast; the driver grabs his crotch.<br>Finally, the woman grabs her butt and gets off the bus.<br><br>A curious passenger asked the bus driver what the odd motions were all about. The driver explained, "The woman is a deaf-mute. She asked me if a bus ride is five cents and I told her it was ten cents.  Next, she asked if the bus was going uptown and I told her it was  going downtown. Then, she asked  if the bus was going past the dairy and I told her it was going past the ballpark..."<br><br>The passenger interjected, "Okay, but why did she grab her butt as she left the bus?"<br><br>The driver continued, She replied "Oh sh|t, I'm on the wrong bus!"<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
