            <div class='col-md body'>One day, our beloved Senior Minister went to Thailand and had lobster for dinner with the Thai King. After SM had finished, he asked the King....<br><br>SM: Your Highness, what can you do with this lobster shell?<br>King : We cannot do anything with it, we just throw it away.<br>SM: Oh, no. In our country, we send it to the factory and produce prawn crackers.<br><br>Then SM had an orange. After he had finished, he asked the King.<br>SM: What can you do with the orange skin?<br>King : We cannot do anything. We just throw it away.<br>SM: Oh, no. In Singapore, we send it to the factory and produce orange jam.<br><br>Then SM asked for some chewing gum. After he had finished, he put it on the plate and asked the King.<br>SM: What can you do with the chewing gum?<br>King: Oh, no. We just throw it away.<br>SM: In Singapore, we send it to the factory to produce condoms and then send it to Thailand.<br><br>SM was about to leave but then the King asked him...<br>King: What do you do with the condom when you finish using it?<br>SM: We cannot do anything. We just throw it away.<br>King: In Thailand, when we finish using the condom, we send it to the factory to produce chewing gum and then send it back to Singapore!!!<br><br>And that is the reason why chewing gum is banned in Singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A guy is walking past a high, solid wooden fence at the insane asylum and he hears all the residents inside chanting, "Thirteen! Thirteen! Thirteen!"<br><br>He continues walking along the long fence, but, being a curious person, he can't help but wonder why they are chanting "Thirteen!" over and over. Could it be that they are chugging beer? Are they perhaps taking turns beating one of the inmates?<br>Maybe they are counting the number of patients that have leapt off of the roof thus far.<br><br>His curiosity peaks and he frantically searches for a hole in the fence so that he may see what is going on. Finally, he spots one a few feet ahead. The hole is low in the fence and he has to kneel down to peer inside.<br><br>He moves into position and peeks into the hole. As he looks in, someone inside pokes him in the eye! Then everyone inside the asylum starts chanting, "Fourteen! Fourteen! Fourteen!"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A swedish man was bored. He was bored with his work, bored with<br>his life in general. He felt as there was nothing waiting for<br>him in this life...<br><br>...until one day, at the breakfast table, he was reading the<br>morning paper, when he saw an article, which would change his<br>life. It said: " ...Scientist's had found out, that somewhere in<br>Africa, one could still find tribes of genuine cavemen,<br>untouched by civilization. Only thing needed was to find the<br>correct cave and shout "Wohoo!!" and the tribe would answer to<br>this call."<br><br>"This is it!" the swede thought. "This is what I've been waiting<br>for! I'll sell everything I own, go to Africa, find these<br>cavemen, and become rich and famous!"<br><br>And so he did. He sells everything, moves to Africa and starts<br>looking for the tribe. But cave after cave after cave, no<br>answer. No cavemen.<br><br>Until one day, yet another cave, and another yell: "Juhuuu!!"<br>And then he heard it! " WWOOOOUU WOOOOOO !!!! "<br><br>"HÃ¤rregud!" The Swede thought, "A whole tribe!" And just as he<br>was starting to run to the cave, he thought: "Now wait a minute.<br>These are cavemen. They don't wear any clothes, and I might<br>scare then off."<br>So he stripped his clothes off quickly, and started to run into<br>the cave.<br><br>And the following day, he was in the headlines all over the<br>world: "Naked Swede run over by a train in Africa"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they noticed a whaling ship.<br><br>The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier.<br><br>He said to the female whale, "Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air hole at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."<br><br>They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore.<br><br>The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, "Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."<br><br>At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him.<br><br>"Look", she said, "I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen."<br><br>Fact :<br><br>The average blue whale produces over 400 gallons of sperm when it ejaculates, but only 10% of that actually makes it into his mate. So 360 gallons are spilled into the ocean every time one unloads, and you wonder why the ocean is so salty.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A woman was shaking out a rug on the balcony of her 17th floor condominium when a sudden gust of wind blew her over the railing. "God, that was stupid," she thought as she fell. "What a way to die." As she passed the 14th floor, a man standing at his railing caught her in his arms. While she looked at him in disbelieving gratitude, he asked, "Do you give blow jobs?" "No!" she shrieked, aghast. So, he dropped her. As she passed the 12th floor, another man reached out and caught her. "Do you screw?" he asked. "Of course not!" she exclaimed before she could stop herself. He dropped her, too. The poor woman prayed to God for one more chance. As luck would have it, she was caught a third time, by a man on the eighth floor. "I suck! I screw!" she screamed in panic. "Slut," he said, and dropped her<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The president of Chase Manhattan Bank decides he should take a vacation/business trip. Since the president has heard how much fun Taipei is, he decides to visit the offices there. He books two tickets, one for him and one for his secretary.<br>After his arrival in Taipei, the president receives an urgent message from headquarters that the richest man in Taiwan wants to put all his money into a Chase Manhattan account. Since the account would be quite substantial, the president decides to meet personally with the man.<br>The next day, the president and his secretary go to meet the Taiwanese at an exclusive restaurant. Throughout the dinner, the president tries to bring up the subject of opening the new account but the prospective client only seems interested in the president's secretary.<br>After dinner, the businessman asks the secretary to spend the rest of the evening seeing the sights in Taipei with him. Not wishing to offend the prospective client, the president orders his secretary to go ahead but tells her that she must be diplomatic and under no circumstances is she to insult the man by rejecting him outright.<br>After going to a dance club for a few hours, the businessman takes the secretary aside. As he holds her hand and looks her straight into her eyes, he tells her that he loves her. Then, he gets on his knees and asks her to marry him.<br>Naturally, the secretary is quite taken aback. However, she remembers what her boss told her. Don't reject the guy outright. So, she tries to think of a way to dissuade the businessman from wanting to marry her.<br>So, after a few minutes, the woman says: "I will only marry you under three conditions. First, I want my engagement ring to be a 75 carat diamond ring, with a matching 200 carat diamond tiara." The Taiwanese man pauses for awhile then, with a nod of his head, answers: "No problem!! I buy. I buy."<br>Realizing that her first condition was too easy, the woman says, "My second condition is a 100 room mansion in New York. As a vacation home, I want a chateau built in the middle of the Gironde in France." The man pauses for awhile. He whips out his cellular phone, calls some brokers in New York, then he calls some real estate agents in France. He looks at the woman, nods his head and says, "Okay, okay. I build, I build."<br>Realizing that she has one last condition, the secretary knows that she'd better make this a good one. She takes her time to think and finally, she gets an idea. A sure-to-work condition. She squints her eyes, looks at the man and says, rather coldly, "Since I like to have sex, I want the man I marry to have a 12-inch penis."<br>The man seems a bit disturbed. He cups his face in his hands and rests his elbows on the table. All the while, he's muttering something in Chinese.<br>Finally, after what seemed like forever, the man shakes his head, looking real sad, says to the woman, "OK. I cut. I cut."<br></div>
