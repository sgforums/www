            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: green;">Continued positive home form crucial to Dynamo bid</span></span></strong><br><br>Although having been granted a 3-0 forfeit victory at AS Roma's expense when referee Anders Frisk was struck by a missile from the crowd at the Stadio Olimpico on the opening matchday, FC Dynamo Kyiv have maintained their push for a place in the knockout phase of the competition with seven points from four outings.<br><br>Diogo RincÃ³n was among the goals on the last occasion FC Dynamo Kyiv hosted Italian opposition<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gavrancic goal</span></strong><br><br>The record books will show that the Ukrainians were 45 minutes from a famous victory in the Italian capital following Goran Gavrancic's 29th-minute goal, but since that match Dynamo have been in excellent form at home, handing Bayer 04 Leverkusen a 4-2 defeat at the Valeriy Lobanovskiy stadium before taking an early two-goal lead against Real Madrid CF although the Spanish side hit back through RaÃºl GonzÃ¡lez and LuÃ­s Figo to salvage a point. Their only defeat to date came at the Santiago BernabÃ©u when a 35th-minute goal from Michael Owen separated the sides on matchday three.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Maiden voyage</span></strong><br><br>AS Roma have already been eliminated from the reckoning for a place in the knockout stage, although Luigi Del Neri's side showed some battling qualities when securing a 1-1 draw at home to Leverkusen thanks to Vincenzo Montella's equaliser three minutes into stoppage time. This engagement, however, will mark their first trip to the Ukraine.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lucky 13</span></strong><br><br>Dynamo, for their part, have played 13 European club competition matches against Italian opponents, their first victory coming in Rome following a sequence of four draws and eight defeats. The Ukrainians last hosted an Italian side when facing FC Internazionale Milano on matchday six of the 2003/04 UEFA Champions League group stage, drawing 1-1 with Daniele Adani putting the visitors ahead after 68 minutes only for Diogo RincÃ³n to equalise six minutes from time. The result actually meant that Dynamo finished bottom of the group while Inter were denied a place in the knockout stage as they finishing third while Arsenal FC and FC Lokomotiv Moskva occupied the top two places.</div>

They are coming off 3 straight losses against Udinese and Reggina in the Serie A and Siena in the Coppa Italia respectively.<br><br>However, coach Luigi Del Neri is optimistic about the teamÂ’s fortunes this season and was typically upbeat when commenting on the year so far.

The volatile Antonio Cassano is expected to captain the side in the absence of Totti and should be partnered up-front by Egyptian striker Mido.</div>

One of the bright spots of a terrible start to the campaign has been the form of Montella, who only three months ago was on the transfer list.<br><br>However, Serie A's joint top-scorer is suffering from flu and has not made the journey. He remains in the Eternal City along with Totti, who has been granted permission to miss the match due to personal reasons.<br><br>Last month's draw against Bayer Leverkusen has given the Italian team a glimmer of hope of qualifying for the UEFA Cup, but to do so they must finish in third position.<br><br>Dynamo, meanwhile, have all to play for as they are currently level on seven points with both Real Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen, while Roma prop up Group B with one point.<br><br>Head coach Yozhef Sabo insists his players will be taking the game seriously, and reckons it will be business as usual despite a terrible weather forecast ahead of the Tuesday night clash.<br><br>``They say that tomorrow will be frost and a huge snowfall,'' he said. ``In spite of this we are preparing as usual.<br><br>``We consider Roma as a serious team with well-skilled players and a good coach. ``We are preparing for this game very seriously because it's wrong to underestimate the opponent before the fight.'' </strong></div>
