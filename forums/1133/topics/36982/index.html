            <div class='col-md body'>A middle age woman had a heart attack and was taken to the hospital. While on the operation table, she had a near death experience. Seeing God, she asked if this was it. God said, "No you have another 43years, 2 months and 8 days to live.<br><br>Upon recovery, the woman decided to stay in the hospital and have a facelift, liposuction, breast augmentation, tummy tuck, etc. She even had someone to come in and change her hair color. Since she had so much more time to live, she figured she might as well make the most of it.<br><br>She got out of the hospital, after the last operation, and while crossing the street was killed by an ambulance speeding to the hospital. Arriving in front of God, she demanded, "I thought you said I had another 40 years?"<br><br>God replied, "I didn't recognize you."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A young feller is brought home to meet the folks. His girl greets him at the door and says, "I'm sorry, I'm running late. Please come in and I'll introduce you to my folks. And I, uhh, forgot to tell you, they're both deaf mutes." With this she ushers him into the living room, introduces him to her parents and promptly disappears. As you can imagine, this is a little uncomfortable as both of the parents are completely silent. Dad is sitting in his arm chair watching golf on TV, and Mom is busy knitting. After about ten minutes of complete silence, Mom jumps from her chair, pulls up her skirt, pulls down her panties, and pours a glass of water over her ass. Just as suddenly, Dad launches himself across the room, bends her over the couch, and takes her from behind. He then sits back down in his chair and balances a match stick in front of his eye.The room is plunged back into eerie silence and the young man is shocked into disbelief. After a further ten minutes, the daughter returns fully dressed and ready for the evening. The date is a complete disaster with the young man completely distracted by the on goings earlier in the living room.At the end of the night, the girl asks, "What's the matter? Have I done something wrong?" "No, it's not you," he replied, "It's just that the strangest thing happened while I was waiting for you and I am still a bit shocked. Well, first your Mother jumps from her chair, lifts up her skirt, pulls down her panties, and throws a glass of water over her behind. "Then, as if that weren't enough, your Father races from his chair, leans her over the couch and does her from behind. He then sits back down and places a match stick by his eye." "Oh, is that all?" replies the girl. The man can't believe her casual response. The girl explains. "Mom was simply saying, 'Are you going to get this a55hole a drink?' and Dad was replying, 'No, f**k him - I'm watching the match.'"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One day, while a woodcutter was cutting a branch of a tree above a river, his axe fell into the river. When he began crying, God appeared and asked him, "Why are you crying?"<br><br>The woodcutter told him that he had dropped his axe into water. God went down into the water and reappeared with a golden axe.<br><br>"Is this your axe? God asked.<br><br>The woodcutter said "No".<br><br>God again went down and came up with a silver axe. "Is this your axe? God asked.<br><br>The woodcutter said "No".<br><br>God went down again and came up with an iron axe. "Is this your axe? God asked.<br><br>The woodcutter said, "Yes".<br><br>God was pleased with the man's honesty and gave him all the three axes.<br><br>The woodcutter went home happily. One day while he was walking with his wife along the river, his wife fell into the river. When he began crying, God appeared and asked him, "Why are you crying?"<br><br>"My wife has fallen into water."<br><br>God went down into the water and came up with Jennifer Lopez. "Is this your wife? God asked.<br><br>"Yes", he said.<br><br>God was furious, YOU CHEAT! Now I am going to curse you..."<br><br>The woodcutter quickly said, "Forgive me My Lord. It is a misunderstanding. If I say "No" to Jennifer Lopez, you will come up with Catherine Zeta Jones. If I also say "No" to her, you will finally come up with my wife and I will say, "Yes". Then you will give all the three to me. I am a poor man. I will not be able to look after all the three. So that's why I've to say "Yes"...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There was a Japanese who went to America for sightseeing.<br><br>On the last day, he hailed a cab and told the driver to drive to the airport. During the journey, a Honda drove past the taxi. Thereupon, the Japanese leaned out of the window excitedly and yelled, " Honda, very fast! Made in Japan!"<br><br>After a while, a Toyota sped past the taxi. Again, the Japanese leaned out of the window and yelled, "Toyota, very fast! Made in Japan!"<br><br>And then a Mitsubishi sped past the taxi. For the third time, the Japanese leaned out of the window and yelled, "Mitsubishi, very fast! Made in Japan!" The driver was a little angry, but kept quiet. And this went on for a quite a number of cars.<br><br>Finally, the taxi came to the airport. The fare was US$300. The Japanese exclaimed, "Wah... so expensive. Thereupon, the driver yelled back, "Meter, very fast! Made in Japan!"<br></div>
