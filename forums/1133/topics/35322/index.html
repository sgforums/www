Her son is a coffeeshop worker who was retrenched recently.<br><br>Several others who had fallen on hard times were among the many people who joined queues across the island yesterday to take a shot at the big prize.<br><br>The draw will take place at 6.30 pm today.<br><br>Several people The Straits Times spoke to yesterday were hoping that a win would be a quick fix to their job and financial woes because of the bad economic times.<br><br>'If I win, I will retire,' said Mr Yap Siang Sing, 40, a former storekeeper who has been searching in vain for a job since being retrenched six months ago.<br><br>Singaporeans were not the only ones in the queue. Foreign workers, expatriates and punters from Malaysia who learnt of the draw - the largest this year - joined in too.<br><br>Electrician Kong Sui Hoong, who is in his 40s, went all the way from his home in Johor Bahru to a Toto outlet in Bishan to place a $15 bet.<br><br>He hopes Lady Luck will help him pay for his two children's studies overseas, especially since he has suffered a pay cut last year. Making ends meet on his monthly pay of $1,600 is tough, he concedes.<br><br>Then there were those who wanted to win for loftier reasons.<br><br>A chemical engineer from China, Mr Cheng Jun, 25, put down more than $50. 'If I win, I will find myself a wife.'<br></div>
