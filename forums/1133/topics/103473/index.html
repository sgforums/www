            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: blue;">Coppa Italia Preview: Inter-Bologna</span></span></strong><br><br>Inter and Bologna will kick off their Coppa Italia campaigns on Sunday night, in a match especially important for Inter, who will try to find a victory they havenÂ’t<br>tasted since they beat Valencia 5-1 in Spain.<br><br><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: green;">BACKGROUND </span></span></strong><br><br>After that miraculous result in the Champions League, they have typically failed to continue a good run and confirm they were a team in form. Instead, they racked up an incredibly long series of draws that isnÂ’t showing any signs of stopping. They either play terrible first halves and come back strongly in the last twenty minutes or so, like against Cagliari and Fiorentina, or seem to dominate their opponents and cruise to comfortable wins before unexpectedly conceding goals from corners or long-range blasts, like against Lecce, Roma, and, most recently, tonightÂ’s opponents Bologna. Under-fire Inter coach Roberto ManciniÂ’s hilarious reaction to Carlo MazzoneÂ’s boysÂ’ equaliser in the dying minutes of that Serie A match, banging his hand against the roof of the cabin he was standing in (he was suspended), was a perfect illustration of the desperation for a win and helplessness Inter fans are feeling about their teamÂ’s recent results.<br><br>Bologna, meanwhile, are possibly one of the most stable teams in the league, since they have a knack for finding themselves almost always in midtable, pretty much safe from the relegation zone but also far from a more ambitious placing, i.e. a UEFA cup spot. They are certainly not a team you can take for granted atany time, as Inter learned 10 days ago when veteran coach Mazzone fielded an depleted side full of reserves because of numerous injuries, and still pulled off a hard-fought, if, fortunate, 2-2 draw. LetÂ’s also remember they beat, nay, thrashed Roma at home and won away to Parma, some highly respectable results to say the least.<br><br>Playing to InterÂ’s advantage, though, is the fact that teams like the Rossoblu are much more concerned with maintaining a safe position in the Serie A standings and their coaches will field sides filled with reserves and players from the Primavera, the youngsters, much as Arsenal do quite successfully in the Carling Cup, for example. Inter, meanwhile, will not approach this competition with any complacency considering the Scudetto race is already strongly compromised because of all those draws. To be extremely harsh despite it only being November, this Coppa Italia, which in Italy has much less meaning than, say, the FA Cup in England, and the Champions League represent the NerazzurriÂ’s only realistic chance of silverware this season. Much will also depend on the result they will achieve against Juventus Sunday next week, but that is of later concern.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: brown;">TEAM NEWS </span></span><br><br>Inter </strong><br><br>It will be quite interesting how Francesco Coco, left-wing defender and ex-Italian international who suffered a serious and complex back injury, will perform after an absence of a year from competitive football. ItÂ’s almost sure he will take to the pitch on Sunday night. Elsewhere, Veron is still suffering the after effects of an encounter with a Bologna defender in Serie AÂ’s recent fixture between these two sides, and Kily Gonzalez is slowly recovering and will return to the pitch soon but not tonight. Adriano will not make an appearence tonight for the first time this season as he is returning from Brazil international duty only on Sunday. All other strikers arenÂ’t experiencing any problems and Mancini will probably give Vieri the chance to get some playing minutes after an umpteenth recent injury. Finally, Davids is a doubt as he skipped his HollandÂ’s World Cup qualifier in midweek through injury.<br><br><strong>Bologna </strong><br><br>MazzoneÂ’s squad has no serious injury and most importantly his most relevant players, such as european champion Zagorakis, Bellucci, Tare, Colucci, are ready for this match and might not play out the whole match or start from the beginning, but will surely contribute in giving Inter some headaches.</div>

Expect Mancini to give a chance to this Argentinean striker, who started his Inter career well last season, but has scored the misery of 3 goals this year, and I mean the year 2004. Always threatening from free-kicks, he will be looking to prove Mancini he is still a serious option in InterÂ’s star-studded attack.... and prove something against the team he played for before joining Inter.<br><br><strong>Ciro Capuano (Bologna) </strong><br>In the recent Serie A game the two sides played at the San Siro, he was one of the best players on the pitch and produced a splendid cross converted by Bellucci for BolognaÂ’s equaliser.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">Coppa Italia Preview: Cagliari-Lazio</span></span></strong><br><br>Coppa Italia winners SS Lazio will be heading south to Sardinia where the campaign of defending their title will start in Cagliari at Stadio SantÂ’Elia. The Capital club is not the same team that won the tournament last season and thus Cagliari will surely be playing with no fear and will be hoping to take advantage of being the home team in a two-legged format cup.<br><br><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: purple;">BACKGROUND </span></span></strong><br><br>Both clubs are satisfied with their mid-table positions in the league. CagliariÂ’s coach Arrigoni knows that all he has to do is to keep his side in Serie A this season and so far he is doing a good job in that as the team lies comfortably in 9th position with 16 points. The rossoblu know that they wonÂ’t achieve trophies this year, but going far in Coppa Italia will help boost the morale of the team and please the fans and of course their President Cellino; and whatÂ’s better than a win on the title holder in the third round ? The team will surely be looking forward to net a win against Lazio, as they know that with all the problems the capital outfit are facing, the last thing on their mind is keeping hold of their title.<br><br>Cagliari enter this game with high hopes as the team was very close to beating Inter last Sunday before wasting a 3-1 lead that could have seen them inject the nerazzurri their first loss. However, they could not rejoice as Inter managed to tie the score. This left President Cellino bitterly disappointed but for sure the fans were impressed by the teamÂ’s performance. Arrigoni will try his best to bring the smile back on his presidentÂ’s face on Sunday by grabbing a win, since Cagliari have not managed to win in November yet after drawing in their three games this month against Livorno, Sampdoria, and Inter.<br><br>Last yearÂ’s champions Lazio know that this year is nothing like its predecessor. The club managed to win Coppa Italia last year beating Juve in the final with an aggregate score of 4-2. However, many of the influential players that helped grab that trophy are now gone due to the clubÂ’s financial crisis. Having saved Lazio from bankruptcy, President Claudio Lotito will be more than happy if his team finishes with a mid-table this season, even if trophy-less. Just like their hosts, Lazio are lying in 8th place with 16 points. The team has gone through a lot of bad patches this season and the streak of bad results and performances threatened the position of coach Mimmo Caso, however a crucial win with a last minute penalty by inspirational Paolo Di Canio over Bologna on Sunday gave the biancoceleste a push forward and prolonged CasoÂ’s job on the Lazio bench.<br><br>Reports suggest that there are many problems surrounding Lazio. From the injury crisis which according to rumors is due to the unpaid medical staff, to the tactics used by coach Mimmo Caso who is being always criticized by the fans. The fans have more than once asked for the axing of Caso however Lotito insists that the coach is doing a good job so far. This created tension at the biancoceleste club between the fans and Claudio Lotito. Other problems at the club are those of contractual nature. Rumors suggest that Liverani, Negro, Dino Baggio, and Peruzzi are in conflict with the current management each for his own reasons. Lotito as usual answered denying all these reports, except for that of Paolo Negro whose relationship with Lazio seems to have come to an end. Fortunately a bright light appears from amidst all this chaos around the Capital club. Under the leadership of Claudio Lotito, Lazio have finally achieved a positive turnover of 4.65 millions. A positive turnover is something that Lazio couldnÂ’t achieve since 1997. This shows that with LotitoÂ’s policies, the club is on the right track financially.<br><br>Cagliari have never had the honor of winning the Italian Cup, however their visitors Lazio have enjoyed lifting the trophy 4 times in 1958, 1998, 2000, and 2004. In a total of 38 games played between the two clubs, Lazio have the upper hand with 17 wins, while Cagliari won 11 times and the two teams drew in 10. Its worth noting that the two teamsÂ’ last encounter was in January 2000 at Cagliari where they tied 0-0, and in their last six games which happen to be in the period from 1996 to 2000, Cagliari was not able to win. The six games had three wins for Lazio and three draws. However the three games that took place at SantÂ’Elia since 1996 ended in a scoreless draw. Cagliari have reached the third round after passing Trieste 6-2 on aggregate winning 3-1 home and away in the second round, while Lazio start their campaign from this third round.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: orange;">TEAM NEWS </span></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cagliari </span></strong><br><br>The last game that Cagliari played was Sunday against Inter, and their next game will also be a week after the Coppa game. This means that Arrigoni will most probably field the same team he uses for Serie A games. The rossoblu do not have major worries. Greek goal keeper Katergiannakis will be in goal for Cagliari. In defense, Cagliari will be missing 22 year old Rocco Sabato as the player is injured and has also missed his teamÂ’s last game against Inter. Arrigoni will most probably field in the defense that played against Inter. No problems in midfield for the rossoblu. In attack Honduran David Suazo will miss the game after picking up a thigh injury.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lazio </span></strong><br><br>Lazio have a very busy schedule. Battling on three fronts, Mimmo Caso is not expected to focus very much on Coppa Italia this season. The biancoceleste have a mid-week UEFA Cup clash against Partizan Belgrade on Thursday, a game that could very well decide the outcome of LazioÂ’s European adventure. Thus, it is expected that Mimmo Caso will rest most of his influential players for the game against Partizan. The South American signings are inelgibile to play in UEFA Cup, so Caso will surely make the most out of this by fielding them on Sunday. Angelo Peruzzi is expected to be back in goal. The keeper will have this chance to regain his place in goal after Matteo Sereni deservingly took over after PeruzziÂ’s injury. In defense, the Argentinean pair Talamonti and Lequi are expected to start as Sebastiano Siviglia is still out for injury while captain Fernando Couto will be resting to prepare for the game against Partizan. In midfield Caso is expected to give Venezuelan Mea Vitali his first debut with the biancoceleste, while it is also expected that young Argentinean Bryan Robert will get a taste of the pitch. Fabio Liverani is back from injury however the midfielder has injured himself again in training so his participation is a doubt. Caso might not field Ousmane Dabo as the Frenchmen needs all the rest he can get after carrying the burden of leading the teamÂ’s midfield due to the numerous injuries the team had. With Emanuelle Fillipini back, he could take the place of Dabo in the center of midfield. In attack Lazio have recovered Roberto Muzzi. The striker has been injured and his return is important for Lazio to give rest to their star Tomasso Rocchi. Lazio leader Paolo Di Canio is expected to play as he will be out of Serie A action next week after his expulsion against Bologna.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: blue;">PLAYERS TO WATCH </span></span><br><br>Cagliari - Mauro Esposito: </strong><br>The striker is really having an excellent start for the season. Scoring 6 goals so far for Cagliari, the Italian has gotten a national team call up. His role was also crucial in the last game against Inter. Esposito will surely trouble LazioÂ’s defense with the help of Zola and Langella.<br><br><strong>Lazio - Angelo Peruzzi: </strong><br>The keeper is eager to impress after he has been long sidelined due to injury. For PeruzziÂ’s bad luck, Matteo Sereni has been on excellent form to say the least. The veteran will have to give his best if he wants his first team spot back.</div>
