            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: red;">BIG-MATCH FACTS </span><br><br>ARSENAL</strong> attempt to get their bid for successive Premiership titles back on track, against a Birmingham side, who are yet to win or even score against them in the Premier League. The Gunners need a confidence boosting result here ahead of Tuesday's decisive Champions League final group game, at home to Rosenborg.<br><br>The Gunners lost 2-1 at Liverpool last Sunday, but have not suffered back-to-back defeats in 80 Premiership games since consecutive 1-2 losses away to Everton and home to Blackburn on 19 and 26 October 2002. They must now play catch-up, as they aim to stretch their record unbeaten home run in the Premiership to 28 matches. They surrendered the leadership to Chelsea a month ago, and now find themselves five points adrift having dropped 12 points from the last 18. Indeed in November, their record was inferior to that of lowly Norwich. But Arsene Wenger's side have scored more than three times as many League goals as Birmingham, and it could be argued that this match pits the Premiership's most attractive and the least entertaining sides. The 15 top flight matches involving the Gunners have produced 59 goals, where Birmingham's 15 have yielded just 27.<br><br>Arsenal suffered a hangover from their title celebrations when frustrated by Birmingham in last season's corresponding fixture in May, which ended goalless. The Gunners have picked up 10 points out of the 12 available in Premiership contests with the Brummies.<br><br><strong>BIRMINGHAM CITY</strong> have registered just one League win since August, and are on their lowest points return ever to this identical stage in the Premiership.<br><br>Steve Bruce's Blues built the longest sequence of draws in the top division this season in September and October when five successive games ended all square, and they prepare to face the champions on the back of two more stalemates. This match provides the chance to compare the sharpest and bluntest attacks in the top division. While Birmingham have only managed 12 goals this term (0.8 goals per game), the Londoners have piled in 39 (2.6 goals per game).<br><br>Last season's goalless draw was Birmingham's second in three League visits to Highbury and third in five. The Midlanders are seeking a first win in 22 visits to the north London venue. Of the last 21, seven have been drawn and 14 lost. City's only win in 40 League visits over 78 years was 1-3 in the top flight on 19 October 1957.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Prem Preview: Arsenal-Birmingham</strong><br><br>Arsenal know that another home slip up could be fatal as they bid to get back on track after an indifferent run of results.<br>Arsene Wenger has admitted he is worried by his sideÂ’s recent dip in form that has seen them fall five points behind Chelsea at the Premiership summit.<br><br>And no wonder. Last weekend in the 2-1 defeat to Liverpool, it took the Gunners until the second-half to register a shot at goal. Patrick VieiraÂ’s equaliser in that match was flattering in the extreme, although many felt justice was done with Neil MellorÂ’s late, late winner.<br><br>Arsenal are still attempting to regain that fluidity in attack that marked them out as a class apart last Sean and the beginning of this. Little seems to be coming naturally at the moment, with too many eye of the needle passes going astray.<br><br>And then there are the defensive problems. The uncertainty of goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, coupled with that of his back-four means Wenger has much work to do on the training ground.<br><br>Birmingham will be looking to exploit those well-documented problems at the back when they make the visit to Highbury. ItÂ’s been a difficult season for Steve BruceÂ’s men after much investment in the summer.<br><br>One new recruit, Jesper Gronkjaer, has failed to hit the heights, and a January move to Atletico Madrid may beckon.<br><br>Bruce said of the Danish winger: "If the price is right, itÂ’ll be in the best interests, I think, for both parties that he moves on."</div>
