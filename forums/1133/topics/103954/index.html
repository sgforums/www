            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: green;">More than pride at stake in Prague</span></span></strong><br><br>Although FenerbahÃ§e SK can still harbour hopes of advancing to the knockout stages of the 2004/05 UEFA Champions League, more realistically they and their matchday five opponents, AC Sparta Praha, are battling for a third-placed finish in their group and a spot in the UEFA Cup.<br><br>A Pierre van Hooijdonk goal separated the sides in Istanbul, but AC Sparta Praha are unbeaten at home against Turkish opposition<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Van Hooijdonk winner</span></strong><br><br>The Turkish side gained the upper hand on the opening matchday in Istanbul thanks to Pierre van Hooijdonk's goal after 16 minutes, but have conceded 13 goals in their subsequent three matches providing Sparta with some additional hope for the meeting in the Czech capital. The Czechs have held Manchester United FC to a scoreless draw and lost by the odd goal in three to Olympique Lyonnais to date at home, with their other defeat coming at Old Trafford on matchday four.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Previous meeting</span></strong><br><br>The first time these clubs met in European club competition also signalled the first time both Sparta came up against Turkish opposition and FenerbahÃ§e faced Czech opponents. The 1989/90 European Champion Clubs' Cup provided the opportunity for Sparta and FenerbahÃ§e to lock horns, with Hakan Tecimer putting the visitors ahead prior to the break only for Ivan Cabala and Michal BÃ­lak (2) to swing the tie back in the Czech sides favour by the end. Chasing the game, FenerbahÃ§e then fell behind at home to Ivan HaÂšek's 39th-minute goal, and though Ogun Ã‡etin levelled eight minutes from time, there was still enough time for Sparta to make it two wins from two when Petar Novak added their second six minutes later.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fortress Prague</span></strong><br><br>Since then, Sparta have since met teams from Turkey on four occasions, taking the opportunity to extend their 100% record in the Czech capital to five matches, although they have yet to secure their second success Turkish soil. Their most recent engagement came in the 2003/04 UEFA Champions League group stage where the Czech side defeated Besiktas JK 2-1 at home thanks to goals from LukÃ¡Âš Zelenka (58 minutes) and Karel PoborskÃ½ (85 minutes) which sandwiched Daniel Pancu's goal (60 minutes) for the visitors. In the return match two weeks later, Besiktas prevailed due to Ronaldo Guiaro's winner eight minutes from time.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Embarrassing defeat</span></strong><br><br>Excluding the opening day meeting between the two sides, FenerbahÃ§e have had only one encounter with Czech opposition since 1989, winning the opening leg of their 1992/93 UEFA Cup second round engagement against SK Sigma Olomouc in Istanbul courtesy of Ismail Kartal's 36th-minute penalty. However, Jozef Venglos' side endured a humiliating 7-1 defeat in Olomouc in the return leg, a result that was one goal shy of FenerbahÃ§e's record defeat in 108 matches in European competitions to date.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: orange;">CL Preview: Sparta Prague-Fenerbahce</span></span></strong><br><br>While Lyon and Manchester United look favourite to progress to the knock-out phase from Group D, Sparta Prague and Fenerbahce are contesting at least a Uefa Cup spot - though technically Fenerbahce can still qualify for the next round. But both teams are without key players for TuesdayÂ’s encounter<br><br><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">BACKGROUND </span></span></strong><br><br>Sparta will be looking to restore some pride with a first win in the Champions League group stage. Frantisek StrakaÂ’s team are currently bottom of Group D, having picked up a solitary point from their four matches so far. They are already out of the next round, but could make it into the Uefa Cup. Defeat would end their chance of a third-place finish. But victory would take them above FenerbahÃ§e with one game to go. The Turkish side have lost all their group games since the opening 1-0 win over Sparta in September.<br><br>However, the Czech side will be without some key players Â– including highly influential midfielder Karel Poborsky - as they attempt to move off the bottom. But coach Straka believes the players who come in are capable of doing a good job for the team. And he is optimistic his side can get a result against the Turkish side.<br><br>"My assistant Miroslav Jirkal saw the last match of Fenerbahce in the league. They played with just with one forward," Straka noted.<br><br>"But this does not mean we are going to play mindless attacking soccer. They certainly know how to attack well. We have to tighten up in midfield and not allow them to combine there.<br><br>"I still think that the last round will decide the third place. We will have to get points in Lyon, I do not believe that Manchester United will win in Turkey."<br><br>SpartaÂ’s impressive midfielder Lukas Zelenka is braced for a difficult match after their 1-0 defeat in Istanbul.<br><br>"We did not deserve to lose in Turkey, we have to play the same type of game, not concede possession and try to put them under pressure," he said.<br><br>Domestically, SpartaÂ’s good run was halted earlier this month when they went down to their first league defeat of the season at home to Mlada Boleslav. However, they recovered to record two victories in the next two weeks. The 3-1 league win against FK Jablonec 97 on Saturday maintained SpartaÂ’s lead at the top of the Czech First Division, but Champions League football has proved much more challenging to StrakaÂ’s squad, who are still without a win and have scored only twice in four games.<br><br>Fenerbahce were met with rain and even some snow in the Czech capital on arrival. But theyÂ’d travelled to Prague encouraged by SaturdayÂ’s 2-0 league win at Trabzonspor. Alex with a penalty and Tuncay Sanli scored their goals, although Fener were reduced to ten men for much of the game following a red card for Marcia Nobre after 37 minutes. The win took FenerbahÃ§e five points clear at the top of the Turkish Superleague.<br><br>FenerbahÃ§e need victory to have any hope of making the knockout rounds. They were unable to build on their good start in beating Sparta, losing 6-2 at Manchester United and then going down 3-1 and 4-2 in their two games against Olympique Lyonnais.<br><br>A second win against Sparta Prague though, and defeat for United at home to Lyon, would mean FenerbahÃ§e could go through by beating United in Istanbul on Matchday 6. However, FenerÂ’s coach, Christoph Daum, has already ruled out overhauling United and is focusing on securing a Uefa Cup campaign.<br><br>"Before the Champions League, I said it would be very difficult for us to succeed and I was harshly criticised for that," Daum said. "But that is the reality - this team needs two more years before it can compete in a competition like this. We can succeed in the Uefa Cup though."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: blue;">TEAM NEWS </span></span><br><br>Sparta:</strong> Poborsky and defender Jiri Homola are both suspended, while midfielder Rastislav Michalik (hamstring) and defender Pavel Pergl (ankle) are sidelined through injury. Straka said: "PoborskyÂ’s absence is of course a great loss for us. We will miss him badly - he is a team leader. Also the other players belong to the team and we would have been much stronger with them. But there is no point beating ourselves up over it, we are going to have to come to terms with it. Our squad is big enough to manage the situation, and the new players will have a chance to prove their quality."<br><br>Jiri Koubsky and Marek Cech have also been struggling with flu this week but both are expected to be available. Former Bayer Leverkusen star Jan Simak looks likely to deputise for Poborsky.<br><br>"It is one of the options," said Straka. "It is a great challenge for him. He wants to work hard, and I like his attitude. Every minute of play he gets improves his performance."<br><br>Meanwhile, Petr Vorisek may replace the injured Pergl, while if he recovers, Slovakian defender Cech could return to the defence after having spent most of the season in the reserves.<br><br><strong>Fenerbahce:</strong> Pierre van Hooijdonk, the match-winner when the teams met in September on Matchday 1, was absent for the Turkish champions last weekend with flu and an Achilles injury and will miss the game.</div>
