By kick off time Rovers, who've drawn their last three Premiership matches, could be back on the foot of the table.<br><br>The club from the Red Rose county have only won one of 14 League and Cup games this season - that being Mark Hughes' first in charge. They prepare to face the Brummies after two 1-1 draws at Norwich and Manchester City. Their goal from the game at the City of Manchester Stadium was a spot kick from Paul Dickov - their first penalty award in a Premiership game since the 2002/03 season.<br><br>These clubs met each other three times last season and there was little to separate them overall. Rovers won the League fixture at St Andrews 0-4, and then Birmingham returned the favour in a home FA Cup tie. This corresponding fixture ended 1-1 in May when a last minute header from substitute Stern John cancelled out Andy Cole's opener.<br><br><strong>BIRMINGHAM CITY</strong> are only three points better off than Blackburn, and have completed just one victory in ten top tier engagements, as they embark on their 2,500th bona fide post war League game.<br><br>Steve Bruce's Blues go to Blackburn looking for back to back victories away from home, having picked up their first this season two weeks ago in a 0-1 triumph over Liverpool at Anfield when Darren Anderton netted the winner. Birmingham last managed successive victories on their top division travels on 30 August and 20 September last year when they came away from Newcastle and Leeds with maximum points.<br><br>The Brummies are yet to record their first victory over Blackburn in the Premiership (two draws, two defeats so far). Their only maximum in 23 League visits to Ewood Park over 50 years was 1-2 on 20 January 1668 in the original Second Division (36 years ago). Their last top flight maximum there was also 1-2 on 28 September 1935.</div>
