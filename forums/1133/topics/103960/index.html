            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: green;">Improving Maccabi seek Bayern scalp</span></span></strong><br><br>Despite having played the least amount of matches in European club competitions among the 32 participating teams in the 2004/05 UEFA Champions League, Maccabi Tel-Aviv FC had already gained some experience against German opposition prior to their opening matchday defeat at home to FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen.<br><br>FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen striker Roy Makaay was on target when the two sides met on the opening matchday<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Harsh introduction</span></strong><br><br>Maccabi Tel-Aviv's introduction to UEFA competitions came in the 1992/93 European Champion Clubs' Cup where they advanced from the preliminary round to the first round only to be eliminated 4-0 on aggregate by Belgian side Club Brugge KV. They endured the same qualification procedure and exit from the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup two years later in their next appearance in European club competitions.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Defeat in Bremen</span></strong><br><br>On this occasion SV Werder Bremen provided the opposition, and though the Israeli side held the DFB-Pokal winners to a scoreless draw in the opening leg at Tel-Aviv's Ramat Gan stadium, they would lose 2-0 in the return leg 16 days later as second half goals from Marco Bode and Mario Basler secured a place in the second round for Otto Rehhagel's side.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Makaay on target</span></strong><br><br>For FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen, they will seek to repeat the victorious experience of their first-ever encounter against Israeli opposition despite having played almost 300 matches in European club competitions. A 64th-minute penalty from Roy Makaay proved the difference between the two sides in their meeting on the first matchday at the Ramat Gan stadium. Victory will all but secure Bayern's place in the knockout stage with Maccabi Tel-Aviv hoping to cause an upset to give them a chance of qualifying although challenging AFC Ajax for third position and a place in the UEFA Cup may seem a more realistic target.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: purple;">CL Preview: Bayern Munich - Maccabi Tel Aviv</span></span></strong><br><br>Bayern Munich are effectively one win away from Champions' League progression when they face Maccabi Tel Aviv in Group C on Tuesday.<br><br><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: orange;">BACKGROUND</span></span></strong><br><br>Having narrowly won the reverse fixture in Israel, Bayern followed up that unimpressive performance with an emphatic 4-0 win over Ajax at the Olympiastadion - a result that now seems destined to decide the group. Despite two rather unfortunate defeats to Juventus, the Bavarians are one win away from ensuring qualification, and see the Israeli's as the perfect victims, therby only needing to avoid a 5-0 defeat in Amsterdam to progess. However, Maccabi will be no pushover, and impressed in their surprise 2-1 win over Ajax last time out. Bayern have since gone top of the Bundesliga for the first time in 18 months, winning five of their last six domestic games. The 3-1 win over Kaiserslautern on Saturday was achieved after the concession of an early goal, and the Bavarian defence is less than watertight. The goal conceded at home to Juventus, where Torsten Frings and Owen Hargreaves were embarrassed by Zlatan Ibrahimovic is testament to that. Nevertheless, anything less than a Bayern win would be a major upset, especially with Nir Klinger's men losing three consecutive Israeli league matches in recent weeks. Yet, Frings is not complacent. "We mustnÂ’t underestimate the threat. We have to give it 100 percent if we want to win," he said in the match build-up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: blue;">Preview: Champions League  Bayern target spot in last sixteen    </span></span></strong><br><br>Bayern entertain Maccabi Tel Aviv in their penultimate Champions League group fixture on Tuesday evening 100 percent focused on beating a the bottom club in Group C and making a place in the Champions League last sixteen a virtual certainty. "We want to go out and finish the job," commented Sebastian Deisler as he voiced the club's determination to seal a vital three points.<br><br>"I don't think we'll let things get out of control against Tel-Aviv," head coach Felix Magath observed, keen to see his men safely through to the next round "so we can turn our full attention to the remaining Bundesliga programme." The boss will have been delighted at Roy Makaay reporting fit after hobbling injured from the field on Saturday. The Dutch ace has scored no less than 10 of Bayern's last 12 goals in European competition.<br><br>Makaay it was who slotted home from the spot for the only goal of the Reds' away meeting with Maccabi. Bayern had their work cut out breaking down their opponents' packed defence in that match, and Magath said he was expecting similar tactics on Tuesday with the Israelis looking for chances on the break. The coach ordered his men "to do what we did against Ajax," deploying a high-tempo passing game and scoring an early goal.<br><br>"We know how difficult it is against them," Torsten Frings commented. Both Juventus and Ajax struggled against Israel's most successful club, with Maccabi even defeating the Amsterdam giants 2-1 last time out for their first ever Champions League victory. "We mustn't underestimate the threat. We have to give it 100 percent if we want to win," Frings warned.<br><br>Nonetheless, Bayern start as overwhelming favourites against opponents who have yet to score away from home in Europe this term. Furthermore, coach Nir Klinger's men have fallen to three defeats on the bounce in their domestic league whereas Bayern have won four competitive matches in a row and are brimming with confidence after returning to the top of the Bundesliga. "We won't make the mistake of underestimating them," Frings continued, "we'll give it all we've got and win the match."<br><br>Should Bayern claim the points, they would be odds-on for a place in the first knock-out round. Ajax would need to win in Turin against Juventus in the parallel group fixture and then defeat Bayern by five clear goals in the last group match. "It's basically all in our own hands," Magath declared.</div>

Makaay himself is a minor doubt for the game as he recovers from a knock picked up in the weekend 3-1 win over Kaiserslautern, but both coach and player are confident he will be available to try and add to his 22 goals in the competition.<br><br>``It's a big game and I hope to be involved in it,'' said Makaay. The Dutchman is likely to be partnered once again by Claudio Pizarro as Magath resists the temptation to give Peruvian wonder-kid Jose Paolo Guerrero a full bow in Europe.<br><br>``Claudio Pizarro will start tomorrow and, as I don't intend to play with three strikers, Paolo will remain on the bench,'' Magath said.<br><br>Maccabi coach Nir Klinger, whose side are not mathematically out of the running for a place in the next stage, is delighted with the way his team have performed against some of the biggest names in European football.<br><br>Alongside Ajax, Juventus and Bayern, Maccabi have more than held their own despite being the clear group underdogs and they come into the game in Munich on the back of their first win in Europe -a 2-1 victory over Ajax a fortnight ago.<br><br>He said: ``After being drawn in a group with three of Europe's greatest teams, to still be in the competition going into the fifth round of matches is remarkable.<br><br>``But we know tomorrow will be a difficult game as Bayern are playing well at the moment whereas we have a few problems,'' added Klinger, whose side suffered a 3-0 defeat to Maccabi Haifa at the weekend - their third successive league loss.<br><br>``There is always a lot to lose in Europe, but a draw for us in the Olympiastadion would be fantastic.''</strong></div>
