Ismael Urzaiz, Joseba Etxeberria and Santi Ezquerra have all been passed fit by medical staff. However, Ander Murillo is a doubt after picking up an ankle injury. </strong></div>

If we work and run hard during matches then we have the basis and on top of this we have players that can break down teams and can score in front of goal.<br><br>``The signs are good at the moment that Betis can finish high up the table. ``Serra Ferrer is a trainer that knows me very well and knows what I can give to the team. I am helping the team and that is the role of a player. Little by little we are finding the style which the coach is looking for.<br><br>``We have now been with him for two and half months and the team has changed and we are showing our quality now.''<br><br>Ferrer was equally positive about the win and thinks the team can now go from strength to strength.<br><br>``The victory was important especially as it was against a team which was on a good run. Now we are approaching the zone in which we are looking for and it is pleasing to give the fans what they want,'' he said.<br><br>``We have shown that we have what is necessary to be successful and we are now capable of beating Levante in their own stadium. Barcelona played very well and did well in the first half but in the second Betis was better and scored two goals.''<br><br>Ferrer is likely to play Fernando Varela in left-midfield with Benjamin Zarandona injured and not making the trip to Valencia.<br><br>Levante coach Bernd Schuster left the Riazor fuming last weekend after his side was beaten by Deportivo La Coruna as a result of a debatable penalty.<br><br>The surprise package of the Primera Division this season are riding high among the European places will soon be able to welcome back Johan Mjallby from injury.<br><br>The Swedish centre-half returned to training this week but this weekend's match will be too soon for him. </strong></div>

Coach Miguel Angel Lotina has admitted that third-placed Espanyol cannot afford to get carried away despite their excellent start to the season, and also acknowledges they are unlikely to finish the season in the top four.<br><br>``I don't want to break the dreams of the people but the team needs to go on winning week in week out and the idea of us qualifying for the Champions League is a dream,'' he said.<br><br>``A lot depends on injuries but we also need to be realistic and have clear our real objective which is to fight, do things well and to stay in the top flight for another year.<br><br>``We are doing better than the last two years because we are conceding fewer goals. ``All the players know how to work defensively together, when we don't have the ball we defend and we are all together.''<br><br>Espanyol have achieved their success this season without Raul Tamudo and Ivan de la Pena, who were key players during the last campaign.<br><br>Both played an integral part in the Catalan side's survival, which was ensured in the final game of the season, but Tamudo did not start this year with his usual sharpness and is currently out with a thigh strain.<br><br>De la Pena started on the bench against Santander and Lotina insists he needs to learn to defend better.<br><br>Sevilla, meanwhile, undid some of their good work this season by losing to then- bottom side Numancia last weekend.<br><br>But Joaquin Caparros's charges are still sitting in sixth position and they are likely to be able to call on Ariza Makukula against Espanyol.<br><br>Makukula has been out of action for the last eight months with a serious knee injury but should return this weekend. </strong></div>
