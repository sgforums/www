            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">Madrid recovery to continue against Leverkusen?</span></span></strong><br><br>Goals from Jacek KrzynÃ³wek, FranÃ§a and Dimitar Berbatov powered Bayer 04 Leverkusen to a comprehensive 3-0 defeat of Real Madrid CF at the BayArena on the opening matchday of the 2004/05 UEFA Champions League season, a result that provided the German side with some revenge for past losses to their Spanish rivals.<br><br>FranÃ§a celebrates scoring for Bayer 04 Leverkusen against Real Madrid CF on the opening matchday<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fond memories</span></strong><br><br>Until that match, Madrid had only fond memories of their meetings with Leverkusen, especially as goals from RaÃºl GonzÃ¡lez (eight minutes) and ZinÃ©dine Zidane (45) helped the Spanish side to a 2-1 victory in the 2001/02 Champions League final at Glasgow's Hampden Park with Lucio (13) scoring for the German side. The success provided Madrid with their third European Champion Clubs' Cup success in five seasons - a sequence which they have not yet been able to extend.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Three in contention</span></strong><br><br>Now the two sides stand locked with FC Dynamo Kyiv on seven points in the group standings and victory for either side at the Santiago BernabÃ©u stadium could prove decisive with Leverkusen hosting Dynamo on the final matchday while Madrid travel to Rome to face the-already eliminated AS Roma.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Upper hand</span></strong><br><br>Prior to their meeting earlier this season, Madrid held the upper hand overall between the two sides having won four times and drawn once in five meetings. Previously, the two teams met in the 2000/01 Champions League first group stage with Madrid coming from 2-1 down to win a five-goal thriller in Leverkusen thanks to goals from Roberto Carlos (2) and Guti after Bernd Schneider and Michael Ballack had scored for the home side. In Madrid three weeks later, the two sides served up eight goals, but again Madrid proved too powerful as Guti (2), IvÃ¡n Helguera and RaÃºl put the home side 4-2 ahead before LuÃ­s Figo secured a 5-3 win three minutes from time. Goals from Thomas Brdaric, Ulf Kirsten and Paulo Rink kept Leverkusen in the game until Figo had his crucial say.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Home advantage pays</span></strong><br><br>En route to their 1997/98 Champions League success, Madrid encountered Leverkusen at the quarter-final stage. A tense opening leg in Leverkusen ended even with a Stefan Beinlich goal after 18 minutes cancelled out by Christian Karembeu's equaliser 16 minutes from time. But Madrid, then managed by German coach Jupp Heynckes, pulled away in the home leg, winning 3-0 thanks to second half goals from Karembeu, Fernando Morientes and Fernando Hierro.</div>

Kiev take on already eliminated Roma, while a win for either side in the Bernabeu will see them qualify due to head-to-head results.<br><br>The Germans will be in a confident mood entering the game following their 3-0 win over Madrid on matchday one, but Real have won the previous two Champions League encounters between the sides in Spain Â– in the 1997-98 and 2000-01 seasons Â– and also beat their German opponents in the 2002 final in Glasgow.</div>

The Spanish international has already scored three times in this seasonÂ’s competition and has admitted on the official Champions League website www.uefa.com that Â“to play as badly as we did on Saturday would be difficult, I hope that in the forthcoming matches we will see a different Madrid sideÂ”.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bayer Leverkusen </span></strong><br><br>Number nine Dimitar Berbatov is likely to be LeverkusenÂ’s main threat in the Bernabeu.

The German side's 3-0 win was one of the early signs that all was not well at the Bernabeu and marked the beginning of the end for Jose Antonio Camacho, who resigned as first team coach less than a week afterwards.<br><br>Salgado knows his side have a long wait before they have the chance to avenge the defeat to Barca, but is eager to set the record straight against Bayer on Tuesday.<br><br>``It is a shame we can't play Barca again tomorrow, so we will have to take it out on Bayer. That is the most important game at the moment,'' he said.<br><br>``We have talked about what happened in the Barcelona game and reached the conclusion that we cannot allow it to affect us on Tuesday.<br><br>``Tuesday night is what we are thinking about now, because everything will be forgotten if we can beat Bayer Leverkusen,'' said Salgado.<br><br>A win for Madrid will see them mathematically through to the last 16 of the Champions League, whereas a draw would leave them needing a win away to Roma on December 8 to make sure.<br><br>Defeat, however, could prove costly with Bayer through and Kiev likely to join them. England captain David Beckham, who may play on the right-hand side of midfield on Tuesday, knows three points is the only option.<br><br>``We have not spoken about the Leverkusen game, we don't need to, we need to win it full stop,'' said Beckham.<br><br>Ivan Helguera returns to the Madrid line-up after missing the trip to Barcelona through injury with either Francisco Pavon or Walter Samuel dropping to the bench.<br><br>Meanwhile, Leverkusen coach Klaus Augenthaler believes his side will not have a better chance to beat Madrid than when the two sides meet at the Bernabeu.<br><br>Like their opponents, Leverkusen suffered a humiliating 3-0 defeat at the weekend - at home to Schalke - and will be looking to get back to winning ways in the Champions League.<br><br>``We have a great chance of reaching the next round in Madrid and we have to make the most of it,'' he said.<br><br>``However, they will come at us and try to overrun us, especially after the disgrace against Barcelona.''<br><br>Marko Babic is expected to be handed a place in the starting line-up at the expense of Diego Placente, with the Croatian providing more of an attacking option on the left of midfield. </strong></div>
