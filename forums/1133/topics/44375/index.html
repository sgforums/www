            <div class='col-md body'>Real Madrid make the boastful claim that the Champions League is their competition, but their ownership may be given up if they produce a performance similar to the one that saw them dismantled by Mallorca last Saturday.<br><br>The club are still top of the Spanish league and remain favourites to lift the European Cup again this season, but the 5-1 crushing will surely have left a few scars. Coach Vicente Del Bosque tried to brush off the team's most miserable performance in recent years, but this was no ordinary blow while one eye remained on the main prize in midweek.<br><br>"During this season we have done more things of merit than we have committed errors," Del Bosque explained. "We are very confident about our game and, as many have said, we have already played a final against Manchester United and won and now we play another huge game against Juventus and must do the same."<br><br>There were signs of nerves from Zidane though, as he explained that Real are pleased that their opponents will be missing three key players in Paolo Montero, Edgar Davids and Alessio Tacchinardi. "Juve will definitely miss them, there is not doubt about that," the Frenchman explained. "It certainly makes life a little easier for us."<br><br>The club's supporters certainly let their feelings be known as they jeered and whistled captain Fernando Hierro throughout the match and booed the team off at the end of the game. Despite all this though, Madrid have splashed out millions of euros on players that can perform at the highest level and when it matters most. The likes of Zinedine Zidane, Luis Figo and Ronaldo will called upon to justify the massive outlay and their huge wages.<br><br>Juventus have gone about their business in typically efficient style in recent weeks, and following the 0-0 draw with Lazio on Saturday, they all but wrapped up another Scudetto. They would have to lose their remaining three games, and Inter would have to win theirs, in order for the title to leave Turin. And lets face it, there is more chance of a pig flying over the Delle Alpi than Juve surrendering such a handsome lead.<br><br>A draw on Saturday was a fine result in one of Serie A's tougher road tests. But it was hardly a performance that inspired, and with the exception of a couple of periods in the first-half, Lazio were the better team by some distance. The Bianconeri lacked a creative spark Â–surprising given that Pavel Nedved and Alessandro Del Piero both featured- and often rode their luck at the back. Were it not for Stefano Fiore's miserable penalty, they would have lost.<br><br>Del Piero has always been considered Juve's 'symbol', and while he remains so, much of the attention will now be placed on Nedved who has enjoyed a supreme season. He was bought to replace Zidane, and while no one can be compared to the mercurial Frenchman, the former Lazio man is only a level or two below. When he plays well, so, invariably, do Juve.<br><br>So how can Juve go about getting a positive result at the Bernabeu? AS Roma coach Fabio Capello, whose team have won their 1-0 this season, thinks he knows how.<br><br>"If you go at their defence with pace they are vulnerable," he told La Gazzetta dello Sport. "But above all you can't give their big stars space to play in. You have to close them down in every area of the field without ever stopping from playing yourself, because at the Bernabeu if you just close up shop you are finished."<br><br>Lippi will no doubt have done his homework, and will know that Hierro and Helguera are not the quickest things on two legs.<br><br>And Lippi himself says: "Real will certainly try to play attacking football at the Bernabeu as that is their main weapon. But we have weapons of our own that have been very effective so far."<br><br>A chilling threat indeed.<br><br>FORM GUIDE<br><br>Real Madrid: Last Six Matches - WLDLWL<br><br>Despite losing the second leg of the quarter finals to Manchester United at Old Trafford, it was evident that had the aggregate score ever been in doubt Madrid were capable of raising their game and producing what was needed to win. What is of greater concern is the fact that Del Bosque's side have lost three of their last six outings.<br><br>Juventus: Last Six Matches - DDWWWD<br><br>The 2-1 win at Barcelona was achieved in fortuitous style, but Juve had no other option than to play on the counterattack once Davids had received his marching orders. It was a majestic break up field that culminated in Alessandro Birindelli superbly crossing for Marcelo Zalayeta to convert for the winning goal. Since then, a 2-1 defeat of Brescia and a 0-0 draw at Lazio have put the Bianconeri to within a point of the Scudetto.<br><br>LATEST TEAM NEWS<br><br>Real Madrid: Vicente Del Bosque's only dilemma is whether to start Flavio Conceicao or Steve McManaman in the midfield. The Brazilian is likly to get the nod over the Englishman with that being the only change from the team that were so unconvincing against Mallorca. Raul is still recovering from his appendicitis operation, but is set to play in the second leg next week with Del Bosque describing his return as the element that will surprise Juve in Turin.<br><br>Juventus: The Bianconeri are missing three key players through suspension. Montero and Tacchinardi picked up their third bookings of the competition against Barcelona, while Davids was stupidly sent-off in that game. The latter two have enjoyed excellent seasons, while Montero is such a reliable individual at the back. Three potentially fatal blows. Arguably your most reliable centre-back, and the heart of your midfield engine room ripped out. Mark Iuliano will come in for Montero, while Igor Tudor and Antonio Conte could replace Tacchinardi and Davids. Either Alessandro Birindelli or Gianluca Pessotto may get the nod, however, with Lippi wanting to pay close attention to Zidane.<br><br>PROBABLE LINE-UPS<br><br>Real Madrid: Casillas; Michel Salgado, Hierro, Helguera, Roberto Carlos; Figo, Conceicao, Makelele, Zidane; Guti, Ronaldo<br><br>Juventus: Buffon; Thuram, Ferrara, Iuliano, Zambrotta; Camoranesi, Tudor, Conte, Nedved; Del Piero, Trezeguet<br><br>WHO'S HOT<br><br>Ronaldo (Real Madrid): After enduring a hard season of adjustment at Madrid, Ronaldo appears to have won over the club's fans. His impressive hat-trick against Manchester United in the last round proved that he still has what it takes to perform on the biggest stages and Juve will do well to stop him adding to his Champions League tally.<br><br>Pavel Nedved (Juventus): The Czech international will float about behind Trezeguet and Del Piero causing his usual havoc. In Zidane, he may actually be coming up against the only other playmaker in the world who is better than him. He'll be out to impress.<br><br>WHO'S NOT<br><br>Fernando Hierro (Real Madrid): The team captain was given a torrid time by the supporters during the Mallorca match, but accepted that as leader of the side they had every right to pick him out. But if Real do not perform against Juve, he could be in for another 90 minutes of abuse from the stands.<br><br>David Trezeguet (Juventus): the Frenchman had a very quiet game against Lazio. It remains to be seen if he is back to peak condition following his shoulder injury. If he gets the support, however, he will punish the Merengues.<br></div>
