            <div class='col-md body'>Here is a piece  written by Andy Rooney - CBS 60 Minutes.<br>---------------------------------------------------------<br>Andy Rooney  says:<br><br>As I grow in age, I  value women who are over 30 most of all. Here are just a few reasons why:<br><br>A woman over 30 will  never wake you in the middle of the night to ask,"What are you thinking?"   She doesn't care what you think.<br><br>If a woman over 30  doesn't want to watch the game, she doesn't sit around whining about it. She does something she wants to do. And, it's usually something more  interesting.<br><br>A woman over 30 knows herself well enough to be assured in who she is, what she is, what she wants and from whom.<br><br>Few women past the age of 30 give a damn what you might think about her or what she's  doing.<br><br>Women over 30 are dignified. They seldom have a screaming match with you at the opera or in the middle of an expensive restaurant.<br><br>Of course, if you deserve it, they won't hesitate to shoot you, if they think they can get away with it.<br><br>Older women are generous with praise, often undeserved. They know what it's like to be unappreciated.<br><br>A woman over 30 has the self-assurance to introduce you to her women friends. A younger woman with a man will often ignore even her best friend because she doesn't trust the guy with other women.<br><br>Women over 30 couldn't care less if you're attracted to her friends because she knows her  friends won't betray her.<br><br>Women get psychic as they age. You never have to confess your sins to a woman over 30. They always know.<br><br>A woman over 30 looks good wearing bright red lipstick. This is not true of younger women or drag queens.<br><br>Once you get past a wrinkle or two, a woman over 30 is far sexier than her younger counterpart.<br><br>Older women are forthright and honest. They'll tell you right off if you are a jerk if you are acting like one! You don't ever have to wonder where you stand with her.<br><br>Yes, we praise women over 30 for a multitude of reasons. Unfortunately, it's not reciprocal. For every stunning, smart, well-coiffed hot woman of 30+, there is a bald, paunchy  relic in yellow pants making a fool of himself with some 22-year-old waitress.<br><br>Ladies, I  apologize.<br><br>Andy  Rooney<br><br>For all those men who  say, "Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free". Here's an update for you. Nowadays 80% of women are against marriage, why? Because women realize it's not worth buying an entire pig, just to get a little sausage...<br></div>
