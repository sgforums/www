            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">Who is at greatest risk of being harmed by second-hand smoke?</span><br>Although any person who spends a lot of time around those who smoke has an increased chance of developing a smoking-related illness, certain people are extremely susceptible to the harmful effects of second-hand smoke. These include:<br><br><span style="color: red;">Â· Service industry workers, such as bartenders and restaurant servers.</span> People who work in an environment where they are constantly exposed to smokers may absorb carcinogens and other harmful substances from second-hand tobacco smoke on a regular basis. This puts them at greater risk of developing respiratory infections and other illnesses.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Â· Pregnant women.</span> Second hand-smoke harms not only the mother-to-be, but her unborn child as well. It increases both her and her baby's risk of developing lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, allergies, asthma and other health problems.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Â· Infants and children.</span> Because young children canÂ’t choose to leave a smoke-filled environment, this constant exposure makes them especially vulnerable to the health risks of second-hand smoke. Infants and children who are regularly exposed to second-hand smoke have an increased chance of developing the following conditions:<br>o Frequent colds<br>o Asthma<br>o Chronic coughs<br>o Ear infections<br>o High blood pressure<br>o Learning and behavior problems later in childhood<br><br>In addition, among infants up to 18 months of age, second-hand smoke is associated with as many as 300,000 cases of bronchitis and pneumonia each year.<br><br></div>
