I noticed that they mentioned a few qualities in their husbands that they found attractive were :<br><br>- Ardent Devotion.  He saw her at her worst moments, and still stayed on and still loved her.  I mean, we all have our good and bad moments, our mood swings, our occasional temper tantrums, and we sure wouldn't like to be judged based on that!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Everyone's a devil sometimes.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">   It'll be nice to know that after we return to our angel mode, he's STILL standing around and he STILL loves us.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>- 'I only have eyes for you'... meaning, he made it obvious to her that he wanted her, and only her, nobody else can replace her.  She might have rejected him in the beginning because 'I didn't have chemistry with him', or 'he didn't fit my profile of a match' or 'he had habits I didn't like', etc. but he was tenacious in his pursuit of her, never giving up.  And so, the best man wins the girl!    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>- Sincerity.  Truthfulness.  Honesty.<br><br>- Decisiveness and Steadfastness.  He was ready to commit to her and his actions spoke louder than words.  He didn't need to be prodded or threatened or forced or whatever to take action.<br><br>- Emotionally and Mentally Healthy.  He shouldn't have emotional baggages nor a pessimistic or cynical view of life that bogs him down and which would drag her down in the long run as well.  They used to have boyfriends who were commitmentphobics or chauvinists or spiritually broken and not healed yet from past hurts and they decided that it's best to walk away from men who aren't ready for a real relationship.  Your chances of winning a battle is much higher if you have a soldier who is equipped, well-trained, and mentally ready for the battle.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>- Companionship.  She is able to envision life with him, even when they're just lounging around, nua-ing, doing nothing in particular.  She can visualise growing old with him with a sweet smile on her face, no cold sweat, no frown lines.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>- Similar goals / morals / dreams / interests / religion / thoughts about family.  Some fundamental issues have got to be similar.<br><br>It's always interesting talking to married folks.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">   I just learnt the night before that one of my colleagues actually went to the ROM with her husband just six months after they met!  And they remain happily married with two kids and she says to this day, they have never had any major fights or quarrels.  Isn't that sweet?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Then there was this colleague who thought her husband was crass and didn't like him in the beginning but they've now been married for two years and she's expecting their very first baby.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   I asked her how she had a sudden change re. her husband and she just said, 'There was absolutely no feelings, no chemistry, no attraction at first, but we just gradually accepted and loved each other over the years'.<br><br>None of their husbands are in any way rich.  In fact, these ladies have to continue working because they have to remain a dual-income family so, nope, it's not all because of the $$, nor the car, nor the condo, nor the credit card.  There are wholesome girls out there who are able to see beyond the material but guys, you HAVE to learn how to SEE them because usually, these girls aren't the flashy, loud, 'happenin' people.<br><br>Truth is, a lot of guys go out looking for rabbits in a deer hunt, and that's why the catch is always a misfit.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Or, you try to aim for a deer with equipment that's meant for harnessing rabbits (meaning, you aim outside your range, guaranteeing sure rejection).<br><br></div>
