            <div class='col-md body'>Looking for the right woman is like a deer being chased down by a pack of hounds. Show the slightest fear and you get ripped into shreds. It's a tough dating world out there, women usually want to see your credit balance AND bank account before they even give you their phone number.<br><br>There are a few different subspecies of "Women" out there<br><br>The MMTG hunters. (more money than god) They're just looking for the richest guys that will accept them. Guys like Ryan get to be shoulders to cry on while they bitch about the rich buggers they're really after. They'll rip out your heart, put in a blender and press "thready!" They can be spotted by their slightly upturn noses and their uncanny ability to sniff out how much cash you have in you wallet from 50 yards. Can be spotted by their ultra chic clothes and Prada handbags. (from the last prey they downed)<br><br>The Disguised Monster. They are unusually difficult to spot as they're disguised as your everyday "girl-next-door". They turn ugly the moment things get tough. Quickly divorcing you and cleaning out your every cent the moment you hit a road bump in your career.<br><br>The Subservient Wife. A species that has been extinct for the last 150 years or so. Though various mutant species appear from time to time. Completely impossible to find in Singapore as evidenced by the number of Singaporean men seeking Mail Order Brides from China, Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand. The mutant strains of the subservient wife usually appear docile in their native countries but rapidly transforms when brought out of their natural habitat. They're well adapt at excaping any forms of dosmetic confinement to quickly disappear back to their motherland. Mostly with a large junk of their spouse's cash.<br><br>Can't think of any more at the moment. Too sleepy.<br></div>
