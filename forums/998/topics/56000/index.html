But if he doesn't loves you then he is just after your cherries besides he will just go and find another girl to add to his list of girls that he had sex with. To regret once he has lost you then i think this guy isn't worth your time. If you can break up once, you can try a second time but if it happens a third time... what is the point of continuing this relationship. Break and patch over and over again is no joke. I have been through this for 6 years and it wasn't easy. In the end, either one of you will just give up or both at the same time. Love makes us blind... what to do?<br><br></div>

If you both broke up once and he wants another chance. Its your choice whether to give that second chance but if its the same results after you give your second chance. My advice would be "don't bother with him anymore".</div>

But then i am not you so the choice is yours. Sometimes, your love for him may be stronger than anything else. Don't let others make the final decision for you but make the choice yourself. If it works out, it works out and if it doesn't then you can't blame anyone or have any regrets.</div>
