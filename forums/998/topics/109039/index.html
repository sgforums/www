On his 22nd birthday, I brought my new bf along and he was heart-broken because he thought he had a chance since I broke up with my ex.

Never once have I lead him on and I have always made things clear to him. Never once did he say to me,"I like you more than a friend" other than his 22nd birthday. Never once have we done or even have any physical contact beyond what is considered more than a friend.<br><br>I've always believed that a girl and a guy can just be very good friends but since this incident I have changed my mind.<br><br></div>
