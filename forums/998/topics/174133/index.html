            <div class='col-md body'>Wow, today is certainly not a good day.  I almost fall overboard half an hour ago.  The freaking lifeline came loose as I was leaning on it to look over the sponson.  As my upper body started to go forward, my knees hit the deck and I stablized myself.  Boy, my face was all white and pale.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">.  The good thing that came out of it is that I will be sure to be more careful.  Then after that a few guys and me have to bring the paint punt onboard and I trip over some wooden blocks or w/e they have on the pier.  The boat almost hit my head.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">.  So, I think I should just go ahead and sleep the day off in my rack.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> .  But, duty calls.  Yeah, I don't know why I am sharing this, it's not like you guys care or anything.     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">.<br><br>If you guys don't see me around tomorrow, I will most likely be injured or fish food.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, anyone misses me?  I know you did, come one just post it out loud.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">.  Anyway, just in case anyone care here is a little update.  I have left Sasebo, been to Nagoya, Japan and just arrived in Moruran, Japan.  Nagoya was ok, went to a little tour and walk around Sakae.  Oh, if you are into those things, they got "massage palors" all over Sakae.  They have the pics posted outside which I think is very nice of them.  I was tempted, but I am glad to report I didn't went inside.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.  I don't paid to get laid, thank you every much.  I still want to know about these places though, so I could help my shipmates out.  They can't all be as good looking as me you know.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">.  Now about Moruran, or rather a place near it, Sapporo.  Sapporo has a snow festival which by all accounts is a feast for the eyes.  They got amazing structures made of ice all over the place.  I have seen some pics online and I am impressed; can't wait to see it in person.  And another good thing about Moruran is that it's the last port in Japan before we head off to other countries, including of course, SG.  Speaking of SG, still need someone to show me around.  Although I heard that it will be a working port of us, so I might get off work a little late.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">.  If I am in a good mood, I may even post some pics I will take of the festival at the end of the week.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">.  Cheers.<br><br>On a side note, it's freaking freezing outside....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Snow Festival was ok, not all it was hyped up to be.  So I won't say anything more.  Hong Kong was fantastic though.  Whoo...love the food, the sights, the shopping and of course, the girls.  I wasn't really looking at them, too busy trying to get everything in*. It can be a little overwhelming with high buildings towering over you and waves and waves of people rushing by you.  Incidentally, you will be pushed and shoved a couple times.  I won't go into detail on Hong Kong either, you need to visit it sometimes.  No one cares anyway, right?  Suffice to said I had a fantastic time there.  Next stop, Thailand......<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>*Ahem, after reading this sentence over again, I came to think the placement could be a tad better.  When I say everthing in; I meant the sights, smells and sounds.  If you think otherwise, you need to get your mind out of the gutter and into something more decent.  That is all.</div>
