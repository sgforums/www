            <div class='col-md body'>I was thinking, there seem to be certain misconceptions and misunderstandings about me.  As for where these stems from, I have no clue.  All my posts are decent, I don't think I had written anything to the contrary.  I am a nice guy really, well..most of the time.  ^_-.   Anyway, got here in Thailand yesterday and already saw too many ladyboys than I like.  I ate at a Thai fast food place and almost burned my tongue off by the evil tom yum kung.  I really thought the little green "peapod" was really a peapod.  Appearance can be decieving, I had tears coming down my eyes and drinking a bottle of water has little effect on the sensation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">.  I suppose I have to watch for both the food and the "girls" in disguise now.  On another matter, the real girls here are cute.  I think I should smile more....  Umm anyway, I was counting the posts and I do believe there is a total of 10 posts by persons other than yours truly.  As promised, I included a link of one of my better pics or so I think.  The pic was taken outside a restuarant in New Calendonia, hence the toothpick.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">.  For those of you who don't know, New Caledonia is a French territory located around the New Zealand area.  Look it up, you can say that you learned a new thing today.  ^_^.<br><br>deleted</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So how you all doing?  I am happy to report I will be in your backyard tommorrow.  Sounds unexpected huh?  Well, by backyard I mean the neighbor right above your island home.  Yes, I will be in Malaysia, the ( forgot the slogan of the commerical on CNN).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">.  Anyway, if you do actually want me in your backyard, you only need to give me your address as I will be in SG very soon.  Speaking of backyards, I hope you have a ladder set up for me.  ^_-.  Ok, all joking aside, I do want to mention that after SG you won't be seeing me for quite a while.  I may stop by here once a month or maybe just wait until next year to come visit the site again.  It's not I got any friends here you know.  So all you guys only have to put up with me for about four more posts.  Ok, I believe that covers everything.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am happy to report that I am still safe and sound after a port visit to KL.  I choose to forego my usual report on the visit and instead wants to mention something else.   The port was a good one, mind you.  I just don't feel like saying too much; which I am sure some of you would appreciated.  Anyway, you guys will be seeing me in Singapore tomorrow if you are lucky.   If you see a tall, Chinese guy walking around with a camera and looking likes he's lost, please lend a hand.  ^_^.  Most likely, that Chinese guy will have one or more persons with him.   I probably won't come down to that, but never hurt to have a little safety net.  So anyone here got any must-see places in SG to recommend?  Oh and where do the pretty girls hang out at?  ^_-.</div>
