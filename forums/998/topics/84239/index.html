            <div class='col-md body'>CUNNILINGUS - THE BEST WAY TO EAT PUSSY<br>When a woman finds a man who gives good head, (cunnilingus) she's found a treasure she's not going to let go of too quickly. (all the men in double O please take note)     There is nothing that makes a woman more unique than her pussy. They come in all different sizes, colors and shapes; some are tucked inside and some have thick luscious lips  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>One side of her clitoris is normally more sensitive than the other. If she doesn't know which side - experiment. When a woman becomes aroused, the clitoris becomes engorged. The more engorged, the more it craves to be touched. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Take A Look <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> ( we r not the eneginer bunny just waiting to be screw)<br>Be sure to wet your finger(s) before you touch her clit because it doesn't have its own juices and it's extremely sensitive. Your finger will stick to it if it's dry and that hurts. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  Whenever you touch her pussy, make sure your finger is wet. You can lick it or moisten it with juices from inside her. Before she becomes aroused, her clit is too delicate to be handled.<br><br>Gently peeling apart the labia minora, her small lips, and look at her inner lips, even lick them if you want to. With the tip of your wet finger slide it upward until you reach her little pink bud of flesh in the front. If you are in front of her, you can find it where all the whorls and folds of skin come together at the top of her vagina. The clitoris is about the size of the tip of your little finger. This is the most erotically sensitive spot in a woman's body. Its sole purpose is receiving pleasure.<br><br>Tease Her <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>Women love to be teased. The inner part of her thigh is her most tender spot. Lick it, kiss it, make designs on it with the tip of your tongue. Come close to her pussy, then float away. Make her anticipate it. Now lick the crease where her leg joins her pussy. Nuzzle your face into her bush. Brush your lips over her slit without pressing down on it to further excite her.<br><br>When sheÂ’s bucking up and straining to get more of you closer to her, put your lips right on top of her slit. Kiss her gently, then harder. Now use your tongue to separate her pussy lips and when she opens up, run your tongue up and down between the layers of pussy flesh.<br><br>Tongue Fucking<br>Gently, spread her legs more with your hands. Tongue-fuck her. This feels divine. It also teases the hell out of her because by now she wants some attention given to her clit. Quickly push your tongue in and out of her wet pussy, alternate between quick and slow thrusts. DonÂ’t forget to run your tongue up the full length of her pussy lips just nipping at her clitoral bud. Never use your teeth.<br><br>Clitoral Orgasm<br>See if her clit has become hard enough to peek out of its hood. If so, lick it. If you can't see it, it might still be waiting for you underneath. Bring your tongue up to the top of her slit and feel for her clit. If you can't feel the tiny bud, you can make it rise by licking the skin that covers it. Lick hard now and press into her skin. Gently pull her pussy lips away and flick your tongue quickly against her clit, hood covered or not. Her legs should shudder. When you sense she's getting up there toward orgasm, make your lips into an O and take the clit into your mouth. Start to suck gently and watch her face for her reaction. If she can handle it, begin to suck harder. If sheÂ’s into it, suck even harder.<br><br>Go with her. Move with her as she lifts her pelvis into the air with the tension of her rising orgasm. Don't fight her. Hang on, and keep your hot mouth on her clit. Don't let go. That's what she'll be saying too: "Don't stop. Don't ever stop!" There's a reason for that, most men stop too soon.<br><br>Finger Fucking &amp; Orgasm<br>You can finger-fuck her while she's enjoying your clit-licking talents. Before, during or after, she'll like it all. In addition to the erogenous zones surrounding her clit, a woman has another extremely sensitive area at the roof of her vagina. This is what you rub up against when you're fucking her. The infamous G-Spot. Your fingers will have to do the fucking. Take two fingers. One is too skinny and three is too wide and can't get deep enough into her pussy. Make sure they're wet. Slide them inside, slowly at first, then a little faster. Fuck her with rhythm. Speed up when she does. Listen to her breathing. She'll let you know what to do. If you're sucking her clit and finger-fucking her at the same time, you're giving her far more stimulation than you would with your cock alone. You can count on it that she's getting high on this.<br><br>When she starts to have an orgasm don't let go of that clit. Hang in there. When she starts to come down from the first orgasm, press your tongue along the underside of the clit, leaving your lips covering the top. Move your tongue in and out of her cunt. If your fingers are inside, move them a little too, gently though, things are extremely sensitive just now. If you play your cards right, you'll get some multiple orgasms this way. A woman can stay excited for a full hour after she's had an orgasm.<br><br>Don't leave her alone just yet. Talk to her, stroke her body, caress her breasts and keep making love to her quietly until she's come all the way down.<br><br>hi all i just read this online i i felt for the benefit of the men out there who just dont know how to enjoy a meal  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  better pick up some skills and tips.<br><br>gals add anything if u wanna or use it as a reference guide.<br><br>cheers<br>celine<br><br></div>
