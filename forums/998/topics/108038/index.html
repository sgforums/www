            <div class='col-md body'>From my experience and most of my friends' experience with their girlfriends, I've noticed a change in the mindsets of singapore women. They seemed to be more demanding nowadays, in another words, super high maintainance!! let me compile a list of the signs and symtoms<br><br>1. They demand most of your time, either its talking over the phone with you even though your friends are around or whend your're working and they refuse to hang up.<br><br>2. They expect or demand you to send them to work and fetch them home almost everyday, if you happen to own a vehicle.<br><br>3. If they go out with a guy who you know is definitely courting her, they think that you are being paranoid and that they're just friends going out. But if you go out with a girl, all hell breaks loose.<br><br>4. When you're courting a girl who you like, she'll try her very best to bait you  till the time when you ask her whether she can be your girlfriend or not, then they'll tell you they already have a boyfriend.<br><br>5. They expect you to listen to their troubles/woes everytime and you'll have to lend a listening ear or a shoulder to cry on. When you call them to tell them about your problems, they'll always be busy or another line is engaged.<br><br>6. For the first few weeks or months, depending on how lucky you are, they'll put on their best behaviour and be the best girlfriend one could ever hope for. But after this certain grace period, they'll fight with you over the most insignificant things</div>

My friends and I have our own group of friends and we certainly don't cling to our bfs or husbands  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Please, most girls appreciate the freedom they have.</strong><br><br>2. They expect or demand you to send them to work and fetch them home almost everyday, if you happen to own a vehicle.<br><strong>Nope. Not necessary at all. Doesn't make sense if workplace is too far apart</strong><br><br>3. If they go out with a guy who you know is definitely courting her, they think that you are being paranoid and that they're just friends going out. But if you go out with a girl, all hell breaks loose.<br><strong>Oh please, I don't believe in double standards. A lot of girls don't as well. I guess you're just unlucky or the girl is very immature.</strong><br><br>4. When you're courting a girl who you like, she'll try her very best to bait you  till the time when you ask her whether she can be your girlfriend or not, then they'll tell you they already have a boyfriend.<br><strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  I can only say that not all girls are that bo liao and need to ascertain that they are attractive.</strong><br><br>5.

When you call them to tell them about your problems, they'll always be busy or another line is engaged.<br><strong>Not true for me and my friends. I guess you're unlucky again</strong><br><br>6. For the first few weeks or months, depending on how lucky you are, they'll put on their best behaviour and be the best girlfriend one could ever hope for. But after this certain grace period, they'll fight with you over the most insignificant things<br><strong>I believe that in a relationship is like a partnership and there must be 'give and take'. However, do note that sometimes guys are also the culprit for setting expectations in a girl. DO NOT do things that you cannot continue to carry out further into the relationship because you have already set the expectation. If you do not continue to carry it out, it will be perceived that you are taking her for granted and do not love her anymore. </strong><br><br>Anyway, it is not the majority of girls that are like you said. Don't forget that the black sheep will always stand out.</div>

(the pocket money thingy gave me a horror). i always believed from what you behaved, you are going the get the kind of girls who like that. so if you give them expensive things right from the start, you may gain a rep of being of those guys who think you can lure a girl just by using money, even though deep inside, that's not what you are.</div>
