            <div class='col-md body'>Yes I think they have changed. Its unevitable and a sign of the times. As to what some others have said, I think you already realise some of the changes yourself subconciously from the way you behave.<br><br>But what I find puzzling is that you are probably one of those dudes belonging to the "upper class". Rich and educated. For such a successful person which I "presume" you are, why should you allow those shallow women to dicate your life and your feelings.<br><br>The more successful you are, the less you should trust women. "Hint,Hint"<br>The fact is I don't think you should even commit yourself to one person until you are sure of how she is like. Some ladies might regard this as a "low-down" method and a sign of insincerity. But it the playing field is fair and I dare say local ladies also do the same although in a more "subtle" and less obvious way.<br><br>Of course if you ultimately really want to find someone who can accept you for who you are, you can simply conceal your $ and your "paper". But you and I know how your chances will stand then <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>So its up to you. Really.</div>

Out of all the things you listed that you did for your girl, what would have touched me the most would have been the being there for me and the gift of 9999 love peas...nothing else...I dont think you would have any problems matching up to a modern womans "standards"...I dont think loving someone with all your heart is wrong.....I do think you need to look at your reasons for choosing the type of girls that you have had as girlfriends so far.......<br><br></div>
