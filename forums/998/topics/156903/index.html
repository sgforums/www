If you've been in Canada, why the heck would u wanna do a postgrad in sg? or stay in sg for that matter? there is a reason why people are jumping the boat faster than bunnies are multiplying and why many people who are staying in singapore are wishing otherwise.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i will leave canada for sure in 2 years becusae i really don't like it here. HK is my home, i must return to HK and i love it in HK too much. on the other hand i would like to study my masters...so my 2 choices are either in HK or in SG. since both cities are very alike in a lack of resource but a flourishing economy and especially when land is scarce, urban management knowledge is necessary.  and i like it in singapore too much, i just very very comfortable there...i have't been to a place long enough that gives me this feeling and i know that i'm staying for sure..don't know how long though but i also want to establish business connections in my family's business from SG &lt;-&gt; HK....so will definitely stay for a couple years..but i also will fly back and forth..the ticket from HK to SG is rather cheap especially during low seasons!<br><br>BTW i am really looking forward to meet you all! if you wanna chat..hit me up on MSN<br><br>freshyip@hotmail.com<br><br>let me know if any of you will come to HK for a visit! i'll make your trip REAL worthwile  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
