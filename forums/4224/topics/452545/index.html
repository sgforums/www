              <p>Since secondary 1 of Normal Technical level, I have been scoring the top scores and never really had to study hard because I'm a fast learner and I can remember things well. Other than words that has more than 3 syllabus, the word is most probably already in my mind. I have always dreamt big and I want to strive. The reason I couldn't get promoted to Normal Academic is because I did very badly for Chinese. Chinese was one subject I could never understand.</p>
              <p>At secondary 4, I took N levels and I was allowed by MOE to transfer to Normal Academic only if my principal allowed. I scored a "B" for Math because my teacher couldn't teach algebra to us as most students which he deems as more important than me needed the basic lessons all over again. However, despite the request, he refused. So I had to enter ITE.</p>
              <p>Here in ITE, the enviorment is really bad. You do learn some important skills but it is taught very slowly. So slow, I usually become impatient and start being in a foul mood. That hasn't affected my attention in class though. I was doing well, certainly but the thought of having to spend 2 years learning something which I could learn in a few months and graduate from university lateron at the age of 28 is demoralising me. I get worried a lot and I have instances when I teared for realising a few stuff like the lacking education I'm forced into by the government. I admited I was wrong to have scored too low for PSLE but I have changed since then, it have already been 4 years and I have not even met a single person who shares my thoughts or interest at my level. All those students cared about is what their other friend does, it's usually uninteresting and much predictable.</p>
              <p>Now, I thought of requesting from ITE to allow me entry into the Polytechnic after a year and 3 months(since poly starts around at the 3rd month) NITEC education, would that be possible? Me being able to do well in Poly is out of the question, since I enjoy studing computers and I am a fast learner. I could understand anything easily but not memorise the whole history textbook(I have tried).</p>
              <p>Will you give me your proper advise or information? I'm really sick of my life even though I am getting fed bursaries or upgrade scholarships. It's worthless to what I want to achieve. Even though the scholarship from ite has made me a little feel better then.</p>

              <p>Summer:</p>
              <p>The reason I got into NT was because of my PSLE result. I got 149. It was all thanks to my computer addiction that I wasn't bothered with my studies.Â I was playing great addicting games then(Warcraft, ElderScroll III, Diablo 2 and Runescape), apprently it was inevitable to set myself to study.Â That was why I was in NT.</p>
              <p>To make it clear, I was an average learner. Right now, I am considered as a fast learner judging from the way I could learnt new things in ite. Given my ability, I could learn so much more, and as a teenager I do not wish to waste another year to learning redundant syllabus.</p>
              <p>I know algebra requires foundation but it isn't as difficult as the way you have put it. Anyhow, in N/T we hardly learned any complex algebra but since all algebra, simple or not, requires understanding, I needed help from my teacher. I was the top student, but wasn't promoted because of my bad Chinese results, I merely passed. (I got "B" for the N levels though.)</p>

              <p>Hello</p>
              <p>It is good that you have realised your learning ability and have confidence in it.</p>
              <p>I understand how you feel when your school don't allow you to transfer into NA. I believe it's not the school's fault for not allowing you to do so, as i encounted similar problems as you before.</p>
              <p>I suggest that you complete your ITE studies before entering poly, meanwhile concentrating more on doing maths(if u are doing courses that have maths modules)<br><br>The reason is because many of my poly friends who are from ITE have an easier time understanding complex engineering mathematics than me(my sec 2 maths teacher isn't very good at teaching), while i have to memorise the method to do the equations.</p>
              <p>The poly that i studied in teaches maths by assuming that we have a solid secondary school maths foundation. The lecturer will assume you know how to simplify equations using appropriate methods(factorising, split complex algebra into simple ones so you can utilise them, quadractic/cubic eqn, etc)</p>
              <p>A good foundation in maths will help you in university maths, which i find very difficult.</p>

              <p>Hi, MyPillowTalks, thank you for your advise.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, in nitec education, we are not taught any of such. The Nitec syllabus has been designed in a way that forces us to Highier Nitec (another 2 years). That is when we learn the basic/some advanced Mathematics a secondary school student does.</p>
              <p>I am certainly taking the ite route as I already am in it. However, I wonder if my request to skip a year of Nitec for poly education is possible. Normally, given my grades, I can get into poly in 2 years. Still, having wasted 2 years of redundant education is pointless.</p>
              <p>I just don't understand why I'm not given the education I should be having. I hate learning what kinds of computer there are for 3 hours. Who can't? I hate it when I have to teach the whole class for the next 2 hours on how to fix the computer. I hate it when I have to bear with all the bullshits of other students, waste my time, procastinate when I don't want to, while this 2 years is being taken from me. It's just does not make sense. Equality should not exist among adults only, there should be equality in education as well!</p>
              <p>Seconday - age 12 - 16</p>
              <p>ite - age 17 - 18</p>
              <p>poly - age 19 - 22</p>
              <p>National Service - age 23 - 24</p>
              <p>A degree - age 25 - 28</p>
              <p>This is a really long process.</p>
              <p>I do agree with everything you have said. Problem is, no one learns Math in Nitec. We only learn what exists in the infotechnology world.</p>
