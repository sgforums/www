If you don't hand in homework on the deadline, some harsh punishment is awaiting you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>b) Teachers who are lenient and forgiving. Bad thing is that students tend to take advantage of this type of teachers<br><br>c) Teachers who are friendly and students can see them as their own friends.
