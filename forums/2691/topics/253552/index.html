            <div class='col-md body'>Just interested to know. Here are some options to get the ball rolling:<br><br>a) Teachers who are very stern and strict about discipline. If you don't hand in homework on the deadline, some harsh punishment is awaiting you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>b) Teachers who are lenient and forgiving. Bad thing is that students tend to take advantage of this type of teachers<br><br>c) Teachers who are friendly and students can see them as their own friends. Again the bad thing is students tend to take advantage again<br><br>d) Teachers who teach by giving a lot of practice (rote-learning). Might help to boost the passing rate, but bad news is the students will most probably have tonnes of homework  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>e) Teachers who encourage creativity and think that they are only facilitators. Means a lot of group work, and minimum guidance from the teachers during classtime.<br><br>f) Others (describe them, I am really interested to know, it will probably help me now and in the future)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is one of my assignment.<br><br><blockquote>What's your style of learning? Explain! (Min 100 words)<br><br>It would be through the convention teaching method where student are spoon-fed.<br><br>Although RP adopted the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) method, I still find it very hard for me to change track. Due to lack of exposure to Problem-Based Learning in Secondary School, I find it very hard for me to adapt now. Since I am in RP now, we are taught to be more Â‘openÂ’ to other solution as there is no fixed answers here.<br><br>In Secondary School, the usual way that I learn is by memorizing, reproducing, understanding and applying what is in the notes.<br><br>We need to memorize huge amount of information of syllabus BUT not without borders. There is a fixed syllabus for every subject. Those syllabuses are in the SEAB websites.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Understanding, Applying and Memorizing</span></strong><br>The normal day in my Secondary School (for Science and Mathematics) starts with my teacher explaining to us what we should know by the end of a particular chapter. Next, my teacher will teach us the steps, followed by how to apply the formula. We will then do some example questions with the class and we make sure everyone know how to do that question. Students are also encouraged to ask questions to clarify their doubts.<br><br>After school, I will have private remedial with friends who are weaker in the subject. I will use the knowledge that I have gain earlier to help them to learn. Setting mock papers and teaching my friends are what I usually do after school. The sense of satisfaction when someone really understands what you taught is great. Teaching not only benefits them but also benefits me too. One of my most respected teachers told me that when I teach, I would reinforce what I had learned.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reproducing</span></strong><br>When we are sitting for a test or an exam, we will be reproducing what we had leant. What we had leant is through building up of Understanding, Applying and Memorizing of the content.<br><br>Learning is not something that can be defined using Â‘styleÂ’. Ultimately, learning is the act or process of acquiring (deep or surface) knowledge. </blockquote></div>

But it is not easy to be humorous in class. Imagine telling a joke and nobody laughs. Happened to me before, but I am getting better at it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Reason is cos when I tell jokes, my face is rather straight, so people don't really know that I am telling a joke, unless they have known me for quite sometime  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I try to incorporate my personal experience during my class, ie telling them about my experience when I was studying last time... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
