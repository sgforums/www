            <div class='col-md body'>Origen (Greek: Ὠριγένης ŌrigÃ©nēs, 185Â–ca. 254) was an Early Christian scholar, theologian, and one of the most distinguished of the <strong>early Fathers</strong> of the Christian Church. He is thought to have been born at Alexandria, and died at Caesarea.

According to some traditions, he carried this to such an extent that, fearing that his position as a teacher of women as well as men might give ground for scandal to the heathen, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he followed <strong>Matthew 19:12</strong> literally and castrated himself;</span> this action, if accurately reported, was likely partly influenced, too, by his belief that the Christian must follow the words of his Master without reserve. Later in life, however, he saw reason to judge differently concerning his extreme act. The historical accuracy of this supposed castration has been doubted by some scholars. It has been postulated that this story was circulated by Origen's rivals in an effort to lessen his importance or to otherwise sully his reputation.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origen#Early_training" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origen#Early_training</a><br><br></div>
