            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Name: Panluna  Â•  Title: The Star Of Jacob numbers24:17  Â•  Date posted: 04/03/07 18:18</strong><br><br>Q: In case any one is interested the following website lists the Old testament verses that predicted the Messiah:bible-history.commessionicprophecy/index<br>Would you say this validates The New Testament claims?<br><br>...........................................................<br><br><strong>Name: Shlomo  Â•  Date: 04/04/07 0:37</strong><br><br>A: Hello, Panluna, Bedmidbar 24:17 does indicate a physical messiah at the end of time [Mashiach ben Dovid]. But keep in mind one must ascertained or define as to the purpose of a messiah first, keeping everything in its proper context, in order to validate a possible new covenant connection. It is difficult to do with other thoughts already in place. One of the biggest problems or temptations when studying and reading is to take verses out of context or what I refer to as contextual elimination to bring about a connection. This can bring a great many misunderstandings and grevious errors. There are other old testament verses that have been adopted to fit a messiah, through word changes etc. and are misapplied, like Isaiah 53 as an example.<br><br>......................................................<br><br><strong>Name: Panluna  Â•  Date: 04/04/07 13:06</strong><br><br>A: Would it be at all possible to get a copy of the original text of the Old Testament before it was changed to fit the modern versions or suit the needs of the Christians?I would like to go to the source.Does the word messiah really mean Saviour of all humanity or was it meant to re-establish the Davidic claim to rulership at that time to overthrow the Roman Empire? The title"E l " was changed to LORD.I don't read Hebrew but it would be nice to be able to read in English the original texts as written in the pre-Jesus era.<br><br>...........................................<br><br><strong>Name: Shlomo  Â•  Date: 04/04/07 23:26</strong><br><br>A: The Greek Septuaguint is a copy, but not reliable, neither is Josephus history. The best and easiest ones are the; Stone edition of the "Tanach"<br>[ includes the prophets and writtings ], the "Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan Torah," and the "Sforno" Torah, these are the best to learn from. There are many, but these would be a good start. The Messiah is to redeem the world, hence the meaning is "redeemer." The Messiah will be a physical world ruler or king, a direct blood descendent, from the house of Dovid. This has not yet occurred . Here is a mystery, Messsiah ben Yosef is the one in Daniel, then comes Messiah ben Dovid. You may remember King Cyrus and Darius were called messiahs that assisted in bringing back the Jewish people to their homeland. So the word messiah can be general in meaning or specific in meaning. If specific, then there are certain pertinent criteria that have to met or fulfilled without any suspicion or debate. The past messiah in my opinion did not meet any of the criteria, not even beyond a preponderance of evidence.<br><br><a href="http://www.jesusfamilytomb.com/forum/The_Star_Of_Jacob_numbers24_17-15-426-0-0/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jesusfamilytomb.com/forum/The_Star_Of_Jacob_numbers24_17-15-426-0-0/</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Discovery- Channel to Update Interpretation of 600:1 Odds Claim #4807 On Fri, 2007 03 09 22:53 joedmello said, I am pleased to state that as a result of several e-mail exchanges I have had with Dr. Andrey Feuerverger over the past few days, and a phone conversation with him this morning which confirmed our informal understanding reached by e-mail yesterday, he has agreed that the following two statements made on Discovery ChannelÂ’s website:<br><br>1. Â“A statistical study commissioned by the broadcasters (Discovery<br>Channel/Vision Canada/C4 UK) concludes that the probability factor is 600 to 1 in<br>favor of this tomb being the tomb of Jesus of Nazareth and his family.Â”<br>(from http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/tomb/about/about.html)<br><br>2. Dr. Andrey Feuerverger, professor of statistics &amp; mathematics at the<br>University of Toronto, has concluded <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a high statistical probability that The<br>Talpiot tomb is the JESUS FAMILY TOMB.</span> In a study, Feuerverger examined the<br>cluster of names in the tomb Â…Â…<br>Taking into account the chances that these names would be clustered together in a<br>family tomb, this statistical study concludes that the odds Â– on the most<br>conservative basis Â– <strong>are 600 to 1</strong> in favor of this being the JESUS FAMILY TOMB.
