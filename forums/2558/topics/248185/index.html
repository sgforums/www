If indeed the tomb uncovered in East Talpiot in 1980 is that of Jesus and his family, and if indeed Jesus of Nazareth had a son, this ossuary contradicts dramatically nearly 2000 years of Christian tradition.<br><br>ItÂ’s true that the New Testament says nothing about Jesus having a wife or fathering a child, but it doesnÂ’t say he didnÂ’t. ItÂ’s true that Jesus commended John the BaptistÂ’s ascetic choices, but he didnÂ’t say they were for him. The fact is, the celibate life was not a big part of Hebrew tradition. The command "Be fruitful and multiply" (Genesis 1:2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> was taken very seriously. A large family was a blessing from God (Genesis 22:17); sterility was a curse (1 Samuel 1:6-<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">; and virginity grievous (Judges 11:37). Rabbis, especially, were expected to be observantly fruitful.<br><br>In the end, the most Jesus ever said about the issue of celibacy was: "Let anyone accept this who can" (Mt. 19:12). It was the early Church fathers who connected sex with sin (outside of such Hebrew Bible prohibitions as incest, adultery, and masturbation) and began to build the story of JesusÂ’ celibacy.<br><br>Absolutely nothing in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">New Testament</span> indicates that Jesus was celibate. He could very well have been married and had children.<br><br>Could Judah, son of Jesus have been the Â“Beloved DiscipleÂ” mentioned in the Gospels? If the Â“JudahÂ” of ossuary 80/501 was still alive after the crucifixion, he would have been protected by JesusÂ’ followers. If spoken of at all, he would have been referred to in code.<br><br>The child of a pretender to the throne would have been a target, especially in those turbulent times, with Jewish revolt in the air and the Romans not on their home turf.<br><br>A glance through history reveals that the Romans killed heirs to those who were contenders for kingship, even as they let siblings live. And a son of Jesus would have been a claimant to the Davidic throne.<br><br><a href="http://www.jesusfamilytomb.com/the_tomb/yehuda_bar_yeshua.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jesusfamilytomb.com/the_tomb/yehuda_bar_yeshua.html</a></div>

March 30, 1980. The Tomb of the Ten Ossuaries. Excavation Day One.<br><br>Upon their arrival, the first thing archaeologists Josef Gat, Amos Kloner and Shimon Gibson noted was the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">strange symbol</span> over the door to the Jesus tomb, on the south face of the antechamber. They had never seen another like it: a decorative <strong>V- or Y</strong>-shaped gable or chevron over a prominent circle. It measured more than a meter wide, a quite beautifully rendered stone relief sculpture. All three archaeologists knew that the splendor of the faÃ§ade, especially in a tomb with no other decorative features, was extremely rare.<br><br>Bones had been placed in the antechamber directly underneath the chevron symbol, possibly deliberately. This too was decidedly not typical. In ancient Jerusalem, the dead were placed inside tombs; in tombs, the dead were placed inside ossuaries. What were human bones doing under the symbol? Whose bones were they? Were they connected with the unprecedented symbol over the passage into the tomb?<br><br>Symbols are shifty things.<strong> A fish</strong>, for example, can represent Christianity, depict the sign of Pisces, or stand for a manufacturer's brand of frozen seafood. So it is with the chevron and the circle found on the Â“Tomb of the Ten Ossuaries.Â” We can look for other symbols that pre- and post-date it to try to pinpoint influence. We can say what it is like. But we cannot say for sure. That job is for some future historian.<br><br>The symbol in question has no precedent, but it is in use today, a diacritical mark used by modern typographers. No connection there. It is used astrologically to represent something called quadruplicity, or the quality of cardinality. And though astrology is ancientÂ—more than 6 000 years oldÂ—<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the symbol of quadruplicity</span> was not used until at least the Middle Ages. No help there either.<br><br><a href="http://www.jesusfamilytomb.com/the_chevron_circle.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jesusfamilytomb.com/the_chevron_circle.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><span class="large"><strong> x </strong></span><br><strong>Masons Mark</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is a MasonÂ’s Mark?</span><br>Most broadly, a masonÂ’s mark refers to a symbol left on stonework by a mason. There is some debate surrounding the exact purpose of mason marks. Some believe them to have had practical purposes such as representing the identity of a mason to ensure appropriate payment. Others believe that a masons mark could provide information about the origins and location of a stone. Still others suggest that the markings were used to determine the position or rotation of a stone.<br><br><strong>History of the Masons Mark</strong><br>Modern Freemasons claim to be an outgrowth of the masons of the Middle Ages who built cathedrals, abbeys, and monasteries for the church, and left their marks. However, the masons mark has been found on structures dating as far back as 25,000 BCE. The earliest examples of masons mark are attributed to Middle Minoan Crete, and are believed to be religious or mystical signs.<br><br><strong>Significance of the Masons Mark</strong><br>Similarities between various masons marks have been found in different parts of the world. The masonÂ’s mark itself has been found on the pyramids of Egypt, on the ruined buildings of Herculaneum, Pompeii, Greece, Rome and on ancient cathedrals.<br><br>One such mark frequently used was the Vesica Piscis, or the fish symbol that was eventually adopted by Christians, and which is believed to stem from pagan symbolism. Some marks resemble Roman letters, while others seem representative of astronomical signs. Other signs are clear representations of the principles of geometry, while others appear to represent the initials of a personÂ’s name.<br><br>Masons marks found on Jerusalem stone containing Phoenician markings have been used to determine the accuracy of accounts in biblical writings regarding <strong>SolomonÂ’s Temple</strong>. Many of the inscriptions found on buildings in antiquity are believed to have mythological, historical, and symbolic significance, as a brief record of an important event.<br><br><a href="http://www.jesusfamilytomb.com/evidence/epigraphy/masons_mark.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jesusfamilytomb.com/evidence/epigraphy/masons_mark.html</a><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mason mark or Templar mark</strong>? </span><br><br><img src="http://www.ktherts.com/assets/images/logo.gif"><br><strong>Templar mark on the Left</strong><br><br><img src="http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A9iby4cpUh9G7.wAxjejzbkF;_ylu=X3oDMTBsMW5yM3VoBHNlYwNwcm9mBHZ0aWQDSTA2Nl84OA--/SIG=120qo8noh/EXP=1176544169/**http%3A//www.hertsmark.org/assets/tempseal.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A9ibyGVkUh9G03QAgDijzbkF;_ylu=X3oDMTBsMW5yM3VoBHNlYwNwcm9mBHZ0aWQDSTA2Nl84OA--/SIG=11mbum1sd/EXP=1176544228/**http%3A//www.longcounty.net/free.jpg"><br><strong>Templar mark on the top</strong></div>

The most important of these values is the Constitutional declaration in the belief of the Supreme Being. According to Freemasons, the Supreme Being is the Great Architect of the Universe, a concept that allows members to espouse their own individual interpretation of the deity.<br><br>Dated in origin to the eighteenth century, the FreemasonsÂ’ main principles are brotherly love, relief and truth, which is also expressed in the French revolutionary slogan of Â“libertÃ©, Ã©galitÃ©, fraternitÃ©Â”. Organized into Lodges, the Freemasons emphasize the importance of charity work. They also espouse a denunciation of the material world.<br><br><img src="http://spiritrestoration.org/images/193290_3.JPG"><br><strong>The ALPHABET O is G or C</strong>?<br><br><img src="http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/symbolism/pontormo2.jpg"><br><strong>Freemasonry and the all-seeing eye</strong></div>

Judas left the Scribe home and made his way to the Mount of Olives.<br><br>2. When he came to a place called Gethsemane,(Garden)He found Jesus on his knees,deep in prayer.<br><br>3. Many of Jesus' followers were scattered ard the mountain,some praying,while others were fast asleep.<br><br>4. Judas approached the Master and,when he was a few paces off fell on his knees and joined him in prayer.<br><br>5.

When Judas heard these words,he was filled with hope that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Master might agreed to return to Galilee</span> and avoid the death he had earlier foretold.<br><br>7. Judas walked slowly towards Jesus.He threw his arms ard his neck and said: " Master, Master,' and kissed him.<br><br>8. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jesus took him in his arms,</span> and Judas was overcome with his compassion.( Judas is Thirteen spirits... as he was told after he approached Scribe)<br><br>9.

            <div class='col-md body'>Despite such clear passages showing that Christ was NOT physically resurrected, millions are confused and deceived. Consider this email recently received by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The REAL TRUTH:</span><br><br><strong>Â“Why is everyone so against finding [the] Jesus Tomb? It has to be somewhere. JesusÂ’ body has to be on earth, it could not have physically gone to heaven. Our universe is at least 26 billion light years big, and even if his body traveled at the speed of light, he would still be traveling for 26 billion light years more (minus 2,000 years). The body would not survive the minute it got out of the atmosphere for lack of oxygen.Â”</strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>A physical being cannot surpass or even match the speed of light. However, a being made of spiritÂ—which, by its very nature, exists outside the physical limitations of gravity, speed, distance, etc.Â—can instantly travel to GodÂ’s heavenly throne and back! Clearly, Christ was resurrected as a Spirit Being, and His appearance, described in Revelation 1:13-16, is certainly not that of a mortal man.<br><br>Some are confused by passages such as John 20 (referenced earlier), in which Â“doubtingÂ” Thomas felt the resurrected ChristÂ’s hands and side. Christ manifested the wounds in a physical body only because He chose to do so. He had the ability to physically manifest Himself at will. In that very same account, He suddenly appeared in their midstÂ—even though the windows and doors were shut! This could not have happened unless Jesus was a Spirit-Being. Physical bodies cannot walk through walls!<br><br>For the dedicated Bible student, this should not be a surprise.<strong> Angels,</strong> who are created spirit-beings, can manifest themselves into the physical as well. In Genesis 19, two angels literally took hold of Lot and his family to save them from SodomÂ’s destruction: Â“Â…the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the cityÂ” (vs. 16).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Surely the resurrected Jesus Christ would have the ability to do the same, and more!</span><br><br><a href="http://www.realtruth.org/news/070309-002-religion.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.realtruth.org/news/070309-002-religion.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://skullandcrossbones.org/images/jollyroger.gif"><br><img src="http://skullandcrossbones.org/images/tship4.jpg"><br>One legend has it that the Jolly Roger obtained its appellation from the French name for the red flag, the "Jolie Rouge." And so it may be, for the flag was first used by a French order of militant monks known as the "Poor Soldiers of Christ and the Temple of Solomon" - commonly known as the Knights Templar.<br><br>The Templars, were pious men. They gave up all their worldly possessions when they entered the Order, only carrying money on special occasions when they traveled alone, turning over whatever money that remained upon reaching their destination. They were ferocious warriors; pitching themselves into the midst of their enemies, astride charging warhorses, against incredible odds. Contemporaries had this to say of Templars:<br><br>The Templars are most excellent soldiers. They wear white mantles with a red cross, and when they go to war a standard of two colors called balzaus is borne before them. They go in silence. Their first attack is the most terrible. In going, they are the first. In returning, the last. They await the orders of their Master. When they think fit to make war and the trumpet has sounded, they sing in chorus the Psalm of David, "Not unto us, O Lord" kneeling on the blood and necks of the enemy, unless they have forced the troops of the enemy to retire altogether, or utterly broken them to pieces. Should any of them for any reason turn his back to the enemy, or come forth alive [from a defeat], or bear arms against the Christians, he is severely punished; the white mantle with the red cross, which is the sign of his knighthood, is taken away with ignominy, he is cast from the society of brethren, and eats his food on the floor without a napkin for the space of one year. If the dogs molest him, he does not dare to drive them away. But at the end of the year, if the Master and brethren think his penance to have been sufficient, they restore him the belt of his former knighthood. These Templars live under a strict religious rule, obeying humbly, having no private property, eating sparingly, dressing meanly, and dwelling in tents.<br><br>"The warriors are gentler than lambs and fiercer than lions, wedding the mildness of the monk with the valor of the knight, so that it is difficult to decide which to call them: men to adorn the Temple of Solomon with weapons instead of gems, with shields instead of crowns of gold, with saddles and bridles instead of candelabra: eager for victory -- not fame; for battle not for pomp; who abhor wasteful speech, unnecessary action, unmeasured laughter, gossip and chatter, as they despise all vain things: who, in spite of their being many, live in one house according to one rule, with one soul and one heart." -- St. Bernard of Clairvaux<br><br>"in turn lions of war and lambs at the hearth; rough knights on the battlefield, pious monks in the chapel; formidable to the enemies of Christ, gentleness itself towards His friends." -Jacques de Vitry<br><br>Being men of principle; their rules of conduct were strict. They were willing to die for their beliefs, and so were feared on the battlefield and respected in life. Such was their reputation, that in battle, there were instances where the enemy would turn and run at the very sight of Templars entering the field. Their Rule of Order stated that breaking rank was worthy of losing ones habit. They neither asked nor gave quarter; the were expected to fight until death stayed their sword arm. Retreat from an enemy would not be countenanced unless the odds were greater than three to one against them and they were forbidden to ransom themselves if captured. They fought like men possessed, either prevailing in their cause, or suffering death under the banner of Gol'gotha - the place of the skull - where their Christ died.<br><br>Templars were not to succumb to the temptation of thinking that they killed in a spirit of hate and fury, nor that they seized booty in a spirit of greed. For the Templars did not hate men, but men's wrongdoing.<br><br>They were dedicated to the protection of travelers and pilgrims of all religions, though they themselves were Christians, in fact many Templars were of Palestinian birth, spoke perfect Arabic, and were familiar with every religious sect, cult, and magical doctrine, including that of the Islamic Assassins. The Grand Master Philip of Nablus (1167 A.D.) was a Syrian.2 They were great statesmen, politically adept economic traders, and they were allied with the great sailor-fraternity that had created a worldwide trading empire in Phoenician times. They became immensely powerful - had the largest fleet and the most successful banking system in Europe. But they could not sustain their grip on the Holy Land. Their losses3 were too great, and they were eventually driven off the Levant by Saladin, their Moslem adversary, in 1291. They continued to fight for their cause in the only manner they could - on the high seas.<br><br>The best known Templar pirate ship was the Falcon, "the greatest that had been built at that time."4 She was in the harbor when the fortress of Acre fell "and rescued many 'ladies and damsels and great treasure and many important people'4 by evacuating them to 'Atlit."<br><br>After the orderly navel evacuation of 'Atlit, the Templars retreated to their Mediterranean island bases on Cyprus, Rhodes and Sicily. Until their dissolution, they, together with the Order of St. John, continued as the foremost maritime powers in the Mediterranean, continuing to effectively wage war on Moslem shipping.<br><br>The Templars were still very powerful but in the eyes of European monarchs and the Church, the Templars raison d'tre had ceased with the loss of the Holy Lands. Jealousy and covetousness reigned. Phillip IV, who was deeply in dept to the Order, had seen their treasures stored in Paris, and designed to make it his own.<br><br>On Friday morning October 13th 1307 - and the reason for which Friday the 13th has become known as an unlucky day - King Phillip IV together with Avignonese Pope Clement V, ruthlessly suppressed the Order throughout Europe, with false accusations, arrests, torture and executions. (Timeline) Though they were offered communted sentences and comfortable lives if they would renounce their Order and plead guilty to the charges, for some mysterious reason, they preferred to remain true to their principles5 and received their punishment.<br><br>A large number of Templars escaped that day to an uncertain future, and found refuge abroad. On the eve of the arrests, the entire Templar fleet mysteriously vanished from the port of La Rochelle carrying with it a vast fortune, the fate of which remains a mystery down to this day.<br><br>Just as a terrorist to one is a freedom fighter to another, so it was with the Templars and their fleet. Wanted by the Pope and all the crowns of Europe, they came to be viewed, by the "comfortable folks" on the mainland, as pirates.<br><br>continue<br><br></div>

King Robert the Bruce had no interest in persecuting the Order, in spite of a papal bull ordering him to do precisely that. To the contrary, he took advantage of their fugitive status, offering them asylum in return for their help in his war for independence against King Edward II of England. Templars have been suggested as the source of mounted soldiers who assisted Robert the Bruce's Scots Guard at the battle of Bannockburn, as the Scots did not have a mounted force.<br><br>As the Scots Guard continued through the years, two of the prominent families involved in its history were the Sinclairs and the Stuarts. Both families trace their lineage back to members of the Knights Templar, as well as to prominent figures of the New Testament. Hugues de Payns the first Grand Master of the Templars was married to a Sinclair.<br><br>There is also evidence that the Templar fleet traveled to North America in 1398 (almost 100 years before Columbus) with the Sinclairs, and settled there at least temporarily. Connections are made between the tower ruins along the eastern coast of the United States, objects discovered in the Oak Island "Money Pit", and the Templar Order.<br><br>The Sinclairs (or Saint-Clairs) castle near Edinburgh, was situated next to Rosslyn chapel, which was constructed by the Sinclairs according to the floorplan of Solomon's original temple. Engraved in the masonry around the chapel are maize and aloe plants, which grew only in North America.<br><br>Throughout Scotland, as well as within Rosslyn Chapel, there are carvings and tombstones dating back to the 15th, 16th, and 17th century using combinations of Templar imagery (skull and crossbones, Templar swords, Templar crosses) and Masonic symbols (compass and square).<br><br>The Stuart royal house became one of Freemasonry's biggest supporters during their reign of Scotland and England.<br><br>Some also suggest that the rituals used in modern Freemasonry have their origins in the ancient texts discovered by the Templars in the ruins of Solomon's Temple while excavating to build their stables. Recent archaeological digs in the area have supported this theory by finding serveral Templar artifacts buried beneath the temple. In the 1950's, a scroll made entirely of copper was discovered in the caves near Qumran. When translated with the other "Dead Sea Scrolls", this "Copper Scroll", as it has become known, was identified as a treasure map listing various precious metals, religious artifacts, and writings supposedly buried beneath the temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>By the 17th and 18th centuries, the skull and crossbones was a symbol with a powerful reputation but identified with no official organization. The Templars had long since gone underground and evolved into other organizations. The symbol was usurped and came to be associated with the pirates of which we are more familiar. They changed the flag to suit their needs replacing the crossbones with swords, adding hourglasses or other symbols.<br><br><a href="http://skullandcrossbones.org/articles/jolly-roger.htm" rel="nofollow">http://skullandcrossbones.org/articles/jolly-roger.htm</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A spiritual leader as a woman in that era...think abt it!<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A: Kurgan asked: "How do we know "Mariamne" means "from Magdala"?" </span><br><br>It doesn't. Mariamne means "Mary." "Mara" (the title part of her ossuary inscription) means "Master." So the inscription means "Mary, the Master." This is quite an astounding inscription for a woman in that era, whether or not it is Mary Magdalene. It designates her as a spiritual leader.<br><br>Yeshua was a feminist. Some have called him the ultimate feminist. His entire ministry rested on the shoulders of women and their support. He, in turn, supported their equality with men. This was a radical stance, even more radical than his opposing Rome or the Jewish leaders. This struck at the very roots of Jewish culture where women were not to be seen in public, had no status in the patriarchal family and had little power of their own.<br><br>Various texts and teaching give Mary Magdalene great stature in His life and mission. She is termed "The Woman Who Knew the All," "Apostle to the Apostles," and was recognized (in gnostic scripture) as the person He designated to lead after Him.<br><br>She is credited with miraculous works in the legend concerning her meeting with Tiberius. Tiberius said, "a man can no more raise from the dead than that egg in your hand turn red." She held the egg up and it turned red.<br><br>It used to be thought that Magdala referred to her birthplace, but that notion has been abandoned because there is no record of a town by that name existing during her lifetime. Margaret Starbird has made a good case for its meaning as "The Tower," referring to her status in the spiritual community. Margaret also makes a good case for sacred union (heiros gamos) as part of their rituals.<br><br>If you want to learn more about Mary Magdalene, read the books by Margaret Starbird (she has several. You might want to start with "Goddess in the Gospels."), Susan Haskins, and Karen King. They each have a different focus and each is well-researched and document<br><br><strong>by Lore</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.jesusfamilytomb.com/forum/Magdalene_or_Mariamne_-9-11-0-0/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jesusfamilytomb.com/forum/Magdalene_or_Mariamne_-9-11-0-0/</a><br><br>(Jews inquire sign....Greeks inquire <strong>wisdom</strong>!)</div>
