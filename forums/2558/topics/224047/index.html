            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Real Meaning behind Martix movie<br></strong><br>It is no secret that the W brothers are followers of the <strong>Gnostic faith</strong>, which is a belief that the God of Abraham is actually a flawed inferior being called the Demiurge. Demiurge came from the womb of the one true transcendant God's wife, <strong>Sophia (knowledge)</strong> as a result of her passion to truly know the transcendant God. When born, <strong>Demiurge</strong> was cast from the Pleroma (heaven and home of the transcendant God). He did not retain knowledge of the Pleroma or the transcendant God. Thus, he believed himself to be alone as the Almighty. He created for himself this universe from existing matter, in his own flawed image. In this universe he created for himself a home, known to us as heaven, followers known as <strong>Archons (angels),</strong> the earth, and life on earth, so as to amuse and worship him. In humanity exisits a divine spark, a trace of the transcendant God, which wishes to ultimatley return to the Pleroma. Knowing this, the Archons created the circumstances on earth, sin and the like to trap the divine spark (souls) on earth for eternity. Only through Gnosis can a soul attain the knowledge necessary to outwit the Archons following bodily death and return to the Pleroma. Gnosis is attained through the help of Aeons, deities that exist in the Pleroma and momentarily return to earth to help free the divine sparks. The biblical figures like Jesus are Aeons. It is here that the stage is set for the Matrix movies. One misconception is that the Matrix stories are told from the aspect of the human plight. This is incorrect. The actual struggle is within the machines.<br><br>The "Real" World: Pleroma<br><br><strong>The Matrix: Earth</strong><br><br>The Source (big building where the architect resides): Demiurge's Heaven.<br><br><strong>Architect:</strong> Demiurge or flawed creator. He creates the Matrix to "mathematical perfection", except of course of the anomoly which he cannot get rid of. This exhibits his own imperfection as his model of perfection is imperfect.<br><br>[bb]Oracle:[/b] Barbelo, Demiurge's consort who was born as Demiurge's <strong>first thought.</strong> As the Demiurge creates his imperfect "perfect" world and is passive in its maintenance, except to "balance the equation" from time to time, Barbelo is his active, energetic, complement. She sees that the Demiurge is flawed and works within his system to break down the barriers that he has constructed to trap the divine sparks. In Reloaded, the Architect told Neo that it was the Oracle who helped him set up the system to control the anomoly to suit his purposes, ie., the role of the One to reboot the Matrix. In Revolutions, she herself stated to Neo that her job was to unbalance the Architect's equation. These two are the Ying and Yang of the universe, working for and against one another at the same time.<br><br>For the remainder of the characters, I will be switiching to traditional Christian Biblical names.<br><br><strong>Merovigian: Adam,</strong> the first man. Merv was described as the <strong>"first exile",</strong> cast out from the Demiurge's heaven, when he sought and received "too much" knowledge. Gnostic teachings tell us that Sophia manifested herself as the serpent and brought the knowledge that the creator was untrue and that they themselves were of holy origin in Pleroma. Persephone described him as "once like Neo". But once, he had the knowledge, that the Matrix was a barren reality of pain, suffering, and "causation". Emotions such as love and the like are illusions to keep him trapped. He now wishes only to survive, to outlast the Architect. One misconception about this character is that he was an adversary to Neo. He was not. He actually helped Neo along the way (and had a bit of fun in the process). THink about it; HE was holding the keymaker, who was being stalked for deletion by the system agents. HE trapped Neo in the train station, protecting him from Smith's growing power in the Matrix. HE made it possible for Sati's parents to bring her into the Matrix and allow her father to explain much to Neo. HE allowed Neo to be saved when the time was right. And, HE led Smith to the Oracle so as to end her meddling and facilitate the end.<br><br><strong>Persephone: Eve, keeper of hidden secrets.</strong><br><br>The One of the 5th Matrix (Morpheus' teacher): Seth, the descendants of which are the gnostic followers. His knowledge was passed down from his father Adam and mother Eve. The movies don't elude to a connection between Merv and the prior One, except that Merv "survived" him. However, it is clear that the origin of the human resistance was Morpheus' mentor, as he chose the 2nd door to rebuild <strong>Zion,]/b] reboot the Matrix, and begin freeing new minds.<br><br>[b]Morpheus: Moses,</strong> liberator of the Hebrews. Clearly Morpheus serves the purpose as freer of the enslaved human minds.<br><br><strong>Neo: Jesus Christ.</strong> Christ is viewed by the gnostics as an Aeon sent down from the Pleroma, who takes human form and teaches humanity the secrets of gnosis. He teaches, is crucifyed, and returns from the dead to lead his flock to salvation, do battle with the Satan, and usher in a time of unheralded peace. In the trilogy, Neo is killed by Smith, then an agent, comes back to life to defeat the system, and then fights Smith for supremacy over the system. He is neither human nor machine, but a mixture of both. He possesses super abilities inside the Matrix. He frees more minds in six months than in the prior 6 years. He eventually bucks the traditional role of the One, ending the Architect's control over the system. He subsquently saves the Matrix from Smith and ushers in peace between the machines and humans. Most importantly, he saves the exiled programs from deletion as negotiated by the Oracle at the end of Revolutions, shows the Architect his flaws, and preserves the ability of individuals to attain gnosis or a higher sense of being (purpose).<br><br><strong>Agent Smith: Satan,</strong> a fallen Archon who wishes to replace the Demiurge as the God of the Universe. In the trilogy, Smith was a fallen "agent of the system" whose job it was to track down and eliminate freed minds and return exiled programs to the source. After being rendered obsolete by Neo, Smith refused to return to the source for deletion. Thus, he became a rogue program whose mission was to destroy the Matrix and take his place as its God. Some believe that he may be the actual good guy, as he tries to bring down the Architect's perfect world. However, he does not wish to free the programs, he only wants to take the Architect's place as ruler over them. Therefore, even though Neo saves him by giving him purpose, he remains Neo's adversary as Neo is attempting to save ALL from the Matrix while Smith wishes to continue the enslavement with him as the leader.<br><br>There are more characters that follow this suit, like <strong>Cain and Abel (sons of Adam who do his bidding), Seraph (seraphime, a choir of angels or aeons sent to help free the Matrix, Trinity (Mary Magdalene), the Kid (the apostle Paul),</strong> and many more. However, my fingers are tired. But after this post, you can get the gist of it.<br><br><a href="http://www.matrix-explained.com/php/about-the-matrix-movies-4881.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.matrix-explained.com/php/about-the-matrix-movies-4881.html</a></div>
