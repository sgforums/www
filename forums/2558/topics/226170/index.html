As such, the various Christian perspectives view the Holy Spirit as God himself, a form of God, or a manifestation of God. The word "Spirit" commonly translates the Greek New Testament word pneuma (Greek: πνεύμα<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">. It is important to remember that Scripture on the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Holy Spirit can be viewed by different sects of Christians in different ways.</span> In Christianity, following the New Testament, the Holy Spirit is the One who guides a person to correctly interpret the word of God and He helps each person reach new levels of understanding. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Since He knows each person perfectly and it is understood that  people think differently, He can transfer information to people in ways that they would comprehend it (Acts of the Apostles 2:7)</span></div>
