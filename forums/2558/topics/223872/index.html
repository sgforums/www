And this is life eternal,that they <strong>might</strong> know thee the<strong> only true God</strong>, and <strong>Jesus Christ</strong><br><br>4. I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work.<br><br>5. And now,O Father,glorify thou me with thine <strong>ownself</strong> with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.<br><br>6. I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me: and they have kept thy word.<br><br>7. Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.<br><br>8. For I have given unto them the words which thou hast gavest me: and they have received them, and have known surely that i came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.<br><br>9. I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me: for they are thine.<br><br>10. And all mine are <strong>thine</strong>, and thine are <strong>mine</strong>: and <strong>i am</strong> glorified in them.<br><br>11. And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world,and i come to thee. Holy Father keep through thine <strong>own name</strong> those whom thou hast given me, that they may be <strong>one</strong>, as <strong>we are</strong>.<br><br>12.
