            <div class='col-md body'><strong>July 22</strong> has been set apart traditionally as the Feast Day of the Holy Mary Magdelene, a gnostic holiday.<br><br>Spiritual transformation may be found in the Gospel of Mary:<br><br>"Mary answered and said, What is hidden from you I will proclaim to you.  And she began to speak to them these words:  I, she said, I saw the Lord in a vision and I said to Him, Lord I saw you today in a vision.  He answered and said to me, Blessed are you that did not waiver at the sight of Me.  For where the mind is there is the treasure.  I said to Him, Lord, how does he who sees the vision see it, through the soul or through the spirit?  The savior answered and said, he does not see through the soul nor through the spirit, but the mind that is between the two that is what sees the vision..."<br><br>Chapter 5, verses 7-11.<br><br>"Peter answered and spoke concerning these same things.  He questioned them about the Savior.  Did He really speak privately with a woman and not openly with us?  Are we to turn about and all listen to her?  Did He prefer her to us?  Then Mary wept and said to Peter, My brother Peter, what do you think?  Do you think that I have thought this up for myself in my heart, or that I am lying about the Savior?  Levi answered and said to Peter, Peter you have always been hot tempered.  Now I see you contending against the woman like the adversaries.  But if the Savior made her worthy, who are you indeed to reject her?  Surely the Savior knows her very well.  That is why he loved her more than us.  Rather let us be ashamed and put on the perfect Man, and separate as He commanded us and preach the gospel, not laying down any other rule or other law beyond what the Savior said.  And when they heard this they began to go forth to proclaim and preach."<br><br>Chapter 9, verses 3-10.<br><br>it was the male Levi who recognized the truth in Mary's words:<br><br>"Peter answered and spoke concerning these same things.  He questioned them about the Savior.  Did He really speak privately with a woman and not openly with us?  Are we to turn about and all listen to her?  Did He prefer her to us?
