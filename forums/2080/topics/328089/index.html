              <p><strong>Circle Line Art in Transit Programme <br> Weaving art into public spaces</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">1.     Public art celebrates the
              identities, experiences and achievements of cultures that make up a society.
              Especially relevant to a multi-racial and cosmopolitan city like Singapore, the
              Circle Line Art in Transit (CCL AIT) programme captures this essence through
              its exhibits in the CCL stations.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p>2.     Today, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is
              pleased to announce the completion of the CCL AIT programme. This is a continuation
              of the well-received North East Line Art in Transit programme launched in 1997
              and completed in 2003.</p>
              <p>3.     Mr Yam Ah Mee, Chief Executive of the LTA said:
              "A vibrant arts community plays an important role in the quality of life
              that we all enjoy. Art recognises the ties that bind people to a place, its
              past as well as a better tomorrow. A thoughtfully conceived, executed and
              integrated piece of public art enhances the value and meaning of a landscape.
              Cities such as New York, Los
               Angeles, Toronto, Paris
              and London have
              long promoted public art in their transit systems. These cities, too, recognise
              the value of art and its ability to contribute to the vibrancy of the cities
              and humanise the often-hectic transit environment."</p>
              <p>4.     The CCL AIT programme comprises two main
              components: Art Seats and Integrated Art.</p>
              <p>5.     The Art Seats will be installed at all
              interchange station platforms on the Circle Line: Dhoby Ghaut; Paya Lebar;
              Serangoon; Bishan; Buona Vista and HarbourFront. Selected from entries through
              an international design competition launched at the Venice Biennale held in
              2006, these creative seats are designed to ats are designed to arouse curiosity
              and spur inspiration while providing comfort for commuters awaiting their next
              ride.</p>
              <p>6.     The Integrated Art for the 28 upcoming CCL
              stations comprises 22 commissioned and six competition-winning artworks. The
              artworks are built into station structures as much as possible to ensure that
              they are durable and easy to maintain. Each artwork is different, creating a
              unique experience for commuters at every station along the Circle Line.</p>
              <p>7.     An eight-member Art Review Panel assisted LTA in
              the judging of both competitions, and in the development of the artworks.
              (Please refer to <a href="http://www.lta.gov.sg/images/News%20Release%20CCL%20AIT%20Annex%20B.pdf">Annex
              A</a> for the members of the panel).</p>
              <p>8.     The panel provided guidance and support to the
              artists, as well as advice on how to develop artwork suitable for display in an
              MRT station environment. It also played a key role in facilitating partnership
              between private and public sectors and in encouraging community involvement
              during the development phase of the art pieces.</p>
              <p>9.     Mr Kwok Kian Chow, Chairman of the Art Review
              Panel and Director of the Singapore
               Art Museum, said:
              "The CCL Art in Transit programme has yielded a collection of high quality
              artworks by our local artists. The quality is achieved through the strength of
              the artistic proposals as well as collaboration by multiple parties in the
              course of realising the works. Beyond the aesthetics of "beauty",
              public art is also about social renewal, civic pride, public enjoyment,
              environmental improvement, and a clear relationship between the art and the
              local geography, features and communities." (Please refer to Annex B for
              the artists' names and themes for each station).</p>
              <p>10.     When asked about the concept of having Art in
              Transit, an enthusiastic Mr Eric Ongusiastic Mr Eric Ong, a Marketing
              Communications Manager, said: "I think it's a great idea to feature
              artworks from our local artists at every station. I take the train everyday and
              I sometimes wish our existing train stations were more colourful. Having these
              art pieces will give the stations more character, and who knows, it might even
              inspire more Singaporeans to pursue their artistic dreams."</p>
