              <p>311/312 was first seen running on NSL for test run in 1999. Then 311/312 later officially entered into passenger service in early 2000. I can remembered that I missed catching 311/312 at Jurong East station when it was leaving the station for heading towards Marina Bay. Then one weeks later, I finally catched 311/312 for my first time ever. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I boarded 005/006, the very first C151 RT in Nov 2006. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>My first MRT ride was after coming to Singapore on Boxing Day 2003. I needed to purchase a bus ticket back to KL from JB, so I boarded a C151 on Dec 27 2003 from NS17/CC15 Bishan towards NS7 Kranji. If I'm not mistaken, in the blue or green car. Initially found the toot-toot after "doors closing" announcement a tad bit annoying when compared to the ding-dong of Putra LRT (Which uses Bombardier, the provider of the crap BPLRT. Putraline isn't spared from breakdowns either. Feel sorry for folks in CCK) which serves my home.</p>
              <p>Disclaimer: I didn't know the difference between C151 and C651 when I first came to Singapore, so pardon me if I'm wrong. Then again, many Singaporeans don't know the difference between those two too....</p>
              <p>My first experience with C751B was sometime in 2004. I may have ridden in one of those much earlier but I didn;t realise it. But, I loved it, and everytime I board one, I feel a rush of excitement. Moreover, now it's the only type with LED scrolling notice board and JUANITA MELSON's voice!</p>
              <p>My first time with a refurbished C151 was surprisingly after I read this forum, sometime in late 2007 / early 2008. Pardon me, but when the contract for refurbishment was out in Nov 2006, I rarely travelled by MRT and when I did, I may have mistaken C151 (R) for C751B</p>
              <p>Now, looking forward to C851 in DTL... Will be the FIRST to ride it! Hahaha.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I have noticed the difference between C151 and C651 when I was in primary school and I do not know why some adults cannot notice the difference at all. I got my first C751B ride when I was in kindergarden (6 years old, year 2000) and I did not know that its name was "C751B" but I could sense that it was a new train from its interior and clearly remembered that ride because it was black. When I took the refurbished train for the first time in November 2006 from Pasir Ris, I thought it was a new train at first but did'nt really think it of a new train because it did not have LEDs or LCD TVs which were found in the C751B trains.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the first time I boarded the C751B train was in 2004 and I really like it especially the public address system. The station announcements is so clear and stereo that I felt like Mdm Juanita Melson was sitting beside you, addressing the station name. Lolz. I miss Juanita Melson's voice and its Ding-Dong sound. I really hate the siren sound and the voice which is so irritating to years</div>
