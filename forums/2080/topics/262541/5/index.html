            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: orange;"><strong>Circle Line On Track For Completion </strong></span><br><br>Construction of the Circle Line (CCL) is progressing as planned for completion from 2010 onwards. About half (14) the total of 29 stations already have their station structures completed, and architectural, electrical and mechanical works are now in progress. Station structure works have started for 10 other stations and the remaining five stations are at excavation stage.<br><br>2     Tunnelling along the CCL alignment is also progressing smoothly. About 25 kilometres of the 33.5-kilometre line have been completed. Full completion is expected to be achieved by 2008.<br><br>3     Said Mr Lim Bok Ngam, LTA Deputy Chief Executive (Infrastructure &amp; Development), "In all mega projects, there will inevitably be some areas of works that are ahead of schedule and some slightly behind. For CCL, we are satisfied that the overall progress of works is on track for completion from 2010."<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Circle Line Stage 1</span><br>4     Architectural, electrical and mechanical works are ongoing in Dhoby Ghaut, Bras Basah, Esplanade, Promenade and Stadium Stations, and are expected to be completed by early next year.<br><br>5     The diverted roads at Dhoby Ghaut and Bras Basah Stations have been reinstated. They include Orchard Road, Handy Road, Bras Basah Road, Waterloo Street and Queen Street. Reinstatement of Temasek Avenue, Rochor Road, Beach Road, Raffles Boulevard and the junction of Bras Basah Road and Nicoll Highway at Promenade and Esplanade Stations will be completed progressively from end 2007.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">New Nicoll Highway Station</span><br>6     Excavation for the construction of the new Nicoll Highway Station has been completed. As the station structure is constructed by the top-down method, casting of the roof and concourse slabs has been done first and completed. Casting of the base slab is now in progress and is expected to be completed in the 2nd quarter of 2008.<br><br>7     The construction of two tunnels, linking Stadium and the new Nicoll Highway Stations, under the Kallang Basin has been successfully accomplished. Preparation works for the laying of railway tracks are ongoing in the tunnels. The last stretch of tunnelling works between the new Nicoll Highway and Promenade Stations will be completed by the end of this year.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Circle Line Stage 2</span><br>8     On CCL 2, works in Kim Chuan Depot are almost completed. Full completion is expected at year end.<br><br>9     Architectural, electrical and mechanical works are ongoing in MacPherson and Tai Seng Stations while station structure construction for Mountbatten, Dakota and Paya Lebar Stations will span from now to mid 2008.<br><br>10     For Paya Lebar interchange station, we have successfully underpinned the existing MRT viaduct piers where the piled foundations were in the way of the new Paya Lebar Station on the Circle Line.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Circle Line Stage 3</span><br>11     The station structures of Bartley, Serangoon, Lorong Chuan, Bishan and Marymount Stations are completed. Architectural, electrical and mechanical works are being carried out in these stations and are expected to be completed by March 2008. Road reinstatement works along CCL 3 are ongoing for progressive completion by the 2nd quarter of 2008.<br><br>12     "Places, such as Lorong Chuan and Marymount, have been affected by the Circle Line project. We are pleased that they will soon be reinstated to the way they were before construction started. Residents and business owners in the area are surely looking forward to this stage of the works as their lives will return to normal in just a while more. We want to thank them, and everyone who have been affected by this project, for putting up with the inconveniences during this period. They have been truly understanding and patient" added Mr Lim.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Circle Line Stages 4 &amp; 5</span><br>13     Works on CCL 4 &amp; 5 are in full swing. Excavation is being carried out at Holland Village, Buona Vista, West Coast, Pasir Panjang and Labrador Park Stations. Construction of permanent structures at Kent Ridge and Telok Blangah Stations has started. All the stations on CCL 4 and 5 are expected to achieve station structure completion by mid 2009.<br><br>14     Bored tunnelling works are progressing smoothly, with about nine out of 17 kilometres of the tunnels being completed.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Circle Line Train</span><br>15     To date, 12 of the forty trains for CCL have arrived in Singapore and delivered to Kim Chuan Depot.<br><br>16     The rest of the trains, which are manufactured by the consortium of Alstom Transportation S.A., Alstom Transport (S) Pte Ltd and Singapore Technologies Electronics Ltd, will be delivered to Singapore progressively over the next one year.<br><br><strong>ABOUT CIRCLE LINE</strong><br>17     The Circle Line (CCL) is an orbital line that links all Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) lines running into the city. This 33 kilometres long medium-capacity system will have 29 underground stations. CCL will offer inter-suburban connectivity that is currently not provided by the MRT system.<br><br>18     CCL has six interchange stations for commuters to transfer from CCL to other MRT lines. These interchange stations are Dhoby Ghaut, Paya Lebar, Serangoon, Bishan, Buona Vista and HarbourFront. The integration of CCL with the existing MRT lines will provide greater convenience and allows commuters to enjoy accessibility to various locations in Singapore. It will cut down travelling time when commuters bypass the city centre to go to their destinations.<br><br>19     CCL is being built in five stages and construction of all five stages is in full swing. CCL is expected to be opened for passenger service from 2010 onwards.<br><br><strong>TIME SAVINGS</strong><br>20     A journey on the MRT from Bishan to Buona Vista now takes about 34 minutes, excluding waiting time, as the commuters travel on the North South Line to City Hall and transfer onto the East West Line. With CCL, it will take only 19 minutes for them to travel directly from Bishan to Buona Vista, without the need to make a transfer.<br><br>21     The current time taken for travelling from Bishan to Paya Lebar by bus is about 35 minutes, while taking the MRT with a transfer from the North South Line to East West Line is about 33 minutes. With CCL, travelling time will be reduced to about 17 minutes, without a need to make any transfer.<br><br>22 Another example is from Serangoon to Paya Lebar. The current time taken for travelling on the bus is about 25 minutes, while taking the MRT with a transfer from the North East Line to East West Line is about 33 minutes. With CCL, travelling time will be reduced to about 12 minutes, without a need to make any transfer.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Source: LTA</span></div>
