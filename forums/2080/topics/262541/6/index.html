The temporary wall is just next to travellator escalator near to NSL ticket concourse right? Or is it referring to the long wall (the one used to be covered with art works when NEL opened in 2003 but now it has either plain white cover or advertisement poster covering) facing travellator escalator?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm just wondering why LTA couldn't be a bit more like InTransitBC in Vancouver, Canada. They have been building a new metro line since 2005, scheduled for completion in late 2009 (and in time for the Vancouver Winter Olympics 2010). For the construction of this line, they have regular photo updates on the Canada Line website whereas all LTA gives are renders of future stations and no updates except for the ones that come once in a blue moon in written form (tunneling is bla bla bla percent complete with about bla bla bla km out of bla bla bla km done).</div>
