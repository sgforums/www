              <b>Underpass linking City Hall MRT to Suntec City Mall opens to public</b><br><br>
              
              30 Apr 08<br><br>
              
              SINGAPORE: An underground public walkway connecting One Raffles Link to Suntec City Mall is now open once again. <br><br>
              
              And from now till 4 May, Suntec City Mall is giving away free coffee, chocolates and sweets to pedestrians to mark the reopening of the underpass. <br><br>
              
              The public can also look forward to music and line dancing performances every weekend in the month of May. <br><br>
              
              The underpass, which is part of the CityLink Mall, had been closed since 2003 to facilitate the construction of the Circle Line MRT system. During that period, pedestrians used a temporary overhead bridge to get to the Suntec City Mall and the Convention Centre. <br><br>
              
              Come 2010, the underpass will also serve commuters using the Esplanade MRT station, which is situated along the Circle Line. - CNA/vm

              <p>Paya Lebar CCL station box is completed. Now the construction of entrance/exit box and linkway between CCL and EWL currently is in progress. Once the linkway between EWL and CCL is completed, the road will eventually be restored back to their original position. But they are pretty faster than Mountbatten CCL station on Stage 2.</p>
              <p>Mountbatten CCL station construction seemed to be progressing at quite slow pace. The top roof covering up is about 95% done.</p>
              <p>And MacPherson MRT station box is completed. The construction of entrance/exit box will be completed, following by fittings in two or more months' times.</p>
              <p>Bishan, Bartley, Lor Chuan and Serangoon CCL station follow the similar suit at MacPherson CCL station in terms of construction progress pace, meaning that their station box is already completed and their entrance/exit box will be completed being building and fitting in few months' times.</p>
              <p>For Nicoll Highway CCL station, the construction seemed to be progressing very slow as I think the constructor is still building the station box. I really need to check out the progress there one day.</p>

              <p>Although I was passing by Mountbatten CCL station on alternate weekends to visit Old Airport Road estate, I will check out on Dakota station.</p>
              <p>Maybe I have to take lift at Old Airport Road flat (Blk 95 or 96) to see the construction site since the road was closed and diverted into Guilimard Road.</p>
              <p>I will update here when I have the information on this.</p>

              <p><br>Most probably open along. Don't forget after completing the SB platform they also need to build the CCL platforms.</p>
              <p>Though the SB platform is mostly completed, like 95%? But they haven't installed A/C and do final touchups.</p>
