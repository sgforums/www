It's a complex operation and we would need to fly in experts from Germany," he added.<br><br>In an earlier interview with TODAY, Mr Heng offered a glimpse of the problems he had to grapple with in trying to save his balloon.<br><br>"We run to SLA...SLA will talk to URA, and URA might be talking to the Land Transport Authority - but we have no access (to the process)."<br><br>Mr Heng said he had been hoping for a face-to-face meeting with the agencies, so as to gain a better understanding of the issues and "craft out possible solutions and alternatives".<br><br>Earlier, the SLA told TODAY it was helping Mr Heng to find another site but that site would have to be opened for public tender.<br><br>Mr Heng said on Thursday he was now in talks with the National Parks Board regarding the relocation of the balloon to the Gardens by the Bay project in the Marina Bay area.<br><br>Interested parties also include VivoCity and Sentosa.<br><br>Its location woes aside, the balloon has been a success for Ducktours.<br><br>"Since the middle of last year, about 150,000 tourists have gone up in the balloon," said Mr Heng. - TODAY/ym</div>

Woodlands, Yishun, Punggol/ Sengkang, Pair Ris etc. right now there's little development between these towns and bus links between them (39, 85, 161, 168, 965, 969) are available. so wait long long for north shore line to be built. won't be before 2012 anyway.</div>
