So disappointing...</div></blockquote>You have to think of overall construction costs. It is not cheaper to build CCL line than NSL and EWL line cos they are fully underground so this will cost more to dig out and do tunneling works. It cost nearly $7 billion. Not only that, it involve the high cost of constructing underground station with the size that accommodate 6 cars. Furthermore, several stations of CCL pass through central town, making it impossible to construct the station with the size of 6 cars due to space constraints.<br><br>FYI: CCL is not really a Larger Rapid transit like NSL and EWL. CCL is merely a "medium" rapid transit. This is what LTA said.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

NS27 will only become an interchange if the CCL is extended in the future. Currently the terminus is at Harbourfront, but it may be extended in the future to include CC30, Shenton Way, and CC31, Marina Bay.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
