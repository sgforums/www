            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry for my mistake I made. I mentioned earlier that the station in second and third picture is Dakota station. But this is incorrect. Sorry for causing confusion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Actually, I heard this wrongly when watching the TV news. So I went back and re-checked this. The increase in cost of sands and granite has impacted on the contractor constructing Dakota, Mountbatten and Nicoll Highway station. Nevertheless, the contractor is still working closely with LTA to keep the construction of Dakota station going on.<br><br>Only 4 stations (Dhoby Ghaut, Bras Basah, Esplanade and Promenade) are completed and will be handed to SMRT at end of this year. So right now, 10 stations are currently in fitting-up work phase. They are Stadium, MacPherson, Tai Seng, Bartley, Serangoon, Lorong Chuan, Bishan, Marymount, one-north and HarbourFront.<br><br>So I think the first picture is Tai Seng station.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>And then the station in second and third picture is indeed Stage 3 station. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

They will be replaced by new contractor soon to continue finishing the station according to LTA. This explained why Macpherson station is taking long to be completed.<br><br>I think macpherson station is currently left with uncompleted fitting up works like wall tiles, escalators, PSD and etc.</div>

If you look at the structures above ground, only one entrance is near completion. The other one is still having concrete being set and another has yet to have concrete setting done (the one next to the Geylang NPC).</div>
