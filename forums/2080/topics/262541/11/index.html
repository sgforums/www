              <p>My pleasure.</p>
              <p>Given the pace of construction progress on CCL Stage 2, I think late 2009 is the earliest they can be opened to public.</p>
              <p>All station fittings, rail track being laid, electricial installation and etc on CCL Stage 3 is expected to be completed at end of 2008. Then SMRT will do trial run on Stage 3 before opening to public in mid-2009.</p>

              <p>For Nicoll Highway MRT station, the escalators at entrance/exit point have been installed already and are covered up with big tent above. I think they are going to construct entrance/exit box soon.</p>

              <p>Meanwhile, the exterior fittings for two of entrance/exit box for MacPherson station are almost completing. The third one will have exterior fittings being implemented sooner as its basic foundation is completed.

              <p>The track for NSL along Bishan MRT station will never be altered or realigned. There is no new track for southbound train.</p>
              <p>So this is where you will alight at opposite side which is on left side of train instead of right side of train where you are currently alight at. It's like Braddell station for Southbound train.</p>

              <p><br>Actually there is nothing wrong with the current NAC layout. I don't know why SMRT wasted money on the NSL when their focus is the CCL. Then they will use the new AC Bishan station as an excuse to raise fares.</p>

              <p>The new plan at Bishan is actually initiated by the LTA. As the LTA anticipated increased passenger flow with the Circle Line and hence possible overcrowding on the current platform, thus the south-bound platform is built to relieve congestion. Furthermore, poor ventilation on the south-bound platform meant that it (and the whole Bishan station) has to be air-conditioned. The current north-bound platform will also be upgraded as a result.</p>
              <p>SMRT will probably use increased operating costs (due to increased train frequency) to raise fares. But not within the next few months given their "promise".</p>
