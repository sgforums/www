            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I learnt about them from various source such as rail forum and Wikipedia.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>If it's confirmed that SMRT is operator for DTL, I can safely say that CCL and DTL will share train like NSL and EWL unless DTL depot is being built, then DTL will probably have their own train.<br><br>As for train model and design on DTL, I don't have the information so I can't give you the answer on this. But I am sure that the manufacturer for DTL train is still Alstom as Alstom has specialization in building driverless train.<br><br>I remembered somewhere that it was mentioned DTL depot will be built along DTL Stage 3 as the available land along DTL Stage 2 is reserved for residential development or some other developments in which land resource has to be planned and optimized. But I can tell you it's still under planning and is not confirmed yet. Who will know if they have decided to build depot along Stage 2... So just wait and see for latest news from LTA.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

It will use some 54,000 cubic metres of concrete. This process takes roughly 18 months.<br><br>But other stations are even nearer to completion, with just the finishing touches to go.<br><br>In fact by the end of the year, LTA will hand over the first four completed stations to operator SMRT. These include the Dhoby Ghaut, Bras Basah, Esplanade and Promenade stations.<br><br>SMRT will oversee caretaking duties leading up to the Circle Line's operational date of 2010.<br><br>Lim Bok Ngam, LTA's deputy chief executive for infrastructure and development, said: "Overall, the Circle Line is about 65 percent completed. For individual elements, tunnelling works, we are about 70 percent completed. On the station side, I think 10 of the 29 stations are already into the architectural and fitting up work phase."<br><br>LTA had to grapple with cost issues arising from the recent disruption in sand and granite supplies.<br><br>The agency will compensate its contractors 75 percent of the increase in sand and granite costs. The increase in costs has affected phases 4 and 5 of the project.<br><br>LTA's Mr Lim said: "The few stations and the Circle Line 2, for example Nicoll Highway, Dakota, Mountbatten, they're also affected. But contractors are working closely with us, there's no big concern about supply."<br><br>LTA says it will not know the final increased cost of the project until it is completed. For now, it says, it will be able to manage the situation. - CNA/ir</div>

I have not seen Kawasaki and Siemens ever building driverless train before. Or perhaps they lost to Alstom during LTA's tender process to build driverless train? You can enlighten me more with this information if you have any on whether Kawasaki or Siemens are able to manufacture driverless train.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sep 15, 2007<br>CONSTRUCTION WORK ON SCHEDULE, BUT...<br><strong>Circle Line will exceed $6.7b budget</strong><br>By Christopher Tan<br><br>CONSTRUCTION work on the Circle Line MRT is on schedule, but it will cost more than the original $6.7 billion budgeted.<br><br>Inflation, more expensive concrete and more stringent design and engineering standards following the 2004 collapse at the Nicoll Highway station have pushed costs up.<br><br>Giving a progress report yesterday, Land Transport Authority deputy chief executive Lim Bok Ngam said part of the 33.5-km line should be ready by 2010, with the rest of it completed by '2011 or 2012'.<br><br>The new timeline takes into account delays after the 2004 collapse. Before the accident, which killed four workers, the first phase of the line was to have been completed by 2006, and the second phase by 2010.<br><br>Yesterday, Mr Lim said: 'In all mega projects, there will be some areas of works that are ahead of schedule and some slightly behind. For the Circle Line, we are satisfied that the overall progress is on track for completion from 2010.'<br><br>About 65 per cent of the line has been completed.<br><br>The structures of 14 of the 29 stations are done, and by next year, LTA expects all tunnelling work to be finished.<br><br>The Circle Line, which is expected to carry 400,000 to 500,000 commuters daily around the city centre, may yet open in stages.<br><br>The LTA said that a stretch measuring about 8km - with seven stations between MacPherson and Marymount - was in advanced stages of completion.<br><br>In fact, architectural, electrical and mechanical works are being carried out now, and are expected to be completed by mid-2008.<br><br>The Straits Times understands that as the train depot is along the stretch, it is feasible to open it as early as the first half of 2010.<br><br>But Mr Lim would not commit to this.<br><br>'It's not just the construction. Testing and commissioning of the system can be quite complicated,' he said.<br><br>Mr Lim said a new contractor will soon be picked to finish the MacPherson and Tai Seng stations - where construction stalled last year when Sweden's NCC stopped work because of the sharp rise in concrete prices.<br><br>Mr Lim said another episode such as this was unlikely, saying 'the NCC case was an exceptional case'.<br><br>Industry players said NCC, a relative newcomer to LTA work, may be the first casualty of cost overruns which have hit Circle Line projects since the 2004 collapse.<br><br>The Nicoll Highway station has been re-designed. It is now one-third smaller, but costs 10 per cent more to build.<br><br>Higher engineering standards - which have pushed up costs - were evident at other stations along the line.<br><br>For instance, the Farrer Road Station under construction now has retaining walls that are 1.2m thick - 50 per cent thicker than the collapsed walls of the Nicoll Highway station.<br><br>The higher standards affect the western half of the Circle Line more, as construction there started well after 2004.<br><br>Mr Lim said the eventual cost 'has not been worked out', but the higher cost of sand and granite would only add 'a single-digit' percentage increase to the project.<br><br>He said the LTA will compensate the contractors 75 per cent of the rise in sand and aggregate cost.<br><br>christan@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright Â© 2007 Singapore Press Holdings.
