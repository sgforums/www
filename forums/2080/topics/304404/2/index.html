So it's like there's a mini hidden camera in the train? Most probably not.

            <div class='col-md body'>in Japan, they have pushers pushing people into trains...In Hong Kong, they stop people from boarding the MTR if they deem the train full (which is probably around the same level of load in off peak direction during peak hours in Singapore), such that people do not need to squeeze and people at next stop can board the train.<br><br>See the difference between those systems and Singapore's? They have people at platforms to guard the platform all the time and to do some crowd control during peak hours, although nearly everything in HK turns chaos when there is a No. 8 or No. 10 warning up and MTR and bus company staffs can't do much with the crowd going home then.</div>
