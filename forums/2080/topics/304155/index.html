            <div class='col-md body'>I think the procedure is to move the mode selector to CM mode and then the train will stop due to the power selector at B4, next, the train moves again when the TO selects it to P3 and so on...

It is set at exactly 6 car lengths. If the driving cab passed this limit, indicated by a sign with 2 vertical black lines, it means the last car of the train had passed the platform edge. This is like the "Point of No Return" and the train must proceed to the next station.</div>

              <p>Its impossible for the TO to fall asleep in our systems, for there is a 'dead man switch' on the control stick whereby constant pressure is necessary to operate the train using the stick in CM and manual modes. Release the the brakes apply.</p>
              <p>The situation may be that the TO misjudged distance, a very common occurance here because TOs are not trained specifically to operate the train manually. When he finds that the distance is closing up, even when the speed is low, there is a tendancy to apply hard brakes to stop the train immediately, which leads to those situations.</p>
              <p>Remedy? Do not panic, apply brakes slowly and stay at that brake level, do not adjust to higher levels. BVE program trains excellent TOs and it should be included in the course. Get 40 x 0.0metres and graduate.</p>

              <p>Set Back Limits are anywhere between half to one car length only, depending on the station. Meaning to say if the train overshoots by one or half a car, it will not be allowed to reverse due to timetabling and ATP.</p>
              <p>The TO will need to comms back to report the overshoot and obtain permission to go into CM, which will allow him to reverse. In time constraints, this might not be approved and the train will instead hold at the overshoot position before continuing on.</p>
