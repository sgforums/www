              <p>I feel that it is time for SMRT to implement a Ladies/Children only cabin in all their train rides. Fix it at the third cabin of every train so as to give ladies and children better comfort and safer rides. Just like Japan has its ladies only train.</p>

              <p>&lt;Girls, beware of perverts on MRT <br><br>By Kelvin Teh<br><br>The next time you take public transport, be suspicious if you find any handphone that seems to be mysteriously trained on you. Someone can very well be filming or taking pictures of you.<br><br>A few mornings ago, as I was taking the MRT to work in an irritatingly-packed train, I glanced up from the magazine I was reading and noticed the man standing in front of me.<br><br>Dressed in nondescript T-shirt and jeans, he was holding up his handphone as one would when messaging - except that he was not busy pressing away on his phone.<br><br>Instead, he was holding it there in his raised hand while occasionally shifting his hand position slightly. To most people around him, it seemed like he was looking at text messages.<br><br>I next trained my sight on where his handphone was pointing to and, immediately, my suspicion was aroused.<br><br>She was a pretty young lady, conservatively dressed in office wear. She was also dozing, unaware of the scene unfolding before her.<br><br>My curiousity aroused, I leaned forward and, true enough, the man was secretly filming the woman with his handphone.<br><br>My first instinct was to glance around to see if anyone else had noticed, but everyone was oblivious. I waited a while more, just to ascertain that the pervert was filming her.<br><br>And then, I felt rage.<br><br>I gave the man a hard shove in the back, pushing the shocked fellow aside.<br><br>Next, I woke the woman up gently and whispered to her that she was being filmed.<br><br>She was stunned and her first reaction was to look up at the fellow, who immediately exclaimed in Mandarin: "I don't have hor. I was just playing with my handphone ok!"<br><br>Yeah, right.<br><br>At this, the woman folded her arms protectively around her chest but refrained from saying anything.<br><br>To avoid embarrassing the girl further, I did not confront the man. In the meantime, the bewilderment on everyone's faces was palpable.<br><br>Although I have heard and read accounts of cameras hidden in changing rooms and perverts secretly filming under the skirts of ladies, to witness this personally is shocking.<br><br>That person being filmed could very well be my sister or one of my female friends. That a perverted stranger is storing pictures of someone you know - that is a disgusting thing.<br><br>But, then again, I guess I am not surprised. Too many such stories have surfaced all too often.<br><br>So girls, just look out for yourself.&gt;</p>

              <p>then when we have the female-only train..<br> <br> the younger women will say the older women are crude &amp; disgusting.<br> <br> then they'll have carriages for women 21-45 years old, &gt;46 years old...<br> <br> then the more fashionable ones will say those wear cheap clothes are uncouth.<br> <br> then they'll have carriages for women wearing branded stuff, women wearing cheapskate stuff.<br> <br> then the ones whose husbands are picking up from the mrt station will
              feel they're of a different breed than those taking the feeder service
              from the interchange.<br> <br> then they'll have carriages for the women with "seemingly wonderful" husbands &amp; those who take the bus!<br> <br> the list goes on! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
