              <p>Overall, the Circle Line Discover was great. However, I felt
              that more could be improved from the forum side.</p>
              <p>Khairiano has suggested using a tag to identify ourselves and
              Veyron16.4 has even made a blank one for us to put our name in. Sad
              to say, the only 2 people I have seen using this tag is
              Interception_7 and myself. Maybe I did not see the rest of you,
              which brings me to my next point.</p>
              <p>There are some here who attended the CCLD in the same train as
              us, but did not even say a simple "Hi". Is it really that
              difficult? We all have the passion for trains, and we should
              acknowledge each other's presence. Another occasion I encountered
              was when I was entering the train from MacPherson while a group was
              coming out. No acknowledgement as well. Let's keep this forum
              united okay? Like what Interception_7 suggested, we should all have
              met at Esplanade at 2pm just to say hi for maybe 15 minutes? And
              then we can go ahead and do our own "discovery". The next possible
              time I can think of with the whole forum going to the same location
              would be CCLD from Marymount to HarbourFront.</p>
              <p>And one guy I saw in the train, I don't know whether he is from
              this forum. I was walking to the front of the train, and this boy
              was holding his camera up to the Train Car Number at the front of
              the train, staring hard at the number, shuddering and mumbling to
              himself "Train Car Number... Train Car Number..." as he took the
              picture. I shall not describe this guy to protect his privacy. I
              mean look kid, I know you're pasisonate about trains and all but
              can you don't look like a drug addict? What would the public think
              of all railway fans?</p>

              difficult? We all have the passion for trains, and we should
              acknowledge each other's presence. Another occasion I encountered
              was when I was entering the train from MacPherson while a group was
              coming out. No acknowledgement as well. Let's keep this forum
              united okay? Like what Interception_7 suggested, we should all have
              met at Esplanade at 2pm just to say hi for maybe 15 minutes? And
              then we can go ahead and do our own "discovery". The next possible
              time I can think of with the whole forum going to the same location
              would be CCLD from Marymount to HarbourFront.</p>
              <p>And one guy I saw in the train, I don't know whether he is from
              this forum. I was walking to the front of the train, and this boy
              was holding his camera up to the Train Car Number at the front of
              the train, staring hard at the number, shuddering and mumbling to
              himself "Train Car Number... Train Car Number..." as he took the
              picture. I shall not describe this guy to protect his privacy. I
              mean look kid, I know you're passionate about trains and all but
              can you don't look like a drug addict? What would the public think
              of all railway fans?</p>

              <p>I understand you were shy to approach the other bus fans during the citaro trip. The others were sitting at the back chatting (of course it wasn't loud and creating commotions like walking up and down the bus filming) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>Overall, the Circle Line Discover was great. However, I felt

              <p>Khairiano has suggested using a tag to identify ourselves and
              Veyron16.4 has even made a blank one for us to put our name in. Sad
              to say, the only 2 people I have seen using this tag is
              Interception_7 and myself. Maybe I did not see the rest of you,
