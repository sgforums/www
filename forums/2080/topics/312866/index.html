              <p>SMRT need to buy additional train to accomodate the capacity needed for future NSL and EWL Tuas extension at Marina Bay and Joo Koon respectively. Maybe about 20 C951 trains.</p>

              <p><br>Its not a matter of getting use to it. It is a matter of unprofessionalism shown by SMRT due to some words of phrases sounding weird and sometimes even <strong>pronounced incorrectly. For instance, Yishun was <strong>pronounced as "yee-soon" in the new annoucements and "Passenger travelling towards........" sounded the weirdest and most irritating. This is because the new annoucer's voice is too high pitched and therefore unsuitable for in-train annoucements. In fact, most of the annoucements and the "siren" sound irritating actually. Europeans who take a ride on our MRT will therefore think that Singapore is unable to use the English Language properly.</strong></strong></p>

              <p><a href="http://www.lta.gov.sg/tender_info/notice/tenders_notice_jan_851a.htm">C851A</a> is the contract being awarded to a constructor to construct Bartley CCL station. But I cannot find C851 without "A". So it is safe to assume that C851 is for constructing the CCL tunnels along Bartley Road.</p>
              <p>So the 4th series should be labelled as <a href="http://www.lta.gov.sg/tender_info/notice/tenders_notice_nov07_951.htm">C951</a>. LTA put up the tender on C951 Electric Trains in Nov 07 and has since extended the closing date to June 08. We will know the result of which train manufacturer will be awarded Contract 951 in early July 08.</p>
              <p>I think C951A/C951B train will be designed, developed, tested and deployed for possibly Downtown Line and NSL/EWL extension respectively. Or maybe C951 is solely for Downtown MRT while next contract on train could be the one for NSL/ELW extension.</p>

              <p>SMRT needs at least 10 trains to supplement this Joo Koon extension as well as at least 20 more for fleet addition. Or not passengers will complain them upside down.</p>

              <p>So the 4th series should be labelled as <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.lta.gov.sg/tender_info/notice/tenders_notice_nov07_951.htm">C951</a>. LTA put up the tender on C951 Electric Trains in Nov 07 and has since extended the closing date to June 08. We will know the result of which train manufacturer will be awarded Contract 951 in early July 08.</p>
              <p>I think C951A/C951B train will be designed, developed, tested and deployed for possibly Downtown Line and NSL/EWL extension respectively. Or maybe C951 is solely for Downtown MRT while next contract on train could be the one for NSL/ELW extension.</p>

              <p><br>Downtown and NSL/EWL will <strong>HAVE</strong> to use different trains if Alstom wants to bring in Metropolis for DTL.</p>
              <p>Because the track systems are different, an Alstom cannot run on EWL or NSL. Even though for the CCL they are also using 750V DC power, but their track signals are totally different. So we can readily assume that Alstom cannot run their Metropolis on the EWL for the Joo Koon extension. Or unless if SMRT wants the DTL to use the same type of trains and their train signals for EWL/NSL, then it is possible they order as a bulk.</p>

              <p>Of course.</p>
              <p>But I am not sure if C951 will break into two groups, C951A and C951B when being awarded to contractor in which means that C951A will go to Alstom for DTL while C951B go to Kawasaki or Siemens for NSL/EWL extension. But I think it is unlikely to happen as we are just 7 years away from the opening of NSL/EWL extension in 2015. So I believe that C951 will be train for DTL only. Just wait and see in early July 08 when the award of contract is announced after closing date in late Jun 08.</p>

              <p>Then maybe we will have C1051? o_O</p>
              <p>The contract should be going to the same dual companies that manufacture the C751B, the KNS group. I hope you get what I mean by Kanasai (KNS). =D</p>
