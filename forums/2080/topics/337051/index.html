              <p>Those who regularly switch between cabins might notice this.</p>
              <p>The first cabin's engine is always the quietest, which is quite a mystery.</p>
              <p>Being the first cabin, it definitely goes the fastest.</p>
              <p>Only a C151, being in service for long, and has lost part of its efficieny, that it creates some noise.</p>
              <p>For a C651 and a C751B, the only time you can hear a first-cabin engine noise would be at underground tracks.</p>
              <p>And surprisingly, this doesn't happen only in singapore trains.</p>

              <p>The first and last cars (the proper term for it) of the train are quieter because they are trailer cars i.e. they do not have the noise-producing motors underneath.</p>
              <p>When the train is underground, the sound of the motors are in a confined space (the tunnel), hence the soundwaves do not have a chance to dissipate (as it could in an open space above ground) but are instead echoing off the walls surrounding the trains; what you are hearing is effectively the echo of the train's motor in this case.</p>
              <p>C151 trains' trailer cars make noise because the components underneath the trailer car there (eg. the bogeys (or trucks, if you prefer American terms)) are getting worn out; what you are hearing is the result of their wear and tear.</p>
              <p>And the first and last cars don't go faster or slower than the other train cars - the cars that make up the entire consist are always travelling at the same speed relative to each other. If one car is being faster or slower than the other, it could mean breakaway/runaway train cars, which translates into big trouble. The cars appear to be travelling faster because it is either the first part of the train to enter a station, when it's still at high speed, or because it is the last part of the train to leave the station, when the train has accelerated to a high speed,  and hence appear to be travelling faster - in other words, it's all an illusion.</p>
              <p>And of course, this doesn't happen only with Singaporean trains - I don't know much about trains in other countries, but if their first and last cars are also trailer cars, don't expect too much noise from them.</p>
              <p>This isn't a mystery at all. Use your brains.</p>

              <p>eXAKR is right. The motors for our 6car trains are all in the 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th cabin. 1st and last cabins do not have motors. Only the upcoming CCL 3car trains will be different. the CCL trains will have motor in the 1st and last cabin. The middle one just a trailer.</p>

              <p>Call4ljw, don't be too arrogant. Not trying to start a flame war here, but I feel that you delibrately is trying to be confusing here; in fact, I'm finding your posts to be not making sense.</p>
              <p>And indeed, what I have said is true. And get this: I have never officially studied physics as a subject in school, having only read up about it here and there. The concepts I explained should be rather easily understandable; if you wish to, just go to someplace like Answers.com or Wikipedia and do a search about it. It shouldn't take a physics professor to figure out some of the basic concepts I have explained.</p>
              <p>If you still don't understand, then I suggest you go to an MRT station and look at the entire trainset entering and leaving the station yourself. Then, go to somewhere around the part of the train tracks just before Ang Mo Kio, southbound, and take a good look at the underside of the trains. Then, go to the walkway over there that gets very close to the tracks before it snakes down toward the station, and stand there and listen for yourself where most of the motor's noise is coming from. As for the tunnel one, try this: stand in an open space and speak to yourself, listening carefully for your own echo. Now try doing this in a pedestrain tunnel somewhere, and compare.</p>
