              Many people boarding and alighting during peak hours? The trains will try to compensate by running faster between stations, but they'll still be late as you can only shave 15 seconds per station by running fast but you're likely to dwell much longer at stations in CBD.
              
              Off-peak AM usually runs very accurately without issues.

              <p><br>TO cannot change to CM anihow without authorising by Control Centre. AM is the most efficient then CM... AM has the ability to brake late and gradually to stop rather then CM.</p>
              <p>F.Y.I:</p>
              <p>For those who does not know if u already know it then good.. To see whether the TO is driving AM. CM, RM.... u can see at the front cab has this light orange color. If its light up mean its in CM...if its off mean AM...if its Blinking means RM (below 18kph)</p>

              <p><br>Yep. TO can only intitate CM when in emergency situations or raining days. There is no such thing as drive halfway switch CM then after that switch AM and so on.</p>
              <p>In driving CM and RM, TO have to press finger down on the dead-man's switch... by releasing it the train will auto turn off power and comes to a complete halt (a safety measure from TOs that fall asleep when driving trains). Hence, CM and RM will not be accurate as the TO gets to decide the speed, not the computer whereby the speeds are computerised and same for all trains passing by a stretch of tracks.</p>
              <p>To TS:</p>
              <p>There are alot of people boarding trains during peak hour. Though the 45-second-per station rule still applies, sometimes boarding time gets very elongated. TOs try to usher people as quickly onto trains as possible by sounding buzzer quickly, but apparently it has brought about a negative view, by mostly, anti-SMRT people.</p>
              <p>AM off-peak trains are usually very accurate.</p>
              <p>I think I have said it soooo many times about frequencies, some other people still cannot understand why they fail so badly in trying to condemn SMRT... not to TS of course. I do hope you have a better view on why during peak hour train frequencies are so bad.</p>
