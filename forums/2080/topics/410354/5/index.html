              <p>Guys I got a few facts here.</p>
              <p>Fact 1: I today went to NLB and found URA 2001 Concept Plan. That plan is actually a small booklet which contains the highlights of the next 40 ~ 50 years of development, subjected to a review in every 10 years. I had photocopied a map on such issue (No colour) which I would upload it some days later. Alternatively, you can go to the NLB Lee Kong Chian Reference Library at Level 8.</p>
              <p>Fact 2: The guy who draw the map of "Future MRT Line" with Tampines Line, Seletar Line, Tuas LRT etc is generally correct --- as in compared with the concept plan.</p>
              <p>Fact 3: Kallang Line / Extension was not mentioned in that map, preceisly is due to that particular sector is not present in this concept plan.</p>
              <p>Fact 4: Holland Line, Seletar Line etc was mentioned as a unconfirmed but logical name because such keyword cannot be found in the booklet, except in terms of graphical drawing.</p>
              <p>Fact 5: Paya Lebar - Marine Parade line do present in that map.</p>
              <p>Fact 6: According to the concept plan again, the DTL Stage 2 extension will be done, and it will connect to Sungei Kadut instead of Kranji (I agree that DTL Stage 2 go to Kranji will involve a right curve towards Turf City.). Well, added bonus: From Sungei Kadut, it goes up to Marsiling near Woodland Checkpoint and go to connect with Thomson Line (But AFAIK, according to leak government tender, TSL will be 4 train car with 5 doors instead of CCL / DTL 3 train car with 4 doors or EWL/NSL/NEL 6 train car with 4 doors).</p>
              <p>Fact 7: There is a small orbital (And many other looping lines) line, one of them located in between of Yishun and Sembawang.</p>
              <p>Fact 8: There was a plan of LRT (Or MRT?) line in Tuas - Lim Chu Kang - Neo Tiew - Marsiling as well as Pulau Ubin / Tekong (WTF - Tekong? Maybe that time is when NS are abolished --- politics talk again.) in whitepaper 1996 BUT not in this concept plan. So please dont plan a line in Lim Chu Kang, as other than ghosts, who is gonna to "live" there for 15 years [They only allowed to be buried for 15 years, except Islamic cemetry which is due to religious reasons] and SAF people in live firing area / Tengah air base as well as farmers around that agricultural areas.</p>

              <p>got to understand, e 2001 concept plan had a lot of planned train line appearing. But everything was scaled down.</p>
              <p>It's all over budget issues. You can't be spending all $$ onto e MRT, you need $$ for e economy, education and other things.</p>

              <p>What I expect, is that they are not going to build to many new LRT lines and too much orbital lines wont benefit the commuters from East to West / North to South.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As I said, the concept plan is likely to change a lot due to NCW incident, and other budgeting issues [Complicated Current World Affairs involved as politics is involved, and politics is not just election], but instead of 2030 acheive 540km rail, they might and will pushed that to say 2050. (By 2020 to have 278km of rail and only 10 years to ready of another 200~ km of rail? You gotta kidding me.)</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Circle
              Line </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">First thing's first. The unused platforms at Promenade.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">If you look at the tunnels, they curve nicely to the left. You can
              assume it is parallel to DTL. They were suppose to be for DTL.
              Originally Nicol Highway was reserved for BTL. Due to the collapse,
              LTA divert the lines and did a last-minute change to Promenade.
              Look at the result, First, the trains from BTL were suppose to be
              ABLE to crossover to DBG but then, they forgot that the nearby
              building (Suntec City) column is blocking. LTA doesn't want to
              rebuild or what-so-ever. LTA hates Level crossing the most, but the
              provision is still there, fenced up. So its not for Marina Bay
              extension or what-so-ever. That track is going to be dead forever
              unless LTA wants to implement a new line and put a buffer
              IMMEDIATELY after the tracks.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Second, connecting Marina Bay to Harbourfront</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Frequency screwed by shuttle service? Nah. Its going to be a crazy
              shuttle wvy crossover service. At Esplanade, Promenade and
              Bayfront. The frequency is going to be alternate. 1 train goes to
              promenade another goes to esplanade and the same for the other 2
              stations. Connecting Marina Bay to Harbourfront is not a problem
              and IT WILL HAPPEN. I repeat, IT WILL HAPPEN. The Pasir Panjang
              Container Terminal has been reserved for the 3rd (or 4th CBD). It
              has been 100% reserved by URA. The circle line can interchange with
              Tanjong Pagar but then wouldn't that be short-term plan? Extending
              it via the Pasir Panjang Container Terminal would be a better plan.
              The Circle Line will serve the new "mini" CBD.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Third, 40 trains on CCL?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">40 Trains on CCL is a big no-no. Seriously look at DTL, 73 trains
              for 33 stations but CCL? 40 trains for 35 stations? RIDICULOUS! I
              did my own calculations, CCL will have at least 77 trains serving
              it by 2030. Look, there are sidings all along the Circle Line and
              you can "park" 16 trains all in the sidings. Meaning, CCL can have
              up to 93 trains on the line.  </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Downtown
              Line</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">First, DTL 1.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">DTL tracks would be able to CROSSOVER to CCL tracks to Marina Bay
              to the Temporary Depot. I have nothing to say about this phase.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Second, DTL 2</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Gali Batu depot. Its near Yew Tee but no that near. But Extending
              it to interchange with the future NSL Sungei Kadut station is
              highly possible or maybe to Kranji station. Since the tracks to
              depot is going to be under the road. When it is about to reach the
              depot it will curve left into the depot. But then extending it by
              modifying the tracks so that it can be a crossover to the depot and
              head straight and run along Woodlands Road, towards Kranji and end
              there.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Third, DTL 3</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Now this is the interesting part, lets take a look at Bedok Town
              Park station alignment, the BPJ track curves weirdly to the left
              instead of being side by side. Meaning, its possible to have a
              middle track. Look at the width of the station (LTA drawing is not
              always accurate), it looks kinda wide right? Yeah, there will sure
              be a spur line, first it will head straight and do a sharp turn
              back onto Bedok North Road. Follow along Bedok North Road and do a
              PMN turn infront of Block 547 (There is a large plot of land
              reserved). Then it will follow along Bedok North Ave 1 and continue
              towards Bedok South Road, follow the road until Upper East Coast
              Road and interchange there.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Expo overrun tracks will split into 2, 1 towards the shared depot
              between DTL and ERL and the other, interchange with ERL. I'm very
              sure that DTL will interchange with ERL and share a depot.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kallang
              Line</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">LTA has proposed this route in the 1996 white paper. In my opinion,
              it will be a shuttle service. The new added section will be when
              the MRB bound track going above the BSD bound viaduct. Adding a new
              viaduct and crossover there then immediately run along Kallang
              River and go Underground. It will go under the Kallang River all
              the way and interchange with Kallang and Stadium then head towards
              the future CBD, Marina East then join with the Marina South overrun
              tracks.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">North Coast
              Line</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">It will interchange at Changi Airport, go along Pasir Ris Park or
              the road parallel to TPE (Old Tampines Rd ??!?!) and head towards
              Punggol and make a "T-shape" interchange. Then it will continue to
              Seletar and towards Simpang and interchange with Woodlands. Then
              continue to Lim Chu Kang and most probably interchange with Boon
              Lay</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">East
              Region </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">2 parallel lines running beside East West Line, naming East west
              line run through the central of the east and Downtown line the
              northern borderline of the east and Eastern Region Line the
              southern borderline of the east</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">North East
              Region</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">The North East Line is the only beeded line. The towns in the
              northeast have a maximum 2.5km radius from the nearest MRT line</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">North
              Region</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">2 Lines (1 Existing, 1 U/C)</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">The Thomnson Line is going to run almost parallel to NSL. Like in
              the east, there will be parallel lines running beside the main
              lines naming EWL/NSL.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">The Thomnson Line depot will be somewhere near Mandai Rd and I
              expect it to be running to the nearest parallel road west of NSL
              (Woodlands to MRB)</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">North West
              Region</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">2 lines (1 Existing, 1 U/C)</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Anyway DTL is suppose to ease the large number of crowd from the
              North West Region. Its is about as big as Tampines and Bedok and
              Pasir Ris combined. </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">West
              Region</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">1 line (East West Line)</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Now, Jurong is so big that it needs at least 10 stations to serve
              the whole Jurong East.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I expect a Western Region Line to interchange with the future EWL
              Tuas South station and head to somewhere deeper in Tuas South.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I expect another unknown Line to be running from Woodlands, go

              <p>So Dragonaxe, I got a few questions:</p>
              <p><strong>CCL</strong></p>
              <p>Not sure what you mean? Alternate Marina Bay - Promenade and Marina Bay - Dhoby Ghaut since adding a crossover in Esplanade is quite unlikely (Between inner and outer circle)? I think it is sensible to have new platform on the left side (Turns existing CCL DBG bound to become JEMP-ed Jurong East EB) and another platform at somewhere else for DTL because it is illogical for CCL Marina Bay Extension trains to terminate and disrupt on DTL tracks / train. Same goes to Marina Bay Extension trains will not terminate on existing CCL tracks and obstruct trains from ESP / NCW. [Then JEMP is obsolete / fake if they allow such arrangements in PMN]. My suggestion is Marina Bay extension will start on Marina Bay, via PMN, heads to Stadium and ends like LTE Outram Park. (As Stadium - Mountbatten has a similar configuration as Outram Park with a middle slidings track.)</p>
              <p><strong>DTL</strong></p>
              <p>On a second look, most likely, DTL Stage 2 extension will have a station on the junction of Mandai Road (Previously mentioned on top of a station near GBD) and heads to Sungei Kadut instead of Kranji as Kranji requires a right curve via Turf Club.</p>
              <p><strong>Kallang Line</strong></p>
              <p>Adding a new crossover in Marina Bay bound is possible but ridiculous as it defeats the purpose of the provision middle track. Shuttle train / Another line option is possible but will it requires more train?</p>
              <p><strong>North Coast Line</strong></p>
              <p>Woodlands - Lim Chu Kang - Boon Lay is illogical as the demand is too low to even justify an LRT. Lim Chu Kang - Boon Lay might not so but it duplicates Jurong Region LRT, which from the concept plan 2001, is likely to be a backward C shape like without closing, instead of a SKG LRT style as hoped by me.</p>
              <p><strong>Others</strong></p>
              <p>I think any line from Woodlands to the West should be well served by DTL Stage 2 extension / Holland Line. The other lines cutting Lim Chu Kang is way too impratical as the users are likely only the Tengah Air base staffs / NSFs (Who might not be using daily, especially on Sundays), Farmers in the agricultural area on top of the Ghosts in cemetery who is gonna mostly to live for 15 years only (Due to land constraints, all the newly buried bodies from dunno when will have such limit, whether you or the deceased like it or not, 15 years later = go Mandai and burn the coffin. Obviously, the Islamics one are exception due to religious reasons.).</p>

              <p>People, this "Western Region Line (WRL)" is only a speculation. It may not be real in the future, or it may be a dream come true for the people living, working, and playing in the western side of Singapore.  <br> <br>To those suggesting the colour for the line: <strong><span style="color: #99cc00;">lime green</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color: #ffff00;">yellow</span></strong>, or <strong><span style="color: #00ffff;">cyan</span></strong>...might be possible in future. <br><br>Anyway, just wait for news of the future MRT network system unveiled by Sameul and myself, or other LTA Project Planners.</p>

              <p>What I expect, is that they are not going to build to many new LRT lines and too much orbital lines wont benefit the commuters from East to West / North to South.</p>

              <p>As I said, the concept plan is likely to change a lot due to NCW incident, and other budgeting issues [Complicated Current World Affairs involved as politics is involved, and politics is not just election], but instead of 2030 acheive 540km rail, they might and will pushed that to say 2050.

                  station on the junction of Mandai Road (Previously mentioned on top
                  of a station near GBD) and heads to Sungei Kadut instead of Kranji
                  as Kranji requires a right curve via Turf Club.</p>
              <p><strong>Kallang Line</strong></p>
              <p>Adding a new crossover in Marina Bay bound is possible but
                  ridiculous as it defeats the purpose of the provision middle track.
                  Shuttle train / Another line option is possible but will it
                  requires more train?</p>
              <p><strong>North Coast Line</strong></p>
              <p>Woodlands - Lim Chu Kang - Boon Lay is illogical as the demand
                  is too low to even justify an LRT. Lim Chu Kang - Boon Lay might
                  not so but it duplicates Jurong Region LRT, which from the concept
                  plan 2001, is likely to be a backward C shape like without closing,
                  instead of a SKG LRT style as hoped by me.</p>
              <p><strong>Others</strong></p>
              <p>I think any line from Woodlands to the West should be well
                  served by DTL Stage 2 extension / Holland Line. The other lines
                  cutting Lim Chu Kang is way too impratical as the users are likely
                  only the Tengah Air base staffs / NSFs (Who might not be using
                  daily, especially on Sundays), Farmers in the agricultural area on
                  top of the Ghosts in cemetery who is gonna mostly to live for 15
                  years only (Due to land constraints, all the newly buried bodies
                  from dunno when will have such limit, whether you or the deceased
                  like it or not, 15 years later = go Mandai and burn the coffin.
                  Obviously, the Islamics one are exception due to religious
                  reasons.).</p>

              <p>Like you said, so far there is 40 trains for CCL, so unless they buy the trains now or a year later, if not where they got trains to do a through service? (It tooks years for them to get new trains and a CGL requires 21 C751Bs.)</p>

              <p>I dont expect that area to be developed, but oddly, HDB do classify LCK as a housing estate as well, despite the blocks were cleared in nearly 10 years ago. (Today, if you go to HDB hub and take a look on the map of Singapore, you will see and support this statement.)</p>

              <p>1) Its impossible to be a non-stop circle. Unless you wanna split ESP-DBG part.</p>
              <p>2) When the tracks (From BSD) and the tracks (From AMK middle track) when it is about to converge, all tracks are almost deleted because the track converges into a single track entrance into BSD. In Depots, all codes are deleted for safety reasons. (What if TO accidentally press the ATO button for 3 seconds by accident and activate the ATO?)</p>
