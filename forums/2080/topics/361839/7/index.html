              <p>Full height platform doors is not possible and even if possible, it will be a big engineering challenge. Reason being the elevated MRT stations, built more than 10 years ago, were not designed to add in additional building structures that could add in other structures in future, eg PSD.</p>
              <p>The manufacturer of the PSD for retroffiting of existing stations is Kaba from Switzerland.  And the world's first retrofitting of MRT underground stations in adding the PSD is the Hong Kong's MTR TKE line.  Completed not long ago, it is the first known engineering feat to retrofit existing stations because it is extremely difficult to do, eg, if not careful, could damage the existing lightning arrester system on the platform - cannot even drill through the platform floor without first modify the system.</p>
              <p>Subsequently, the first half height PSD was installed in Taiwan, followed by Paris and now Singapore.</p>
              <p>These projects were awarded to Kaba directly.  The first few PSD were totally manufactured in Switzerland and assembled at the site.  Subsequent PSD were locally fabricated with close supervision by Kaba.</p>
              <p>Hence, it is interesting that the contract for the Singapore MRT was awarded to Singapore Technologies Electronics (a Singapore GLC).  STE will earned at least S$15m to S$30m pure profit as most engineering are undertaken by Kaba which also benefited from their previous experiences of retrofitting MRTs.</p>
              <p>The recent Straits Times reported pointed out that the Paris PSD half height contract is lesser than the Singapore PSD project, although it has lesser PSD.  What the reporter failed to mentioned is that in the Singapore PSD project, there is another "layer" of contractor which is STE and hence the costs is higher.</p>
              <p>Wondering why Kaba cannot be awarded the contract directy to save the S$15m to S$30m since they are manufacturer of the PSD and they could easily form the PSD project team for the Singapore PSD project.</p>
              <p>Is this another instance of the Singapore GLC way of securing projects and depriving private companies to be involved in these projects?  Another way of money left pocket out and right pocket in?</p>
