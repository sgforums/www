              <p>i think yes, even for dead, its the fastest way to get from one point to another. Best of all its free for them as we  cannot see them entering MRT.</p>

              <p>I dont think its the reason, GOVT is some times superstitious like how they design the Suntec area and the fountains ect and the 1 dollar coin  shape. Anyway its not good to open the NEA line with one station along the way where the dead resides. Shareholders and investors will feel uncomfortable.  dont know if ghosts exist but definitely its like the power of suggestion,  when u see a cemetery beside, yr mind starts to see "things". Like when u just watch a horror movie in yr room and u hear strange sounds, u think u are haunted by ghosts</p>
              <p>there were actually reports of "people" in the station. The dead still lingers there and until they leave when development occurs,</p>

              <p>1) I have been there for hours jogging both day and night. The empty plot of land used to be a cemetry. But it is now cleared and earmarked for future development.</p>
              <p>2) The station is constructed for future use. It is empty now, but there needs to be maintenance to keep it in working condition.</p>
              <p>3) The station is a secured location. Meaning you cant just enter as you wish. If anyone on the street can enter, then there is a big problem, because trains full of passengers are passing through it everyday.</p>

              <p><br>wait till u see the New York Subway's abandoned stations.Its 10 times more spookier than tis woodleigh station.My fren who went there told me tat they r super freaky and have been abandoned for dunno how many years..The authorities there nvr care abt the stations and jus leave them to rot till now.My fren said tat some of those abandoned stations were used during those war times and after tat,they care abt them alr.And nw all left unused.<br><br>But he said tat the trains still slowly passby the abandoned stations.He said tat he felt so spooked even as he was inside the train as it slowly rattled pass an abandoned station.So u can imagine hw spooky it is.haha..</p>
