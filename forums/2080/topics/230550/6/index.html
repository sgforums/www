Siemens C651 were manufactured 1994 ~ 1995. Well. 8 years to go.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Features of Refurbished C151s:</span></strong><br>1. Exterior makeover (Re-painting)<br>2. Windows changed (Same type though, manufactured by DUOLITE, only 005/006 does not have DUOLITE windows)<br>3. Fluroscent lighting in the connecting parts of 2 cars<br>4. Long fluroscent lightings changed to small bulbs<br>5. Additional grabpoles<br>6. Extension of seats, but seats decreased by 2.<br>7. Interior painting (All carriages are painted the same white colour)<br>8. Painting of seats (Lighter colours in the middle 3 seats, heavy colours in the side 2 seats)<br>9. Additional air-conditioners installed (similar to C751Bs)<br>10. Changing of glass panels for fire-extinguishers (In the old C151s, the glass panels had a handle but now, in the refurbished trains, there is no handles and the glass panels read "Break".)<br>11. Re-laying of floor surface with granite (supposedly)<br>12. Installation of luminous "Emergency Exit" sign at both ends of trains (in the old C151s, it was just a sticker pasted at the walls of the driver cabin doors)<br>13. Headlights changed from circular to squarish<br>14. "Door closing" sign installed at every door in the middle of it<br>15. Emergency Call button replaced (In the old C151s, it was stationed at the top, in the new refurbished trains, it was placed next to doors)<br>16. Huge space with lower Emergency Call buttons and handles at both ends of Car 2 for handicapped on wheelchairs<br>17. Fibreglass panels at the side of doors replaced with full length instead of half-length<br>18. Rubber panels installed at exterior ends of cars (similar to C751Bs)<br>19. Labelling of cars changed (exterior -- changed to smaller sizes; interior --- changed to a smaller size with bolded fonts)<br>20. Additional speakers with holes punched into the walls<br>21. Labelling of doors added<br>22. With reference to Point 21, all doors now had emergency call buttons (think so). Labelling of doors were placed at doors with emergency call buttons. I'm not too sure about refurbished trains, have to confirm.<br><br>Do you think it'll be the same for C651s?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
