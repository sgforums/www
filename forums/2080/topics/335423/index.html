              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">New performance standards set for trains</span></strong></p>
              <p>Commuters can now expect to wait no more than 2 to 3 minutes for trains
              during peak hours under new performance standards set by the Land
              Transport Authority.</p>
              <p>LTA has included a new indicator called train headway, or interval
              between trains, as part of revisions to the operating performance
              standards or OPS.</p>
              <p>With the revision, operators will have to ensure that the intervals
              between trains during lunchtime as well as the morning and evening
              peaks, do not exceed the new OPS.</p>
              <p>Transport Minister Raymond Lim shared these details after visiting the Boon Lay Extension MRT line.</p>
              <p>"The OPS standard is to give us a benchmark so that across all
              services they are not assessed across the benchmark so that everybody
              know this is it you can't go below that particular minimum that you
              have set."</p>
              <p>Another revision to the standards - the tightening of the train
              passenger load from 1700 passengers per train down to 1600 passengers.</p>
              <p>This indicator sets the maximum number of passengers each train can carry.</p>
              <p>CEO of SMRT Saw Phaik Hwa says says they have currently met both standards in their operations.</p>
              <p>"The OPS as stated is what we are doing today and we already provide
              this level of service. As you know during peak we are already doing the
              fastest possible in headway wise, so now we have already done the best
              and this is very much within the headway wise."</p>
              <p>The revised standards will take effect today. --938Live</p>

              <p>SMRT has done the stupidest thing ever they could - And I forsaw that. They shot themself in the leg by making the next train arrival timings only appear once 6 minutes reaches.

Isn't that the same thing as having the time limit set to 12 minutes? =.="</p>

              <p><strong><span>New performance standards set for
              trains</span></strong></p>
              <p>Commuters can now expect to wait no more than 2 to 3 minutes for
              trains during peak hours under new performance standards set by the
              Land Transport Authority.</p>
              <p>LTA has included a new indicator called train headway, or
              interval between trains, as part of revisions to the operating
              performance standards or OPS.</p>
              <p>With the revision, operators will have to ensure that the
              intervals between trains during lunchtime as well as the morning
              and evening peaks, do not exceed the new OPS.</p>
              <p>Transport Minister Raymond Lim shared these details after
              visiting the Boon Lay Extension MRT line.</p>
              <p>"The OPS standard is to give us a benchmark so that across all
              services they are not assessed across the benchmark so that
              everybody know this is it you can't go below that particular
              minimum that you have set."</p>
              <p>Another revision to the standards - the tightening of the train
              passenger load from 1700 passengers per train down to 1600
              passengers.</p>
              <p>This indicator sets the maximum number of passengers each train
              can carry.</p>
              <p><strong>CEO of SMRT Saw Phaik Hwa says says they have currently met both
              standards in their operations.</strong></p>
              <p>"The OPS as stated is what we are doing today and we already
              provide this level of service. As you know during peak we are
              already doing the fastest possible in headway wise, so now we have
              already done the best and this is very much within the headway
              wise."</p>
              <p>The revised standards will take effect today. --938Live</p>

              <p>Ton of bull. What I personally experienced, and had put in my blog, is very much the otherwise.</p>
              <p>Let's see what sort of bull her mouth will spew once she gets slapped by another big fine for not meeting what she claims are already-met standards.</p>

              <p>SMRT has done the stupidest thing ever they could - And I forsaw
              that. They shot themself in the leg by making the next train
              arrival timings only appear once 6 minutes reaches. And it's
              totally crazy. Why? Then wouldn't we all know the waiting time has
              exceeded 7 minutes if the plasma shows a blank screen? Isn't that
              the same thing as having the time limit set to 12 minutes? =.="</p>
              <p>Anyway, hope the frequency really improves.</p>

              <p>Well... the refurbished C151 trains are not that bad - it's the same layout as the C751B trains, and they removed two seats per row mainly to accomodate wider seats and more standing space around the doors - the latter being a place where many people like to stand around, so having more space there could at least mean that people who like standing beside the doors have less of a chance to block the doorways.</p>
              <p>Though, that said, having more space around the doors could also unintentionally encourage people to crowd around the area more, a problem the new layout on the refurbished C151 trains is trying to solve; this could be rather counter-intuitive. In that case, 8 or 9 wider seats per row and absolutely no standing room around the door could have helped encourage passengers to move inward. Another possibly could be to split up the row of seats into two, with space in between deeper into the interior of the train car - that may also help encourage people to move in.</p>
              <p>That said, at least it's 7 seats per row right now - the C651 trains that participated in the experimental layout program (the blue cars) were slightly even worse - 6 seats per row.</p>
              <p>p.s. Talking about seats, I faintly remember that, sometime in the early 1990's, there was an experiment to install plush (i.e. cushioned, upholstered) seats on MRT trains? I glimpsed it on a news bulletin back then, but never encountered any of these seats on any trains I took. Could someone confrim what my memory is recalling?</p>
