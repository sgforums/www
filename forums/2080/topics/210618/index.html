            <div class='col-md body'>lucky when i go home frm work, i take the train frm boon lay all the way to tampines. so i get a seat each time.<br><br>each day, the train gets packed with office ppl at tanjong pagar up to city hall. once i see a father and mother team with two babies and two prams trying to board the eastbound train at 6.20pm. they succeeded though, coz' they were smart to wait at the last door.<br><br>i guess it is the rule of thumb to "ENSURE" trains are packed to the brim... seriously. at aljunied, kallang on weekend aftnns westbound, it gets so packed and when u see the timing of the nxt train, it's 8-10mins. i guess that 8-10mins is used to ensure ppl come and board their packed trains and hence maximise profits yay!<br><br>hence, this only pushes more individuals to drive! err.. are we talking abt world-class public transport?</div>
