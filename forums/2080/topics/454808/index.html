              <p>I took a sip of water (yes just one sip only and it's purely water), and i got warned by one of the mrt officers. I told him that i'm not drinking soft drinks, i'm drinking water, and he replied me that water is also considered drink so it's not allowed in the mrt station. He also emphasized that he will fine me next time if he caught me drinking water again.</p>
              <p>I took 3 trains today and i felt very thirsty. I also have some health problems and i get dehydrated easily. All i took is ONE sip of WATER and i got a warning from that mrt officer.</p>
              <p>Wtf? Is he being unreasonable, or do Singaporeans get fined for drinking water?</p>
              <p>Why is Singapore becoming so strict? I think i am beginning to hate my own country</p>

              <p>I won't be surprised that 100 years from today, Singapore will start jailing people for drinking water in mrt station. Now it's just a fine of $500.</p>
              <p>But 100 years from today, people would end up getting jailed for taking a sip of water in mrt stations.   </p>
              <p>I am very sure about this, considering how strict Singapore is. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              its to simplfy matters.
              
              its strictly no eating/no drinking.  offenders cant argue and cause a ruckus.  you know how people are.  if the rules is not clear cut surely a lot of problems will arise.
              
              moreover, the TS could have taken his sip before boarding.  its not like the journey is 6 hours and he got thirsty after 3 hours.

              <p>TS very stupid to drink water in plain sight of MRT staff. There is something called tactical, and timing.</p>

              <p>I don't see the logic of banning people from drinking water at the MRT station.</p>
              <p>Its bull. This contravene human rights. This is a stupid rule. What is the logic of this rule? to stop people from spilling water accidentaly? Would that dirt the floor? rubbish.</p>

              <p><br>No food or drink is to be consumed on board the train or on the station platform. However, I think the rules are slightly relaxed if you are outside the paid area of the concourse. Still, no smoking is allowed anywhere within the station premises.</p>
