              <p>To reply you point for point:</p>
              <p>DTL2 has what you termed as Slidings, but it is more of a middle track.  As for where it is, find out when DTL2 is in operation.</p>
              <p>Based on the 1996 white paper, there would not be a circle line as we know it today.  You get my meaning?  Plans change, and they change to suit the particular conditions as we know of at that point in time. </p>
              <p>Whether ERL will link to CCL at Paya Lebar at the current time, is no.  But your statement that "maybe not implemented at all due to soft soil only, and thats all" is factually incorrect.</p>
              <p>We can build MCE across reclaimed land, tunnel through Nicoll Highway vicinity and do bored piling works right in the middle of the sea channel / river / canal.  We can also cut a road through granite rocks.  Who says we cannot build an extension if we want to?  It can be due to the time and cost factor that is prohibiting the construction, plus there is no value added if it is constructed now.  Maybe 10 to 20 years down the road, there will be a modification project to connect CCL to ERL?  We won't know for sure.  Even if there are plans, you and I won't know of it until it is annonuced by the Transport Minister.</p>
              <p>Thus, all I can say is, don't keep harping on this, as you may not even be around when and if they really decide to that.</p>

              <p>I believe that the plans had changed, but keeping a middle track is for extension for future use. I never say the current use of middle track in PYL is for an extension line, but as a provision for such extension if there is such a need. For now, I never said that it is incorrect for SWT / overnight parking use (Which is quite obvious usage for the middle track for now).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Notice that the left to DBG platform has a wide land space? It can be used to office development and i believe, if they feel that there is a need to "JEMP" it due to such extension had finally materialized (<strong>IF</strong>), it is technically feasible.</p>

              <p>Well, I never say that the CCL middle track must be ERL. It might be CCL extension to ERL, or a ERL extension to CCL. It might be wrong, if ERL were to follow TSL in suit (Rumours were said that TSL will have 4 train cars as opposed to 3 in CCL / DTL and will feature 5 doors in each car side, instead of the present 4). Or it might be simply a depot route for ERL trains due to lack of possible depot sites along in ERL except somewhere near Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal?</p>

              <p>AFAIK, the "cylinders" are dug with a TBM, while the "box" were cut-and-cover, meaning the box was dug out of the ground, then the top refilled.</p>

              <p>Nobody knows for sure. But we can use what we have to estimate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Deepest NEL station: Dhoby Ghaut -- 28m</p>
              <p>Known shallowest station: Newton / Novena (Not sure which) --- ~12m</p>
              <p>Deepest Level in NEL:</p>
              <p>NE1: B2 --&gt; ~13m? (Considered the proximity to Outram Park + KTM tracks near Keppel areas, where "NE2" is most likely to be located.) My take: ~<strong>20</strong>m.</p>
              <p>NE3: B4 (Second deepest NEL station) --&gt; ~<strong>24</strong>m?</p>
              <p>NE4: B2 --&gt; ~13m? -- Given the proximity, it cant be that huge difference. My take: ~<strong>22</strong>m</p>
              <p>NE5: B2 --&gt; ~13m? -- Given the proximity, it cant be that huge difference. My take: ~<strong>22</strong>m</p>
              <p>NE6: B5 (28m deep, translates average 1 level = 5.5 ~ 6m?) = <strong>28</strong>m</p>
              <p>NE7: B2 --&gt; ~14m? -- Given the proximity, it cant be that huge difference. My take: ~<strong>22</strong>m</p>
              <p>NE8: B2 --&gt; ~14m? -- Given the proximity, it cant be that huge difference. My take: ~<strong>20</strong>m</p>
              <p>NE9: B2 --&gt; ~14m? -- Given the proximity, it cant be that huge difference. My take: ~<strong>17</strong>m</p>
              <p>NE10 to NE14: B2 --&gt; ~<strong>14</strong>m?</p>
              <p>NE15: B2 --&gt; ~<strong>14</strong>m? --- Given the area is quite hilly terrain, coupled with nearby depot it cant be too deep. My take: ~<strong>13</strong>m</p>
              <p>NE16: B1 (Sengkang Interchange) --&gt; ~ <strong>7</strong>m?</p>
              <p>NE17: B2 (B1 is restricted access) --&gt; ~<strong>14</strong>m?</p>
              <p>Average = ~17.4375m deep. (Calculate all by bold values)</p>
