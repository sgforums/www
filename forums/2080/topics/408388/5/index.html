              <p>lol, no rubber tires. Using the emergency brakes (to change modes, for example) can grind the wheels down into an uneven shape, hence the name "flat wheels".</p>

              <p>CX100 is a CX100, what you meant arent the same? Interiors? Exteriors livery? SMRT can always repaint / refit it. The only reason I can guess from no takeover of CAAS's "young" trains is because the depot is really CMI, designed to house only 19 trains and now it has 19 trains in service since the day of operation in 1999.</p>

              <p>Since the Ten Mile Junction was bought by a developer company (Sold by URA), I even expect the BPJ LRT to close down as lack of depot (No official news to confirm this to date, but the shops such as Sheng Siong has to close by November 2010, which was reported in news / newspaper.), and hence even if the LRT really did not close / undergo major modification (Relocation -- my speculation: Combine Ten Mile Junction and Bukit Panjang LRT station by shifting existing BPJ LRT so that to interchange it like any other LRT - MRT interchange station) project, they wont even refurbish it / buy new trains for it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reason: Think again, the Changi Skytrain was used in the 1990s where the second terminal opens, hence with the lifespan of less than 15 years, they were all scrapped. Why didnt SMRT takeover the Changi Skytrain and boost the frequency there? Something must be very fishy as if this theory applies, we would not see C151 and C651 by now anymore.</p>

              <p>Hmm, no. BPLRT cannot be stabled in GBD (DTL 2 depot) not because of "lack of foresight" (Provision for a LRT depot) but currently there is no way to direct the LRT without modifying the tracks in Bukit Panjang - TMJ sector OR inside the depot, which is unlikely to either.</p>

              <p>Yes, how long was the tender?

              <p>11 years of operation, while it might be a bit young, but definitely with such a lot of issues, they ought to think of buying new trains (Innova) to replace CX100 or refurbish it, just like what happened to a 16 years old C651, but none happened on BPJ LRT.

              <p>Mitsubishi Crystal Mover? CMI. Why? Coz Mitsubishi Crystal Mover uses thrid / fourth rail on the sides (Usually both sides that becomes the "Fourth rail") while CX-100 and its predecessor / successor is using a 3rd rail right below (Centre). Like that means change the entire railing. Step 1: Install the side walls, Step 2: Install 3rd rail wires on the sides, Step 3: uninstall the 3rd rail from bottom (I know the Mitsubishi Crystal Mover below got a big box so dont try and lie straight on the tracks like an Israeil woman failed suicide attempt, which is DIFFERENT from one in Yishun leaked suicide video.) because no matter how one lies, still will flatten by train one, be it along or across the tracks and hence doubt the below thrid rail can be preserved. Step 4: Launch the Mitsubishi Crystal Mover and remove CX-100 at once. I doubt they can be compatible together without factoring their computering system, unlike C151 and C651 issues.</p>

              <p>On the other hand, I do NOT have any solid / insider information confirming that they will scrapped afterall, but really doubt the fate of BPJ LRT as the CX-100 was performing CMI, long time the car 110 no announcement one, one even dunno if the doors are closing and the station's announcement might be too late etc which I personally, dont think it is feasible to refurbish the train like C151 (C651 also kena complained as many problems but they will have the refurbishment, so maybe thats the only hope, which one may have to wait for 6 years later to make CX-100 17 years old.).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personally, heres come the issue: 17, arriving 6 years later [The minimal sensible age to refurbish a train is 15 years old as said by SMRT the earliest year they would consider refurbishment of C651 is in 2010 and in the sense of nearest 5 years]. What if the tender was really 15 years because they feel that the entire LRT system worth only a few hundred millions (Punggol LRT costs about $400 million), which might not be enough for one of the particular MRT contract while MRT costs billions (EWL / NSL was costing near $6 ~ $10b especially if lateral extensions were factored in, NEL $4.6b while CCL $6.7b and DTL / TSL / ERL together are going to hit a $20b). (Read: one of the particular MRT contract does not necessary refer to entrie stage of the line but it might be even only one complex station maybe with including with its assoiciating tunnels)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If it is true that the LRT tender is 15 years, and refurbishment take 1 year (For all 19 trains, presumely they can refurbish 3 ~ 5 trains per month.), you have to factor the design (Interior) of BPJ LRT, whos is gonna to refurb it (Read: Kawasaki and its Japanese gang built the C151s, but it was Hyundai Rotem and dunno what company which has no relation to this Japanese gang refurb it. So maybe as an example while Bombardier built the CX100, but Alstom gets to refurb it etc....???), the entire process may go up to 2 years (1 year decide, 1 year refurb itself in depot) and even if they tomorrow announce the refurbishment of CX100, by then it has finished its refurbishment, they are on service for less than 3 ~ 4 years. Ask again, do you think will SMRT foot this bill? (Especially the poor track record on SLRT, whether LTA wants to re-tender to SMRT or give it to SBS Transit is another issue. Scarly, LTA also admits SLRT staffs inexperienced is one reason, the failed track alignments [Read: Unnecessary turnings going up and downs in Senja - BPJ etc and the one in Teck Whye - Phoenix is like.....] is worsening the condition and decide to scrap and rebuild one [Or not at all since I dont find BPJ a heavily built up town which neither LTA will really scrap and <strong>rebuild</strong> it as they wont build any new LRTs unless the town is heavily built up]?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Summary: To scrap or not to scrap, to refurb or not, to build new trains or not, all got their own concerns. The best and safest bet is that 4 years later, we shall see if there is a re-tendering or not. If no, then it might be a 20 years (25? 30? Should not be more than 30 years) tender and after that, SMRT / LTA will see the next step of chess to be moved.</p>
