              <p><strong>New DTL Bugis Station</strong></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">DTL Stage 1</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">1. The Downtown Line Stage 1 (DTL1) will run from Bugis
              Station on the East-West Line (EWL) to Chinatown Station on the North East Line
              (NEL). The six stations on DTL1 are Bugis, Promenade, Bayfront, Landmark, Cross
              Street and Chinatown. DTL 1 is scheduled to open in 2013.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">2. Commuters will have more transport choices in the city as
              the DTL 1 will serve existing and upcoming developments in the Marina Bay area,
              including One Raffles Quay, The Sail @ Marina Bay, Marina Bay Sands Integrated
              Resorts and the Marina Bay Financial Centre.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">New Bugis Station</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">3. The new Bugis Station is one of the six stations that make
              up the 4.3 km DTL 1. The new Bugis station for DTL 1 will be sited under Rochor
              Road and partly within the adjacent land to the west. Due to engineering
              constraints which cannot be avoided , the land currently occupied by the New
              Seventh Storey Hotel (NSSH) and part of the adjacent State land fronting Rochor
              Road, is required for the construction of the station box and the at-grade
              station structures, such as the station's entrance and lift facility. The NSSH
              will have to be demolished to allow for the construction of the station. (Please
              see <a href="http://www.lta.gov.sg/images/Annex1%20Map%20of%20DTL%20Bugis%20Station.pdf">Annex
              1</a> for the map of the new DTL Bugis Station and <a href="http://www.lta.gov.sg/images/Annex2%20Artist%20impression%20-%20DTL1%20Bugis%20Stn.pdf">Annex

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Land Acquisition</strong></span><br> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> 4. To make way for the construction of the new Bugis station and to enable
              comprehensive redevelopment of the area, the Government will acquire the<br> NSSH under the Land Acquisition Act (LAA).<br> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> 5. The NSSH site will be amalgamated with the adjacent State land parcel at
              North Bridge Road / Tan Quee Lan Street / Beach Road / Rochor Road for future
              comprehensive redevelopment. The amalgamation of the NSSH site with the adjacent
              land parcel will allow for better integration of the Station and the at-grade
              structures with the future development in the area, and enable the planned
              pedestrian network and urban design plans for the area to be realised.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">6. The land to be acquired is gazetted today by the Singapore
              Land Authority (SLA). Compensation pegged at market value will be awarded
              according to the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act. The owner and occupants
              of the NSSH will have to move out of the existing hotel site by the end of
              December 2008.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">Tender of Contract</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">7. The contract for the construction of the new DTL Bugis
              station and tunnels from Beach Road to Queen Street will be tendered in early
              July 2008 for award in November 2008.</span></p>

              The DTL1 alignment is along Rochor Road and
              passes under the existing Bugis Station. Due to constraints in the tunnel
              alignment at Rochor Flyover and the tunnels passing under the existing Bugis
              Station, the new Bugis Station for DTL1 must be located south of the existing
              Bugis Station and towards the west side of Rochor Road, which puts it partially
              under the New Seventh Storey Hootel building.</sup></span></span></em></p>

              <p>I heard it's the only manual lift left in Singapore, similar to those in Hong Kong where the platform door and lift gates have to be manually closed. If I'm not wrong, it's called a drum elevator.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Stage 2 of Downtown Line rail network expected to be ready by 2015</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Residents living in the north—western part of Singapore can
              look forward to faster and more direct access to the city centre, when
              construction of Stage 2 of the Downtown Line rail network completes in
              2015.</p>
              <p>The 16.6 km—long line comprises one depot and 12 stations stretching from Rochor, along Bukit Timah Road and Bukit Panjang.</p>
              <p>It will have three interchange stations located at Botanic Gardens, Newton and Little India.</p>
              <p>When ready, this stage of the line is expected to cut commuter travel time by some 30 per cent.</p>
              <p>For example, the current hour—long journey from Bukit Panjang to the city will take just 40 minutes.</p>
              <p>The construction of Stage 2 of the Downtown Line rail network is set to begin in mid—2009.</p>
              <p>The Downtown Line is part of Singapore’s extensive rail network extension plan, which aims to link up most parts of the island. — CNA/yb</p>

              <p><strong>Downtown Line 2 Station Sites Named<br>Bukit Timah residents get faster access to City and Marina Bay area</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">1.     Having completed the advanced
              engineering studies, LTA is pleased to announce the rail alignment and station
              locations for Downtown Line 2 (DTL2). This stage of the Downtown Line is a major
              step towards bringing long-awaited rail access to the north-western area of
              Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">2.     The 16.6km long DTL2 comprises one
              depot and 12 stations, including three interchange stations at Little India,
              Newton and the Botanic Gardens. These 3 interchange stations will link to the
              North East Line (NEL), North South Line (NSL) and Circle Line (CCL)
              respectively, giving commuters greater accessibility to the rest of the island
              and significantly improving travel time.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">3.     Mr Yam Ah Mee, Chief Executive, LTA
              said, "The Downtown Line 2 will offer commuters significant time savings.
              For example, the current one-hour journey from Bukit Panjang to the city centre
              will be reduced by a third - to approximately 40 minutes. DTL2 will also improve
              accessibility to other parts of Singapore as commuters can conveniently transfer
              to other MRT lines at the three DTL2 interchange stations"<br> <br> <strong>Benefits of DTL 2</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">4.     Mr Yam added: "DTL2 will link
              the north-western part of the island through DTL1 directly to commercial,
              residential and entertainment developments in the Marina Bay area. These include
              the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort, Marina Bay Financial Centre, Sail @
              Marina Bay, Gardens by the Bay as well as the Central Business District. DTL2
              will support the growth of these new developments, and more importantly, make
              public transport a more viable commuting choice."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">5.     DTL2 will bring greater convenience
              to residents living in Bukit Panjang and Bukit Timah as they can look forward to
              taking the train directly to city areas such as Orchard Road and Clarke Quay
              that are currently not linked to the Bukit Timah corridor by the rail system.
              DTL2 will also improve accessibility to other areas with these three interchange
              stations:</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">a)     Botanic Gardens interchange station
              will link DTL2 to CCL where commuters can access Holland Village, Kent Ridge,
              West Coast, Pasir Panjang, Telok Blangah and Thomson.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">b)     Newton Station interchange station
              will link DTL2 to NSL for commuters from Bukit Panjang and Bukit Timah to areas
              such as City Hall, Marina Bay on its southbound route and to Toa Payoh, Bishan,
              Ang Mo Kio, Yio Chu Kang and Yishun towards the northern track.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">c)     Little India interchange station
              connects DTL2 to NEL for direct access from Bukit Panjang and Bukit Timah to
              Hougang, Sengkang and Punggol on its northbound route and to Chinatown and
              Clarke Quay in the eastbound direction.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">6.     With the alignment and station
              locations finalised, working names based on station location have been assigned
              to the DTL2 stations for ease of reference. However, we will be seeking feedback
              and ideas from the public on the naming of the stations (excluding Little India,
              Newton and Botanic Gardens Stations as they are already official station names).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">7.     Stations names should:</span></p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Identify the location readily so that all commuters
                  can easily remember the names and identify the area of the station</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Illustrate the history and heritage of the station
                  surroundings if relevant</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;">Reflect the multi-racial, multi-cultural character of
                  Singapore if possible.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">8.     The public will be able to send
              their suggestions to LTA from <strong>end July 2008</strong>. More details will be
              provided nearer to the date.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">9.     The 12 DTL2 stations are:</span></p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;">Rochor Station*</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;">Little India Station (Interchange for DTL2 and NEL)</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;">Newton Station (Interchange for DTL2 and NSL)</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;">Stevens Station*</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;">Botanic Gardens (Interchange for DTL2 and CCL)</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;">Duchess Station*</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;">Sixth Avenue Station*</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;">Blackmore Station*</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;">Beauty World Station*</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;">Hillview Station*</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;">Cashew Station*</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;">Petir Station*</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">* These are working names only.<br> <br> <strong>Downtown Line</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">10. Land acquisitions for DTL2 will be minimal and limited to
              a 2-storey building at Halifax Road and two strips of land at Upper Bt Timah
              Road. The land to be acquired is gazetted today by the Singapore Land Authority
              (SLA).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">11. The Government announced its decision to build the DTL in
              three stages on 27 April 2007. Since then, LTA has called the tender for the
              civil construction of DTL 1 and five construction contracts have been awarded.
              These contracts cover the stations and tunnels between Chinatown and east of
              Promenade Station.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">12. Current work on all five awarded contracts is progressing
              well.<br> <br> Annexes: <a href="http://www.lta.gov.sg/images/20080715-DTL2.pdf">Alignment of

              <p>Just looked at the location maps of the stations. I was expecting
                      Rochor Station to be slightly more to the east, in front of Sim Lim
                      Square. And I'm wondering how they would build another pair of platform
                      perpendicular to it, since the route for DTL phase 3 is going to
                      intersect the route for phase 2.</p>
              <p>Beauty World Station should be shifted slightly further down, since it would be nearer to NP and serving the shopping centres at the same time. Perhaps can link NP via an underpass.</p>
              <p>I was expecting a Balmoral
                      station between Newton and Stevens. I think that place deserves a
                      station, but perhaps it might be too near to either Newton or Stevens.</p>

              <p>Agree. And I think Beauty World would be renamed to Bukit Timah.</p>
              <p>I feel that Hwa Chong would be a more appropriate name for Duchess station (not that I'm from Hwa Chong). Likewise for Stevens, Whitley would be a better name in my opinion.</p>
              <p>Last but not least, the DTL phase 2 should extend to Kranji, and possibly to JB in the future.</p>

              <p>I find two of the DTL2 station locations inappropriate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Hillview Station should be relocated southwards to Railway Mall (near the crossing the of Malaysian railway line across Upper Bukit Timah Road). This will look after the Hillview area population; from Hume Park to Glendale Park.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Blackmore Station is redundant and should be relocated nearer to the King Albert Park Area to cater to the Ngee Ann Polytechnic students, and at the same time taking in commuters from Binjai across to Rifle Range Road area.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Distance between stations should not be an important consideration. For example, if Blackmore is moved to King Albert area, distance between Beauty World and King Albert would be quite near. But they serve 2 distinct and equally populated localities. Distances between the stations nearer to the CBD are short but are understandable because of the need for connectivity with other Lines.</p>
