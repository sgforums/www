              <p>LTA says that as long a MRT is within 500m of a bus stop, it is considered to be near the station. Relocating bus stops will however cause problems such as readjusting distance fares and sometimes too close to preceding bus stop or previous bus stop. All I can say is that they should have one more entrance to the station that is closer to the bus stop at Holland Rd.</p>

              <p>Each station should have at least a pair of bus stop that stop at the station door step. 500m is just too far.</p>
              <p>Comparing to E-W line, all stations have at least a pair of bus stops or bus interchange situated at their door steps.</p>
              <p>HV platform was positioned along the junction, it seems one has to spend 5 min to exit from platform to entrance MayBank. And one probably has to walk another 8 minutes to Bus Stop along Holland Road (out side Holland Village). 13 min? One probably can take the train from Holland to HarbourFront.</p>

              look at e jam at Upp S'goon but isnt the minister or whoever just persuade the residents there to accept for a premium fares rate (more expensive) as a price to built NEL and the people just want the NEL and willing to pay slightly higher fares?</p>

              <p>I know certain plans such as Tuas LRT and extension towards LCK / Ubin / Tekong (Not shown on 2001 but 1996) are simply plain stupid even on 2050 [The only point I see useful is like on top of Weekday peak hour, is to connect the EWL Tuas Extension and a speculated line on the Southern tip becoming the "West Coast Line" or sort of, if they have the foresight to see] and expect these to be cancelled, but as long as CBDs are concerned, the plan sticks. It is not entire nation within 800m a railway (MRT) station (400m radius) but only within CBD and it is evident that the eastern part of CBD (Promenade, Bugis area) are like reaching there and the Western / Northern CBD such as Kim Seng / Outram / Tanjong Pagar - Orchard / Tanglin respectively are going to be covered by TSL (Not so for Tanglin, maybe the next generation line after ERL?) which hence left the southern CBD area that is obviously, Marina / Downtown area will have so much lines there.</p>

              <p>I have nothing against the bus and agreed that MRT stations is getting too much and become kind of a bus-stop (Every 3 ~ 5 bus stop per MRT station!?) and will confuse the commuters but it is definitely better than using the $$ to the minister's astonishing salary (Higher than US president's salary in terms of USD).</p>

              <p>According to history, NEL was planned along with the compass line but to built at a later date. You are right about ppl challenged MBT to take a look at e jam at Upp S'goon but isnt the minister or whoever just persuade the residents there to accept for a premium fares rate (more expensive) as a price to built NEL and the people just want the NEL and willing to pay slightly higher fares?</p>

              <p>Dun forget construction cost will only go up because NEL went fully underground. NSL &amp; EWL could be cheaper because it's mostly elevated and hence faster to complete.</p>
              <p>The only thing I can think of it to extend EWL to Tuas CIQ where ppl could link up to 182 to get to Tuas Sth. It's going to be a problem to SBS to be providing long haul rts from Tuas Sth to Boon Lay in e long run as e area develops.</p>
              <p>How much MRT can u be building in e congested CBD? You need underground spaces for other uses, not to forget e piling for e skyscrappers today.</p>
