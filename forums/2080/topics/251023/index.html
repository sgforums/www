In detail it's important because it goes into areas which are not served by the MRT, it takes us from the north side down to the eastern side. So you have northwest into the east.<br><br>"The northwestern corridor now will be served by RTS, rapid transit system, so you have Bukit Panjang all the way down to the Bukit Timah corridorÂ… and the Bukit Timah corridor is a heavily congested corridor which we needÂ…and also pushing into the east will serve areas which are not served by the RTS."<br><br>LTA expects the number of commuters on the DTL to hit half a million daily.<br><br>The decision as to which company will get to run the DTL will be made at a later date.<br><br>Circle Line will also be extended from the Promenade Station to Bayfront to enhance accessibility of the Marina Bay Area, and this will likely be completed in 2012.<br><br>"I think it is good, that people are coming forward with proposals and suggestionsÂ… not just SBST, but others have come forward," says Mr Lim.<br><br>"It is good that people come up with proposals, that people debate the issues, engage in this public transport issue.<br><br>"And on our part, we'll consider all these various proposals in our ongoing land transport review. But our aim is to ensure we have a more efficient integrated public transport system that will serve commuters well." - CNA/yy</div>

I think the benefits that comes along after outweighs the inconvenience in the meantime. I just hope it's faster," said one resident.<br><br>The Downtown Line comprises three stages.<br><br>The first is a loop to link places like the Integrated Resort at Marina to the other MRT lines, like the East-West track.<br><br>The second part will head westwards along Bukit Timah Road, stopping at places like Botanic Gardens and ending at Bukit Panjang LRT.<br><br>The last section will connect east to the Expo Station, passing through estates like Macpherson and Tampines.<br><br>Part of the new Downtown Line is expected to be constructed along Bukit Timah Road.<br><br>Currently, there are no MRT stations there.<br><br>Residents said the nearest MRT station is the Newton station.<br><br>So with the upcoming Downtown Line, residents say not only will it be more convenient, but they are also looking forward to a boost in their property prices.<br><br>"The property price sure will go up unless it's too near to it and it's noisy. If not the case, it'll be convenient. So it should add value."<br><br>"Of course it'll enhance their property values, And besides that there're quite a few good schools along this track."<br><br>So residents in Bukit Timah can soon tap their way into the train carriages when part of the MRT line for the area is ready in 2015. - CNA/ch</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The DTL seems to be making the BPLRT somewhat redundant, since BPJ residents no longer need to go to CCK to catch the MRT.<br><br>Anyway, if SMRT had the subway monopoly, SBS took back BPJ and gave up HGN, Svc 5 may still be around.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Government Approves Building Of The Downtown Line</strong><br><br>1. The Government has given approval for LTA to build the Downtown Line (DTL) at a cost of S$12 billion. The 40km line will be mostly underground and will be built in 3 stages. The DTL is targeted to be completed by 2018.<br><br>2. With the DTL, the connectivity of the existing Rapid Transit System (RTS) network will be strengthened. The DTL will facilitate direct travel from the northwestern and eastern areas of the island to the Central Business District (CBD) and the Marina Bay. It also provides a strategic transport link to support the development of the Marina Bay area.<br><br>3. The Government's target is to raise the public transport share of all morning peak-hour trips from the current 63% to at least 70% by 2020. To achieve this target, the RTS network as the backbone for our public transport system will have to be expanded, with more rail lines extended to new areas, thereby enhancing accessibility and reducing travel times.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">DTL Stage 1</span></strong><br><br>4. DTL Stage 1 comprises the Downtown Extension (DTE) which was previously planned as an extension to the Circle Line (CCL). This 4.3 km section will run from Bugis Station on the East-West Line (EWL) to Chinatown Station on the Northeast Line (NEL). It will have 6 stations in all: Bugis, Promenade, Bayfront, Landmark, Cross Street and Chinatown.<br><br>5. Targeted to be completed in 2013, it will be operated independently from the CCL, serving upcoming developments in the Marina Bay area, such as the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort and the new Marina Bay Financial Centre.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">DTL Stage 2</span></strong><br><br>6. DTL Stage 2 comprises the previously announced Bukit Timah Line (BTL). It will run from Bugis Station on the EWL, along the Bukit Timah Road corridor to link up with the Bukit Panjang LRT. This 16.6 km long stretch of the DTL is targeted to be completed in 2015.<br><br>7. With DTL Stage 2, commuters can enjoy a more direct link to the city centre. For example, a trip from Bukit Panjang to the city centre that now takes 60 minutes will be shortened by one-third. Residents who currently take the train from Bukit Batok and Choa Chu Kang into the city, can also shave up to 15 minutes from their hour-long journey.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">DTL Stage 3</span></strong><br><br>8. DTL Stage 3 comprises the northern half of the previously announced Eastern Region Line (ERL). This 19.1 km phase will run from Chinatown Station on the NEL to Expo Station on the EWL.<br><br>9. This final phase of the DTL is targeted to be completed in 2018. With DTL Stage 3, commuters who currently take about 40 to 50 minutes travelling into the city by train from Bedok Reservoir and Tampines will save up to 10 minutes.<br><br>10. The LTA is currently undertaking studies to determine the exact alignment and station locations of DTL Stages 2 and 3.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Extending the Circle Line to Marina Bay</span></strong><br><br>11. To enhance the accessibility of the Marina Bay area to the rest of the island, the CCL will be extended to Bayfront Station from Promenade Station. This will be completed in 2012.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Interchange Stations</span></strong><br><br>12. DTL will have an interchange station with the Bukit Panjang LRT system as well as 10 other interchange stations with the existing rail network and the CCL which is under construction:<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">North South Line</span></strong><br><br>Newton<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">East West Line</span></strong><br><br>Bugis<br>Tampines<br>Expo<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">North East Line</span></strong><br><br>Little India<br>Chinatown<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Circle Line</span></strong><br><br>Bayfront<br>Promenade<br>MacPherson<br>Botanic Gardens<br><br>13. In the coming months, contracts will be awarded for the various stages of the DTL project. The first two civil contracts, for the Cross Street and Chinatown stations will be awarded in the second half of 2007.<br><br></div>

Newton is super ulu not being a residential area... is it going to be developed soon?<br><br>does making Tampines an interchange defeat Tanah Merah being an interchange for the Airport service?<br><br>and Expo being an interchange somehow sounds very odd to me...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>4. is it inflation rates? how come a 33.7km, 29-station CCL costs 6.7bil bucks, and a new DTE of almost the same size of 40km, 33 stations, costs almost double the price...<br><br>5. mostly underground? i heard some saying that the boon lay extension is the last of the elevated stations... hmmmmm....</div>
