            <div class='col-md body'>I suspect that 43 may have better ridership as commuters from Buangkok MRT can take 43 from there to Sengkang Ctrl and Buankok area instead of taking 43 from Sengkang or Serangoon. For 27, i dont think it will affect much just that there may be less pax from HGCTRL <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  Buangkok while the pax will board back @ Buangkok to continue with their journey to Sengkang or Tampines/Airport and pax will alight @ Buangkok for MRT if they dont want to walk a long distance to MRT @ Sengkang.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Preparations underway at Buangkok MRT station for official opening</strong><br><br>SINGAPORE : There are just a few more days before Buangkok MRT station opens on January 15.<br><br>To gear up for the station's grand opening, some of the works being done include ensuring the turnstiles are in order, that the air conditioners are working efficiently, and the floor and walls are spotlessly clean.<br><br>Augustine Wong, Deputy Director of Passenger Service (Rail) at SBS TRansit, said: "What we are looking at now is that the system has to be in operation, to serve the same as what other stations have been doing. So from the operation aspect, passengers should be able to come in, should be able to use the station in a friendly way."<br><br>So it is all systems go at the station - with the ticketing machines already programmed to dispense tickets.<br><br>The name of Buangkok MRT station is already incorporated in all ticketing machines across the island since the opening of the NorthEast line in 2003, except that it has been covered by a white sticker.<br><br>On Sunday, this is all set to change as the MRT station will prominently feature as part of the North-East line.<br><br>The announcement to open Buangkok MRT station was made earlier this year, reversing an earlier decision for the station to remain closed as there were not enough residents within 400 metre radius of the station needed to justify its opening.<br><br>Currently there are already 100 blocks within that distance with at least 2,000 to 3,000 units occupied.<br><br>And by the end of the year, there will be another 625 units in the area when a condominium project near the station is launched.<br><br>SBS Transit expects between 2,500 and 3,500 commuters daily when the station opens.<br><br>But the company stressed that it is committed to keep the station open, even if it does not see the ridership that's expected.<br><br>Operating the station will add $1 million a year to SBS Transit's expenditure.<br><br>A grand opening will be held on Sunday when Defence Minister and MP for Pasir-Ris Punggol GRC, Teo Chee Hean, officiates at the opening of the station.<br><br>Residents can board their first train at Buangkok MRT station at 1pm that day. - CNA<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/187318/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/187318/1/.html</a></div>
