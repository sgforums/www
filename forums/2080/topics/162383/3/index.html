            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Buangkok MRT station finally opens amid fanfare </strong><br><br>SINGAPORE : At least 10,000 residents of Punggol South on Sunday celebrated the opening of Buangkok MRT station amidst much fanfare.<br><br>On the first day alone, 1,700 people took the trains there.<br><br>Residents of the area had to wait about two and a half years after the launch of the North East Line for the station to start operations.<br><br>Minutes before the first train pulled in, the first passenger, 52-year-old Ang Lan Sai walked through the turnstiles.<br><br>He had waited a year since moving into the area for the MRT to start services.<br><br>Said Mr Ang, "I will go down to Chinatown and I will get number one."<br><br>He was followed seconds later by excited residents who rushed through the gates.<br><br>It was a moment they had been waiting for, having lobbied for the station to open.<br><br>Even those who did not live in the immediate vicinity came to lend support and test out the first train.<br><br>Said Marie Lim, a grassroots member at Punggol South, "Every visit we have, we get queried when is it (going to) open and we tell them soon, soon, soon. Now it is finally open we are happy; so next block visit we will not be queried again."<br><br>One resident said, "We have been fighting for the opening for some time and it's only happening now."<br><br>For Marilyn Ho and her husband Joseph Lim, who live about 300 to 400 metres away from the station, the start of train services means that they can save time, and transport costs.<br><br>Said Ms Ho, "In the past I have to take the LRT to the train station (Sengkang MRT station) before transferring to another bus service so that takes up 30 to 40 minutes. With this new station, it will shave off 10 to 15 minutes, so it's good news."<br><br>Defence Minister Teo officially opened the station.<br><br>As MP for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, he hopes it will be a win-win situation for both residents and SBS Transit, the train operator.<br><br>Said Mr Teo, "We are happy that SBS Transit has been able to control the costs and been able to open the station early and of course when the residents are happy, that is very good too."<br><br>The opening of Buangkok Station had been delayed due to insufficient developments around the area.<br><br>It led some frustrated residents to put up placards of white elephants to reflect the state of the station during a minister's visit last year.<br><br>MP for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC Charles Chong, who has been fervently lobbying for the opening of the station, expressed confidence that ridership will increase.<br><br>Said Mr Chong, "Now that the station is open, I hope residents would play their part by using the station even if they have to walk more than 400 metres to the station, because if they don't, then SBS Transit may be tempted to put a next set of white elephants to send a message to our residents."<br><br>Mr Chong says that residents have learnt a valuable experience from lobbying for the opening of the station and the episode has even bonded the residents together.<br><br>The opening of Buangkok Station could not have come at a better time.<br><br>With the Chinese New Year just round the corner, residents now have a direct service to take them to Chinatown.<br><br>SBS Transit expects passenger rides here to reach up to 3,500 per day. - CNA /ct</div>
