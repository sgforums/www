              <div class="artText">THE interchange stations serving the North East Line and the North South Line at Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station are too far apart. The same thing applies to Outram Park, which serves the East West and North East Lines.</div>
              <div class="artText" style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              <div class="artText">I believe that this is because of engineering and safety considerations. As the North East Line was built after the existing lines, it probably had to be built at a distance from the existing stations to avoid disruption to the existing services.</div>
              <div class="artText" style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              <div class="artText">There should be practical ways to overcome this problem and get the interchange stations closer together. Some research should be done to see how other cities overcome this problem, or creative solutions sought. One possible approach is to build the new interchange station to serve both lines, and to divert the old line to use the new station when it is ready.</div>
              <div class="artText" style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              <div class="artText">Singapore will be building several new train lines over the next few years, with more interchange stations needed. I hope the Land Transport Authority will look into this.</div>

              <p>i also wish Dhoby ghaut and outram park interchange can be like City hall and Raffles Place where u can simply transfer to another line by crossing the platform</p>
              <p>but dhoby ghaut and outram park the different lines intersect each other in a kind of perpendicular way instead of being parallel like city hall and raffles, plus both lines are at different levels underground and have nothing to do with each other, how to possibly divert the old line to use the new stations' tracks...the tracks for NEL use totally different system from the old one too...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>if they are gonna re-align, it's gonna be a major realignment and it may take years....cuz firstly for the existing lines, they can only do it when trains are not running i.e. afterdark hours (which is pretty much like only less than 6 hours?) [and time is needed for maintenance] well, i think it's pretty impossible to align perpendicular lines 2gether so that cant be helped...i think that some stations of the new upcoming lines are stacked island so that they can allow cross platform later (circle line marina bay extension and downtown line first phase going to complete at about same time...since they announce so many lines together, there's surely going to be crossplatform interchanges planned as well)</div>

              <p>Once in KL, I went to the wrong side of the platform.</p>
              <p>To get to the right side, I had to go down, exit the station, cross the road, and buy a new ticket. 1 ringgit down the drain.</p>
              <p>And their so-called 'interchange stations' are useless.... might as well just refer to them as 'two different stations separated by a few meters and a major road'.</p>
              <p>This fella who's complaining doesn't seem to realize that it's not just about safety..... there are engineering factors involved (soil composition and condition, existing underground infrastructure, acoustics requirements, etc).</p>
              <p>It is already NOT easy to add a new platform and tracks with an entirely new orientation while maintaining seamless interconnectivity and accounting for all the other engineering factors!</p>
              <p>As much as it can be a hassle to walk at Dhoby Ghaut and Outram Park, at least you don't have to cross fare gates (and end up walking and paying more).</p>

              <p>hope in bishan and serangoon the walking also not as much as dhoby/outram.</p>
              <p>think im used to the dhoby ghaut and outram interchange already, even though must walk quite a bit theres nothing much to complain about. the 2 stations far apart also means the interchange as a whole cover a larger area and u have station entrances spread over a larger area, increasing accessibility. e.g. entrance link directly to plaza singapura, previously before the NEL this wasnt possible. plus dhoby ghaut is also interchange for circle line so when they built the huge interchange they also need to accommodate for CCL as well. maybe transfer to CCL no need walk as much?</p>
              <p>and i dont really understand why the person only until now then complain, the NEL open for so many years already. maybe because the person only starting to use the interchanges now and expecting them to be like city hall and raffles?</p>

              <p>Think CCL is at the same zone as NEL. If they going to put all the lines together ala Raffles Place/City Hall someone is going to write to ST saying that the platforms cause confusion. And signalling system for NSL/NEL doesn't match.</p>

              <p>Due to improper planning by the authorities. Cant blame them as in the past they never thought MRT was gonna be so overused. As for the walking part, they can't possibly build an intersecting/parallel line right under an existing one as tunnelling below an operational line could cause a major implosion and cave-in to the existing line.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Remember the precaution that NEL trains had to slow down at Serangoon because they realised that the soil had sunk due to CCL construction even though CCL box isnt right under NEL's. Its just too dangerous to build a box under an existing one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thats why dhoby and outram have to walk so far.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I think recently govt has started planning this already. They did mention about this and i think NEL's Chinatown (which has future DTL) station box was built to accomodate a future int. They did some extra works with NEL's Harbourfront for CCL too.</p>
