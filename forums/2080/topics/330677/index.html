              <p>Sounds like a case of overshot. They always blame the train for it.</p>
              <p>And about the train being automatic, it depends on which mode it's going at.</p>

              <p>Hmmm... something similar happened to me at Jurong East some time back. Apparently, the train was about to leave Jurong East; it started up for a split second before suddenly jerking to a stop. The train then dwelled for quite a few minutes before it slowly strolled back to it's proper position on the platform and let all the commuters off. The train then left the station - in a normal manner technically - in the direction towards Clementi, presumably towards Ulu Pandan Depot. The train driver I spoke to only said something about a fault. The train involved was an unrefurbished C151 trainset (possibly refurbished now).</p>
              <p>With SMRT scrimping on what's truly necessary, I'm hardly surprised that all this is happening.</p>

              <p>something happened to my C751B a few years ago at night when i returned home with my family living at Admiralty. the train overshot and took around a minute to reverse to the approximately +/- 0.0 point and then the TO opened the door. wondered if it is operating in CM. not even raining.</p>
              <p>another one happened this year on a Saturday morning. wanting to alight at Ang Mo Kio to transfer to another bus, i stood quite close to the door during the trip between AMK and YCK. the trip was much slower than usual. upon reaching AMK, the train continued at that speed into the station. suddenly, an emergency brake. the opening of the door had been delayed for about 3-4 minutes. resulted in me being late for my appointment.</p>

              <p>This happens alot of times. Normally the TO will not reverse the train if the overshot is too much or during peak hours. Imagine the frequency is 2 minutes and he reverses the train. My experience when I was on a C651. The train overshot the station by half a carriage. The train stayed there for half a minutes or so, and then moved off. And there were announcements that "due to technical fault, the train will stop at the next station".</p>
              <p>I've seen an increase of TO using CM mode on the EWL especially at stations like Clementi, Dover and Commonwealth although they are only instructed to enter Buona Vista at CM Mode.</p>

              <p>yea i believe should be a case of overshot la. well sometimes even the computer on the train can cok up abit and apply the wrong brake level mah. The commonwealth stn warning lights for TOs to switch to CM mode lyk foreeva on wan. when i see the sign, they put Crane working ahead, but i see no crane ahead everytime lol.</p>
              <p>on a similar note, have u guys experience before on a train when it suddenly enters a storm or heavy rain it will sudeenly e-brake thn hold on for very long before the train starts to move. is this the standard procedure that TOs adopt before they swtich to CM n move off? i experienced this many times before</p>

              <p>Tdy I kena similar thing ley. I on crowded train saw my toopid cher somemore T.T then we on (313/314) at Novena (SB) at 1421h hor, doors closing.. Move like few doors ahead, can hear that the "heeeee" sound of the C751B alr change to the 'non heeeeee sound part" (dunno how to describe, u all know i think) then suddenly stop. No slow braking like entering station, accelerating halfway like stop.. Before that at Bishan alr door close open 3 times alr.. So I suspected tht he using CM mode due to smth wrng bah? Cuz inside tunnel also cnt hear the motor sound quite clear unlike ATM (isit ATM? the auto one..) mode liao.. Maybe he accidentally let go of that deadmanswitch (issit? so auto stop?) Then see my cher face like some noob kena some big incident liddat.</p>
