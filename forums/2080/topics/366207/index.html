              <p>1. What happen to the "stand behind yellow line"? Or you want it to be omitted? (Although the yellow line thing can be omitted in stations which has the 1.5m PSD installed). Otherwise it sounds good.</p>
              <p>2. This sounds good. Since it's underground, it's okay not to have what's stated in point 1</p>
              <p>3. This sounds good too, except that personally I prefer "The doors on the (left/right) side will open" more.</p>
              <p>Forgot to add; This is the JR variant when a train reaches a terminal;</p>
              <p>"We will soon be arriving at Omiya terminal. The doors on the right side will open. Please change here for the &lt;Lines available for transfer at Omiya station&gt;. Thank you for travelling with us and we look forward to serving you again."</p>
              <p>So you still prefer the JR version or the version you have? And why all of you find it long? It's okay what... Also can complement the STARIS... If you find it long, please state a reason and give a better one which you can think of?</p>
