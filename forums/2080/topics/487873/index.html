            <div class='col-md body'><p>The MRT was been operating for 28 years since its opening on 7 November 1987.Back then the trains had a red and white livery and had different colour scheme for diffrent cabins(walls of trains are the same colour as the seats) The first and last cabin seats are orange (now red/pink), second and fifth are blue and third and fourth are green.Fast forward to 2000 (the year I was born) new C751B trains start to feature a black and red livery and a whole new interior scheme with the walls white in colour.In 2007, the first generation C151 trains started tgier refurbishment and bow has the black and red livery leaving only the second generation c651 trains with old interior and livery colours.These trains are due for refurbishement soon.And in 2012, HHPSD has been installed at all elevated MRT stations and will also be installed at Tuas West Extention due for completion by next year.Share your experience on how the MRT had evolved over the years. *No talking about breakdown*</p></div>

              <p>SMRT's train operator license will be up in 2017, while SBST has been granted the NEL contract for 30 years (2033?). We all know this breeds complacency and the state of the NSEW lines speak volumes of that.</p>
              <p>Also DTL uses LTA livery, which our public buses will gradually adopt under GCM.</p>
              <p>The original four-car money train is now at ITE West. It was originally used for training by SCDF personnel after being decommissioned.</p>

              <p>Suggestion: Can rename this thread "Did you know...?" instead since the other one already expired</p>
              <p>Anyway, here's my piece of interesting info about the MRT...</p>
              <p>1.In August 1993, an westbound train collided with a stationery train at Clementi Station, resulting in 156 reported injuries. Oil spill was found the main reason for the cause of the incident.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">2.On March 2003, a 23-year old driver lost control of his Mercedes-Benz along Lentor Avenue, crashing through the fence and landing on the tracks. A northbound C751B train could not stop on time, but slowed down sufficiently to avoid a major collison.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">3. When NS line was first built, there were rumours of supernatural sightings inside the tunnels at Bishan and Novena, both of which were former cemetery sites. Stories of maintenance personnel encountering ghostly coffin bearers while doing their checks spread like wild fire. Another popular tale was the haunting of the last train at Bishan, where a lone passeger was terrified by a ghastly spirit of a girl who removed her head and placed it on an empty seat after boarding the train.</p>
