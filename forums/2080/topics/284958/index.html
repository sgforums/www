            <div class='col-md body'>One reason is because , mrt have operators manning the train and running it but NEL is fully computerised unless it breaks down then will ask operator to run it . Mrt the operature can see the passenger flows in real life while NEL depends on traffic controllers to check using cctv from site .As long as theres nothing wrong they will let it run by its own computers . Not to mention you all i once board their lrt with a strong shit smell and even have traces of shit inside .</div>

I think they have a sensor throughout the tracks from one station to another, and that signifies the amount of time.<br><br>For example, if a train crosses the 6 minute sensor, the Plasma TV in the preceeding station would then jump to 6 minutes.<br><br>This could be the reason why when new trains are deployed into service, the station cannot track it's position because it is not within reach of the sensor. Only when it crosses the sensor will it change the data. (Sometimes you see the next train timing as 5 minutes but suddenly it jumps to 1 minute. This is the reason that an empty train had just crossed into passenger service tracks and only after crossing the 1 minute sensor the TV reads 1 minute as next train.)</div>

But it does a bit of guesswork.<br><br>For example if a train arrived 15 secs late at the previous station. If the train scheduling system updates it schedule to rush to beat that 15 secs, the system will be informed of its ETA at next station and it will change at the exact second of the ETA a minute or two away.</div>
