            <div class='col-md body'>Yup, man ran over by train at Paya Lebar station. Managed to get a glimpse of the "after action" when I was in the train heading west.<br><br>Here's the "after action" report : Was in a train travelling west, train stopped at Paya Lebar station to allow ppl to alight. [Train heading west was not affected by the disruption, only those heading to Pasir Ris]. Train idled for almost 2 mins at the station, with all doors wide open. Wow! Ppl in this train get to ogle  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> at the scene. But......nothing much to see. By this time, the person have been extracted and wrapped up like a mummy in white and place on the extreme western part of the platform... Still some mrt and civil defence ppl were observed cleaning the under side of the front coach of the train. End of "after action" report.<br><br>My guess is they have to wrapped the person up like mummy, so his insides do not leak or spill out. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  Most likely, this chap must have been partly sliced by them steel wheels of the train, that makes sense for them mrt and civil defence ppl busily cleaning the bottom of the coach...hmm...maybe i am wrong...hmmm.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>This guy sure knows about train momentum. Cos he must've jumped at the section of the platform where the train is still coasting at about 45-60kmh. So the impact will be instantanous and leaving the driver with very little time to react. Even so, the momentum of the train will ensure the chap got an instant ticket to the next life........smart move......so little or no suffering on his part. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Many of the suicidal cases seem to be a sudden thing, I don't suppose a person plan out a suicide, well, some might do so but many don't.<br>Planning more of a kind for murder, but not for these track jumpers, just about that time they thought of something real bad and that time, they just want to end their lives there and then, without due consideration to other things. I suppose someone about to die will have that look on their faces, why no one was able to stop them, and prevent this sort of implusive thing?<br>Not very true on the point of pyschology that a person will pay for a modest fare and jump onto the tracks and get the videos viewed...</div>

Managed to get a glimpse of the "after action" when I was in the train heading west.<br><br>Here's the "after action" report : Was in a train travelling west, train stopped at Paya Lebar station to allow ppl to alight. [Train heading west was not affected by the disruption, only those heading to Pasir Ris]. Train idled for almost 2 mins at the station, with all doors wide open. Wow! Ppl in this train get to ogle  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> at the scene. But......nothing much to see. By this time, the person have been extracted and wrapped up like a mummy in white and place on the extreme western part of the platform... Still some mrt and civil defence ppl were observed cleaning the under side of the front coach of the train. End of "after action" report.<br><br>My guess is they have to wrapped the person up like mummy, so his insides do not leak or spill out. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  Most likely, this chap must have been partly sliced by them steel wheels of the train, that makes sense for them mrt and civil defence ppl busily cleaning the bottom of the coach...hmm...maybe i am wrong...hmmm.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>This guy sure knows about train momentum. Cos he must've jumped at the section of the platform where the train is still coasting at about 45-60kmh. So the impact will be instantanous and leaving the driver with very little time to react. Even so, the momentum of the train will ensure the chap got an instant ticket to the next life........smart move......so little or no suffering on his part. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div></blockquote>Mind sharing with us wat type of Train involved in this incident?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
