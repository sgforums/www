                      <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify;">When opened on 22 December 2013, commuters can look forward to a brand new MRT line, as well as a new commuting experience when they travel on the Downtown Line 1 (DTL1). The Land Transport Authority (LTA) will introduce new designs for queue lines and reserved seats. Ambient music will be played in all DTL1 stations.</p>
                      <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify;"><strong style="margin: 0px;">Root Cause Survey</strong></p>
                      <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify;">The new initiatives are part of a trial aimed at improving overall commuting experience and are ideas from a study involving some 1,000 commuters conducted by LTA and the Singapore Kindness Movement between February and July 2013. The survey was commissioned to better understand the key factors contributing to the public transport experience, and explore the reasons behind ungracious commuter behaviour. The survey also helped to identify possible measures to enhance the travel experience.</p>
                      <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify;">The survey showed that commuter behaviour has the strongest influence on the overall public transport experience. Besides commuter behaviour, the survey findings also highlighted other factors that contribute to the public transport experience, such as the design of the stations, as well as the environment of the stations.</p>
                      <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify;"><strong style="margin: 0px;">New Designs for Queue Lines and Reserved Seats</strong></p>
                      <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify;">To ensure that commuters can move in and out of the trains in a more orderly manner, LTA will introduce new queue line designs for all the six DTL1 stations.</p>
                      <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify;">At the Telok Ayer and Promenade DTL1 stations, the queue line design will be a set of lines drawn parallel to the platform screen doors to show clearly where commuters should queue. For the DTL1 stations at Chinatown, Downtown, Bayfront and Bugis, a modified version of the existing queue markings used in other MRT stations will be adopted. This modified design will come with a bigger “funnel” for commuters entering and exiting the trains. LTA will review the effectiveness of the two new designs before deciding if they should be introduced to other stations. Please refer to <a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #006699;" title="Annex A " href="http://app.lta.gov.sg/data/apps/news/roads/2013/New%20Initiatives%20Annex%20A%20-%20Queue%20Line%20design.pdf"><strong style="margin: 0px;">Annex A</strong></a> for the new queue line designs.</p>

These striking designs will signal more clearly the seats’ intended use for commuters with mobility needs. Commuters can vote for the design which they feel would be most effective through SMS or Facebook when the DTL1 opens on 22 December. The voting will close on 1 February 2014. The result of the polls will help determine which design for reserved seats will be applied to all DTL1 trains.

Aimed at providing a more pleasant environment for MRT commuters, LTA will review the feedback before evaluating if this initiative should be rolled out to other MRT stations.</p>

                      <span style="line-height: 1.231;">SINGAPORE – There will be free all-day travel between the six Downtown Line (DTL) stations for 11 days from Dec 22, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said today (Dec 7).
                          The DTL stations, which will have new queue line designs and ambient background music, will also be part of the on-going free pre-peak travel trial with two stations, Telok Ayer and Downtowd, added to the trial. 
                          In addition, there will also be bigger reserved seats signs and “dressed up” reserved seats in the new DTL trains, the LTA said.
                          The six stations - Chinatown, Telok Ayer, Downtown, Bayfront, Promenade and Bugis stations - will open for passenger service on Dec 22. as part of the first phase of the DTL, Singapore’s fifth major MRT line. An open house was held today, and commuters can get free rides from 10am to 6pm</span></div></blockquote>

              <p><strong>Child who activated detrainment door device could have caused Downtown Line disruption</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The power fault that caused service to be disrupted on the Downtown Line 1 on Friday night could have been triggered by a child who had accidentally activated the detrainment door device, said operator SBS Transit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This caused the emergency brakes to be automatically applied, resulting in a tripping of the power supply to the line which is a safety feature of the system, it added. "Based on CCTV footage, we note that there were some children playing around the detrainment door area. A small girl appears to have accidentally activated the detrainment door device," said SBS Transit. "We are still investigating the incident and apologise to all affected."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Service on the newly-opened line was down at about 9pm on Friday, and resumed at 10.10pm. SBS Transit said 50 passengers on one train were detrained at Bayfront station. The operator deployed free bus bridging services for affected commuters, and buses passing by affected stations were also free.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is the second breakdown for the six-station, 4.3km line which began operating just five days ago. The line runs from Chinatown to Bugis. On its opening day on Dec 22, service was disrupted for 15 minutes due to a train fault. The problem took place around noon at Bayfront station and delayed services between Bugis and Chinatown. It was quickly resolved and full service resumed not long after.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>SINGAPORE — Train service on the Downtown Line (DTL) was disrupted this evening (Dec 27) at about 9pm before being restored at 10.10pm, said SBS Transit (SBST).</p>
              <p>"<strong>At about 9pm, there was a power fault affecting the Downtown Line. 50 passengers on one train were detrained at Bayfront Station. Full service resumed at 10.10pm.</strong> We apologise to all commuters for the inconvenience caused," said Ms Tammy Tan, Senior Vice President, corporate communications, SBS Transit.</p>
              <p><strong>Based on CCTV footage, the power fault appears to be due to activation of the detrainment door device</strong>, said Ms Tan.</p>
              <p>"Based on CCTV footage on board our train, it would appear that the power fault which caused the Downtown Line to shut down this evening may be the result of the activation of the detrainment door device," said Ms Tan. "<strong>We note that there were some children playing around the detrainment door area. A small girl appears to have accidentally activated the detrainment door device which caused the emergency brakes to be automatically applied. This resulted in a tripping of the power supply to the Line which is a safety feature of the system</strong>.</p>
              <p>"We are still investigating the incident and apologise to all affected."</p>
              <p>The end of the disruption was announced on a Twitter post that the Land Transport Authority (LTA) posted on behalf on SBST. The transport operator said: “DTL service has resumed. Once again, we are sorry for the inconvenience caused.”</p>
              <p>The service disruption was originally reported by the LTA, also on Twitter. In the tweet, SBST said that “we are very sorry” and added that bus bridging services were made available during the disruption in service. SBST said the downtime was due to a power fault.</p>
              <p>This is the second time the DTL suffered a service downtime in just six days. A train fault at its Bayfront MRT Station disrupted services for about 15 minutes on Dec 22 just hours after the first stretch of the DTL was opened.</p>
              <p>These breakdowns come despite SBS Transit previously announcing that more than 180 drills were conducted prior to the opening of the first six stations of the DTL. Some of the drills involved multiple agencies and included simulations of scenarios where trains break down. Shuttle bus service routes were also tested.</p>
              <p>SBST also said that trains go through an automated process before they enter service every morning. The process, which lasts about 20 minutes, includes testing of brakes, air-conditioning, lighting and battery systems, while customer service officers also check the trains.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE — Testing for the new Downtown Line (DTL) trains is almost complete and the first stage of the line is on track for its scheduled year-end opening.</p>
              <p>This would be in December, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced yesterday in his National Day Message.</p>
              <p>By next month, the <strong>Land Transport Authority (LTA)</strong> will <strong>hand over the trains to SBS Transit, the operator of the line</strong>,<strong> for trial runs</strong>, which could take about two months.</p>
              <p>On its part, <strong>the operator is working with the LTA and its contractors in the testing and commissioning of station equipment, trains and all control systems</strong>.</p>
              <p>SBS Transit Senior Vice-President (Corporate Communications) Tammy Tan said <strong>work procedures are being developed and staff training is ongoing</strong>.</p>
              <p>To date, it has recruited more than 90 per cent of the staff required for Downtown Line 1 (DTL 1), which will consist of six stations: Chinatown, Telok Ayer, Downtown, Bayfront, Promenade and Bugis.</p>
              <p>Since the trains arrived eight months ago, they have been put through their paces with checks on basic functions such as lighting and ventilation and on the communication channels the trains would need to communicate with the stations or the operation control centre.</p>
              <p>Nine trains are now being tested, with two more on the way.</p>
              <p>The entire system, including the trains and tunnels, will undergo around 800 tests and more than 50 per cent of the checks have been done, according to LTA Deputy Director (Rolling Stock and Depot Equipment) Chia Choon Poh.</p>
              <p>“The team has been conducting tests from the operations control centre down to each individual train for the last eight months to test the various functions of the train while the train is in motion,” he said.</p>
              <p>The trains are now going through carousel train testing, where normal train operations are replicated.</p>
              <p>“There are now four trains running in the six DTL 1 stations, and we observe everything, such as the train stopping accuracy, to the announcements made on the trains,” Mr Chia added.</p>
              <p>The DTL trains will come with new features such as perch seats to allow for more passengers on the train and dynamic route maps, which will indicate the direction of travel, the next station and the side the doors will open on.</p>
              <p>Stage 1 of the DTL will be 4.3 kilometres long and the entire line will stretch 42km, slated for completion in 2017.</p>

              <p>Personally, based on the news articles, I feel that the cause of last Friday’s disruption is simply an accident; it is neither LTA nor SBS Transit’s fault.</p>
              <p>Apparently, the error is in the design of the train. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">So the blame should be on<strong> the one who designed the train</strong>.</span></p>
