            <div class='col-md body'>Well, at least you know one thing! Companies will have to rely on buses now to advertise as trains could not be used. If you visit Japan's Keio Line, I think you know their bodies are stainless steel and no exterior ads was on them from their start of lifespan. So, bye bye for train exterior advertisment.<br><br>P.S: SMRT sometime lazy never remove expired exterior ad from trains like 3075 -3076. Only interior ad removed, exterior no.<br><br>P.S again: Is 3024-3023 undergoing refurbishment?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>quite a no. of train stations esp the NS-line are underground. also, advertising on the train's exterior can hardly attract passerbys' attention/glance unlike buses as they are running on elevated tracks.<br>Thats why it makes sense to advertise on the trains' interior instead to attract the max attention.<br><br>for planes, its quite difficult for people even those standing at the airport's viewing gallery to have a glance on the plane's ads should there be one. furthermore, the planes are in the sky most of the time. so how to attract public attention to the ads? furthermore as planes generally fly across countries or continents, the ads might not attract the right attention.</div>
