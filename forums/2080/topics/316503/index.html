              <h1 class="clr">Singaporean on derailed KTM train claims there was confusion after incident</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Confusion reigned when the KTM train derailed near Seremban Saturday afternoon, said a Singaporean who was onboard.</p>
              <p>Mr Hong Ngar Choong said the Express Rakyat train with 210
              passengers, jumped track around 3.30pm after pulling out of the
              Seremban station.</p>
              <p>He said help was not immediately available and he made his own way back to Singapore after getting out.</p>
              <p>The incident resulted in the death of the driver and injury to 12 passengers, including six Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The injured were ferried to a hospital where they received outpatient treatment.</p>
              <p>Mr Hong, who was with a group of seven Singaporeans, told Channel NewsAsia he was not injured.</p>
              <p>"There
              was a fair bit of confusion inside our coach, and then there were many
              opinions — whether to stay in the coach or get out of the coach.
              Because the coach was slanting, so some were afraid that if we were to
              move to one side, the whole coach may just roll down," he said.</p>
              <p>"We
              waited for a while but there were no instructions from the so—called
              KTM authorities, so the passengers decided to just carry their own
              luggage and... climb down the coach." — CNA/ac</p>

              <p>Lack of maintainance of the track which resulted the accident?</p>
              <p>That time while I was taking the train and pass by this area, I saw the track sleeper look old like did not replace and why did they (KTM) use wooden sleeper instead of cement type. Cement sleeper require less maintainance while wooden one need.</p>
