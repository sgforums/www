              <p>Maybe there is a trend that there are more malays in CSO, so the chance of stereotyping is higher. Just like just now where people (train fans) are trying to take a group photos on MRT station, it was a chinese CSO say cannot when people are setting it up for about 5 mins.... Fail......</p>

              <p>These people are given jobs and task to do. They have to discharge it well. Different people may have different style. Some could be abit lineant, some abit strict. Races is not the issue here.</p>
              <p>You are given a task and you have to execute it well. They are just following instructions.</p>

              <p>I am just trying to say, there is no connection between which race a CSO belongs to will have "nastier" trend, afterall, it is either A) They did not see it or B) They choose not to see it, which makes them "nicer" and maybe there might be some point to look out for friendlier staff to ask for such special permission, but do look out for "nastier" ones so that noe when to "siam" ("run away") and stay out of trouble.</p>

              <p>Anyway different TOs have different ways of dealing with trespassers. When sometimes you are filming and you accidentally film into the TO cabin, some TOs will just wave at you and close at the door.
