              <p>I must say,</p>
              <p>FOSMRT Card IS NOT A PASSPORT FOR YOU TO TAKE PHOTOS OR VIDEOS. You are simply tarnishing the image of Friends of SMRT.</p>
              <p>Hey, if you are a friend of SMRT, why aren't you following their house rules?</p>
              <p>Furthermore, not everyone who joined FOSMRT is a train fan. Who says they are train fans? They may like trains, but do not have that much knowledge on trains than us. Some are interested in buses, some in their taxis. Who knows? Don't assume everyone on FOSMRT is a train fan.</p>
              <p>I have to reiterate it again cause some people won't understand,</p>
              <p>FOSMRT CARD IS NOT TO BE USED AS A PASSPORT FOR YOU TO TAKE PHOTOS OR VIDEOS.</p>

              <p>You all go CCL rides on Sunday. Every Sundays I went for TC polices running up and down. (Train)</p>
              <p><strong>Example:</strong> There's have a gangs. A group Paya Lebar board a train to Dakota, then they exchange polices in Dakota Station.</p>
              <p>Then the polices in Dakota board the train to next station. In one Carriage there have 4 doors. Two polices one door then two polices another door until ALMOST whole train door! And I mean the back door one.. (Left Door - Not Often)</p>

              <p>An SMRT CSO came, he told me "No video allowed". He didn't call and other polices or CSO. Just the words "No video allowed". Then I forget it. (He's not scolding, just reminding me)</p>
