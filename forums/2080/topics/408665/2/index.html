              <p><strong>1 more station for DTL</strong></p>
              <p>TRANSPORT Minister Raymond Lim revealed the alignment of the third 
                  stage of the MRT Downtown Line on Friday, and it turns out the eastern 
                  and final arm is longer than originally announced.</p>
              <p>Downtown Line Stage 3, which connects eastern suburbs such 
                  as Tampines and Bedok to the Marina Bay downtown, will be 2km longer at 
                  21km.</p>
              <p>It will also have 16 stations, one more than envisaged initially. The additional station is in Jalan Besar.</p>
              <p>This is partly why the budget of the entire Downtown Line 
                  project - now 42km instead of 40km - will bust the forecast $12 billion 
                  budget, and will be completed in 2017 instead of 2016.</p>
              <p>The other reasons include a sharp increase in construction 
                  costs since the Downtown Line was first announced three years ago. 
                  Minister Lim said Downtown Line Stage 3 will offer commuters in the 
                  eastern part of Singapore, 'who are currently not served by the rail 
                  network, an alternative transport choice'.</p>
              <p>'For instance, a person living in Tampines and working at 
                  the Kaki Bukit Industrial Estate will take half the time to get to 
                  work,' he said, adding that his 25-minute journey by bus today wil be 
                  cut down to just 10 minutes by train.</p>
              <p>Residents will have to wait till 2017 though. Although the 
                  new deadline is a year later than previously forecast, it is still 
                  earlier than the 2018 target envisaged in 2007.</p>
              <p>Part of Downtown Line Stage 3 will pass through one of the 
                  busiest parts of the city, including Sungei Road, Bencoolen and River 
                  Valley.</p>
              <p>This eastern and final stretch of the line will have three 
                  interchanges: MacPherson station which connects to the Circle Line; as 
                  well as Tampines and Expo stations, which connect to the East-west Line.</p>
              <p>The alignment will involve some property acquisitions. 
                  Private plots that are affected are a Shell station in Upper Changi Road
                   East, two parking lots in Bencoolen House, part of a foodcourt in Peony
                   Mansion, vacant spaces behind Kaki Bukit Techpark and Techview 
                  Building, as well as a vacant plot next to Plaza by the Park. Fifteen 
                  terrace houses along Merpati Road and Jalan Anggerek in MacPherson will 
                  also be acquired to form part of free up a 2.7-hectare site that will be
                   redeveloped.</p>
              <p>The Urban Redevelopment Authority said with the announcement
                   of Downtown Line Stage 3, 'it is essential to gazette the acquisition 
                  sites now... to provide certainty for affected land owners and to 
                  prevent undue speculation and anxiety'.</p>
              <p>Affected land owners of the 15 landed houses will be given five years to hand over their properties.</p>

              <p>The wiki was based on earlier announcement which did states that Rochor will be an interchange. Guess that they insert a station (Jalan Besar) and shift the 2 stations, or simply split "Rochor" into 2 stations (Bencoolen and Sungei Road).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, that do happens at North East Line as well. According to a North East Line related reference book in a library (NLB), it was stated that initally Chinatown was a bit further North and there is no Clarke Quay station. However, some planners had went to bars located in Clarke Quay and overheard the people there wishing to have a MRT station there, so they have decided to shift Chinatown further South to present location + add a Clarke Quay becomes today North East Line.</p>

              <p>DT12 (now DT13) Rochor and DT21 (now DT22) Sungei Road were planned as interchange station. In the end, the plan was shelved.</p>

              <p>Yes, there will be, just that it is not announced right now (Post 2020 line)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW, personally I feel that the correct answer to the number of DTL stations is <strong>40</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How does that derived?</p>
              <p>34 presently announced stations</p>
              <p>2 stations from Expo to ERL Interchange @ Tanah Merah Ferry / Golf Club (Somewhere there, the distance should be around 3km if I am not wrong, and hence usually a station is about 1.5km or so, it will be translated into 2 future stations)</p>
              <p>1 station between Hillview and Beauty World (DT4)</p>
              <p>About 3 stations from Bukit Panjang to Kranji (Kranji included). Taking into account that DTL 2 was such cheapstake that they follow the entire Bukit Timah Road, even at a cost of not interchanging with Bukit Panjang within the paid areas and made it like City Hall - Esplanade case, I will be surprised if they were to extend the line without connecting to Kranji as either Yew Tee or future Sungei Kadut (NS6) will involve a big turn. Well, presently the depot is about a km further North from DTL (Gali Batu Depot) BPJ station, with overrun sector placed. So, I believe that it is sensible for it to extend until Kranji.</p>

              <p>I dun think they're going to extend</p>
              <p>There's no pt extending it to Kranji because it's going to be difficult shifting the industrial plots users &amp; Woodlands Rd is relatively narrow.</p>
              <p>But I think e MRT stations at Bedok Reservoir/ Kaki Bukit/ Ubi as in location is overkill, all clustered together.</p>
