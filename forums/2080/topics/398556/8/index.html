              <p>Would appreciate if you guys could post here and tell us which
                  session you are coming for. Currently, only Samuel Lee and Kawac151
                  has posted.</p>
              <p>Less than 10 forms have been given out in total including the 2
                  members mentioned above which is extremely shocking. Guys, if you
                  think it's easy to plan this kinda thing, think again. If you can't
                  commit, please, next time, don't say yes so quick. In the end, you
                  may have deprived others of their chance.</p>

              <p>Erm, I know that you and Interception will be quite disappointed due to the response is indeed shocking. However, there are some considerations to take note:</p>
              <p>1: Who are you / Who is XXX? Seriously, the guys here may not know each other in real life. And thus, how am I see who is the one on platform X of X station is the guy I need to find. And I guess the first time met will have the awkard feeling.</p>
              <p>2: Time constraint. This sounds like an excuse, but, it is indeed people are not free (Including the organizers like you)</p>
              <p>3: There is no mention of the exact time of the depot event, since this is under planning. Thus, people will think that hey it is far (Possibly June in my personal educated guess, correct me if I am wrong) and I can plan my schedule accordingly, and thus sure free for this wonderful depot event. But hold on, what? Taking FOSMRT form at XXX (Various sessions)? Opps, I at school la, weekend parents want me to stay with them la (Some Parents may nag when u meet strangers) ...... &lt;whatever reason&gt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>EDIT: BTW, I still afraid that I might just cant find the place and even if I did, I might just did not get the right person. So...... is it possible to camp at CGA for like 5:30pm?</p>

              <p>I have something on which starts at 5.30, so cannot. I can only do 5 to 5.15pm.</p>
              <p>You can't miss the Aviation Gallery, really. It's the old Viewing Mall. Take the longer escalator at the MRT Station to T2 Departure Hall, walk towards Check-in Row 7 and take the escalator behind it. You will pass by Fresh Bulggogi and Fish &amp; Co. Turn left and you will see it straightaway.</p>

              <p>I am so sorry for failing ti attend the session in CGA. Actually it is not that I did not turn up, but by the time I reached CGA T3 (I live in Marine Parade, can be seen on Intro thread) via Service 36, it was already like 5:10pm ~ 5:15pm (Based on Ezlink card time / my watch), and by the time run I run to there, I saw many childrens in groups, accompanied with their parents, as well as some teenagers in group and even couples and among them got some seemed to do their Art coursework or whatever (Bringing crayons or colour pencils). I even saw planes on F30 or whatever, which brings my childhood memories..... (I saw there and I have the feel,....)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW, did I saw you (NickLim)? Today did you saw a teenager alone with brown T-shirt with spectacles on the long esclator in T2 (Or did you wear T-shirt with blue colour, accompanied by presume your parents?). Anyway, I left the gallery at 5:21pm (Based on CGA clock) and took MRT, and the train car number was 2211 all the way to TNM.</p>

              <p>Terrorist acts are called trivial? Then the Yishun station would have been exploded and contary to some "urban legends" where suiciders / people who are killed in incident will have to find someone to die for him / her could have freed themselves to their next life or whatever. (If one believe in such, given that indeed there are some so conincdence stuffs like Bedok was suicided twice in the entire 2000 - 2010, the earlier is in 2000). At the same time, bringing more deaths due to an explosion caused / inconvience as the entire town centre has no MRT while reconstructing it.</p>
