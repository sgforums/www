              <p>Sigh, that time want to collect form, don't want submit. Need to think twice and such la this and that. Then now want submit to me? If I working corporate communications also I won't process your registration easily. </p>
              <p>You think they everyday process ah? They rather collate alot of it then register at one go. Even if you register, I doubt you'll get invited as today (14 June) is the due date to RSVP for the tour.</p>

              since we are going to email those who have registered with us, this
              "discussion" is redundant. We are supposed to have only 25
              participants including the organisers. If you want to continue this

              <p>Seperate group? Can yo kindly elaborate the differences? And does it means if only 1 of the criteria meet, I still can come for KCD tour, but the arrangement will be different or <strong>NOT at all </strong>(Meaning if I go KCD on 18 June 2010 also will be asked to leave)?</p>

              <p>Well, I am pretty sure that people wants things to be fair (Despite reality is always not) and will keep on asking one. So in long term point of view, if that can be asked as well, it will be better (Whats so difficult to add one more sentence to it?)</p>
