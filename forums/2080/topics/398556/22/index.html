              <p>Wah, so next time if we just take a snap of the inside control (Like the previous CCL train fault and I use a low quality HP to snap it) also can lor, since that is part of public knowledge.</p>

              <p>Actually all the stuff inside the depot that they showed us are supposed to be public knowledge and unclassified. They did not show us the OCC room, outright you would know that is classified.</p>
              <p>To add on, rules applied during <em>part of the tour</em> was only no videography. There were no rules such as no photography. No rules such as no uploading of photos online. Hence I selected through my photos and showed those parts which people may not know what they are or need some explanation with.</p>
              <p>If a CSO opens up the cover for CM operation and you happen to have a camera with you, <strong>ask before shooting anything</strong>. If the staff is authorized and know what to do, he/she will give you the appropriate permission/response.</p>
              <p>Dashboard photos are available all over the net. I have gotten pictures of so many train dashboard through BBS and forums all over the world and nothing is short of amazing as this, a very simplified control and what I must say a very tough to operate master control as compared to other systems (spring loaded control).</p>
              <p>Explanation of the dashboard is outright public knowledge as well. I am sure a railway fan from Asia, Japan, Europe or America can figure out the controls just by looking at the picture.</p>

              <p>Ok, as I today had went to One-North / Kent Ridge, I can assure
              you that between them got a place called: Temporarily Staging Area
              (TSA) and one aspect of C830 is to do with with C830 TAS-ONR (ONR =
              One-North)</p>

              <p>isnt the temporary staging area used by Alstom for track and E&amp;M works? how is it related to your explanation?</p>
              <p>and what is it about this C830 TAS-ONR (I suppose Tai Seng - One North)? are you referring to your deduction about the cycle of crossovers and sidings for the different stages?</p>
