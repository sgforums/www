In this, magnetic forces lift, propel and guide trains over an elevated guideway.<br><br>The monorail will initially serve a 13.5km stretch from the state capital to AEON Tebrau City in the proposed logistics hub. Another 50km of railway lines will be added subsequently to serve other parts of the state. The Singapore link will be about 3km-to-4km long.<br></div>

So far there has been no stumbling blocks," said Mr Novakovic.<br><br>Another possibility is for JM to engage SMRT as a technology partner or business consultant.<br><br>"It's most likely to be all of the above options," said Mr Novakovic.<br><br>JM is now waiting to sign official concession agreements, after which it will try to hammer out its deal with SMRT, subject to approval from authorities.<br><br>Analysts think it's a lucrative project.<br><br>"This will be a profitable line because of the traffic. Everyday, you have 50,000 people commuting across the Causeway. With the monorail, even more people will cross the Causeway during the weekends," said a transport analyst at a foreign bank.<br><br>FACTS about the Johor Baru Monorail:<br><br>The Johor Baru monorail, which travels at a speed of 100km per hour is faster than Singapore's MRT and will be based on the "maglev" or magnetic levitation technology. In this, magnetic forces lift, propel and guide trains over an elevated guideway.<br><br>The monorail will initially serve a 13.5km stretch from the state capital to AEON Tebrau City in the proposed logistics hub. Another 50km of railway lines will be added subsequently to serve other parts of the state. The Singapore link will be about 3km-to-4km long.<br></div></blockquote>if this becomes reality, will the maglev be operated by SMRT or a malaysian train operator?</div>
