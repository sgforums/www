              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE : It is the first work and school day of the new year 
              and train services on all lines during the peak-hour period ran 
              smoothly.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>But it was a different scenario during off-peak hours on the west-bound train service, with some commuters experiencing delays.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Working adults and students travelling on trains were off to a good start on Tuesday morning.<br><br>While MRT lines were fraught with disruptions last month, there weren't any major hiccups on Tuesday.<br><br>It
               was the North-South Line that experienced train stoppages on December 
              15 and 17 due to power disruptions. But commuters Channel NewsAsia spoke
               to on Tuesday morning at Bishan MRT station, which lies on the 
              North-South Line, weren't too worried about train delays. <br><br>However, there were others who took no chances.<br><br>One student said: "I left home late today but there were no delays on the train."<br><br>Another student commented: "The train services were normal and nothing happened."<br><br>A
               third student noted: "I left early for school today, but the train 
              suddenly stopped right before Bishan interchange and I was a bit afraid 
              for a moment."<br><br>One commuter said: 'I did not anticipate any train delays so it should be okay."<br><br>But the journey was not that smooth for commuters on the west-bound service.<br><br>One commuter, Ms Koh, told Channel NewsAsia that she experienced a 20-minute delay on her way to Jurong East MRT station.<br><br>SMRT said a track signalling fault at Jurong East station was identified at about 9.15am.<br><br>As
               such, a speed restriction was imposed on the west-bound train service 
              between Clementi and Jurong East for staff to access the tracks.<br><br>Travelling time between the two stations took about seven minutes instead of the usual four. <br><br>The delay also had a knock-on effect on the west-bound service going towards Clementi.<br><br>And the travelling time between Dover and Jurong East took about 14 minutes instead of the usual six to seven minutes.<br><br>The fault was rectified in about half an hour.<br><br>- CNA/cc/ms</span></span></p>
