            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi all, I hope this post is in the correct forum, but anyway does anyone know whether the Bukit Timah Railway station (KTM) is open to all to access? I seldom see anyone go to that station, neither do i hear anyone talk about it. I do know it is used for trains to exchange tokens. Could anyone enlighten me on its other roles? Thanks</p></div>

              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>This topic has been made here before but don't know where it has gone to. The station is not open to everybody. There is a signboard indicating that entry or photography is not allowed. If you want to take pictures there, you must seek permission from the Station Master inside the station. There has been numerous cases people visiting there and not asking permission from the Station Master as you are standing in Malaysia's property and you will be asked to leave the premises. Also, there is a railway bridge near the Station itself and is accessible through Rifle Range Road. That place is popular where photographers like to take photos of wedding couples, etc. There is a bend round the corner and it is a blind spot. Trains heading towards Singapore might not able to see people standing on the bridge and might not have enough time to stop the train. Therefore, it is not advisable to stand there and take photos. Even if you want to, please seek permission from the Station Master so that you know whether there are any trains passing by.</p>
              <p>Yes, the main function of the station is to exchange key tokens. It is also a station where trains can cross as there is a single track in Singapore. It also serves as a backup station where passengers can alight and board during an emergency. It has been practised before when a Freight Train carrying Sugar derailed near Bt. Merah and passengers were allowed to board and alight at the Station. Other than that, boarding or alighting at the station is not allowed. Hope this helps.</p>

              <p>Dear dinierazin</p>
              <p>Thanks for your reply. I asked about it because i wanted to catch a glimpse of the Eastern &amp; Oriental express, which comes here about twice a month or so. Guess i shall have to view it from somewhere else. Not to worry i won't stand on the trackbed if I do go spot it. </p>
