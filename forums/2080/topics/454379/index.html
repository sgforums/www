              <p>STOMPer <strong>wasabi</strong> was on her way home when one of the train doors remained stuck open even as the train moved off from Lakeside station.<br><br>Said the STOMPer:<br><br>"I was on my way home from Boon Lay MRT to City Hall MRT last night. <br><br>"At
               Lakeside station at 10.15pm, one of the doors started making noises 
              during 'Doors Closing' and remained stuck open even while the train 
              started moving. <br><br>"Thank goodness the train was relatively empty, 
              if not it would have been dangerous for people standing near that door 
              in a crowded train! <br><br>"The doors eventually closed at the next station."<br><br>A spokesperson from SMRT wrote:<br><br>"SMRT
               views this incident seriously. We have contacted STOMP for more details
               so that we can verify the authenticity of the photograph, and 
              investigate the matter thoroughly.<br><br>"For such incidents, 
              passengers aboard the train can activate the emergency communications 
              button located on the side of train doors, to inform our train officer. 
              Passengers can also provide details to our station staff at the 
              passenger service centre.<br><br>"We wish to reassure commuters that the
               North-South-East-West Line is built with many fail-safe features to 
              ensure passenger safety. For example, there is a safety system that 
              ensures trains will not be able to move off, if train doors are not 
              properly closed."</p>

              STOMP apologises for erroneous article on open SMRT train doors
              
              APOLOGY
              
              Statement by STOMP Editor, Azhar Kasman
              
              STOMP would like to apologise for the posting on June 20, supposedly showing an SMRT train that left Lakeside station with one set of doors open. The report, submitted by a STOMP content producer, has been found to be fabricated.
              
              The content producer, Ms Samantha Ann Francis, had submitted the photo to STOMP, claiming that she had taken it when she was at Lakeside MRT Station at 10.15pm on June 19.
              
              Following investigations by our staff, Ms Francis has admitted that she had in fact taken the photo off a posting on Twitter. The original tweet has since been removed.
              
              Ms Francis has been dismissed by Singapore Press Holdings, which owns Stomp.
              
              SPH sent a letter yesterday (24/5) to SMRT's interim CEO Tan Ek Kia apologising for the incident.
              
              Mr Patrick Daniel, editor-in-chief of Singapore Press Holdingsâ€™ English and Malay Newspapers Division, said in the letter: â€œMy team and I would like to apologise unreservedly to SMRT for this erroneous report by one of our staff. We truly regret the damage this has caused SMRT.â€�
              
              He added: â€œAside from breaching our professional ethics, what Ms Francis has done goes against all the values that we stand for."
              
              As STOMP editor, I would also like to personally apologise to SMRT and members of the public for this erroneous article in STOMP. I deeply regret that one of our staff breached professional ethics and posted a fabricated report.
              
              I would like to assure the public and all STOMP readers that the website does not tolerate such unethical behaviour.
              
              We will also be reviewing our operating procedures and will do everything we can to prevent such a lapse from recurring.

              <p>Then what about all the other posts on STOMP which are technically slanderous?</p>

              <p>STOMP editor should take down those posts as well and apologize for leaving them there.</p>

              <p>So now we all know STOMP kinda works that way one. Which stories to believe now?</p>
              <p>By the way, that post of hers made it to last week's main papers, so hence you see how serious it had become to SPH, only to find out that its "fabricated".</p>
              <p>If SPH hadn't apologised, SMRT could actually file a suit against them for b*llsh*t that caused commuters to question SMRT's train safety (loss of reputation).</p>
              <p>But we all know GLCs don't work like that.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
