Typical nuns' clothing consists of undergarments which are made mainly of wool, and a tunic which is tied around the waist with a cloth or leather belt. Over the tunic is a scapula which is a garment of long wide piece of woolen cloth worn over the shoulders with an opening for the head, to which a hood is also attached. A chain with a crucifix, or a set of rosary beads, is usually worn around the neck.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #0645ad;"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup></p>

              <p>The Swiss national is not responsible for the security breech. If terrorists sneak into the MRT depot, it is not his fault, neither is he the cause of it.</p>

              <p>In fact he did the authorities a favour, he showed them that security of the depot is not up to scratch.</p>

              <p>The matter was highlighted by the public through internet.</p>
              <p>The affected train was let into service.</p>
              <p>Was it inspected for serviceablilty and safety before it was released for service or nothing was performed at all ? Another honest mistake ?</p>
              <p>The vandal was performed with ease. There was no lapse of security or there was no security at all.</p>

              <p>TEMASEK REVIEW</p>
              <div>
              <p><img title="mrtgraffiti" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mrtgraffiti.jpg" alt="mrtgraffiti" width="177" height="115"></p>
              <p>The MRT graffiti saga which rocked the entire nation took another twist yesterday when it was revealed that SMRT took more than 48 hours to lodge a police report.</p>
              <p>A Swiss FT was hauled up to Court yesterday for trepassing into a MRT depot at Changi and vandalizing one of the trains by spraying graffiti on one side of the carriage.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">(1)It also transpired that he had an accomplice with him Briton McKoy Banos who has since left Singapore</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>The security breach allegedly took place on 16 May 2010, but a police report was made only on 19 May 2010 which contradicts an official statement by SMRT that it “reported the breach to the police immediately when it was discovered.”</p>
              <p>When queried by the Straits Times, SMRT Head of Security Mr Choy Kin Chong declined to comment on the time lapse, saying that “more security staff had been deployed to increase patrol at its depots.”</p>
              <p>Singapore’s biggest security lapse since the dramatic escape of famed terrorist Mas Selamat Kasteri two years ago drew widespread concerns from both law-makers and Singaporeans who wondered what the consequences might be had the vandals been terrorists instead.</p>
              <p>GPC chairman for Home Affairs and Law, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr Alvin Yeo</span> was quick to jump to the defence of the Swiss FT:</p>
              <p><em>“MRT trains are potential soft targets. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">(2)</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">I dare say that the suspects probably did it in the spirit of fun and adventure and not for something more sinister. But this could have been something more harmful than just graffiti</span>,”</em> he was quoted as saying in the Straits Times.</p>
              <p>Netizens were equally flabbergasted at how SMRT could allow the security breach to go unnoticed for so long.</p>
              <p>Eddie Chin commented:</p>
              <p><em>“This is a real security concern. If someone can sneak into an MRT depot and spend a sizeable amount of time spraying the graffiti, he would have enough time to plant bombs on many different trains.

              <p>Maybe they are keeping a distance as far as possible from the incident out of fears of re-igniting Singaporeans’ memories of Mas Selamat.</p>

              <p>(1)Another Briton was involved and has left the country? Are we going to see another case similar to that of the Romanian diplomat? Would MFA be able to bring this Briton back for investigation? Let alone punishment?</p>
              <p>(2)If it was some other fellows from other countries (like Iran or Syria)  making the infiltration (and not an angmoh from Switzerland), I wonder if the Alvin Yeo dares to say  <br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em> "the suspects probably did it in the spirit of fun and adventure and not for something more sinister". </em></span><span style="color: #000000;">If a potential terrorist was to make the infiltration and did something nasty (such as planting a bomb), he should top it up with graffiti on the MRT. If he's caught just say that he did it in the spirit of fun and adventure and not for something sinster. Just hope that he can fool the others so that there's enough time for the bomb to explode. </span></p>
              <p>(3)I think we should not expect any comments from our DPM Wong. Remember PM Lee questioned Low Thia Kiang how far along the line did he want the heads to roll (something like this when Low asked in parliament whether WKS should quit to hold resposibility for MSK escape) PM Lee even questioned LTK if he should resigned too since he's the one who picked WKS as Minister For Home Affairs.</p>
              <p>I predict that WKS would soon announce his retirement from politics. PAP is already facing lots of problems with voters over many issuses and they definitely wont want to carry another extremely heavy burden in this coming GE.</p>

              <p>I thought i saw a similar topic addressed in 'Life in a dot'.</p>
              <p>Well, I'll post my thoughts here too.</p>
              <p>AT LAST.  The PAP has decided to treat WHITES the same as they treat Singaporeans.</p>
              <p><br>1. For the first time, a white foreign talent doesn't get special treatment</p>
              <p>2. For the first time, the government made this white criminal FRONT PAGE NEWS. Usually, reports of whites criminals are TUCKED snugly inside an obscure page of the Straits Times in a little column.</p>
              <p>3. For the first time, an ang mo may receive the maximum jail sentence.</p>
              <p>4. For the first time, an angmo will not get special privileges in court.  Remember, NICK LEESON stole US$800,000,000,000.00 and got 6.5 years jail. A LOCAL CHINESE ACCOUNTS CLERK stole $1,500.00 and received 18 years jail.</p>
              <p>5. Remember the ang mo woman who knocked down and killed a Korean woman was able to argue that Singapore street lamps are dim and she could not see the Korean. And the sycophantic Singapore judge actually believed and acquitted her</p>
              <p>6. At last, Singaporeans are not treated like 2nd class citizens.</p>
              <p><br>7. I hope this swiss guy gets hantum, clobbered and whallopped in Changi Prison by his soon-to-be Changi inmates. The inmates just can't wait to get their hands on him and screw him.</p>

              <p>Dun assume that the conviction is final.</p>
              <p>Possible defence:</p>
              <p>- He is carrying the spray paint; the other guy is the culprit who performed the act.</p>
              <p>(Unless there are concrete proof that he commited the act, no one can convict him on the crime. He can only sued for transpassing.)</p>
              <p>(If there are camera on him, he would have been arrested red-handed and not a few days later.)</p>
              <p>- He is not causing harm to any one but performing a mischief.</p>
              <p>- He is a world class artist and imprisoning him would be a lost to the arty farty world.</p>
              <p>- He is suffering from some mental deficiency and is unable to distinguish act of crime from act of mischief.</p>
              <p>- No sign board to inform him that it is a restricted area.</p>
              <p>- It is considered as an art form and it is allowable in his country.</p>
              <p>Final verdict:</p>
              <p>- He will serve a few month jail sentence and paid a hefy fine to serve as a deterrent.</p>
              <p>He will not be caned as the person in charge will be too chicken to handle a mass opposition from the european community living here.</p>
              <p>The media is too navie to think he will get the cane.</p>

              <p>-  We still have other trading partners, eg. d good U.S. of A., and the great imperialistic CHINA, plus the World's fastest growing economy INDIA. By the way Ms India should be Miss Universe 2010 and Miss China Miss Universe 2011.</p>
