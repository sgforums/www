              <p class="art-PostHeader">TEMASEK REVIEW</p>
              <p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-27457" title="mrtgraffiti" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mrtgraffiti.jpg" alt="mrtgraffiti" width="269" height="168">A 33 year old Swiss FT has been arrested by the police for spraying graffiti on a MRT train parked in a depot, a supposedly restricted area.</p>
              <p>It was reported by the Straits Times that the Swiss somehow manage to sneak into the depot at Changi in spite of several barriers such as fences topped with barbed wire.</p>
              <p>He spent several minutes inside the depot spraying graffiti on the carriage of a train before escaping undetected much to the embarrassment of the security officers on duty.</p>
              <p>The security breach was apparently not noticed by MRT officials as the train piled the route for a period of time with the graffiti in full sight of the public.</p>
              <p>It is not known if the Singapore Home Team is responsible for security at the MRT depots.</p>
              <p>A police report was made on 19 May and the culprit was arrested a week later. A netizen shot a video footage of the defaced MRT train and posted it on Youtube <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV4JYKBEQo"><span style="color: #ab6f07;">here</span></a>.</p>
              <p>Under the law, those guilty of vandalism can be fined up to $2,000 or jailed up to three years, and caned between three and eight strokes while those convicted of entering a protected place without permission can receive a maximum punishment of two years’ jail and a $1,000 fine.</p>
              <p>The vandal has not been charged in court yet. Since he is a FT from Switzerland, it is likely that he is let off with only a fine instead of a jail term.</p>
              <p>Under Singapore law, some people are more “equal” than others.</p>

              <h2 class="title">Swiss man faces caning over Singapore graffiti</h2>
              <div class="node">
              <div class="content_wrapper">
              <p>SINGAPORE, Friday 4 June 2010 (AFP) - A Swiss man has been arrested in Singapore on suspicion of breaking into a high-security subway depot and spray-painting graffiti on a train, an offence punishable by caning, police said Friday.</p>
              <p>"We confirm that a 33-year-old Swiss male national has been arrested in relation to the case," a spokesman for the Singapore Police Force told AFP.</p>
              <p>No further details were available pending the investigation into the incident, which took place in May.</p>
              <p>The Swiss embassy in Singapore had no immediate comment.</p>
              <p>Subway operator SMRT said it was helping police with the investigation, but gave no further information.</p>
              <p>The train has been scrubbed clean but a clip on video-sharing site Youtube -- still visible at <a title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV4JYKBEQo" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV4JYKBEQo"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CV4JYKBEQo</span></span></a> -- shows the vandalised train as it left a suburban station.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times newspaper reported Friday that the suspect was believed to have cut his way into the depot, a restricted zone surrounded by fences topped with barbed wire.</p>
              <p>Singapore, a close US ally, considers itself a prime target of Southeast Asian extremists and lists the train system among possible points of attack, along with the airport and US-linked establishments.</p>
              <p>Vandalism is punishable in Singapore by three to eight strokes of the cane as well as jail terms of up to three years and a maximum fine of 2,000 Singapore dollars (1,424 US).</p>
              <p>An American teenager, Michael Fay, garnered global headlines in 1994 when he was jailed and caned in Singapore after he was found guilty of vandalising several cars. Fay was caned despite a US appeal for clemency.</p>

              <p>Goodness me, that is Art, I think singapore govt is a bit too shadow to let people be creative, especially so when you are talking about being the first world. Its beautiful...I guess this swiss guy just want to express himself, and now he really get that full expression from our govt and media.</p>
              <p>As for security, not only MRT security fail to prevent people coming into their depot, but also when the train moved, the supervisor, security personel, drivers also fail to notice the graffi until the public saw it...my goodness!!! what if someone put a bomb below the MRT?? everyday talk so much about looking out for bags, strange people, no eating in MRT, they themselves are so slack...yak!! Sack the whole team....any comment from the transport minister??? quiet quiet again..</p>

              <p>The vandalism is very nice in fact...</p>
              <p>I think Government should use this opportunity to start creativity in people to allow graffiti in MRT train. Didn't Government wants people to be creative and Singapore be a vibrant country? Instead of incentive, they give punishment by this creativity (vandalism still though). </p>

              <p><br>my consultation fees is $30 per minute. but for charity sake, i do it mostly for free here.</p>
              <p>When govt embraced foreigner talents into Singapore, such incident will happen, no doubt about it, the worrying part is that if a normal Swiss artistic expatriate  can go into a depot where most of the MRT train stationed there and do a few minutes of graffiti without a single soul noticing it, I think singapore is looking for trouble, that is to say, it gives terrorism a relook at our Ah pek's security system, might as well plant a few time bombs and we are in big big trouble.</p>
              <p>Even if i have suggestion to it, i will not contribute it, cos we pay millions to ministers to solve and prevent problem, and yet  they want us to think and solve the issue, then they can again shake legs, wine and dine as alway. I will be a real stupid girl if i will to suggest anything to help them. Remember, they scholars with a big pay checks working within a neopotism govt, they should be the one cracking their heads. If not, the citizens of Singapore should sack them once and for all. and vote Angel </p>

              <p class="art-PostHeader">TEMASEK REVIEW</p>
              <div class="art-PostContent">
              <p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-27457" title="mrtgraffiti" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mrtgraffiti.jpg" alt="mrtgraffiti" width="177" height="115"></p>
              <p>The MRT graffiti saga which rocked the entire nation took another twist yesterday when it was revealed that SMRT took more than 48 hours to lodge a police report.</p>
              <p>A Swiss FT was hauled up to Court yesterday for trepassing into a MRT depot at Changi and vandalizing one of the trains by spraying graffiti on one side of the carriage.</p>
              <p>It also transpired that he had an accomplice with him Briton McKoy Banos who has since left Singapore.</p>
              <p>The security breach allegedly took place on 16 May 2010, but a police report was made only on 19 May 2010 which contradicts an official statement by SMRT that it “reported the breach to the police immediately when it was discovered.”</p>
              <p>When queried by the Straits Times, SMRT Head of Security Mr Choy Kin Chong declined to comment on the time lapse, saying that “more security staff had been deployed to increase patrol at its depots.”</p>
              <p>Singapore’s biggest security lapse since the dramatic escape of famed terrorist Mas Selamat Kasteri two years ago drew widespread concerns from both law-makers and Singaporeans who wondered what the consequences might be had the vandals been terrorists instead.</p>
              <p>GPC chairman for Home Affairs and Law, Mr Alvin Yeo was quick to jump to the defence of the Swiss FT:</p>
              <p><em>“MRT trains are potential soft targets. I dare say that the suspects probably did it in the spirit of fun and adventure and not for something more sinister. But this could have been something more harmful than just graffiti,”</em> he was quoted as saying in the Straits Times.</p>
              <p>Netizens were equally flabbergasted at how SMRT could allow the security breach to go unnoticed for so long.</p>
              <p>Eddie Chin commented:</p>
              <p><em>“This is a real security concern. If someone can sneak into an MRT depot and spend a sizeable amount of time spraying the graffiti, he would have enough time to plant bombs on many different trains. I wonder what our Minister for Home Affairs going to say about this, that he’s doing a harmless prank so it’s ok?”</em></p>
              <p>Salihin added:</p>
              <p><em>“Worse of all is that SMRT actually deployed the vandalized train with the huge graffiti. Let’s not ask how they actually secure their depots when their staff cant even notice a huge graffiti on their train.”</em></p>
              <p>There are no immediate comments from the Home Affairs Ministry or its Minister Wong Kan Seng yet.</p>
              <p>Maybe they are keeping a distance as far as possible from the incident out of fears of re-igniting Singaporeans’ memories of Mas Selamat.</p>
