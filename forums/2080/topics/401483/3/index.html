              <p>mancha,</p>
              <p>me thinks he made it clear to all the mujahideens in pakistan,all the terror cells in jermaih ismaiiah and the entire world that it is easy to sneak into a public transport store area in spore for their reign of terror.thanks alot to this swiss man showing them how its done.....i think the magistrate would view it even more serious than michael fay case and a much more severe sentence given to swiss man.remember michael fay did that when 9-11 didnt happen.....people could go in and out of planes lwithout a care....but after 9-11 attack things got real tough and people actually get detained forever for that purpose.</p>
              <p>so next time u take a mrt wiv yer family to orchard for the weekend there would probably be a 5kg bomb strapped directly underneath the oblivious passengers.</p>
              <p>thanks to swiss man,the spore gov will have to upgrade security system yet using more taxpayers and probably cpf money too.spore gov wont like it if explosion planted at some train depot exploded in orchard road derailing it and smashing and demolishing station and ruin transport system for weeks.</p>
              <p>swissman actually in reality made spore more dangerous.</p>

              <p>mrt management were just following orders from top.i believe they wanted it all to be faster cheaper n better a long time ago....cheapskates they may be!!i have notice the mrt trains do bear a similar resemblence to the trains in Moscow underground station as seen from firefox movie back in 1985.so i believe its all cheap old designs they have in spore mrt no doubt its good but i was hoping it could be more luxurious for the $$$ in spore due to million dollar ministers salaries.</p>
              <p>but swissman can forget about switzerland for 5 years at least.</p>

              <p class="art-PostHeader">TEMASEK REVIEW</p>
              <p><strong>Agence France-Presse, 5 June 2010</strong></p>
              <p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-27494" title="oliverfricker" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/oliverfricker.jpg" alt="oliverfricker" width="180" height="238">A Swiss business consultant was charged in court Saturday with breaking into a Singapore metro depot and spray-painting graffiti on a train, for which he could be jailed and whipped with a cane.</p>
              <p>Oliver Fricker, 32, was accused of committing trespass and vandalism in mid-May, and a district judge who described him as a flight risk set bail at 100,000 Singapore dollars (71,000 US). His passport was also impounded.</p>
              <p>A worried-looking Fricker told the judge he needed a lawyer and asked that bail be lowered to 40,000 dollars.</p>
              <p>But the judge cut him short and rejected the bail request, stressing the seriousness of the offence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The official charge sheet said Fricker, who was arrested on May 25, was with a Briton identified as Lloyd Dane Alexander when he broke into the suburban depot, a restricted zone surrounded by fences topped with barbed wire.</p>
              <p>Sources familiar with the case told AFP that Alexander was in Singapore on a tourist visa and left before a police report was filed.</p>
              <p>The charge sheet said Fricker and Alexander vandalised public property when they cut through a fence and spray-painted two carriages.</p>
              <p>A police spokesman described Fricker as a company consultant but further details on him were not available from Singapore officials or Swiss diplomats.</p>
              <p>A man named Oliver Fricker is listed in the business networking website Xing as a senior consultant in Singapore working with a Zurich-based information technology firm specialising in the financial sector.</p>
              <p>Vandalism is punishable by up to three years’ jail or a maximum fine of 2,000 Singapore dollars, plus three to eight strokes of a wooden cane, a punishment dating from British colonial rule.</p>
              <p>An American teenager, Michael Fay, garnered global headlines in 1994 when he was jailed and caned in Singapore after he was found guilty of vandalising several cars. Fay was caned despite a US appeal for clemency.</p>
              <p>Prosecutors in the train vandalism case, arguing for the high bail amount, said Fricker had been due to leave for Switzerland two days after his arrest.</p>
              <p>The break-in, believed to have taken place before dawn on May 17, was not immediately detected and the train plied its route in full view of commuters, one of whom filmed it and posted a clip on video-sharing site Youtube. – AFP</p>

              <p>The complacency displayed by the transport company have assisted the incident and the escape of the accomplice.</p>
              <p>Every one seem to be putting the blame on this swiss guy.</p>
              <p>However, what is the accountability of the company who is to ensure that their train is safe ?</p>

              <p>You can disagree with me and have an alternative view on the security aspect, I don't mind, thats your perogative. Although we agree on one point, and that is a security lapse was exposed. I think thats good, you think not good. OK, never mind about that.</p>
              <p>But you have absolutely no grounds to accuse me of discrimatory practices '<em>based on colour of the skin</em>'.</p>
              <p>That was your own invention and has nothing to do with me.</p>
