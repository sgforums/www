              <p>i'm pretty okay with most of the rolling stock ba....but the original lines like more classic feel to me (i.e. noisy, typical subway trains)</p>

              <p><br>agree with u... why isit like all auto trains (not counting NSL EWL ones as they still have operators) have so much irritating screeching sounds when braking? does the braking mechanism suck that bad?

              <p>That's friction brakes. Dynamic (motor) braking can only do this much.</p>
              <p>Imagine the train goes on emergency brakes. That's 100% frictional braking. The last time a train did that on a platform, I could see smoke rising up.</p>

              <p>Yeah lols... You were right about the GTO/IGBT types. Batches 1 and 2 of the N1000 have GTO-VVVF controllers made by Siemens, 3 to 5 with IGBT-VVVF ones by the same manufacturer and batches 6 onwards (till 8 presently) have them made by Japanese companies, Tokyu Car Corp (car build) and Mitsubishi (electronics) for 8-car, Kawasaki HI and Toyo Denki for 4-car trains (8é€£ãƒ»æ�±æ€¥è»Šè¼›è£½ã�¯ä¸‰è�±é›»æ©Ÿè£½ã€�4é€£ãƒ»å·�å´Žé‡�å·¥æ¥­è£½ã�¯æ�±æ´‹é›»æ©Ÿè£½é€ è£½).</p>
              <p>Sadly didn't take them when I was in Japan, but I pretty liked their older trains though... Been researching on Japanese trains and technology for quite some time... With so much different types, it would not be surprising if I missed out some info...</p>
              <p>The only wonderful stuff about those GTO-VVVF powered ones (N1000) are the 'Powered by SIEMENS' plate on them... Wonderful, only if we can have those on the C651 (or Series 200). Some other GTOs, though slower (difference in gearing) are like the Shinkansen Series 300...</p>
              <p>About emergency brakes, should really watch one video on Nicovideo.jp (need account &gt;&lt;) on the Nagano Railway, max acceleration with wheel slip, highest notch braking and emergency brake at the end of stopping at a station. Man, Japanese do know how to operate trains effectively (although there are lots of 'dark' affairs behind those smooth running...).</p>
              <p>You seem well informed too. Shall contact ya off the forum to talk more... haha</p>

                      pretty liked their older trains though... Been researching on
                      Japanese trains and technology for quite some time...</p>
              <p>The only wonderful stuff about those GTO-VVVF powered ones are
                      the 'Powered by SIEMENS' plate on them... Wonderful, only if we can
                      have those on the C651 (or Series 200). Some other GTOs, though
                      slower (difference in gearing) are like the Shinkansen Series
                      300... Though that one is also a VVVF version. &gt;&lt;</p>

              <p>They probably know this one is going to be big, so they are able to display it proudly. Usually credit goes to the traincar builder, which they do as well for K2100/N1000 (KHI/Tokyu). We're using a pretty early version of it, so the idea of modulation probably hasn't come to their mind yet.</p>
              <p>I presume LTA doesn't have the fancy for builder plates, which might explain for the lack of it. In Taipei Metro, Siemens plates appear on every car.</p>

              <p>Haha not only that... If you have done good research, you would know that JR West is one of those JR companies which treat their staff the worst.</p>
              <p>Make a small mistake (in our terms perhaps, their terms is big) like overshooting by 50 meters or more, late arrival of 1 minute or more (they would use reasons such as passengers not being able to transfer to other trains and cause trouble for them) and face all kinds of punishment like temporary suspension from work and 're-education' (æ—¥å‹¤æ•™è‚²), like one driver had it, those punished stood at the roof (from how it was wrote, I would assume that to be a building's roof) next to Kiyoubashi station (äº¬æ©‹é§…) and shouted to departing trains "ã�”ã��ã‚�ã�†ã�•ã�¾ã�§ã�™ã€‚æ°—ã‚’ä»˜ã�‘ã�¦ä¸‹ã�•ã�„ã€‚"(Thanks for the hard work! Be careful!) for 1 and half hour in the morning, 3 hours in the afternoon (Pg 79, RA2007-3-1 Accident Report). Among these, they will also drill questions and shout loudly at drivers/staff who made mistakes. Often these punishments come with a month of suspension from work and deduction of pay. This was also one of the reasons that shaped the accident on that fateful 25th April... Definitely not a good company to work with if you like a conducive environment. Just think how much stress those folks go through...</p>
              <p>The transport ministry also go deep into every accident and inciden that happens to the public transport companies, and make the reports online for the public to refer to.  Often these are just research materials, but it shows the hard work that people put in to create a almost seamless transport system.</p>
