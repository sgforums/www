              <p><strong>Q1. How does the train behind a train sense the distance and active brake to stop about 1 train length?</strong> It's a system called ATP where a continuous stream of information is sent to and from the train. The track is separated into "blocks" of varying length, marked by the following sign.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.davros.org/rail/signalling/articles/cen-bsm.gif" alt="" width="113" height="139"></p>
              <p>The train will receive via the ATP appropriate Limit/Target speeds, where Limit is the speed the train can travel up to, while Target is the speed the train must target for as the train approaches the next block. The Limit/Target speed pair will take into account preceding trains, and through varying the target speed, will stop the train before the preceding train. </p>
              <p>For more information refer to <a href="http://www.davros.org/rail/signalling/articles/central.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">this article</span></a> of the LU Central Line's ATP system, which is based on the NS/EWL system.</p>
              <p><strong>Q2. When does the train applies emergency brake automatically? Sometime in heavy rain? Approach station at high speed? </strong>Some train operator does that when the have to switch modes between auto, coded manual, or restricted manual. Emergency braking can also occur when the train receives the ATP code of STOP. Of course, there are many other situations where such a application is made.</p>
              <p><strong>Q3. Sometime when the train stop for too long, or the doors opens for a certain amount of time, i can hear a continuous beep from the driver cabin at times. The beep stops only when the driver closes the door. What is the beep for?</strong> I am not certain, but it appears to be something to notify the driver that the timetabled departure time is approaching. </p>
              <p><strong>Q4. Who manages the change of signal light from red to white? Automatic? </strong>It is automatic and linked to a computer system, which can be over-ridden by a trained personnel. </p>
              <p><strong>Q5. Who change the direction of switch on the track at jurong east interchange towards marine bay? Automatic? </strong>Should be computerised. </p>
              <p><strong>Q5. During emergency brake, we often hear train giving out some ?gases and knocking sounds. What is that for?</strong> It is the sound of the air being drained from the equipment, which leads to the application of the physical brakes. </p>
              <p><strong>Q6. What training must the driver goes before becoming a train driver?</strong> Ask SMRT Trains or SBS Transit. :)</p>
              <p><strong>Q7. How does the station knows train will be arriving in X mins? Are there sensors 0n the track? </strong>The "Arriving in" is calculated based in the train's position, which is probably gotten from the signalling system.</p>
              <p>However, the "Departing in" time given at terminal stations are based on pre-scheduled times, as it is impossible predict when the train operator will decide to depart.  </p>
              <p><strong>Q8. Noticed that a blue colour box (at night it will shine a blue colour light) beside the track every 400m or so. What is that for?</strong> Not sure, never got to see it up-close...</p>
              <p><strong>Q9. Why is there stones on a levelled track but not in underground track? </strong>The crushed stones, or rather ballast, is present to facilitate the drainage of water from the tracks, distribute the load from the sleepers, and to prevent the growth of vegetation on the tracks from interfering with the track equipment and trains. The first and last reason I have given is not necessary or of less importance underground, therefore there is no need for the presence of the ballast. </p>

              <p><strong>Q1. How does the train behind a train sense the distance
                  and active brake to stop about 1 train length?</strong> It's a
                  system called ATP where a continuous stream of information is sent
                  to and from the train. The track is separated into "blocks" of
                  varying length, marked by the following sign.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.davros.org/rail/signalling/articles/cen-bsm.gif" alt="" width="113" height="139"></p>
              <p>The train will receive via the ATP appropriate Limit/Target
                  speeds, where Limit is the speed the train can travel up to, while
                  Target is the speed the train must target for as the train
                  approaches the next block. The Limit/Target speed pair will take
                  into account preceding trains, and through varying the target
                  speed, will stop the train before the preceding train. </p>
              <p>For more information refer to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.davros.org/rail/signalling/articles/central.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">this
                  article</span></a> of the LU Central Line's ATP system, which is
                  based on the NS/EWL system.</p>
              <p><strong>Q2. When does the train applies emergency brake
                  automatically? Sometime in heavy rain? Approach station at high
                  speed?</strong> Some train operator does that when the have to
                  switch modes between auto, coded manual, or restricted manual.
                  Emergency braking can also occur when the train receives the ATP
                  code of STOP. Of course, there are many other situations where such
                  a application is made.</p>
              <p><strong>Q3. Sometime when the train stop for too long, or the
                  doors opens for a certain amount of time, i can hear a continuous
                  beep from the driver cabin at times. The beep stops only when the
                  driver closes the door. What is the beep for?</strong> I am not
                  certain, but it appears to be something to notify the driver that
                  the timetabled departure time is approaching. </p>
              <p><strong>Q4. Who manages the change of signal light from red to
                  white? Automatic?</strong> It is automatic and linked to a computer
                  system, which can be over-ridden by a trained personnel. </p>
              <p><strong>Q5. Who change the direction of switch on the track at
                  jurong east interchange towards marine bay? Automatic?</strong> Should be computerised. </p>
              <p><strong>Q5. During emergency brake, we often hear train giving
                  out some ?gases and knocking sounds. What is that for?</strong> It
                  is the sound of the air being drained from the equipment, which
                  leads to the application of the physical brakes. </p>
              <p><strong>Q6. What training must the driver goes before becoming a
                  train driver?</strong> Ask SMRT Trains or SBS Transit. :)</p>
              <p><strong>Q7. How does the station knows train will be arriving in
                  X mins? Are there sensors 0n the track?</strong> The "Arriving in"
                  is calculated based in the train's position, which is probably
                  gotten from the signalling system.</p>
              <p>However, the "Departing in" time given at terminal stations are
                  based on pre-scheduled times, as it is impossible predict when the
                  train operator will decide to depart.  </p>
              <p><strong>Q8. Noticed that a blue colour box (at night it will
                  shine a blue colour light) beside the track every 400m or so. What
                  is that for?</strong> Not sure, never got to see it up-close...</p>
              <p><strong>Q9. Why is there stones on a levelled track but not in
                  underground track?</strong> The crushed stones, or rather ballast,
                  is present to facilitate the drainage of water from the tracks,
                  distribute the load from the sleepers, and to prevent the growth of
                  vegetation on the tracks from interfering with the track equipment
                  and trains. The first and last reason I have given is not necessary
                  or of less importance underground, therefore there is no need for
                  the presence of the ballast. </p>

              <p>You can go to the end of the train (1st door on 1st carriage or the last door on last carriage where the 2 emergency exits are), on the right side. where there is a slot for people to go in one. There is a lock there if u see carefully and SBST train used to put a sticker of no sitting / lean, apparently is due to kids who would love to see the "dungeon" (tunnel).</p>

              <p><br>As our trains do not use straight air pipe system, the correct explanation for question 5 is actually the <strong>release of air from the immediate brake pipe line valve in a manner like the ABS</strong> (Anti-lock Braking System) of a car. The pssh pssh sound is when the air is released from the brake pipe line in a rushed manner. B3 air brake pressure is about 2.8 bar (280 kPa/40.6 PSI), and EMG brake is about 1.0 bar higher than this. Releasing this amount of pressure would generate sounds like that.</p>
              <p>There are two main types of air brake systems, straight air and automatic electric command.</p>
              <p><strong>Straight air</strong> would mean that the brake piping from the reservoir to the brake mechanism is pressurised during normal operations. Normal braking is achieved by adjusting the brake pressure from the brake pipe to the brake mechanism. The reservoir will top up the brake pipe pressure when it drops.

              <p><br> As our trains do not use straight air pipe system, the correct
              explanation for question 5 is actually the <strong>release of air
              from the immediate brake pipe line valve in a manner like
              the ABS</strong> (Anti-lock Braking System) of a car. The pssh pssh
              sound is when the air is released from the brake pipe line in a
              rushed manner. B3 air brake pressure is about 2.8 bar (280 kPa/40.6
              PSI), and EMG brake is about 1.0 bar higher than this. Releasing
              this amount of pressure would generate sounds like that.</p>
              <p>There are two main types of air brake systems, straight air and
              automatic electric command.</p>
              <p><strong>Straight air</strong> would mean that the brake piping
              from the reservoir to the brake mechanism is pressurised during
              normal operations. Normal braking is achieved by adjusting the
              brake pressure from the brake pipe to the brake mechanism. The
              reservoir will top up the brake pipe pressure when it drops. It
              would require mechanical levers to achieve a ABS function, if any.

              <p>You can go to the end of the train (1st door on 1st carriage or the last door on last carriage where the 2 emergency exits are), on the right side. where there is a slot for people to go in one. There is a lock there if u see carefully and SBST train used to put a sticker of no sitting / lean, apparently is due to kids who would love to see the "dungeon" (tunnel).</p>

              <p>However, the "Departing in" time given at terminal stations are
              based on pre-scheduled times, as it is impossible predict when the

              <p>Addon for this, similarly for stations near any terminus, the arrival time above travel time from terminus to current station is predicted by shedule, and thereafter by the sensors.</p>
