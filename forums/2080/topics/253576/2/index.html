            <div class='col-md body'>Taken during my train adventure trip to Hokkaido and all of Japan during December 2005.<br><img src="http://i84.photobucket.com/albums/k7/jetabt767200/Raw_251.jpg"><br>Kiha 40 800 (Kiha, designation of Diesel coach in JR, type 40 800 sub series) number 32 at Engaru station in Hokkaido. Snowfall was about 1-2 metres in the area on that day. Snow in the station is cleared, of course...<br><br><img src="http://i84.photobucket.com/albums/k7/jetabt767200/Raw_260.jpg"><br>The favourite train model that I met in Hokkaido and whole of Japan, the Kiha 54 500 sub series, number 15. This small little train packs a huge power punch, two DMF-13HS diesel units each provides 250PS at 1900rpm and a total of 500 horsepower for something lighter than 40 tons, compared to the Kiha 40's single diesel unit of 220PS at 1600rpm (DML30HSH). The Kiha 40 is also slightly heavier. This model also has a toliet and comfortable seats which can let the pax switch positions by pushing the seat rest onto either side, so seats can face each other or face one direction, commonly the direction of travel. This is a huge difference to cars in KTM, which feature two directions fixed, its jackpot whether you will travel comfortably forward or backward...<br>Number 520 of the fleet though have been scrapped due to an accident on March 1st 2007 when it crashed into a log carrying truck at a crossing, tilted to one side, derailed and slid to a stop (sequence described by witness and  fellow train fan in Hokkaido). 51 passenger and crew were injured in the accident. The train unit was also only the one in the fleet with a flower livery.</div>

Third time too, but the 2005 trip was much longer (a month) and took the entire Japan four islands, went to all terminal stations (Wakkanai-North, Nemuro and Higashi Nemuro-Eastern, Sasebo-Western, Nishi Oyama-South) for JR, and travelled almost 1200km on rails, but I had to reserve tickets for me and my mother also, so how, dunno, then use some basic body language loh, or else, some phrases listen already can learn one...<br>Not to worry, its not as difficult as it seems... (I was only 16 when I went in 2005, lol...) Like I am doing now, study hard and work hard part time, and go travel again one day... With own money this time, lol, no point depending on parents liao, they getting old...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dug up another one from the archives, Kiha 54 514. Shot at Kushiro Station on the Nemuro Main Line (the most eastern JR service line in Japan), on 12/12/2005, 2111hrs.<br><img src="http://i84.photobucket.com/albums/k7/jetabt767200/Raw_306.jpg"><br>ISO100, 1/40 f2.6 at 6mm (digital).<br><br>The train (Kiha 54 522) on the adjacent line is heading to Nemuro, the last train of the day, and will reach Nemuro at 2328hrs, rest overnight at the station and then head back to Kushiro at 0600hrs the next day.<br><br>Nemuro Main Line's operation is one of the most sparsely timetabled in Japan, with only two rapid services (run by same model of train or the Kiha 40) each direction daily, five trains east bound and six trains west bound. There are also two to three short working services on the line, making it not too tourist friendly. However there are also express buses that connect Kushiro and Sapporo to the most eastern town of Japan.<br><br>Very friendly train officer who allowed me to watch the front through the right front window, as in the left window when viewing the picture. Throughout the journey snow builds up until its encrusted on all of the train's non heated parts. Lamp and window areas are heated.<br><br>Some other specs of the train include body length of 20 metres, two diesel units (DMF13HS) of 250PS each and total of 500PS (PS=HP). They came with DT22 bogies, but due to custom conditions, JR Hokkaido designed their own and designated N-DT54, the new bogies were installed 2003-2005, and as a result, the trains can run up to 110km/h, but normal operations require only 95km/h. Many other parts including couplers (Kiha 40s), seats (Shinkansen type 0) and even gearboxes (random compatible parts) were cannibalised from scrapped trains. A true 'rojak' train for parts!</div>
