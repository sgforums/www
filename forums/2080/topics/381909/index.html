              <p>Hello guys. Out of boredom one night early this year (2009), I set out a set of questions on railways in Japan. Posted on several forums, few people answered due to various reasons. Some say they are too hard, some say they have no need to know about it so they are not attempting.</p>
              <p>The reason I would like to post it here is not to reverse those comments. If its really hard, then I admit that I am an asshole. But this is no PSLE Maths nor 'rocket science'. If you find that the questions are really too tough like going to the Moon, the answers will be up after midnight, 1st January 2010. What exact time answers go up will have to depend on when I can get my hands on a computer after New Year party...</p>
              <p>Please answer in English unless otherwise stated. For the benefit of non-Japanese speakers and for everyone to understand. Certain Japanese names/terms are included in brackets but they will not affect the answer.</p>

              <p>Hmm good attempt, but the internet is full of loopholes</p>
              <p>Shall reveal some of the answers.</p>
              <p>8. Morioka and Hachinohe, correct. The line's name is IGR Iwaki Galaxy Railway (in which the short form stands for).</p>
              <p>11. The Tadami Line, SL Ban'etsu Monogatari. October November December 2008.</p>
              <p>14. A little tricky question, but you got it correct. Is this in Wikipedia too? I should avoid these questions next time haha...</p>
              <p>15A. Hmm good, Minami-Otaru was one I missed out. I would prefer to walk from Otaru station and taste some of the unique Udon stores and glass-blowing experience too!</p>
              <p>16 and 17. Good. This two are stuffs that only pre-JR (JNR) fans know good of. An average foreigner or even a Japanese may not know. Railway Fans however have them at the back of their palms.</p>
              <p>24. Double deck car (5000ç³») is JR Shikouku, plus two immediate cars are also their's. The three cars heading Okayama are from JR West, numbered the 223ç³»5000ç•ªå�°.</p>
              <p>25. Correct, or another way to say is using the thousand unit numbering series. Guess its their culture!</p>
              <p>28. 2 hours and 34 minutes (ã�„ã�—ã�¥ã�¡3å�·, 602 --&gt; 836, 13 en-route stops).</p>
              <p>29. Another tricky question.</p>
              <p>30.2 275 kW per motor (MT500K Three-phase Squirrel Cage AC Motor)</p>
              <p>31. Nishi-Oyama (è¥¿å¤§å±±) station.</p>
              <p>32. Urakami (æµ¦ä¸Š) station.</p>
              <p>34. 8620 correct. Wheel arrangement 2-6-0. Japanese configuration 1C. By right this locomotive pre-dates the JNR era, its a Ministry of Railway (é‰„é�“çœ�) vehicle.</p>
              <p>1001: A, the Shinkansen type 1000 (æ–°å¹¹ç·š1000å½¢é›»è»Š). The prototype Shinkansen trains had 2-car and 4-car respectively, with 1001-1002 and 1003-1006 as the car numbers. They were made by several companies including Kisha Seizo, Kawasaki Heavy, Nippon Sharyo, Hitachi and Kinki Sharyo.</p>
              <p>1003. ATC working allows 5 km/h buffer, and on the 5km/h mark the brakes will apply to lower speed down to +5 km/h -10, means if 200 is my cap, I can only go to 204 km/h, and once I hit 205, I will be brought back to 195 km/h. Sanyo Shinkansen has 300 as ATC signal, so the fastest you can actually go to catch-up the time is 304 km/h.</p>
              <p>1004: A5, or 105 km/h on a 10 per mil (/1000) gradient. This value is used in planning diagrams (schedules).</p>
              <p>1005. Another tricky one. Kagoshima station =/=Nishi Kagoshima station (presently Kagoshima-chuo). The fastest way of going to Tokyo from Kagoshima station in year 1993 is taking a local train, one stop, to Nishi-Kagoshima station, change to the Tsubame Ltd Exp to Hakata, then the Nozomi Super Express to Tokyo.</p>
              <p>ATS one everyone got it right haha.</p>
              <p>So I guess this concludes the quiz. Thanks for attempting or answering.</p>
              <p>Next year's may be more challenging!</p>

              <p>about the question about third rail lines under tokyo metro, it's not the hibiya line that runs on 3rd rail</p>
              <p>the hibiya line has thorough service with other railways so it runs on catenary line</p>
              <p>rather, i remember it's the marunouchi line that runs on third rail (both ginza and marunouchi lines do not have thorough service with other railways</p>
              <p>the ginza and marunouchi line resemble singapore's MRT i feel....both lines have 6 car-formation and are third rail</p>
