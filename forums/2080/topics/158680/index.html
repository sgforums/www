            <div class='col-md body'>Also, did you notice that the trackside plates at SMRT stations were replaced, one of them being to warn them not to cross the yellow line and not to go down to tracks.<br><br>Another one, the " Value Life, Act Responsibly.

            <div class='col-md body'>Today, while in JB, near the KTM station (on the overhead bridge), saw a northbound train at about 1900h.<br><br>First came a whistle sound, then some sort of noise like a slow-moving bus --- a YDM4 loco.....and then 4 ASC coaches going out of the station.........slowly...........like a tortoise.<br><br>Even after the train was off the edge of the platform.......its coaches doors are still open........and the train is still moving slowly................................<br><br>Well, so, did anyone noticed that YDM4 are typically slower and noisier than any other class of KTM loco......?<br><br>Even the class25 were faster than the YDM4. (I saw it for myself in JB checkpoint while waiting to get past the immigration, seeing it a 25204 hauling a southbound Ekspres Sinaran Pagi down towards Singapore, at about 10 or more cars length.)<br></div>
