              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singaporeans can expect more temporary closures of 
              segments of the rail network on the North-South and East-West lines in 
              the future.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Transport Minister 
              Lui Tuck Yew said the closures are needed for major works, such as the 
              upgrading of train signalling systems and replacement of the network's 
              older parts.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The authorities 
              would have a better idea of when the shut-downs will take place, and for
               how long, by the year's end, Mr Lui added.<br><br>But moving ahead, commuters will have to get used to temporary closures of some MRT stations for upgrading works.<br><br>"If
               we were to do the upgrading (works) using only the hours available to 
              us now, between the revenue service periods (when the trains are not 
              operating), I think every night you may have at most three-and-a-half or
               so hours ... (that) leaves very, very little time for major upgrading 
              works," Mr Lui said.<br><br>Planned closures of train stations for works
               to be carried out have been done before. In 2010, stations in western 
              Singapore were shut to allow modification works at the Jurong East 
              station to be carried out. This was done over two weekends.<br><br>Mr 
              Lui assured commuters that they will be told well in advance about the 
              planned closures, so that they can make alternative travel arrangements.<br><br>There will also be bus-bridging services along the affected MRT lines during the closures.<br><br>Mr Lui was speaking to residents from the Cheng San-Seletar ward during his visit to the area on Sunday.<br><br>At
               the dialogue with residents, Mr Lui also addressed concerns on the 
              S$1.1 billion government funding to buy buses for SBS Transit and SMRT.<br><br>"If
               you want this enhanced standard but you don't want the government to 
              put in the money, we think that bus fares on average will have to go up 
              by 15 cents and that's quite a lot. Essentially, when we came up with 
              this scheme, the way we were thinking about it is that this is not a 
              subsidy to the operator. It is actually a subsidy to the commuter," said
               Mr Lui.<br><br>On the recent move to raise the age limit for taxi 
              drivers from 73 to 75, Mr Lui said there are no plans to extend it to 
              bus drivers.<br><br>That's because they face a demanding schedule which has to be looked at carefully before any changes are made.<br> <br>Speaking
               on the Committee of Inquiry looking into the major train disruptions on
               the North-South Line in December 2011, Mr Lui said he hopes there's a 
              clear conclusion on what caused the breakdowns and also to take lessons 
              from findings in order to improve how such incidents are managed.<br><br>- CNA/wm/fa</span></span></p>

              <p>2 questions come up to mine</p>
              <p>why does it take now to have major upgrading? shouldnt this be done earlier in smaller phases without major disruption?</p>
              <p>if we are talking about raising fares just for these sort of upgrading, what happened to past fare rise? to whose pocket they landed in?</p>

              <p>The major signalling upgrade has been planned for a while already, and as far as i understand, it will bring finally moving block signalling by SelTrac to the two older lines. This should have been done eons ago!</p>
              <p>The installation can be done during the 3.5hours, but I suppose we are really running out of train capacity so they want to hasten the job to increase train frequency?</p>
              <p>It should not decrease the chances of breakdown due to track or traction power failure, as the trains are still the same old ones.</p>
