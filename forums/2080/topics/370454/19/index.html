            <div class='col-md body'><p>Big jam at Boon Lay towards Pasir Ris today. All trains were running in CM mode, except the C151 (025/026) that I eventually took which had a flashing yellow light (RM?). Got up to the platform, and three trains were in sight: one in front just before Jalan Boon Lay, one stuck at the platform with its doors closed, and another one just exiting the turn into Boon Lay station. The train I took stopped three times: right before the double-crossover, just after Jalan Boon Lay, and before the crossover at Lakeside where it slooooowly entered the station. All happened around 6:25pm.</p></div>

              <p>Major announcement screw-up this morning on a C151 (train was so crowded that I couldn't even identify the trainset number). As I departed Lakeside, the chimes went off twice, and ten seconds later, there was an announcement saying that the next station was Boon Lay along with the STARIS saying so, even though I knew we were travelling eastbound.</p>
              <p>After leaving Chinese Garden, the chimes rang twice again but no announcement came on. Arriving at Jurong East, the chimes rang twice and ten seconds later, "Boon Lay"... and just once. Left Jurong East, a single chime rang, and "Next station, Lakeside" was played. Left Clementi, double-chime again and a single "Lakeside" was played, and then a double-chime and "Next station, Chinese Garden" when the doors were open. The CNG arrival announcement was never played, and halfway on the way to Commonwealth, "Next station, Jurong East Interchange" was played after a single chime without a pause.</p>
              <p>I swear, the STARIS and announcement issues are getting too common.</p>

              <p>Today<br>Time: 4pm<br>Location: EB tracks near TNM</p>
              <p>Happenings/Status:<br>There is a track fault when a EB train leaves TNM... Resulting train to be under RM mode or to come to a full complete stop for 10 mins... Imagine the pax will feel like stuck at a train or think the train sudden causes a breakdown.. Making pax inside the train feel uncomfortable if a train stops stationary halfway..<br><br>Oh yea, there are some technical staff over at the track segment to fix it... They need to troubleshoot that segment.. Trains pass by there stop for no reason... btw, even the tech staff carries a flag for a signal of train needs to stop... <br><br>Results: there are even more trains waiting behind the TNM stn EB side.. While wb side is also moving slowly esp in the morning..</p>

              <p>I have met a the most idiotic person. Well sort of.</p>
              <p>During my Sec 2 assemnbly in the afternoon, I met another Sec 2 boy telling his friend all about trains, which are all wrong.</p>

              <p>M= Nah....That's not the fastest....(On the screen shows a picture of a Shanghai Metro Maglev train)</p>
              <p>H= I am a Train fan.</p>
              <p>M= I am too.</p>
              <p>H= Do you know that SMRT is so stupid to restrict the Alstom Metropolis C751A to only go at 80 km/h when it's top speed is 120 km/h?</p>
              <p>M= The Alstom Metropolis C751A is used on the North East Line, and its operator is SBS Transit.</p>
              <p>H= Oh, I was just testing you (Yeah, my foot)</p>
              <p>M= Do you mean the Kawasaki C751B</p>
              <p>H= Oh? The Kawasaki Heavy Industries C751B? The train that runs on the Circle Line?</p>
              <p>M= No. The Circle Line trains are Alstom Metropolis C830....</p>
              <p>H= Does such a train actually exist? Since you are a train fan, let me test you. What is the name of the white and red train on EWL &amp; NSL?</p>
              <p>M= Siemens C651? Common sense?</p>
              <p>H= No. It is the Bombardier C951.</p>
              <p>M= You utter moron. The Bombardier C951 is DTL's train.</p>
              <p>H= Then do you know the carrying capacity of a C151</p>
              <p>M= Not sure.</p>
              <p>H= 1900.</p>
              <p>M= Then let me ask you. How many bar trains are there in the 66 C151s</p>
              <p>H= em...Let me think...30? of which 20 C151s are unrefurbished as SMRT would like to preserve them.</p>
              <p>M= ALL C151s ARE REFURBISHED! WHAT GENERATION DO YOU LIVE IN? THE 80's?</p>

              <p>H= Oh, I was just testing you (Yeah, my foot)</p>
              <p>M= Do you mean the Kawasaki C751B</p>
              <p>H= Oh? The Kawasaki Heavy Industries C751B? The train that runs on the Circle Line?</p>
              <p>M= No. The Circle Line trains are Alstom Metropolis C830....</p>
              <p>H= Does such a train actually exist? Since you are a train fan, let me test you. What is the name of the white and red train on EWL &amp; NSL?</p>
              <p>M= Siemens C651? Common sense?</p>
              <p>H= No. It is the Bombardier C951.</p>
              <p>M= You utter moron. The Bombardier C951 is DTL's train.</p>
              <p>H= Then do you know the carrying capacity of a C151</p>
              <p>M= Not sure.</p>
              <p>H= 1900.</p>
              <p>M= Then let me ask you. How many bar trains are there in the 66 C151s</p>
              <p>H= em...Let me think...30? of which 20 C151s are unrefurbished as SMRT would like to preserve them.</p>
              <p>M= ALL C151s ARE REFURBISHED! WHAT GENERATION DO YOU LIVE IN? THE 80's?</p>
              <p> </p>
