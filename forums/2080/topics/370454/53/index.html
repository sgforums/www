              <p>I'm trying to support my post, proving to you that my post is
              <strong>VALID</strong> and <strong>NOT</strong> flaming.</p>
              <p>A Train Operator doesn't even give a damn to a graffiti on the
              exterior. But they care about some parts in a way. In the train
              cabin, the walls that separate the passenger and train operator
              area is almost fully sound-proof. About 90%. They can't hear
              whatever announcements that are being played or whatever din they
              are making in the train. </p>
              <p>Look, In the train cabin, all commands are <strong>NOT
              VERBAL</strong> but VISUAL. All commands like even to the simplest
              like "DOORS OPENING" command is also shown. Air Gauge, Air Pressure
              and Speed are all shown. If a motor were too fail, an error would
              show up on the dashboard. </p>
              <p>If a bus has the simplest of an Air-con fault detector and fuel
              gauge. An airplane has speedometer, attitude level and a lot more.
              Why not a train? A train is equally important to any modes of
              transport. It carries thousand's of lives and dollars. </p>
              <p>All trains are given a through check. If one part is overlooked
              like a damaged engine on a plane, it can lead to serious
              consequences like derailment. When a motor fails or what so ever,
              the TO will be alerted by a flashing bulb. </p>
              <p>Look at an ICE cabin, look how every single detail is being
              shown. From the doors mode to the motors condition. From the
              signalling to  the location. </p>
              <p>Each train would have this important features. We are no longer
              living in the past where signalling depended on time. WE now depend
              on technology. </p>

              <p>Well said Interception_7. And to add, over-reliance on technology can leads to one's downfall. If automated train system is all that awesome, why is there a need to have humans to man the system? Did you watch iRobot? That's exactly what happens when humans over-rely on technology.</p>
              <p>And to answer the doubts of those who find that SMRT is discriminating the physically disabled, they are not.</p>
              <p>Why is that so? Here are some of the reasons:</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vision</span></strong></p>
              <p>- TO need to have a clear visual of track side signals, obstacles and signage. <strong>Failure to heed any of these warnings/visuals may result in an accident, which may result in casualties/death.</strong><br>- If vision is impaired, it may result in TO pressing the wrong button at the wrong time. <strong>In the worst case, it may result in casualties/death.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hearing</span></strong></p>
              <p>- As mentioned, TO <strong>needs to have a healthy hearing </strong>to be able to operate a train. For example, TO may not be able to hear what the OCC is trying to say. <strong>If what the OCC is trying to convey to the TO is important and of a certain urgency, if not acted promptly, may results in casualties/death.</strong><br>- Technical faults which are hints to a upcoming mechanical explosion/fire/emergencies. <strong>If TO are unable to hear these sounds, the result of not hearing them may result in casualties/death.<br></strong>- Passengers communication through CEB with the TO. <strong>If TO is unable to catch what the passengers is trying to say, casualties/death may occur.</strong></p>
              <p>So are you able to set your mind to rest while commuting/joy-riding with a person who may not be able to operate a train correctly when emergency-like situation occurs?</p>
              <p>I am not being exaggerating, but being a TO is not just about driving a train. There are of course, many other reasons but the short list I've given should be sufficient for your understanding. <strong>Casualties and death are reasonable enough to explain why the physically disabled are often not allowed to operate trains, let alone an aircraft.</strong></p>
              <p>Lastly on a side note, stop derailling this thread. This is a Train Happenings thread. If you have any queries related to trains/railway related stuffs, kindly post in it's relevant thread. Thank you.</p>

              train correctly when emergency-like situation occurs?</p>
              <p>I am not being exaggerating, but being a TO is not just about
              driving a train. There are of course, many other reasons but the
              short list I've given should be sufficient for your understanding.
              <strong>Casualties and death are reasonable enough to explain why
              the physically disabled are often not allowed to operate trains,
              let alone an aircraft.</strong></p>

              <p>Well said Interception_7. And to add, over-reliance on
              technology can leads to one's downfall. If automated train system
              is all that awesome, why is there a need to have humans to man the
              system? Did you watch iRobot? That's exactly what happens when
              humans over-rely on technology.</p>
              <p>And to answer the doubts of those who find that SMRT is
              discriminating the physically disabled, they are not.</p>
              <p>Why is that so? Here are some of the reasons:</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vision</span></strong></p>
              <p>- TO need to have a clear visual of track side signals,
              obstacles and signage. <strong>Failure to heed any of these
              warnings/visuals may result in an accident, which may result in
              casualties/death.</strong><br> - If vision is impaired, it may result in TO pressing the wrong
              button at the wrong time. <strong>In the worst case, it may result
              in casualties/death.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hearing</span></strong></p>
              <p>- As mentioned, TO <strong>needs to have a healthy
              hearing</strong> to be able to operate a train. For
              example, TO may not be able to hear what the OCC is trying to say.
              <strong>If what the OCC is trying to convey to the TO is important
              and of a certain urgency, if not acted promptly, may results in
              casualties/death.</strong><br> - Technical faults which are hints to a upcoming mechanical
              explosion/fire/emergencies. <strong>If TO are unable to hear these
              sounds, the result of not hearing them may result in
              casualties/death.<br></strong>- Passengers communication through
              CEB with the TO. <strong>If TO is unable to catch what the
              passengers is trying to say, casualties/death may
              occur.</strong></p>
              <p>So are you able to set your mind to rest while
              commuting/joy-riding with a person who may not be able to operate a
              train correctly when emergency-like situation occurs?</p>

              <p>I beg to differ. Yes, whether is it Dragonaxe side or Interception / E5 side, both had try to see things in different prespective. Well, while I agree with what you said on above reason, but dont forget that Din89 uses a <strong>hearing aid.</strong> As I am not a deaf person, neither did I used one such device, therefore unable to comment te effectiveness of such tools but based on various related advertisement, they generally say thanks to XXX hearing aid, I have finally found my hearing back etc. Well, hearing aid is not foul proof also it is not necessary for deaf only but also suitable for people who has poor hearing but not completely deaf, and maybe to me, the cloest thing i could think of is an earpiece. Nobody is asking SMRT / other rail operators to provide these people an hearing aid, but what I am trying to say is that hearing aid are meant to provide and act as an ear drum, and hence it should be comparable to a real and healthy ear drum without deaf issue. So, the above arguments along with Interception does not sound reasonable anymore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, based on your argument, people who wears spectacles / contact lens are also ban from driving car, bus, plane (Not over 500 degree) or train because they got some vision problems and hence they need these stuffs? The answer is definitely no, so why not the same rule applied to hearing aid, as Din89 has used to say he is not completely deaf in his previous post. Please dont say it is stupid to use spectacles / contact lens as counter argument but its all about safety, unless you are trying to say the reason spectales / contact lens are allowed .is because ~73% of SG population and comparable ratio of the populations are wearing either of them and it is kind of "mission impossible" to find people who dont wear spectacles and / or contact lens but medically and educationally qualified to be trained as a driver, TO or pilot.</p>
