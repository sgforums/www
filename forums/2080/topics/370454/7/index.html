              <p>Today</p>
              <p>At around 8.25am, a C151 merely collided with a C751B @ Yishun station (Marina Bay bound). Thanks to the ATC installed at all trains, the C151 didnt colllide with the C751B in front of it, since the C751B was still inside the station, and C151 about to come in. *I was inside the C151 (027/028) and it stopped violently in the middle of the tracks. As i looked outside the window, i was shocked to see that an unidentified C751B was still inside! Every1 onboard the train had the same feeling as mine when i saw that. Lucky there were no accidents. :)</p>
