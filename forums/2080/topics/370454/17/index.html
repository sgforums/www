              <p>That was 2 years ago in March, and I suspect it was a newbie driver then, as he would either underrun alot or overrun alot (of course needing to reverse), making that ride super uncomfortable.</p>

              <p>I was at City Hall station today, going to Dhoby Ghaut. When the
                                      train started moving, within 3 seconds, the 
              train suddenly jerked
                                      very hard and stopped. After that, the train 
              started moving again
                                      also but then also, within another 3 seconds the
               train suddenly
                                      jerked very hardly and stopped.I thought 
              passengers will have to
                                      get out of the train somehow but then the driver
               announced through
                                      the PA system that due to train malfunctions, 
              the train will be
                                      delayed. And the train stopped there for around 5
               minutes before it
                                      started moving normally... My first unusual 
              experience :DDD Scary
                                      at first but fun!</p>

              <p>1. Ok... a case of overrun today.</p>
              <p>093/094 approaches JUR EB at high speed. It seemed to be decelerating rapidly, and when it finally came to a stop, it had overrun by more than a door. Only a few minutes later, did it manage to reverse and open its doors.</p>
              <p>2. Another case of faulty PSD at JUR. The very first door for NSL on the WB platform was faulty. Many CSOs were guarding the area, and they even used cordon tape to block the area when there wasn't a train at the platform.</p>

              <p>Was there some <em>wording</em> misunderstanding? Could it be the CID / the staff asked who else have did <em>such similar acts</em>, and not someone (In this case, you) directing (Or not nicely say, instruct) him / her to take those videos. In this case, it is not called as frame liao, because you took such videos as well. (Under <em>similar act</em> pretext and not <em>who ask / direct / instruct</em> context)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: In any case, that train fan is in fault for saying your name, which he / she should have act dumb and say "I dunno". This is what I said the person is not calm. Must practice more by taking DNBs lah, silly!</p>

              <p>I mean, I acknowledged that I took many train videos, but the officer did ask if I direct the specific person in SGFT to take those videos. Why would I ask him/her to take the videos when I can take them myself? Silly isn't it?</p>

              <p>Actually, I got questioned... seriously. The call lasted for 20 over minutes know? Not just <em>"Friend, you dear friend XX have caught for train videoing, which
              will XXXX consequence, next time better dont do this
              similar XXX........ again."</em>.</p>
              <p>And this person claimed that I was doing a school project and directed him/her to help me take videos, therefore <em>"ask the person who did similar act and not </em><em>direct / instruct" </em>is false. Furthermore, the person also claimed that I asked him to upload those videos at a specific time. Weird isn't it?</p>
