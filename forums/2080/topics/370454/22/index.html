              <p>Exclusive! Today I at Circle Line Bishan, the announcement said "Attention please. Due to train faults in certain sectors, the train service for both directions will be delayed for about 10 minutes." (Note: I intended to record it using TTOS, but the phone only allowed me to record for a minute, which is not enough to cover all 4 languages. Coupled with the hand's uncomfortable due to the speaker are put at a height which I need to raise my hand, I aborted the idea of recording the announcement and thus, the wording might not be the exact one) And the whole Bishan station was cramped by people during the peak hour (Approx 7:30pm)</p>
