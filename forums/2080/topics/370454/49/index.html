              <p>As a train fan, I would like to say that, if you know that you are gonna to hit the time limit soon, then you should try to tailgate and exit, and they will just charge you for Entry without exit, where the admin fee is <strong>$0.70</strong>. Obviously it is not legal to do this intentionally somehow, but it can happen on old faregates (EWL / NSL). NEL, CCL and LRTs? Forget it, it is more risky.</p>

              <p>The scrolling text only displays this once then it is back to
                  normal. It repeats itself everytime it departs a station.. What
                  does the above mean anyways? :S</p>

              <p>Please don't tailgate, you are gonna cause a lot of problems for
              the person behind you. Once someone tailgate in front of me, I paid
              for the person in front. Then it showed error for me. Then i went
              to the station office, THEY DEDUCTED MY FARE AGAIN. Then in the
              end, i paid 2 times =P</p>

              <p>When I tailgate, I try to either:</p>
              <p>1: Nobody is behind me</p>
              <p>2: Try to have the least possible people behind me on crowded stations</p>

              <p>This is because I dont want anybody to pull my collar / bag etc, it is so embrassing.</p>

              <p>Ytd onboard 123/124 from BDL as TRN 211, only 4 lights per car were on then. The rest were off, so its gonna be a very dark experience inside the tunnel. Aircon werent on too. No wonder its damm hot. Then until MRB, the TO realises he 4got to check then train, then decided to switch it on back..</p>
              <p>It was an exclusive experience and STARIS is surprisingly on with no failures</p>

              <p>At abt 1pm, SBS7485P smsed me that Train broke down somewhere along NSL which delayed the SB travelling.. Â I was at YCK when i received this sms. That I took a bus down to AMK to see the situation, I saw an overcrowding situation for ppl trying to leave AMK, causing the faregates to be packed like crazy..</p>
              <p>Then I transfer alot of buses to BSH to see the situation.. Along the way, there are more ppl trying to wait for a cab but the queue was overcrowded as well.. Some ppl even jaywalked to Interchange and pedestrian crossing to int was not allowed then..Â </p>
              <p>Then I reached bsh, i saw 349/350 waiting behind bsh SB.. Then it departed very slow, I tap in to bsh and decided to cancel off my ride when i was inside the stn as train stopped too long.. After leaving BSH for some time, I saw this sight and situation</p>
