              <p>Hahaha,</p>
              <p>One the many uncountable reasons why I rarely film SMRT trains. Too much restriction. Count yourself lucky for not being detained.</p>
              <p>During Mas Selamat's escape, a friend of mine who was recording an express train off Woodlands Rd, got caught by police officers, who thought he intend to pass the clip to terrorist. He got detained for 3hrs before the parents came to clear the mess.</p>
              <p>What an experience.</p>

              <p>And this person claimed that I was doing a school project and

              <p>this is quite fishy..... I think from the context, it looked like use a lie to cover a lie by the train fan, if that were to be the case. Maybe, I suggest, is to create a new thread on how to handle these damn CSOs if such incident happen. Lol!

              <p>Even if you get caught, just say that it's your hobby, problem solved. But to drag someone else in, thats utterly rude, isn't it?</p>

              <p>Yes... Now that the problem is solved, I don't wish to talk about it once more. The purpose of me posting this is to deliver my feelings to this person when he/she reads it. Also I don't want history to repeat itself. Just say it's your hobby, which is 100% true as you're a train enthusiast, not drag someone in and say whoever told you to do this and that...</p>

              <p>I think this idea is great, but to add on we should have a new thread "Is it safe to flim for that day" since like yesterday I saw many "guard" at Raffles Place, City Hall, Paya Lebar (10) and Bedok. So in the end, i did not flim at all. So simple to say, if anybody spotted so many for that day, u should not flim at all and inform everybody thru here or by so others means. What u think?</p>

              <p>This is not called extra trouble. Anyone with some common sense will know to ask permission from station manager / CSO and not the janitor etc. Why, because you all for sure know that janitor does not have the rights to permit or deny.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But are you so sure that the station manager got permission / authority to permit or deny. Sometimes, in pshychologically speaking, when you ask this kind of question, and lucky that they are more passion in trains / people with more sympathy, they may not want to shatter "kiddo's dream" that they allow (When you say allow = take film / video etc) because for sure that they know that we are not one with ill intentions. But can they give permission in the first place? It is not written. By asking them to me is just placebo effect (To make you feel better, when the actual facts is not getting any better). By doing so (Asking station manager / CSO for permission), either they being harsh (Elite and uncaring as defined by me) OR they allow (And they still have to answer to their management, remember, station manager are not ones who write the Rapid Transit Act nor the directors / management of the SMRT / SBST etc railway company), in both ways they are in the <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>losing end</strong></span></em>. This is something that you and some of the guys dont know and ended up in a flame war. I try to keep tone down, but dont teach and /or tell me what to do. I know the limits.</p>

              <p>OOH. I wonder whos the one that did it. I think lets set a rule from now on lah. Like, what the mature bus fans do, they set the rule of not taking photos in the bus interchange. But it is somewhat impossible for us to not film in the station. So 1st rule I think I want to enforce is when anybody ask us why we are filming the train, introduce ourselves as train fans or smth like that. Anybody who wanna change this rule or add in rules can do so :) .</p>

              <p>After all,unlike buses,that stop conviently at bus stops where you can snap away all you want,the only(most likely) place to do what we desire is the station.At this rate...... All I can say is that i feel more of a pest than a human to society.</p>
