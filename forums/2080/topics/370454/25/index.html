The other 2 are another branch line from EW30, a mega station with 2 island platforms, where the middle one has 2 tracks (2 extreme sides are for main line using usual style and the 2 middle tracks are for Tuas South Extension, that links to the remaining 2 of them, using Dover style.).

              <p>The BPLRT should not be scrapped. If you are living near the BPLRT, you would not want it to be scrapped. The BPLRT is quite reliable after Ms Saw Phiak Hwa stepped in and reorganised SMRT. If you want the BPLRT to be scrapped, think about the residents using it everyday.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I shall emphasize on this clearly. No <strong>BPLRT SHOULD NOT BE SCRAPPED </strong>because the residents living around that area need it. If not <strong>IT WOULD BE POINTLESS TO EVEN BUILD THE BPLRT</strong>. I know it's buggy but give the residents a thought. They <strong>ONLY CARE ABOUT SERVICES BUT NOT HOW IT LOOKS SO EVEN IF THE TRAINS LOOK UGLY THEY SHOULD NOT BE SCRAPPED</strong>. No bus services won't be able to replace them because they may not be as fast as trains (no not critisizing buses, but buses stop at stops which scatters all over, while trains only stop at designated stations, which decreases dwell time).</p></div>

              <p>Yup. The Changi Airport system didn't have any bugs since there was only 2 tracks. 1 for each transit and public.</p>
              <p>BPLRT is too =.=" Singapore like using old-school programming. (Ancient ATS system)</p>
              <p>SKLRT and PGLRT? Rode on them before. Pretty smooth, or should I say very? </p>
              <p>Actually the BPLRT look ugly IMO, can see the wheels. Now its like an out-dated model?</p>
              <p>Changi Airport now use er.. It run on one track from T2-T3 but then in the middle of the tracks, it split into two and one side goes on the other side while the other just proceed straight before the tracks switches back.</p>
              <p>BPLRT should just be scrapped. Too unreliable. Its like the same for LUP Upgrading,</p>
              <p>Futuristic Bubble Lifts for a very old flat seems too far off, applies the same to the BPLRT, Its like the buildings in Bukit Panjang LRT is pretty modern but then, the LRT seems to be stuck in a 1990s period, unable to upgrade forever.</p>

              <p>Actually, there is a family of train we can upgrade the CX-100 to - the Bombardier Innovia. Uses same tracks and can run alongside ADtranz/Bombardier CX-100 and ADtranz C-100s.</p>

              <p>I agree with you, Innovia is the successor of CX-100. Designed for sharper turns and faster speed, meaning higher reliability. Rolling stocks play a part in reliability. The Innovia looks more futuristic in design. XD If they really replaces it, I would be 100x surprised</p>

              <p>The reason why last time BPLRT (former SLRT) encountered many technical difficulties and problems, lies within the management and the signalling system itself.</p>
              <p>When opened in 1999, it was running separately on their own, although SMRT was (and still is its paymaster).</p>
              <p>They were run with most of their employees, inexperienced, which has resulted in numerous breakdowns in service. One of the mistakes in Human Resources, I must say.</p>
              <p>The current CEO of SMRT (2003/2004) decided to reorganise SLRT (BPLRT) and upgrade it's GEALOC signalling system and put in experienced workers from SMRT to manage it's operation.</p>

              <p>I shall emphasize on this clearly. No <strong>BPLRT SHOULD NOT BE SCRAPPED</strong> because the residents living around that area need it. If not <strong>IT WOULD BE POINTLESS TO EVEN BUILD THE BPLRT</strong>. I know it's buggy but give the residents a thought. They <strong>ONLY CARE ABOUT SERVICES BUT NOT HOW IT LOOKS SO EVEN IF THE TRAINS LOOK UGLY THEY SHOULD NOT BE SCRAPPED</strong>. No bus services won't be able to replace them because they may not be as fast as trains (no not critisizing buses, but buses stop at stops which scatters all over, while trains only stop at designated stations, which decreases dwell time).</p>

              <p>they will never scrap it. otherwise, Bukit Panjang MRT station totally no rail link to red line already(even though i hope it can eventually extend to link to a red line station!).</p>
              <p>and, it is not like the old sentosa monorail, so impossible to be scrapped. but i think BPLRT is quite slow...</p>

              <p>Cool Innovia. I thought that they cant refurb the train, and so the BPLRT will have to scrap at some point of time (And rebuild it), given the consideration on more users would prefer the BPJ MRT station and BPJ LRT station can be interchange, and seriously, the Ten Mile Junction was known that the URA attempted to "sell the piece of land" (In CNA report), but the tender price was too low for URA to accept, and hence it is still like that. I believe, if TMJ were to re-develop, it would have to demolish the entire building to build a condo - shopping centre style like AMK Hub or Sengkang Compass Point.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hence, after saying so much, I believe the BPJ LRT will be scrapped, but it will be replaced, and hopefully the station alignments will be changed to suit the BPJ MRT station.</p>
