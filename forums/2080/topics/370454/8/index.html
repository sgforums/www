              <p>3327's VPIS fully working. Only for that car and westbound though.... It scrolled the Station, Next Stop and Doors Closing. Not sure about interchange announcements as it did not play any announcements (other than the doors closing) the 2nd time we see it.....</p>

              <p>Didn't post this, but here it is. (This happened few days back.)</p>
              <p>Train 325/326 had messed up annoucements after leaving Yew Tee station. When it reached Choa Chu Kang, it said "Ding dong...Yew Tee....Yew Tee..." then the driver said "Choa Chu Kang...Choa Chu Kang". Don't know about the whole of the line, might have been messed up for the whole journey. And yea, there are some confused people about the announcements...Hahaha lol</p>
