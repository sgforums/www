              <p>Just to add on, while my Set 25 reached Dakota, the RATIS seemed resumed, to my horror, it states as "Do not board", but no announcements was made. So while I was ready to snap it, it changed to "Dhoby Ghaut" and since then, everything resumed. (So in future, do take DNBs <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png">)</p>

              <p>No videos by me, due to lack of proper device, and asking me to remove it is = impossible. Afterall , no one (Staff) cares.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>EDIT: The reason behind for not willing to remove the image is because, I have no videos and I need something to proof its existence. And it is true that I photoed in front of a staff, but he did not care about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just a question, why cant the staff wait until all crowds had been cleared before operating the train in CBTC mode, so that it can prevent unwanted kiapping incident and claming these trains are automated train and they could do nothing (They can ask passengers who are blocking the TO cabin to leave and unlock the cover and operate it in CM mah....!!!)</p>

              <p>I enquired the situation with the station manager at Clementi today and he actually said that he didn't think that it would be a big deal if I took video footage of a train or station and posted it on the internet. After all, it's not like terrorists can't just go on a train or station and observe it if they can't just get on YouTube and watch a video of it. It's just a pointless exercise to stop us from taking videos and personally I don't quite see how it will enhance security from terrorism.</p>
              <p>But he did mention not to take things that we normally wouldn't see often, for example, a view inside the driver's cab.</p>

              <p>He had enquired about this matter, and the staff mentioned not to post pics of sensitive photos, eg in the driver's cab. And IMO, you could, in a way be helping terrorists if they were to save your pics and study them (the cab, and its controls).</p>

              <p>I understand that your intentions are very harmless, but due to security reasons, I am apologetic that I will not restore the last image. I hope to have your understanding in this matter. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Exclusive! Today EWL at Evening seemed to have a track fault in
              Joo Koon direction. Unfortunately, I have tapped out in Bugis
              station to hear such announcement. The delay was mentioned to be
              about 10 minutes. I suspect the involved train is 225 / 226.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I only heard the announcement once or twice........</p>

              <p>There is no peak hour train on weekends. It is a direct swop of trains. One train rest than take over the other.</p>

              <p>But before doors are closing there is a chime first as warning, while NEL's doors closing has no chime before it. so once pple hear the chime they should take it as doors are definitely closing immed, unlike EW/NS line there are drivers who can still wait or reopen the doors but CCL not possible. however, smrt can adjust the time accordingly</p>
