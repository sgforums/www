              <p>Today around 12+, West-bound towards JKN, I took this Siemens train to Dover from Tampines. All went well, except that at Dover it overran wtf~... It went on CM from City Hall all the way to Dover, didn't know why.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ZOMG but luckily the train driver managed to reverse it, albeit with very abrupt jerks.</p>

              <p>You're lucky enough...</p>
              <p>If the train overshot the station, and has entered the next block (section), the train is unable to reverse but it has to make its way to the next station... UNLESS, the OCC approved the train to be reversed.. But usually they will have to make its way to the next station.. hahaha..</p>

              <p>There was a train parked beyond the track of Pasir Ris Platform
              A, which was 049/050 when I passed by it and saw it while on
              service 3. It was there since near noon, and at 5.30pm it was still
              there. As a result, all trains entering Platform A had to stop
              before entering the strn, and shift to RM mode before
              slowly pulling into the stn.</p>

              <p>I dont think so. There should be no crossover between Bunoa Vista and Clementi IF I am not wrong. (It used to be that Clementi is the next station of Buona Vista until 2001 where Dover was added)</p>

              <p>Today while filming the bee train departing Jurong East, a group of security officers approached my also. Then, they asked me what i as doing and i said "testing my camera". After that, one of them browsed through my pics in the camera then asked if this was my hobby (seeing many pics of trains and buses) and i replied with "ya". After that, he told me cannot upload to the internet and cannot take pics of like cameras, escalators etc in stns but i think what i took was fine. Good thing he didnt take down my particulars nor ask me to delete anything, which was what i was grateful about.</p>

              <p>Last time, I still remember, it was raining heavily and under CM(West-bound). Then the driver was like overrunning practically every stop from Tanah Merah to Paya Lebar. Luckily it was off peak and freq was 6 min at that time. That was about 3 years ago.</p>
