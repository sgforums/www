              <p><br> He did not get his job is due to hearing issues (Was it deaf
              <strong>without</strong> hearing aids?) and not he did not study
              well. To become a BC / SL, all you need for now is a Secondary 2
              Education and a driving license (Class 3 / 4 or equivalent Malaysia
              driving license which is D / E) with at least one year of driving
              experience (Meaning, you will never see a probation plate on SBS /
              SMRT buses even this is his / her first day of the job.) From
              there, we can guess to become a TO / CSO, all you need is a
              Secondary education or <strong>maybe</strong> ITE in electronics
              since trains contains more electronical device or equivalent higher
              learning qualifications (Teritary) and <strong>maybe</strong> Class
              3 or equivalent license (Why maybe is because there is link and no
              link between driving a car / bus and a train. The link is the
              knowledge of controlling a vehicle and safety awareness while the
              no link is there is no way of comparison between the operation of a
              car / bus and a train, including one uses hand to acclerate / brake
              a train via the notches but uses right foot to acclerate / brake a
              car / bus).</p>

              <p>Just now around 2.30pm++ 099/100 bearing the TRN of 89 was parked on the middle track of WDL station. Overheard some CSOs with the vest saying the motor was smoking.. I took a train and went to peep at the train. Saw a few mechanics inspecting the bogie closer to 3100 on 2100 (the side where you will usually see when a train pulls into a station with an island platform).After that i took another train again and i saw a 'silvery frosted looking' bogie.</p>

              <p>Why do you say a TO no need to listen?</p>
              <p>Imagine if new information is to be broadcast, he needs to listen clearly. What if there is an "explosion" on the traction motors?</p>
              <p>A TO doesn't mean he only drives the train. Yes, technicians are the one maintaining the train, but if no one complain = technician also don't know the fault.</p>
              <p>TO also needs to listen to sounds that are awkward or rarely heard. Who knows one of this sounds can lead to a disaster, such as an "explosion" on a traction motor?</p>

              <p>I'm trying to support my post, proving to you that my post is <strong>VALID </strong>and <strong>NOT </strong>flaming.</p>
              <p>A Train Operator doesn't even give a damn to a graffiti on the exterior. But they care about some parts in a way. In the train cabin, the walls that separate the passenger and train operator area is almost fully sound-proof. About 90%. They can't hear whatever announcements that are being played or whatever din they are making in the train. </p>
              <p>Look, In the train cabin, all commands are<strong> NOT VERBAL </strong>but VISUAL. All commands like even to the simplest like "DOORS OPENING" command is also shown. Air Gauge, Air Pressure and Speed are all shown. If a motor were too fail, an error would show up on the dashboard. </p>
              <p>If a bus has the simplest of an Air-con fault detector and fuel gauge. An airplane has speedometer, attitude level and a lot more. Why not a train? A train is equally important to any modes of transport. It carries thousand's of lives and dollars. </p>
              <p>All trains are given a through check. If one part is overlooked like a damaged engine on a plane, it can lead to serious consequences like derailment. When a motor fails or what so ever, the TO will be alerted by a flashing bulb. </p>
              <p>Look at an ICE cabin, look how every single detail is being shown. From the doors mode to the motors condition. From the signalling to  the location. </p>
              <p>Each train would have this important features. We are no longer living in the past where signalling depended on time. WE now depend on technology. </p>
