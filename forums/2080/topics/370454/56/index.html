              <p>Dear Mr "Smart Guys",</p>
              <p>Let me try to solve this matter for you all.</p>
              <p><strong>SBS9231S </strong>- He's just posting to let everyone know, so if you have nothing better to post, take it as if he just wants to share with others this <em>interesting</em> fact, though you think it's <em>not interesting at all</em>.</p>
              <p><strong>Veyron16.4 </strong>- I don't tolerate your attitude in this post. You could've just posted "oh... I didn't know that... thanks for that..." and end the matter, but no, you escalated the problem to a higher level - a level which you used vulgarities and starting to swear at people!</p>
              <p>Although you've seen only one train with this, doesn't mean other trains don't. I've seen 201/202 and 233/234 having this before.</p>
              <p>One thing that I cannot stand and absolutely don't tolerate - YOU DRAGGING SOMEONE ELSE INTO THE MATTER! Although SBS9231S only meant 'train fans' in general, DO NOT DRAG A SPECIFIC MEMBER INTO THIS MATTER, IN THIS INSTANCE, USER "jcqh"!</p>
              <p>I know it's your first time seeing this, it's okay to post something like that as a 'special', but you shouldn't transform the matter into a nightmare on SGF!</p>
              <p>So please, stop your actions now or I'm going to take actions against you both.</p>
