              <p><br>yes. the bell chime was nice and used for many years. i think it was first used in the C751 trains when they started service. ya, i also feel its kindof wasted, was expecting it to be used on the CCL trains as well </p>
              <p>why did they change it? isit because this woman wasnt there to record the announcements for the new BLE stations and the circle line? but even so they shouldnt have replaced the chime.</p>
              <p>it seems like alot of people prefer the previous voice. and i agree the new ones some of the stations she pronounce it a bit strangely.</p>
