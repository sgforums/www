              <p>SCORES of morning rush-hour commuters were stranded after service 
              between Serangoon and Hougang stations on the North-East Line was 
              disrupted on Wednesday morning.</p>
              <p>Passengers were informed that the train service was down at about 
              9am. Some passengers complained about indefinte delays.</p>
              <p>Ms Leya Lee, who was at Sengkang MRT station at 8.53am, said
               the platform was packed with commuters. When train service still had 
              not resumed by 9.10am, Ms Lee decided to take alternative transport. She
               added that the queues for cabs and bus service 80, which travels to 
              Harbourfront, were very long.</p>
              <p>Another commuter, Mr Tang Yucai, who was travelling from 
              Outram to Serangoon, said the train he was on had stopped for about five
               minutes at each station. At Little India station, he and other 
              commuters on board were told to disembark and find alternative 
              transport.</p>
              <p>Train service has resumed but is still slow, said some 
              commuters.</p>
              <p>Responding to media queries, Ms Tammy Tan, Senior Vice 
              President, Corporate Communications, of SBS Transit, said in a 
              statement: 'At 8.25am this morning, service on the NEL was affected due 
              to technical faults with the signalling and communication systems.</p>
              <p>Service was temporarily disrupted for about 26 minutes 
              between Serangoon and Hougang stations. As a result, train service at 
              the other stations slowed down considerably. We deeply apologise to all 
              affected commuters for the inconvenience caused.'</p>

              <p>Even for trains, they are pulling from the depots as well. I think is the lack of drivers to drive it, which can simply means calling the staffs from other shifts to drive as well, by giving them OTs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And I dont see a need to keep spare buses just for  rotational maintenance
                  cycle bcoz I saw nothing on the bus depots, apart of bue parking there motionlessly.</p>
