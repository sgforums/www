In addition, a new platform would be constructed to serve the southbound train service, leaving the existing platform for serving northbound trains only. This would ease congestion at the current platform. The A&amp;A works are expected to be completed by end 2008.<br><br>Once again, thank you for your feedback.<br><br>Yours sincerely, </blockquote></div>
