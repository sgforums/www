It is almost impossible to get into a cabin by the time the trains reach Boon Keng Station.<br>At Farrer Park and Little India, only those who dared to push themselves (and others) can get aboard. The journey is extremely uncomfortable for everyone.<br><br>The seven minutes-a-train schedule was set when the flats in Punggol and Seng Kang were not filled, and when the country had a smaller population. Now, there are more people living in Punggol and Seng Kang - in fact, everywhere on our tiny island, contributing to our economy and making it 'vibrant'. Unfortunately, a more vibrant Singapore is also a more crowded one.<br><br>Before SBS Transit starts comparing our trains to Tokyo's, may I repeat the point a Singaporean who had lived in Tokyo made a couple of years ago when the crowded-trains problem was brought up: Our standard of personal hygiene is not on par with the Japanese's. In addition, our humid climate makes us perspire and smell. It is no fun being pressed against bodies wet with perspiration and body odour early in the morning.<br><br>I hope SBS Transit will look into increasing the frequency of trains during the morning peak hours. If this is not possible, perhaps it could do what the Japanese did: designate a few carriages for women.<br><br>Kuah Kar Yoke (Ms)<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/Story/STIStory_177703.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/Story/STIStory_177703.html</a><br><br>Looking at the comments stemed from this article...<br><br>#1:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>There have been a number of letters written about the inconvenient frequency of trains. I wonder what the MRT CEO is still waiting for. Do we have to bring in UPS or FedEx to manage our MRT?<br></span><br><br>My thoughts: How short do you want?

This train encountered problems and stopped suddenly between two stations.<br><br>After a while, attempts were made for it to move, but they resulted in multiple jerks which sent some passengers who were standing colliding into others if they had not managed to get hold of any of the grab bars. The train had to move slowly until we reached our destination. The alignment of the doors was not accurate, so we had to wait before we could alight.<br><br>The train inched forward so that they would align. The inner doors finally opened, leaving the outer one along the platform still closed. When it did open, we began to walk through it, only to have it close on us. My friend was uninjured, but it left me with grazes on my right arm as well as grease on my palms.<br><br>I was rather disappointed at the level of safety as it had not been my first time seeing such incidents happening, resulting in injury.<br><br>On Oct 27 at around 2pm, I was at the City Hall station, waiting along the East West Line when a crowd rushed into the already-packed train. An elderly woman was one of the last few attempting to board the train, believing that the crowds would eventually ease into the middle of the train, leaving enough space for her.<br><br>Suddenly, the doors closed on her, resulting in the woman being stuck between the doors. Being in her 70s at least, she was unable to struggle free. A few women who had been nearby, including a woman in her 30s who was accompanying the elderly woman, tried our best to pull open the doors to free her, but to no avail. Without the help of a man to pull open the doors, the consequences would have had been disastrous if the train had moved with the elderly lady still remaining there. Yet, the undeniable fact is that the elderly lady would have suffered shock from this incident. There had either been no sensors to open the doors when people get stuck in-between it or they had been faulty.<br><br>I feel that more measures should be taken to ensure the safety of the public when we travel on these trains. The problem of the doors places many who take the trains every day in risk of injury. Would the authorities look into this matter?<br><br>Elaine Wee (Miss)<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/Online%2BStory/STIStory_177485.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/Online%2BStory/STIStory_177485.html</a><br><br>Firstly, I don't think SMRT controls the NEL.<br><br>Secondly, who asked you not to hold the grab-bars? They are there for a reason.<br><br>Thirdly, the train will not move off if the PSDs are not closed. It's a safety measure.<br><br>Lastly, there is a emergency stop plunger at the platform of the station.</div>

Yet little has been done to improve the situation.<br>We have only seen increasing costs in public transportation over the years that did not translate into a more expedient mode of travel for commuters. Singapore prides itself as one of the developed countries in Asia, yet if you visit other countries like Hong Kong and Taiwan, you will notice how badly we have trailed behind in the following areas:<br><br>MRT - The waiting time during peak and non-peak hours in both Taiwan and Hong Kong is significantly shorter than that of Singapore. Also, for visitors who do not have a stored value card, they are not charged the extra deposit for the ticket. I had a friend who visited Singapore recently and he did not realise that he could obtain a refund at the ticketing machines at the end of the trip.<br><br>Buses - We probably have one of the most convoluted bus routes. With SBS combining many of the routes many years ago, today it is not unusual for you to take three buses to get around housing estates. Valuable time is lost in waiting at the interchange stations.<br><br>Taxis - This is one of the biggest nightmares for any business visitor or tourist. Many of my Taiwanese and Hong Kong co-workers have told me about how difficult it is to hail a taxi in Singapore during peak hours. In these two countries, even during the peak hours, you could easily flag down a taxi in their central business districts. There are no confusing additional surcharges in terms of peak hour, CBD zonal or ERP charges.<br><br>For those of us who live here, even if we know the phone numbers to call for a cab, our efforts to get a cab are usually futile at specific hours in the night. Imagine the number of business visitors or tourists waiting forlornly for a cab at some taxi stand during these hours.<br><br>Really, for us to improve as a city known for its high standard of living, a tourist destination and a major financial centre, we should benchmark ourselves against the countries known for their public transportation. Many cities in Asia already outpaced us in that area and we should not lose sight of our declining competitiveness in public transportation.<br><br>Ow Seng Fong<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/Online%2BStory/STIStory_177490.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/Online%2BStory/STIStory_177490.html</a><br><br>Let's not talk about taxis...<br><br>MRT: I'm asking again, how short do you want? If you want more trains, pay money for more equipment, more electricity and more maintenence. As for the $1 deposit, it's written so bloody clearly on the GTM that you can get your $1 deposit after reaching your destination, either you forgot or you didn't see it. Don't so bloody assume that SMRT is at fault.<br><br>Bus: If you think bus routes are so complicated, go buy a car, helicopter, rocket or limosuine. Don't come here and bark like as if you own SBST.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess we have to be quite appreciative at times. Of course the frequency cannot be world class, but for Sg its like so much for that we pay for.<br>I don't know what happened here and in the bus forum for the past week, but I think at times it can be frustrating for the passengers to wait for too long. Lets say if off peak frequencies are like five minutes per train, would you agree to it?<br>Tokyo's Ginza line (most busy line in Tokyo) has peak frequency of one minute and half, and thats one timing we can head towards for peak hours, and we are running on auto systems for pleasant days (SMRT) while they are running manual operations...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I fully agree about the trains at Boon Keng... Even when I board at Hougang, the trains are rather packed. Having to wait for 6 mins for the next train, then 6 mins again for the next train, and wait again..., doesn't help (at Boon Keng) because it will be just as packed.<br><br>If you see the Metro at Paris, the trains comes at 2 mins interval. At peak hours, the 2 mins trains are still as packed, but not as packed to the point at Boon Keng where people cannot get on.<br><br>If you think carefully, bus routes were changed to make people take NEL. What happens now? People are forced to take only NEL because there are no longer any choice for them to choose to take a bus instead.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that people here might be expecting a lot since they are used to it. These people need a working vacation to other countries. While RpaidKL does an okay job with its train lines, let them try taking a line which is over capacity by 40% and has trains less than 50% the size of our MRT. When I was working there, there were times I needed to wait for 4 trains to pass before being able to board.<br><br>Singapore's transport services are good. They should appreciate what they have rather than finding fault with every single thing there is to nit-pick at. Granted, every system has things which can be improved on.<br><br>SMRT's peak-hour frequency is good at 1 to 2 minutes on the EWL. However, this is needed as by the time an eastbound train comes to Clementi, its quite packed with hardly any room to board unless people get off. To compare that to NEL, where it only seems to be impossible to board at Potong Pasir onwards, that's not that bad. At least Dover station opens on the side which is rarely used which helps with the traffic flow on board the train.<br><br>If more stations were built like Dover and Braddell, I think the flow of passengers might be better. With an island platform at each station, everyone crowds around the set of doors that will open.<br><br>I do think, however, that NEL frequencies would do better to be improved. Maybe for a start from 6 minutes to 4 at peak hours and gradually lowering it down to 3 or even 3 minutes. The system is capable of such as a family friend did say that LTA/SBS has tested the system at 2 minute frequencies. RapidKL operates their automated line at 90 second frequencies at times during peak hours.<br><br>Interior design has room for improvement on future rolling stock. I'm glad the new refurbished Rotem trains have a better design with the straps lining both rows of seats allowing at least two rows of people to hold onto something. Compared to the newest Kinki-Sharyo cars (the original Black rolling stock), they only have 6 straps in the middle of a row of seats. The older lines had at least 12. Having additional straps and poles does help when the trains are crowded.<br><br>A possibility to reducing crowds on lines in the future would be to build parallel lines as in New York. However, I don't think it is economically feasible for the moment. Hopefully the circle line helps when it opens, but for peak hours, I doubt it will as most people are headed to the CBD which the circle line orbits around and only enters once instead of cutting across it like the radial lines.</div>
