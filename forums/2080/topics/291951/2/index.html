These people need a working vacation to other countries. While RpaidKL does an okay job with its train lines, let them try taking a line which is over capacity by 40% and has trains less than 50% the size of our MRT. When I was working there, there were times I needed to wait for 4 trains to pass before being able to board.<br><br>Singapore's transport services are good. They should appreciate what they have rather than finding fault with every single thing there is to nit-pick at. Granted, every system has things which can be improved on.<br><br>SMRT's peak-hour frequency is good at 1 to 2 minutes on the EWL. However, this is needed as by the time an eastbound train comes to Clementi, its quite packed with hardly any room to board unless people get off. To compare that to NEL, where it only seems to be impossible to board at Potong Pasir onwards, that's not that bad. At least Dover station opens on the side which is rarely used which helps with the traffic flow on board the train.<br><br>If more stations were built like Dover and Braddell, I think the flow of passengers might be better. With an island platform at each station, everyone crowds around the set of doors that will open.<br><br>I do think, however, that NEL frequencies would do better to be improved. Maybe for a start from 6 minutes to 4 at peak hours and gradually lowering it down to 3 or even 3 minutes. The system is capable of such as a family friend did say that LTA/SBS has tested the system at 2 minute frequencies. RapidKL operates their automated line at 90 second frequencies at times during peak hours.<br><br>Interior design has room for improvement on future rolling stock. I'm glad the new refurbished Rotem trains have a better design with the straps lining both rows of seats allowing at least two rows of people to hold onto something. Compared to the newest Kinki-Sharyo cars (the original Black rolling stock), they only have 6 straps in the middle of a row of seats. The older lines had at least 12. Having additional straps and poles does help when the trains are crowded.<br><br>A possibility to reducing crowds on lines in the future would be to build parallel lines as in New York. However, I don't think it is economically feasible for the moment. Hopefully the circle line helps when it opens, but for peak hours, I doubt it will as most people are headed to the CBD which the circle line orbits around and only enters once instead of cutting across it like the radial lines.</div></blockquote>actually EWL at least from pasir ris to boonlay, the frequency during peak is more like 3-4 mins. not 1-2, this is from experience taking the trains....</div>
