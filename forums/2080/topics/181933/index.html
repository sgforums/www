            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Boon Lay MRT extension to have two stations</strong><br><br>The Boon Lay MRT extension, which is scheduled to be completed by 2009, will have two MRT stations.<br><br>They will be located at Jurong West Street 63 and at Joo Koon Circle.<br><br>The names of the stations were revealed by Minister of State for Transport Mrs Lim Hwee Hua at the commencement of works for the $436 million extension.<br><br>They are Pioneer Station and Joo Koon Station.<br><br>Mrs Lim noted that the stations will be elderly-friendly, offering barrier-free access not just to the wheelchair users but also to the visually impaired.<br><br>The new extension will add 3.8 kilometres to the East-West line and travel time to the Jurong Industrial Estate is expected to be cut down by 15 minutes.<br><br>A bus journey now from the Boon Lay MRT station to the Jurong Industrial Estate takes between 45 minutes to an hour during peak periods.<br><br>Mrs Lim said this improvement would make it easier for employers in that area to attract and retain workers.<br><br>Elaborating on the decision to go ahead with the Boon Lay MRT extension, Mrs Lim explained, "Currently, Jurong West is served by two MRT stations - Lakeside and Boon Lay. Residents in this area and those working in the Jurong Industrial Estate are also served by the very busy Boon Lay bus interchange.<br><br>"Those of you who use the MRT or bus interchange during the morning and evening peak hours will definitely agree with me that you can feel the pulse and energy of the community just by looking at the throngs of commuters going through them.<br><br>"This congested situation is something that both the Ministry and LTA are aware of, and have in fact been monitoring for some years already." - CNA<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/197268/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/197268/1/.html</a></div>
