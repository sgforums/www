              <h1 class="clr">66 dead in China train collision: state media</h1>
              <p>BEIJING (AFP) - - Sixty-six people were killed and nearly 250 injured
              early Monday when a passenger train from Beijing careered off the rails
              and slammed into another train in eastern China, state media reported.</p>
              <p>The train was travelling to Qingdao -- the coastal city that will
              host the Olympic sailing competition in August -- when it derailed,
              causing the other train to leave the tracks too.</p>
              <p>The accident,
              the worst in China in more than a decade, happened in the city of Zibo
              in Shandong province, state-run Xinhua news agency said.</p>
              <p>State-run
              TV reported 66 killed in the accident. Xinhua said 57 had died
              immediately in the pre-dawn accident, while three others died in
              hospitals later.</p>
              <p>Out of 247 injured, four were French nationals, Xinhua said, without identifying the four.</p>
              <p>Witnesses
              said many passengers were able to climb out of the wrecked train
              carriages shortly afterwards, some wrapped up in bed sheets from the
              sleeper cars to guard against the early morning chill.</p>
              <p>"I think dozens were injured or killed," a doctor told Xinhua earlier.</p>
              <p>"We have received around 40 injured passengers but nobody died," a nurse at one of Zibo's hospitals told AFP.</p>
              <p>"Some of them are seriously injured, some slightly injured. Their injuries are external."</p>
              <p>Nurses
              at the accident and emergency departments of two other hospitals in the
              area said they were also counting the injured but that no one had died,
              and there were no critical injuries.</p>
              <p>The accident happened at 4:43 am (2043 GMT Sunday), Xinhua said, quoting a spokesman from the Shandong provincial government.</p>
              <p>The other train was on its way to Xuzhou in the eastern Jiangsu province, from Shandong's Yantai.</p>
              <p>About 10 carriages crashed into a ditch after the train derailed, a witness told Xinhua.</p>
              <p>A
              photo of the crash, posted on a popular Internet news web portal,
              showed people wrapped in white blankets sitting by the train wreckage.</p>
              <p>Railway
              Minister Liu Zhijun has arrived at the scene of to oversee rescue
              efforts, Xinhua said, where he demanded an investigation to prevent
              this type of incident happening again.</p>
              <p>The accident has disrupted traffic on a major rail route linking Jinan, the capital of Shandong, to Qingdao.</p>
              <p>In January, a high-speed train ploughed into a group of railway workers in Shandong province, killing 18 people.</p>
              <p>The
              Chinese government said earlier this year that 101,480 people died in
              2007 in more than 500,000 transport, industrial and other accidents.</p>
              <p>It
              said the number of rail accident deaths fell 45 percent, or 2,595, but
              did not provide an absolute figure. However, data suggest the number of
              train deaths last year was about 3,170.</p>
              <p>In one of the worst rail
              accidents in recent times, 126 people were killed and more than 200
              injured when two trains collided in central China's Hunan province in
              1997.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">High speed to blame for China train disaster: authorities</h1>
              <p>BEIJING (AFP) - - High speed was to blame for the train disaster in
              eastern China that killed 70 people and injured more than 400 others,
              official media said Tuesday, citing an investigation panel.</p>
              <p>"Overspeeding was responsible for Monday's deadly train collision in
              east China that killed 70 and injured 416 others," the Xinhua news
              agency said, citing the panel set up by China's cabinet.</p>
              <p>The rail
              accident, the worst in China in more than a decade, happened near the
              city of Zibo in Shandong province, when a passenger service from
              Beijing derailed and collided with an oncoming train.</p>
              <p>Xinhua
              reported earlier that the train from Beijing was travelling at 131
              kilometres (81 miles) an hour, in excess of the 80-kilometre-an-hour
              speed limit, before it came off the tracks.</p>
              <p>Authorities had on Monday already ruled out terrorism and said "human error" was to blame.</p>
              <p>It
              was the second serious train accident in Shandong province this year
              and the worst in China since 126 people were killed in Hunan province
              in 1997.</p>
              <p>In January, a high-speed train ploughed into a group of railway workers in Shandong, killing 18 people.</p>
