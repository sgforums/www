              <p>Early in the morning, there are 7 trains doing so. The timing is from 7am to 8:30am or so which starts from Ang Mo Kio (Bishan depot) and crossover to Jurong East EB, hence passengers going towards Clementi, the City or Pasir Ris or Changi Airport will not need to alight at Jurong East.</p>

              <p>Only C151 trains, a newly brought in 1980s, have gone through refurbishment.</p>
              <p>Other trains in EWL / NSL such as C651 and C751Bs are the newly brought in 1992 (In Service 1994) and 1999 (In service 2000 - 2001) respectively. (Timeframe should be there) However, the C651 (White colour one), will be the next to go for refurbishment, which can be as early as 2010 (Minimum earliest SMRT would ever consider) to more likely 2015 (My speculation based on the number of years served). No details for such from SMRT since.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All other lines (NEL, CCL, DTL etc) rolling stocks are brand new one.</p>

              <p>I think it is because of the air piston effect, when the air in front of the train is unable to escape, so causing a lot of air pressure at the front of the train and if the train exits the tunnel fast, then it will be very noisy, so to reduce the noise, they actually slow down the train.</p>

              <p>Wow! The C151 you've sat with the refurbed plate and the manufacturer's plate is 089/090, a special C151 as it is the only one with a refurbished, refurbished floor, special PIW stickers and builder and refurbisment plate and that is an example of a refurbished C151 . Currently, all trains with the STARIS system and the VFDs(The scrolling text display in blue font) are refurbished. The C151s are the only trains with STARIS, and all have completed refurbishment by 2009.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are two kinds of the black-and-red train, the C151 &amp; the C751B. The C151 used to have a white exterior, but since reports from the public about dirt trapping, SMRT painted the train white. To solve the problem once and for all, SMRT pasted a black adhesive over the train, giving it a similar look to the C751B, which is currently the newest running stock in EWL, NSL &amp; CGL.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, how to distinguish the C151 and the C751B? Other than distinguishing them via the STARIS system, another way is to check the interior seats. For the driving car on both ends, a C751B's seats are pink in colour while a C151's seats are red in colour. Regardless of whatever car you are in the C151, the end two seats are darker in colour.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another thing is to spot the Train Run Number display. This is particularly important to distinguish a C751B from a C151 from afar in an underground station. The C151 uses roller blinds while the C751B uses an orange LED EDS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The C751B's head is tilted while the C151's head is straight.</p>
              <p> </p>
