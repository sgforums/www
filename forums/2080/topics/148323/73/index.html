              <p>I don't know if others have asked this question, but I have a genuine question to ask the local train enthusiasts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have no clue about this, but in other countries, trains are coupled, decoupled, and multi-coupled(terminalogy for multi-coupled only used for Europe). On SMRT and SBST lines, what is the max number of units that can be couple together(obviously not for standard commuter use, but for instance in a breakdown one can be coupled with another). What is the max number of sets of trains possibly coupled together? 2(12cars) or 3(18cars)?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know for a fact one disadvantage about using DC power is that for a section of rails, not too many trains can operate(otherwise there will be a power surge). So there should be a limit for this(2 or 3) right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, is it possible to couple different trainsets(C151 with C751/651) and operate under special circumstances? Or is it limited in that sense to only one type of trainset? While the coupling mechanism might be the same, is there also any limitation pertaining to different TCAS systems?</p>

              <p>I don't know if others have asked this question, but I have a
              genuine question to ask the local train enthusiasts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have no clue about this, but in other countries, trains are
              coupled, decoupled, and multi-coupled(terminalogy for multi-coupled
              only used for Europe). On SMRT and SBST lines, what is the max
              number of units that can be couple together(obviously not for
              standard commuter use, but for instance in a breakdown one can be
              coupled with another). What is the max number of sets of trains
              possibly coupled together? 2(12cars) or 3(18cars)?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know for a fact one disadvantage about using DC power is that
              for a section of rails, not too many trains can operate(otherwise
              there will be a power surge). So there should be a limit for this(2
              or 3) right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, is it possible to couple different trainsets(C151 with
              C751/651) and operate under special circumstances? Or is it limited
              in that sense to only one type of trainset? While the coupling
              mechanism might be the same, is there also any limitation
              pertaining to different TCAS systems?</p>

              <p>Only 2 can be coupled. If you are going to couple 3, it can only travel less than 30km/h due the weight its dragging. If you couple 3 trainsets together, you are going to ask the first train to be dragging 435.6 tons of weight ( excluding the train itself ). Power is not a problem because its using the first train motors only. The 2nd train is being "towed" to depot. If you have at least 3 or more than that, it may cause a power surge as more power is required to drag the faulty trains behind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is possible to couple a C151 with a C651, a C651 with a C751B and a C151 with a C751B. Given that SMRT programmed the motors to have a downgradeable code to match the older train. But I dobut that SMRT has done that. </p>
              <p>There is no TCAS danger when you miscouple a different type of trainsets together. Since that the signalling codes are still the same. (If not how they run on the same line?).</p>
              <p>The signalling is still the same no matter what you couple with. If you couple a C151 with a C751A, then the C151 can run at full speed but the C751A can only run in RM (15km/h and below). </p>
              <p>C751As use CBTC for signalling but NSL/EWL uses the traditional ATS system. The C751A can RECEIVE the code but it CANNOT read the code. Vice versa if a C151 on NEL. </p>

              <p>Erm, I have an question for that as well, what if there are a
              lack of trains (Meaning if a C651 got broke down but the nearest
              C651 available is probably more than 5 ~ 6 stations away then
              how?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>C651 is the minority population in the SGMRT. (Only 19 cars)</p>

              <p>19 <em>cars</em>? Trains, you mean. 19 cars make only three trains. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
