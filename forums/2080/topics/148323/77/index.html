              <p>Question with regards to CCL:</p>
              <p>can the trains go any faster? for most of the journey for all 3
              stages, the trains feel like they're going at 50kmh or below...
              apart from the crazy promenade bend of course, can't the trains go
              fast up to 80kmh at least? its a real bore sitting through slow CCL
              rides!</p>
              <p>trains also pull in at rather slow speeds as most of you guys
              have noticed too!</p>
              <p>Is it possible for Alstom trains to be programmed to speed into
              stations just like those on NSL and EWL?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Erm CCL maximum service speed is 80km/h and designed speed is 90km/h. So your wish is <strong>not</strong> granted. But most CCL 1 stations are simply plain too close to each other, especially the first 4 stations so it is kind of .....</p>

              <p>DBG -&gt; BBS, its the worst. The distance is shorter than the distance between Chinatown and Clarke Quay. 1 1/2 bus stop only!!! Should be 30 seconds. Because they decelerate and coast at 50km/h after the crossover. It takes 1 minute ++ instead!!</p>

              <p>You see , tunnels do worn out after some time. CCL tunnels and stations were built to last 120 years only. After that they may be demolished and rebuild as the steel beam columns could have worn out. They could be because that when The Central was build on top of the NEL, the construction could have damaged the tunnels.</p>

              <p>Â The reason why they slowed down when entering the station is because now when they're braking, you are already like, falling backwards, so if it were to use more force to brake, everyone in the train would already fell down.</p>

              <p>That was in the past... NSL/EWL is no longer pure manual, unless instructed to drive in CM due to rain or rail works, or during peak hours.
