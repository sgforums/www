              <p>Actually, platform 2 is used for passenger service too in morning and evening peak hour and on some rare occassion, non-peak hour. And to add, DNB train does not neccessary use platform 2, it can also use platform 1 too.</p>
              <p>Coupling and decoupling is done in the depot. Here's a timeline to show what's happening in the depot;</p>
              <p>Train couple together<br>Goes to the track right outside Ten Miles for standby<br>Commence revenue service at BP station<br>Continue service until times up<br>Upon receving signal/code to return back to depot, two scenario will occur;</p>
              <p>A: Train will make last trip to CCK station, before returning back to depot as a DNB train<br>B: Train will make last trip to BP towards CCK, before returning back to depot as a DNB train</p>
              <p>Again, back in the depot, 2 scenario will occur;</p>
              <p>A: Train will be decoupled in depot, with one of the train getting ready for revenue service<br>B: Train will either decouple or 'leave as it is' and 'sleep' in depot till needed</p>
              <p>To jayh272416,<br>The purpose of the 2-car train is to increase passengers service per train. It does improve frequency by "a bit". But as there's only 19 cars available, coupling all train into 2-car is not a solution. So the following is their solution during peak hour according to the commuters demand;</p>
              <p>In morning peak - Most 2-car train run on Service B<br>In evening peak - Most 2-car train run on Service A</p>
              <p>Just as an additional information, in the early days of LRT operation, there's 2 set of 2-car trains running on service C, but due to the lack of demand over time, this has been reduced to 1 set of 1-car train on service C. And to add, the LRT in the past is "fast" and riding on it was like riding a roller coaster. I still remember passengers screaming when the train accelerate to a speed faster than the current one upon exiting BP station running on Service A.</p>
              <p>Lastly, the way the system works currently is "not-so-effiecient" as each train have a headway of 1 station (Exception to this is BP and CCK station, where train will stop right before the station; distance is about 6-LRT-car length).</p>

              <p>Not possible, because the depot is a restricted area. Now, please don't try to snuck into the train to enter the depot or enter it through any means, as it will land you in to some serious trouble. If you're curious about any train related stuffs, ask here, don't tresspass or 'peform stunts'.</p>

              <p>Do you mean at curve? If you mean jerk at curves, it's because the operator is pushing the train very hard on curves and the more violent the left-right jerk, the more the train is closer to derailment.</p>

              <p>Like what willis had pointed out, the train wheel is slipping or in "free-roll". As train wheels does not have "threads" like cars do, the drainage of water out between the wheel and rail is not very good, which will cause a layer of water to accumulate between the train wheels and rail, which in turn cause the train to slip. The only way to prevent jerks during raining is to accelerate and brake more gently. But this comes with a downside, train will be late and commuting time between station will take tremendously long and not to mention the risk of overrun. So this is something unavoidable if one wants a balance between schedule accuracy and comfort. You will know why when you drive a train yourself(Please do so <strong>ONLY WITH A LEGAL REASON</strong>).</p>

              <p>Just as a correction, in our system, TO cannot perform 'speeding' on train. Doing so means breaking the speed limit define by ATC &amp; ATP in a particular section which in turn means, ATP will overrule ATO, ATC , TO's control and bringing the train to a complete halt using EB (4.5km/h/s). In Japan however, this is possible on the ATS system. For example;</p>
              <p>Sectional limit: 120km/h<br>Train actual speed: 125km/h</p>
              <p>When this happens, train stills moves as usual with no brakes applied and "stunts" like this can be seen during morning peak, where diagrams (timetable schedules) are congested and 'speeding' is needed to regain the time lost. But one cannot 'speed' it's way by breaking signals, as the train will brake according depending on the signal limits.</p>

              <p>Thanks everyone, what I can say is that</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Enter depot of LRT is more dangerous than MRT (Surprisingly) as conducted by my preliminary studies. So the chance is next to nil. (Even though now I know how to emergency open BPLRT door, but SKLRT / PGLRT does not seemed to have)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) CM a train? No, please no, that will = fine of $50000 and jail 6 months or both. Repeat offenders fine $5000. Now, unless I am PM's who but no, no, so no intention of doing so.</p>

              <p>Sort of, let say I left YWT in CM mode, heavy rain. So I start the train by putting to P1.. Then to P2.. And when it is in P2, it started to slip, so I will put it back to P1 or Coasting..Then afterthat will pick up speed.. Cause when you put power, the wheel wants to spin faster, but since metal + metal contact, and got water, sure wheel slip.. Then if you put back to coast, the wheel will move freely according to what the speed is..</p>
