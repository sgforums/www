              <p>c):Is there a chance that the 3rd track in Paya Lebar could jolly well to connect Eastern Region Line such that is for Depot purpose? (Kim Chuan depot host trains for Circle, Downtown and Eastern Region?) Or would LTA build a new one along the line? (Even so, i will guess @ Siglap or Changi Point or, actually, is the Changi Depot -- hey, why not downtown also use that, since the terminus is Expo?)</p>
              <p>3: Actually, what is the real purpose of having a third track on Ang Mo Kio and Paya Lebar? Apart of depot purpose (Paya Lebar? Why not @ Bartley or Tai Seng??), and given that the Ang Mo Kio structure is more resemble to Jurong East, it is really seemed that it can be extended but the place can be extended seemed to be quite limited.</p>

              <p><br>as i hav not been in sgforums for a long time, i looked thru the thread and found your questions u posted few months back. I will reply because this is to my interest and I actually did ask a similar qn in 2009(in this thread).</p>
              <p>I would think the real purpose of building the middle track in AMK was to make provisions for a future extension, just like the ones at tanah merah and jurong east. for evidence, if u take a look at the 1996 LTA White Paper(still downloadable from LTA website), at that point of time, they had a planned MRT line called Kallang Line in mind, and it happened to start from Ang Mo Kio, but the plan never materialised.</p>
              <p>Therefore there is v gd reason to deduce that the real purpose of middle tracks is to provide a line extension, not for facilitating the return to depot. Because just like what u had reasoned, if the real purpose is for the latter, why doesnt Hougang/Buangkok(or any of the NEL stations) hav a middle track then. And like u said, why does Paya Lebar, which is not near the depot, hav 3 tracks too, and not at Tai Seng/Bartley instead?</p>
              <p>Also, trains can also simply terminate at Bishan and return to the depot and bishan doesnt need to have a middle track. And like i had reasoned, to faciliate returning to depot, what is needed are the additional tracks in between the stations, and not at the stations themselves.</p>
              <p>Perhaps its just a coincidence that all the old stations with 3 tracks happen to be near depots, just like it is a coincidence that their old station numbering happen to be W9, N9 and E9!!! (9th station from the Raffles or City hall interchanges)</p>
              <p>So, in the case of Paya Lebar, after learning that the middle track leads to a dead end instead of connecting to Dakota bound tracks, it is all the more likely that the middle track is a provision for a future line extension. Even though u mentioned that there is currently no mention of a branch line in current plans, doesnt mean that they wont consider it in future, just like the Marina Bay extension of the CCL. at first they called it off too.</p>
              <p>If u look again carefully at the planned rail map in the 1996 white paper, MRT/LRT network for year x, u will find a planned LRT line that largely resembles what is now the CCL. In that plan, u can see that after Paya Lebar, the line continues on to link directly to Marine Parade, instead of travelling towards Dakota. So it is really not far-fetched to speculate that the middle track at Paya Lebar is a provision for a possible future line extension to the ERL(Marine Parade or somewhere near), not for depot purposes, but for actual passenger service!</p>
              <p>Well at least this is what i have deduced. because i simply cannot think of any other reason why there is a 3rd track there. definitely the real reason cannot be just to hav a spare track there, otherwise why didnt they connect the other end to the dakota bound tracks so that spare trains can go toward dhoby ghaut too instead of just marymount?</p>
              <p>But obviously at present, it is just as well that they put the middle track to good use like what they are doing at AMK and Paya Lebar. for now, they can function as spare tracks. Who knows in the distant future they may reconsider something like the Kallang Line again.</p>

              <p>Overrun half a car? So you mean overrun by about 12m, because the 3XXX / 3 YYY car is about 23m or so (Based on your train in BVE<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png">). Simply speaking, after following OCC orders, generally a miss / overrun by 2 doors length = skip station.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(Then OT a bit, I at times on openBVE might just get distracted and failed to stop on time even in Emergency Brake and a record for that was overrun for 63m and still allow me to do reverse back!)</p>

              <p>That is strict. Thanks for the info.</p>
              <p>So does that means a overrun of 0.3m ~ 0.4m until 10 ~ 12m can reverse, and anything more than 10m ~ 12m, will simply means skip station, after the permit was granted by the OCC?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And OCC sounds only from City Hall right or what? (In EWL / NSL) Or there are OCC in every stations?</p>

              <p>Once the train exceeds the set back limit, it has activated the next signal and the next oncoming train assumes that the train at the station has moved. As such, if exceeded, trains are required to proceed on to the next station. However, the OCC has complete control over the system, so they will readjust it systematically.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The train officer will make sure that trains stop at the 'Correct 
              Stopping Point' (CSP)...if you have the chance, look out for this sign 
              "CSP" at the platform <span style="font-weight: bold;">HW...</span></p>
              <p>Only when trains stop accurately, that the ATO units will receive "open 
              door signals", which actually works as a safety interlock, to prevent 
              unauthorised or premature opening of train doors.</p>
              <p>So, when train doors fail to open when train stops at a platform, it 
              could simply means, the 'communication between train/platform could not 
              be established due to train or track-side equipment failure'.</p>
              <p>The tolerence that had been designed onto the door opening sequence on 
              the platform is within a range of about 5-8 cm. The train will 
              'communicate' with the station equipments via wireless transmission in 
              order 'to allow' train doors to be open when it is within this range....</p>
