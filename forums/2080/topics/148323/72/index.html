              <p>My understanding of similar systems in another country (Central and Victoria Lines, London, UK) is this:</p>
              <p>Coded Maunal is named <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Code</span></strong>d Manual for a reason.</p>
              <p>Trains are constantly receiving "code", about current speed limits and a target speed which the train mus try to attain by the next "block".</p>
              <p>However, if the code is absent, the train will be unable to move. For this reason a "Slow Maunal" or "Restricted Manual" mode is available, for moving the train where these codes are unavailable, like in depots. They do not rely on code, but keep a maximum speed the train can attain, and will immediately stop the train once the limit is exceeded.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure if this applies to our current systems, but this is based on the assumption that <br>a) The power supply is the same, and;<br>b) The safety systems are not compatible.</p>

              train once the limit is exceeded.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure if this applies to our current systems, but this is
              based on the assumption that<br> a) The power supply is the same, and;<br> b) The safety systems are not compatible.</p>

              <p>Our Restricted Manual cut off power from the motors once it exceeds 15km/h. When it is going to depot, it use RM as shown in the BSD depot tour. We use 750W third rail for power supply. As there are a lot ( There is really A LOT!) of crossovers in the depot, there is a need for it to slow down and slowly crossover to the correct parking lot. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if we compare to the CCL</p>
              <p>They used the same power supply but different signalling and safety systems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For NSL/EWL they have specific "zones" for each track sector. They will light up when the train is in that location. They have many lights.</p>
              <p>NSL/EWL crossovers are controlled differently. For NSL/EWL, it is require to change all 4 connecting tracks.</p>
              <p>For a scissors crossover, it requires 8 switches. The station master needs to set all the tracks to the correct one.</p>
              <p>For NEL/CCL it relies on CBTC and two-way non-stop communication, so in this case the station master can track the exact train location. The crossover only requires two clicks. It is shown on a monitor in the station office. The empty sector is shown as green while red means occupied </p>
