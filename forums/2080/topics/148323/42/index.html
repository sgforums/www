              <p><br>These trains are (usually) returning to depot as the train interval is increased. And of course sometimes someone will decided to stay on a train as it transitions into an DNB service, and thus, the need for staff to check and clear the train.</p>

              <p>I dunno if this post is ok, but here is a question:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1: When do we know the details of DTL3 / who won the tender and for how long (SMRT signed a 30 year contract with LTA in 1998, and a 10 year contract since 1988)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2: Suggests a suitable depot location for these future lines:</p>
              <p>a): For Downtown Line, it would be Gali Batu, Kim Chuan and Marina Bay (Maintenance Facility, before DTL2 and 3 operates) --- BTW, what does the maintenance facility and depot's difference? And does Harbourfront (Or any other places) has one such?</p>
              <p>b): Where could the Thomson Line had their depot? Personally, I would guess is Bishan but there is no source for me to confirm.</p>
              <p>c):Is there a chance that the 3rd track in Paya Lebar could jolly well to connect Eastern Region Line such that is for Depot purpose? (Kim Chuan depot host trains for Circle, Downtown and Eastern Region?) Or would LTA build a new one along the line?

              <p>May be wait for next 20years to know about North Shore Line. And I think the NEL will not build extension. Because the island was end.</p>
