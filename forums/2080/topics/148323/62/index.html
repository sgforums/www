              <p>Oh ya, NS6 sorry. So the spaces between Yew Tee (NS5) and Kranji (NS7) and Sembawang (NS11) and Yishun (NS13) are already planned to be set aside for future stations?

              <p>No, I prefer the second choice. Because at the end of the day, using the first choice will still need to via Dhoby Ghaut instead. The first choice is not any significantly better because it is akin to going over a long loop compared to the second one, except with a notable fewer transfers and walks towards the other platform along with the possibility of more wait times, which can be used to cover the time spent on a big loop instead.</p>

              <p>For that case was because the Disney wants to build a Disneyland in Singapore, Seletar and promised to build a MRT station / line there. Obviously, building a line is more complex and not economically wise than a station, and I personally do not wish to see a Disney Resort Line or sort of, like the MTR (Hong Kong). Well, guess what, it was revealed that they will build a MRT station there as Lentor station, and provide bus service for connectivity to the resort land. However, the discussion had broken between the 2 parties (Authorities and the Disney company) and therefore Disneyland did not come to Singapore and the plan was never materialized. I guess, the timing was wrong and they should have proposed only after the start of North Shore / Coast line. (Which will ply Seletar areas)</p>
              <p>BTW, there are no signs of Disneyland is coming to Singapore at anytime soon, and even if there is, most likely it would be between the East Coast to Marina Areas instead of Seletar. And even if they resumed talks on Disneyland in Seletar again, I would expect the North Shore / Coast line has already built and therefore, there is really no need of Lentor station. (And thus the numbering scheme was not reserved)</p>

              <p>Did you even read my post clearly? I meant, they want to build a Lentor station because of Disneyland in Seletar, where the nearest existing line is NSL on stations between YCK and Khatib. However, it did not worked out to be this way due to other factors (Partially politics?) and thus both Disneyland and Lentor station plan has cancelled. I believe, there will be a day where Disneyland comes to Singapore, after the IRs or whatever, and I believe, the expected location will no longer in Seletar, which has plans to develop into aerospace hub or something like that in the long term planning. Hence, this plan of Lentor MRT is forever killed off which means the reason why they did not reserve a code name like NS6 or NS12. Not even if later they comes back and Disneyland was built on Seletar, because by then the North Shore / Coast line, which via Seletar, should be under consturction / commenced on revenue service, which means the nearest station to the Disneyland is no longer in NSL but in North Shore / Coast line. In other words, any future results / development = No Lentor MRT station because there is no more a reason to build it at such a ulu place.</p>

              <p>However, transferring in Dhoby Ghaut might be an issue. The walk is so long (Assuming no travellators). And even so, it involves a up and down transfer experience while OTP is down and down transfer.</p>

              <p>To me, the transfer experience at Dhoby and Outram is about the same. I personally dont feel that outram is much better.</p>
              <p>For Dhoby Ghaut actually now u can also use the CCL area, walk past the whole area to transfer btw NSL and NEL</p>

              <p><br>thats why i dont like to transfer from NEL to east line because not linked to city hall like red line. But if transfer at Outram Park, need to take for about 6 more stations, so transfer twice method it does feel more direct even though it probably take around same time </p>

              <p>However, the first method by C751BLovur seemed to be the fastest. Well, as I said so. The reason why CCL in fact is an epic failure for Stage 1 / 2 is because there are too many close stations, that delays the travel time (Like DBG - Bras Basah)</p>
              <p>Given the route comparison,a CCL to EWL / NSL conversion table list will be as follows</p>
              <p>Dakota ---&gt; Paya Lebar<br>Mountbatten --&gt; Aljunied<br>Stadium --&gt; Kallang<br>Nicoll Highway --&gt; Lavender<br>Promenade --&gt; Bugis<br>Esplanade --&gt; City Hall<br>Bras Basah --&gt; City Hall or Dhoby Ghaut?</p>
              <p>Well, so actually CCL is running a big circle. Waste of time, if you intend to go from PYL to other places that excludes from the CCL stations. (Any transfers that involves CCL 1 &amp; 2 and transfer again to another line = waste more time)</p>

              <p><br>I've only been there(CCL) once so i cant be sure. but psychologically it does seem faster. because by going down and up escalators at CCL u are also walking the distance(like using travelator like that) and it giv u the chance to bypass the crowd using the travelators. and by the time u go up the escalator at the other end, u are almost at the other line already. as i dont transfer at dhoby ghaut now. im wondering how many pple actually started doing this.</p>
              <p>also. transferring at Dhoby Ghaut. even if it is crowded. the interchange and linkway is spacious enough, compared to Outram linkway where u can feel trapped especially when there are huge crowds both directions.</p>
