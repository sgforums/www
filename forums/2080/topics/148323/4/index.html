            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, the Bullet Train, or Shinkansen, does not use a lot of guard rails!<br>As I remember, they only use guard rail on sensitive, high speed turning area. I once thought that the guard rails are for construction/inspection vehicles to travel on while inspecting main tracks, however, this is not the case as in the tunnel, tracks do not feature this, hence this theory is refused.<br>I do not think that the guard rails do much 'guarding' the train from falling off, as the centrifugal forces would be enough to tear the bogie(s) and tracks apart. In many derailing accidents, the bogie would be separated from the train body once the forces become too extreme. This would render the guard rails useless, and the guard rail would have been a catalyst too, helping in tearing apart the bogie in some sense, as forces are in work.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Burning Question:<br>Anyone got the number of the trains involved in the Clementi Station collision on 5th August 1993? Wikipedia sources state that the present 4-car 'money train' is 'salvaged' from the 'wreck' of the collision trains.<br>There is obviously something very wrong about this!<br>The collision, I believe, is very light, not enough to make the carriages telescope into each other, and the damage is under control as well. Hence, I do not trust the article, but I am sincere about the numbers of the train, including the number the 'money train' is carrying right now, I have not seen it for some time.</div>

I once thought that the guard rails are for construction/inspection vehicles to travel on while inspecting main tracks, however, this is not the case as in the tunnel, tracks do not feature this, hence this theory is refused.<br>I do not think that the guard rails do much 'guarding' the train from falling off, as the centrifugal forces would be enough to tear the bogie(s) and tracks apart. In many derailing accidents, the bogie would be separated from the train body once the forces become too extreme. This would render the guard rails useless, and the guard rail would have been a catalyst too, helping in tearing apart the bogie in some sense, as forces are in work.</div></blockquote>According to Wiki, "C751B" is right.<br><br><blockquote>Wikipedia: Guard Rail (U.S.) Check rail (UK) --&gt; A double rail section of track, sometimes found in train yards and on bridges to prevent derailments, by having rail on both sides of the wheel flange. Also found on curves with a tight radius and switches and crossings</blockquote></div>

Labelling the school isn't really that serious, you can't really find a culprit if you just label the school, no matter how prestigious or bad that particular school is.</div>

The LRT cars use rubber wheels and the tracks are quite far away from the buildings.

FYI, roads leading to Sydney Airport or surrounding roads have these devices installed due to the protest of the people living real close to the airport and we as tourists have to pay a higher tax when using Sydney Airport.</div>
