              <p>Hi~ asking: why sometimes all passengers on board will be asked to exit the train at a station? what's the purpose of it?</p>
              <p>If it's for better passenger flow, i don't see the results cos evrytime i come out halfway to my destination, the nxt train i waited for will still be as equally or even more cramp with people, it was never less.</p>
              <p>I encounter this almost everytime during peak hours when ppl rushing to work &amp; sch in the morning or home in the late afternoon and night.</p>
              <p>These few mths, have been coming across such incidents when going to school (SP, dover) from yishun:</p>
              <p>There was once or twice when i board the train from yishun, it says it terminates at pasir ris, but in the end ask all passengers to exit and board the nxt train at jurong east. That time the stn is alr full of ppl b4 the passengers on board alight. When I alight, i (and the whole stretch of passengers standing on the most front) was forced to stand very near the edge of the platform, with the train (now empty) passing by right in front of our face.</p>
              <p>I wish to voice out/complain something: its lack of safety for passengers, and lack of efficiency..</p>
              <p>or am I too picky? anyw, i really wish to know why the need for all passengers to alight at certain times, especially during peak hours..</p>

              <p>Hi. That's because they want to increase frequency for the city area. Since they lack trains, they can only do it till Yishun. If you want to have an efficient journey without alighting, then board the Jurong East bound train.</p>
              <p>The purpose for alighting is so that the train could reverse at the siding nearby, then go back opposite and to Marina Bay to fetch more passengers.</p>

              <p>some trains are headed for termination of service due to the end of the peak period, for full utilisation of the train they usually deploy it to terminate as far as possible, however sometimes trains arent able to reach further like for those staying at woodlands so sometimes a little squeeezing for a rather short remaining portion of the journey has to take place. terminating points are yishun for peak periods, amk for lunchtime express for NSL. however some is to cater for an unusual rise in demand for a short period like jurong east to yew tee in the evening peak. just a footnote, the NSL cross to EWL trains help to ease loads from yew tee - jurong east in the morning and enable simple swapping of trains between depots along with the yew tee crossover where a few trains are swappe back from UPD to BSD.</p>

              <p>Is it right to say that the number of trains we have now are just not enuff to handle the number of passengers we having? If it is, will there be further actions to improve the situation?</p>
              <p>Or we need more platforms oso, to allow more trains to operate at one time?</p>
