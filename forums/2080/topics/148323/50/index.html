              <p>To reply everyone's query on Punggol LRT, I will answer it:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1: LTA did planned for Punggol LRT consist of 3 sectors - East, West &amp; North.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The East has bascially opened except PE 7 Damai.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The West has not opened as of yet due to lack of demands (No buildings at all!)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The North? -- Unfortunately it was NOT even built at all and the only hint you can get was a 2002 street directory (Either 2004 or 2005, that part was not shown) -- No dont ask me for one because probably I have thrown away.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, based on my MRT Trivia, on page 6 or 7 should have mentioned some questions on PGLRT. In anycase, here is the source that gives hints on it.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.mitsubishitoday.com/peoplemover/ht/d/sp/i/2669/pid/2669">http://www.mitsubishitoday.com/peoplemover/ht/d/sp/i/2669/pid/2669</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We have 7 stations for East and West (PE 1 - PE 7, PW 1 - PW 7) and Punggol Town Centre station, that gives a total of 15.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personally, I feel that the North line is not a loop but a branch line with 4 stations, starting from PW 2. (PW 2, PN 1, PN 2, PN 3 --&gt; PN 4, the Terminus)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, based on Wikipedia is such that (And I have the feeling that) the Punggol Town Centre LRT station will have 3 tracks (The middle platform) such that it is not visible at this point of time as it is NOT even built yet. I think that when it built and commence for service, I think that they might deploy 4 trains for it, 2 for each direction and having 2 terminus stops (PTC &amp; PN4).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And yes, there are no names given to the 4 stations yet and the names outside are just mere speculations. No -- it wont go to Coney Island unless they extended 1 more station.</p>

              <p>Punggol station will operate similar to Jurong East and Tanah Merah, which is the reason why the current platform seems very broad.

              <p>However at Teck Lee station, the north-bound Punggol North Line train and the north-bound Punggol west Loop train will have independent platforms.

              <p>1)     what is the difference between all the trains (black and red)? its very confusing to tell the type.=( can include pics. cause description is not enough...=)</p>
              <p>2)     Just a few days ago, i watched a video about Japanese bullet train. The drivers always point to the monitor which indicate the speed limit and stuffs related to it.(same goes to some train drivers on other lines) Should our train drivers do that assuming that the train have the monitor screen?</p>

              <tbody>
              <tr>

              <p> </p>
              <p>However, I am wondering, so it means that in future when the Punggol North Line has really built (No, this is not a speculation, but is true that nothing has mentioned on Punggol North Line such that I believe that are no stations built (Unless there is really a station without station name -- I will check your gallery / go there sometime if possible.), this cover will take out and then the 3rd rail will be installed and hence they cannot cover that platform unless they dismantle the thrid rail? I am wondering if it will be a dead end track or will it merge into the front (That is towards Cove / Soo Teck or rather trains from Cove / Sengkang - Punggol link rail / Soo Teck can crossover to Punggol Middle Platform to serve the North)?</p>

              that I believe that are no stations built (Unless there is really a
              station without station name -- I will check your gallery / go
              there sometime if possible.), this cover will take out and then the
              3rd rail will be installed and hence they cannot cover that
              platform unless they dismantle the thrid rail? I am wondering if it
              will be a dead end track or will it merge into the front (That is
              towards Cove / Soo Teck or rather trains from Cove / Sengkang -
              Punggol link rail / Soo Teck can crossover to Punggol Middle
              Platform to serve the North)?</p>

              <p>No stations are built yet for the Punggol North Line. When they've decided to electrify the track, the cover will be removed and the third rail will be installed. I don't get your "they cannot cover that
              platform unless they dismantle the thrid rail" part because a track cannot be covered when trains are in operation.</p>
              <p>Currently it's a dead end, but there may be space for crossovers since the current tracks do not pinch. For this, I am not too sure yet. It may or may not be connected.</p>
