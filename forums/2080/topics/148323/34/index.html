              <p>Yishun has no LTE (Lunch Time Express). You probably meant peak hours where trains terminate at Yishun (Such as my Yishun stunt shown on "Life after Harbourfront and  Bartley stations"). AFAIK, I see no difference apart changing Ang Mo Kio to Yishun.</p>

              <p>Yes, there is a train service from Marina Bay to Yishun during both morning and evening peak hours.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The timing is like 6 (6:30) am - 9am and 5 (5:30 ~ 6) pm - 8 (7:30) pm</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I have some question to ask as well.</p>
              <p>1: Is it possible to have a TO or 2 to reverse the whole train for the entire shuttle service in EWL or NSL (E.g: From Tanah Merah to Changi Airport, DNBs to nearest depot or Jurong East to Yew Tee etc) ? In the last Yew Tee stunt, I have saw a TO who saw me as well after the train has moved. On that time, I was in the second carriage and they did not move / walk towards me. That terminate was very brief and seemed to me either a reverse or a 3rd TO was inside the other cabin on the other end.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2: Is it possible for train to return to depot without a TO at all in NSL / EWL?</p>

              <p><br>Back with an answer:</p>
              <p><br>" Most of the station announcements are generated automatically. There is a dedicated computer system (Automatic Train Supervision System - ATSS) which oversees this...like where is its intended destination or whether it is a passenger service train.</p>
              <p>Generally, all trains in today's modern systems carry 'an identity' or 'tag', as they move within the railway network. They have 'antennas' that communicate with track-side signal equipments although its appearance or design may vary.</p>
              <p>LIke the ones in SMRT, the train (whether it is a passenger train or a non-revenue one) is detected about 500 metres (or about 3 ATP blocks) away from the station and it will trigger a pre-programmed announcement played over the station public address system. "</p>

              <p><br>1. What do you mean? For "lunchtime express", 1 TO is enough for train which performs turnaround in slidings due to the fact the the time given to the train for turnaround is roughly about 2~4mins. For Yishun Shuttle service, 1 TO is also enough as there's enough time for the TO to walk from End to End for the train to turnaround. But for Yew Tee shutter service, due to the "tight nature" of the timetable for SB and NB train, 2 TO is needed to perform the turnaround to offset this.</p>
              <p>2. Not possible, due to fact that system is semi-auto, which means a "human" is needed at all time to control/monitor the train, though that "human" may not neccessary be a TO but an engineer from the depot.</p>

              <p>1: As far as I know, some shuttle trains has 2 TO in a train while others don't (Such as Lunchtime Express, since the train was moving while the TO walking to the other end). What I was interested is if the TO is able to reverse the train throughout the service without walking from end to end. (I know in Yishun shuttle, the TO will walk from end to end). What I meant was from Point A to Point B, the TO drive forward all the way. Is it possible that a TO drive from Point B to Point A using reverse and save the hassle from walking an end to the other end.</p>
              <p>2: Thanks for the answer, so the last "accidential" stunt was really lucky indeed.</p>

              <p>Met a CSO on a train in Tanjong Pagar before while i was filming. He walked up to me and I thought I was dead. But no! He said to me: "Hello boy, do you know filming is not allowed in SMRT trains?" I pretended I did not know. He then asked me why am I filming. I said that it was the school holidays and I had nothing to do at home. He said "You Secondary School students have so much time on your hands. I advise you to study more. But since you are filming on the train now, I shall let you <strong>FILM TO YOUR HEART'S CONTENT."</strong></p>

              <p>1: As far as I know, some shuttle trains has 2 TO in a train while others don't (Such as Lunchtime Express, since the train was moving while the TO walking to the other end). What I was interested is if the TO is able to reverse the train throughout the service without walking from end to end. (I know in Yishun shuttle, the TO will walk from end to end). What I meant was from Point A to Point B, the TO drive forward all the way. Is it possible that a TO drive from Point B to Point A using reverse and save the hassle from walking an end to the other end.</p>
              <p>2: Thanks for the answer, so the last "accidential" stunt was really lucky indeed.</p>

              <p><br>Hmm. It is possible in manual mode (Auto mode i am not so sure) but not recommended due to safety reasons (Who would drive their car with their back facing the front?). Anyway if by any chance if you "jack" a DNB train and didn't see TO walking from "end-to-end", most likely there's another TO on the other side of the train on standby to perform turnaround under 30 seconds~1min.</p>
