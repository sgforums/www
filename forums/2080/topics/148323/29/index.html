              <p>Hahaha, you kept asking questions about TO.</p>
              <p>There is no job such as slack job. It depends on the person. If you are willing to work, you wouldn't be slacking while performing your career right?</p>
              <p>You may think TOs job is easy, just sit down, open close door. But think the other way, they may have to react on something unexpected, take instructions from the CTC, drive the train in CM mode when required, know what to do and how to react when something happened.</p>
              <p>This is just SMRT, where most of the things are computerised, and are driven in Auto mode. Although it may seem boring or slacking, just sitting down in the cab travelling from North to South, East to West, but take note, they may have to drive in caution speed due to track works. Furthermore, you have to keep the train on schedule, not to far behind time, must learn how to stop accurately.  All this takes practice. To be honeset, sometimes when the MRT trains are driven in CM mode, they stop much more accurate than then fully automatic trains such as the NEL, CCL..</p>
              <p>If you are interested, and have a big passion for it, I don't see any obstructions for you to be a TO.</p>
              <p>Who says a Chinese cannot? I've seen lots of Chinese people who are TO. Don't you worry, SMRT isn't a racist company.</p>

              <p>Yes, met one. During the BLE open house. He asked me why am I taking photos of the trains and stations, I replied, I'm a railway enthusiast, but concentrate more on the KTM side. So he replied, Oh I see, have you been into the cab before? I said, No. He said, Okay, come, when my train arrives, I will show you.</p>

                  enthusiast, but concentrate more on the KTM side. So he replied, Oh
                  I see, have you been into the cab before? I said, No. He said,
                  Okay, come, when my train arrives, I will show you.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">Actually, the train just cannot cross over to the Platform B as they liked in HarbourFront, unless they proceed to a dead end, which I named it as "NE0" which then they can use the HarbourFront Platform B. This is why one of the platform is almost never used in HarbourFront (Unlike Punggol).</p>

              <p>Sengkang, scissor. This is because the Punggol station was not thought to be operational (Due to Insufficient demand), along with Potong Pasir (Due to Opposition held), Hougang (Due to Opposition held) and Woodleigh Station (Due to Opposition held and mainly a cemetry area)</p>

              <p>Read my post on http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/showthread.php?t=2542466, the harbourfront station want to go to "NE0" so that they can cross over to the NE1 Platform B. Thats all.In this way, the station can hold 3 trains at a time in theory (To me la) instead of 2 where 1 of them is parked @ "NE0"</p>

              <p>Read my post on http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/showthread.php?t=2542466, the harbourfront station want to go to "NE0" so that they can cross over to the NE1 Platform B. Thats all.In this way, the station can hold 3 trains at a time in theory (To me la) instead of 2 where 1 of them is parked @ "NE0"</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">Actually, the train just cannot
              cross over to the Platform B as they liked in HarbourFront, unless
              they proceed to a dead end, which I named it as "NE0" which then
              they can use the HarbourFront Platform B. This is why one of the
              platform is almost never used in HarbourFront (Unlike Punggol).</p>

              <p>It is possible, provided that there aren't any trains between Harbourfront and Outram Park. Theres a crossover towards Harbourfront right after Outram Park.</p>
