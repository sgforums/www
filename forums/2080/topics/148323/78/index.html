              <p>I can also say that.</p>
              <p>NEL/CCL trains are fully automated. I guess we need to revive
              the newcomer's thread. We have new train enthusiasts who don't know
              what is AM,CM,RM</p>

              <p>You peeked at the driver's console. Very funny, I doubt the CSO
              would see you sneaking up from behind. Anyway when the CSO drive in
              CM, they tend to be late for schedule by a few minutes. </p>

              <p>By saying "peeked at the console", I meant over a period of over 5 
              stations. The driver was just standing there but he was not operating in
               any manual mode, I don't know why. I didn't sneak up on the CSO. I was standing right at the blockade but I could make out the speed markings on the speedometer. So its not so funny unlike what you'd probably imagine.</p>

              <p>If you have the train 20m from CSP and it's still going at high speed, it would need to brake to 0km/h immediately (There are trains in other countries which can E-Brake 0km/h immediately). The force would be greater and if it's a locomotive. The trailers behind would "fly". The force has no where to go. So it is rebounded back to the other end instead. The force is also pushed downwards and against the force as a result of friction. Causing flat wheels too. </p>

              <p>As for acceleration, NEL trains slowly (relatively) increase
              power to full, while CCL depart at a lower power setting (CCL has
              no notches- it is linear), before going full throttle. This is why
              the acceleration feels different.</p>

              <p>Anyway have you guys checked out the new B2 linkway from Raffles City to Esplanade station? Made me realise how close ESP is to CTH stn...

If I'm not wrong, KL has a few stations that are in close proximity and are actually considered interchanges on the map (but I doubt they have seamless transfer)</p>

              <p>The Kelana Jaya Line has tunels, but as the previous user has said, "...crossover underneath each other tunnels". The only line that runs undergrouns is the Kelana Jaya Line, or PUTRA LRT which means lines don't overlap underground.</p>

              Middle track &gt; SB - opposing main traffic flow, Depot track)</p>
              <p>No crossover from Bishan  - Braddell</p>
              <p>Braddell - Toa Payoh (Right before Toa Payoh):</p>
              <p>SB &gt; NB, if my memory did not fail me. It must be only one side 
              crossover and we can conclude that during the operation of first SMRT 
              sector (YCK - TAP), 1 of the platform from each terminus was not used, 
              just like present day Marymount / Harbourfront)</p>
              <p>No crossover from Toa Payoh - Newton</p>
              <p>Newton - Orchard (Right after Newton):</p>
              <p>NB &gt; SB - opposing main traffic flow (Quite like Bugis style)</p>
              <p>~~~ End of NSL sector (Read on Marina Bay Appendix for Raffles Place and Marina Bay / Pier crossovers)</p>
