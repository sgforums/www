              <p>I see, so basically the signalling &amp; electricity collection must be the same, hence although the train in EWL / NSL can fit into NEL / CCL / DTL (After completeion) and vice versa but it cant move because</p>
              <p>1: If they fit into NEL, the signalling &amp; electricity collection is different and not compatible</p>
              <p>2: If they fit into CCL/DTL then because the automatic lines (CBTC) is not compatible with traditional ATC, so even the trains did received the power it can move dangerously (Manual operation) or none (Automatic part)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, to go either completely by either system, I am curious if</p>
              <p>A: Is it possible that the lines have 2 signalling systems and 2 electricity collection (Such that eg: NEL has both CTBC and ATC for power collection as well as using both overhead cables and 3rd rail -- then the EWL / NSL trains can go into Sengkang in theory)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: I dont ask just for the sake of ask, this has curioused me by the fact that they are all standard gauges and seemed to me like it can fit and go.</p>

              <p> Yes to both of your question but you do need to take note of one very important point;</p>
              <p>Cross section. This is the most important point if you want train collecting electricity using third rail collection method and overhead collection method to run on all lines, If you realized, NEL has a tunnel which is more thin but "taller" to cater to the storage of the wires while CCL, NSL, EWL and the upcoming DTL will have a wider but "shorter" tunnel to cater to the storage of the third rail. Since the initial design of the tunnels and tracks is not designed to have a train collecting electricity from third rail to run on NEL, the tunnel may not be wide enough for the third rail to fit in and also, the tunnel in CCL, NSL, EWL and DTL may not be "tall" enough for the overhead wires and it's equipments to fit in. Not to forget the the pantograph or the "shoe" of the train may hit part of the tunnel/platform due to protruding parts.</p>
              <p>This problem can be overcome, but at a great cost.</p>

              <p>As for having both ATC and CBTC, it should be possible, but I'm not sure...</p>
              <p>Two different power collection method using the same tracks is not usually possible, as the current is not the same - if the OHLE is 25 kHz AC, but the third rail is 750 volts DC, it may lead to some nasty results...</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p> It is possible to have a train to operate using both ATC and CBTC on it's respective lines, like ATC on NSL and EWL and CBTC on NEL and CCL.</p>
              <p>An example will be the Tokyu Toyoko Line. Originally, the line runs on a ATS system. But due to the ever increasing passengers demands, Tokyu have to increase the frequency of the trains to a point where it's almost a job impossible (Yes, the driver is extremely stress during morning rush hour, where leeway for each train is at it's minimal). So until a point when they realized that simply adding more trains into the timetable could not solve the problem and in fact, make it worst, they began to research and develop a new signalling system for the line, which is the current CS-ATC.</p>
              <p>Of course, the change wasn't a immediate change to the whole line, portion of the lines were gradually converted from ATS to CS-ATC. So there was this time, where the ATS section of the line is from Sakuragicho to Kikuna and the CS-ATC section of the line is from Kikuna to Shibuya. So what happen is that the the driver will operate the train in ATS mode from Sakuragicho to Kikuna. At Kikuna, the driver will deactivate the ATS mode and activate the CS-ATC mode. From Kikuna all the way to Shibuya, the driver operates the train in CS-ATC mode.</p>

              <p>For the trains, so far there are none to my knowledge yet. However, it is possible to electrify a track with both catenary wires and third rail to cater to different EMUs. I think it's easier for me to illustrate in example for you:</p>
              <p>Imagine if NEL has both catenary wires and third rail. Ignoring the signalling system, I put a C151 on the line there, with a C715A behind. The C151 uses it's shoe to pick up electricity from the third rail and run. The C751A uses the pantograph to pick up electricity from the catenary wires and run also.</p>
              <p>This example is also used in London, but I forgot which line(s).</p>

              <p> This is a good idea but do remember that coupling of train during operation will interfere with the emergency exits at the ends of the train, unless the end sections of each train are coupled in such a way that it's connected along with a gangway to allow passengers in one train to travel from one train to another. A good example will be the E259 on the Narita Express.</p>

              <p>Good finding over here! For those interested, this video was taken from Kanazawa Hakkei to Kanazawa Bunko. The person who took the video was on a 4-car Limited Express train bound for Haneda Airport. Somewhere between these two station, a 8-car Rapid Limited Express bound for Shinagawa or beyond overtook the train the owner was in. After the 8-car train arrives in Kanazawa Bunko, the 4-car train was given the signal to proceed and couple with the 8-car train, forming a 12-car train and this 12-car train will travel from Kanazawa Bunko to Keikyu Kawasaki as a Rapid Limited Express before being decoupled at Keikyu Kawasaki, where the first 8-car will travel towards Shinagawa and the last 4-car will travel towards Haneda Airport.</p>
              <p>As a additional information, the situation Kanazawa Bunko station during morning rush hour ("7am~9am") is pretty "chaotic" as train arrives and depart at frequency of 1~3mins, not to mention that some train needs to be coupled at the station to cater to the morning rush hour crowd and trains crossing over from depot over to the "holding area". And due to the tight nature of the timetable, the distance separating between two trains is as close as 1.5metre and you can have up to 3 train bunching up behind, though they are cleared within 2~3mins most of the time.</p>
              <p>Once again, my apologies for such a lengthy post but hope that I've at least answered part of your queries.</p>

                  to allow passengers in one train to travel from one train to
                  another. A good example will be the E259 on the Narita Express.</p>
              <p>Good finding over here! For those interested, this video
                  was taken from Kanazawa Hakkei to Kanazawa Bunko. The person who
                  took the video was on a 4-car Limited Express train bound
                  for Haneda Airport. Somewhere between these two station, a 8-car
                  Rapid Limited Express bound for Shinagawa or beyond overtook the
                  train the owner was in. After the 8-car train arrives in Kanazawa
                  Bunko, the 4-car train was given the signal to proceed and couple
                  with the 8-car train, forming a 12-car train and this 12-car train
                  will travel from Kanazawa Bunko to Keikyu Kawasaki as a Rapid
                  Limited Express before being decoupled at Keikyu Kawasaki, where
                  the first 8-car will travel towards Shinagawa and the last 4-car
                  will travel towards Haneda Airport.</p>
              <p>As a additional information, the situation Kanazawa Bunko
                  station during morning rush hour ("7am~9am") is pretty "chaotic" as
                  train arrives and depart at frequency of 1~3mins, not to mention
                  that some train needs to be coupled at the station to cater to the
                  morning rush hour crowd and trains crossing over from depot over to
                  the "holding area". And due to the tight nature of the timetable,
                  the distance separating between two trains is as close as 1.5metre
                  and you can have up to 3 train bunching up behind, though they are
                  cleared within 2~3mins most of the time.</p>
              <p>Once again, my apologies for such a lengthy post but hope that
                  I've at least answered part of your queries.</p>

              <p>1: Cross section in this case refers to the dimension of the tunnel/infrastructure such as maximum width, maximum height etc. As the 0, 200, 300 and 8000 series have "shoes" at the side of the bogies for electricity collection, some "extra space" is needed to ensure that the shoe won't be broken off by the wall/obstacles halfway during the journey and likewise, as the 70000 series have pantographs on the train for electricity collection, some "extra space" is needed to ensure that the pantograph won't be broken off by the roof/obstacles halfway through the journey.</p>
              <p>So in order to counter this problem, an infrastructure upgrade is neccessary such as increasing the maximum width/height of the tunnel/infrastructure. But since upgrading everything is darn expensive, it's best to convert all lines to use only one electricity collection method for resource conservation purposes. Having multiple electricity can be done but it'll be extremely expensive to develop, build and mantain.</p>

              <p>Which both train? the 4-car train has been travelling on P2 max due to signal restriction (40km/h) and the 8-car train is sprinting using P5 (110km/h~120km/h). Of course as usual, B1 is used before a completed stop. During coupling, only P1, B1, B2 and B3 is used.</p>

              <p>Yeah, it's the japanese style of train identification convention. I am not really sure about how they derive the contract number though. Just like C151 for the 0 series and the C151A for the upcoming new train, the gap between these two contract are about 20 years.</p>

              <p> It's a video containing a collection of Osaka Municipal Subway train horning. Horn are usually sound when train is entering station at high speed, passing by station, passengers getting too close to the edge of the platform, near level crossing, another train is right infront etc.</p>
