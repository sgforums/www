There's great likelyhood for you being detained by the police once caught - and they can even detain u without trail just like the terrorists while pending investigations. by doing so, the police would be wondering why are you photograhing those sensitive items - and definitely suspect you're up to no good until proven otherwise. even then, the minimum they can charge u is for trespassing or even break-in! better not play the fool or else there's no way of turning back. also the public are more vigilant against suspicious people or activities these days and may report to the police against u.<br><br>if you like trains, you may consider photograph them in public areas - eg go to Seletar reservoir area to photograph the trains along the viaduct - the photo can turn out to be really beautiful.</div>

The reason for the slow speed is that it takes 3'30" on schedule to travel from Yishun to Sembawang and that the train is travelling uphill towards SBW unless the train is behind time then it will be normal.<br><br>A short period of acceleration near the football field is normal for NB. For SB, this happens after Yishun Sapphire before the crossings.<br><br>The same thing happens for Sembawang southbound, where it is travelling uphill. A train that needs to be faster will cheong up the hill, while a train that does not will slowly glide up.<br><br>Interestingly, trains enter SBW at 60kph at NB and 50kph at SB. Not a lot of difference. YIS NB is about 60~65kph, SB is 70kph.</div>

Woodlands, Yishun, Punggol/ Sengkang, Pair Ris etc. right now there's little development between these towns and bus links between them (39, 85, 161, 168, 965, 969) are available. so wait long long for north shore line to be built. won't be before 2012 anyway.</blockquote>in the blueprint in 1990s north east line was supposed to branch out to Seletar from hougang. then after punggol station it was also shown to extend to pulau ubin<br>but if MRT go to pulau ubin then will pollute the place like hell, so i think the plan was scrapped<br><br>jurong LRT was mentioned some time back that the plan has also been shelved because 'unless there is going to be a new township in the future that is going to be very heavily built up, it is unlikely that the LRT system will be expanded'. this is quoted from a straits times article abt plans for the then Bukit Timah line, eastern region line (now part of the downtown line)<br><br>i think if u want extension after joo koon is unlikely bcos already got the jurong industrial services to serve the area. or if u want to go malaysia via 2nd link i think wait long long. MRT after pasir ris also not likely, pasir ris already the east end of Singapore, where else u want the MRT to go, Changi Village? actually the north shore line when its built (if it is built) may go to Changi Village, but then again north shore line is a long time later, so u have to wait</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly speaking i would really prefer that no matter smrt or sbs nel not to go to ubin island . cos by then it wouldn't be the same anymore and it would lose its rustic charm as alot of pple will go there and cause alot of pollution and not to mention littering problems also . And also many of the coral ard ubin will definitely die during the building of any rail system as corals are the most fragile in the ocean eco system . So please i plead all of the rail heads and inlcuding pple at LTA to throw away the idea of building a rail to ubin . Please pple , city and rustic island do not mix . I like to go ubin to camp overnite there at any spot i like and i bet if ubin were to have a rail there , the whole place will definitely not be the same anymore and i will definitely lose the joy of camping there freely .</div>
