I once thought that the guard rails are for construction/inspection vehicles to travel on while inspecting main tracks, however, this is not the case as in the tunnel, tracks do not feature this, hence this theory is refused.<br>I do not think that the guard rails do much 'guarding' the train from falling off, as the centrifugal forces would be enough to tear the bogie(s) and tracks apart. In many derailing accidents, the bogie would be separated from the train body once the forces become too extreme. This would render the guard rails useless, and the guard rail would have been a catalyst too, helping in tearing apart the bogie in some sense, as forces are in work.</div></blockquote>Aiya...why you always think of the extreme? MRT can go as fast as bullet train, ah? This is not Japan lah. And do you think the engineers would put the guard rails there without calculating the amount of force it will be able to withstand? Of course, they would have anticipated the worst and rigorous tests have been done to ensure maximum safety. You wouldn't want to wreck a million dollar train and hundreds of lives just because the guard rails are not strong enough.</div>

And how can the bogies get ripped off at all? If a carriage should become derailed, the guard rails will help to keep the derailed wheels more or less on the track, going straight on instead of over the side. In other words, they prevent the wheels from leaving the alignment of the track - even tho' they might be running on the sleepers - and so stop the train going over the edge. The guard rails bend towards each other after junctions and at the start of the viaduct, to try and catch derailed vehicles as they approach.<br><br>The one you are talking about for the bullet train is known as check rails. They are found on curves and, I believe, are much closer to the running rails as compared to guard rails. However, they still work the same way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

LRTs in malaysia are partially underground, like PUTRALine.</div></blockquote>Light Rail can be underground but they will be more expensive to build. LRTs in Malaysia (Kelana Jaya, Sri Petaling, Ampang) although they are called Light Rail Trains, they are actually classified under heavy rail like our Kawasakis, Siemens and Alstom. They call it Light Rail because it's as "fast" as Light. And it has a nice ring to it.<br><br>*Off-topic*<br>PutraJaya Monorail Line is partially underground.
