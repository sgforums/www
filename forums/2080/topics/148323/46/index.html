              <p>I got an "academic" question.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What will happen if let say, a Kawasaki C151(A), C651 or C751B has wrongly delivered to Kim Chuan Depot instead for Circle Line deployment or a C830 has wrongly sent to Bishan Depot for NSL/EWL deployment and a TO went to drive them?<br><br>PS: Please dont consider the amount of carriages they have, my concern is only on Automatic trains running in Semi-Auto Rail lines and vice versa.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, I am wondering why despite notable differences, there is a C751A (NEL) and C751B (NSL/EWL). Why arent they assigned to a different number?</p>
              <p>Futhermore, why is the laterral lines despite being fully underground, they still use a 3rd rail (Maybe can describe on pros and cons and perhaps, alternatives)</p>
              <p>Last but not least, how is the thrid rail connected to the train itself, or actually only provide electricity to the track only.</p>

              <p>Will not happen.</p>
              <p>C751A - 70000 series<br>C751B - 300 series</p>
              <p>People who design the line feel that a wider tunnel is better and easier to build than a taller tunnel? Frankly speaking I don't know as there's too many factors to consider for this question. But for me personally, I prefer overhead wires anytime.</p>
              <p>Last question has been partially answered by joeyfjj.</p>

                  <p>How about I explain this question in another context? (Please pardon me)</p>
                  <p>Do you know that back in Japan, there's such a thing call through service? I know that over here locally, we have NSL~EWL morning crossover service but over in Japan, It's a through servive of train between two company or more. An example would of a train travelling through lines belonging to different company would be;</p>
                  <p>Keikyu Main Line ~ Toei Asakusa Line ~ Keisei Oshiage Line ~ Keisei Main Line</p>
                  <p>If you notice, 3 companies are involved in this through service and in order for the train to be able to operate in all sections of the 3 lines, the 3 companies have to sync and use their train signalling system into only 1, which is the current C-ATS.</p>
                  <p>Putting this into local context, if you want NSL &amp; EWL train to be able to run on NEL and CCL, the following need to be done;</p>
                  <p>- Use of a single signalling system. Currently NEL &amp; CCL are using CBTC and NSL &amp; EWL are using the traditional ATC<br>- "Globalize" the usage of electricity collection, meaning either go complete 3rd rail or overhead collection method. Currently NEL uses overhead collection method whiole NSL, EWL &amp; CCL are using third rail collection method.</p>
                  <p>Hope this has answers your question. Of course, feel free to post more questions if you have any. If I am wrong in any points, feel free to correct me. Cheers~</p>

                  <p>Need to depend on the progress of the technologies by then. Remember that we still have the problem of "rainy weather" since a large portion of these two lines are non-underground.</p>

              <p>I have taken the C751Bs and find that they can be grouped into 2 categories:</p>
              <p>Category 1: In each carriage, there are 2 rows of seats where there will be 5 seats instead of 7. The rows which have 5 seats are the rows of seats between door B1 and B2 and door A3 and A4.</p>
              <p>Category 2: In each carriage, there is 1 row of seats where there will be 5 seats instead of 7. The row which has 5 seats is the row between door A3 and A4.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Category 1 trains: sets 311-322, 341-352</p>
              <p>Category 2 trains: sets 325-340</p>
              <p>Why is this so? Also, can someone confirm if 323-324 belongs to category 1 or 2?</p>

              <p>How about I explain this question in another context? (Please
              pardon me)</p>
              <p>Do you know that back in Japan, there's such a thing call
              through service? I know that over here locally, we have NSL~EWL
              morning crossover service but over in Japan, It's a through servive
              of train between two company or more. An example would of a train
              travelling through lines belonging to different company would
              be;</p>
              <p>Keikyu Main Line ~ Toei Asakusa Line ~ Keisei Oshiage Line ~
              Keisei Main Line</p>
              <p>If you notice, 3 companies are involved in this through service
              and in order for the train to be able to operate in all sections of
              the 3 lines, the 3 companies have to sync and use their train
              signalling system into only 1, which is the current C-ATS.</p>
              <p>Putting this into local context, if you want NSL &amp; EWL train
              to be able to run on NEL and CCL, the following need to be
              done;</p>
              <p>- Use of a single signalling system. Currently NEL &amp;
              CCL are using CBTC and NSL &amp; EWL are using the traditional
              ATC<br> - "Globalize" the usage of electricity collection, meaning either
              go complete 3rd rail or overhead collection method. Currently NEL
              uses overhead collection method whiole NSL, EWL &amp; CCL
              are using third rail collection method.</p>
              <p>Hope this has answers your question. Of course, feel free to
              post more questions if you have any. If I am wrong in any points,
              feel free to correct me. Cheers~</p>
              <p>Need to depend on the progress of the technologies by then.
              Remember that we still have the problem of "rainy weather" since a
              large portion of these two lines are non-underground.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I see, so basically the signalling &amp; electricity collection must be the same, hence although the train in EWL / NSL can fit into NEL / CCL / DTL (After completeion) and vice versa but it cant move because</p>
              <p>1: If they fit into NEL, the signalling &amp; electricity collection is different and not compatible</p>
              <p>2: If they fit into CCL/DTL then because the automatic lines (CBTC) is not compatible with traditional ATC, so even the trains did received the power it can move dangerously (Manual operation) or none (Automatic part)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, to go either completely by either system, I am curious if</p>
              <p>A: Is it possible that the lines have 2 signalling systems and 2 electricity collection (Such that eg: NEL has both CTBC and ATC for power collection as well as using both overhead cables and 3rd rail -- then the EWL / NSL trains can go into Sengkang in theory)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: I dont ask just for the sake of ask, this has curioused me by the fact that they are all standard gauges and seemed to me like it can fit and go.</p>

              <p>For the trains, so far there are none to my knowledge yet. However, it is possible to electrify a track with both catenary wires and third rail to cater to different EMUs. I think it's easier for me to illustrate in example for you:</p>
              <p>Imagine if NEL has both catenary wires and third rail. Ignoring the signalling system, I put a C151 on the line there, with a C715A behind. The C151 uses it's shoe to pick up electricity from the third rail and run. The C751A uses the pantograph to pick up electricity from the catenary wires and run also.</p>
              <p>This example is also used in London, but I forgot which line(s).</p>
