              <p>No, they did not put a green light in NE2, it is just that we have seen lights of KTM TGP station being moved away, and it is only a start of discussion in NE2.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I believe it can be built at earliest 2013 / 2014 or 2015 and earliest possible operational year is 2018, if massive development takes place there, just like how the Marina area is.</p>

              <p>No, it can never be Tanjong Pagar Railway becoz of Tanjong Pagar MRT station, people are more likely to be confused and KTM....??? You might as well got better chance naming any other station as "Singapore" or "&lt;Some politican name&gt;". By the way, countires name and building names are not allowed to be MRT station name, this is why there is no Hwa Chong Station.</p>

              <p>What answer? Well, it (The relocation of KTM station in TGP) is reported on the papers and some forums do report it as well (Like IRF, which is International Railway Forum; Speakers Corner .....) etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>NOTICE: NE2 had never announced on the papers as well etc. But based on the relocation of KTM station, it is clearly a starting point of NE2.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>The skipped from NE2 must be for a reason.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW, by not being near to the KTM station does not mean it does not near to the TRACKS along the stretch of the route. As the station will have to be closed down since the relocation and the station will be preserved for historical values (Which is way better than demolishing everything and everything), it means that the land no longer belonged to the Malaysian and it means if it the tracks were NOT demolished, they can built a NE2.</p>

              <p>Probably we could make a poll for the name of the station? Feel like naming it Tanjong Pagar Railway, or KTM... But I think names that may be accpeted by LTA are Cantonment, Keppel and Kampong Bahru (a bit far). Hopefully we don't get the Tan Kah Kee repeat incident. OT: I hope there is a re-naming of all stations event, then some stations really need to change name</p>

              <p><br>hoping too! dont like Tan Kah Kee.. it should be Coronation Station.. NE2 working name will be Kampong Bahru..<br><br>NE2 nearst place are Kampong Bahru, Keppel, Bukit Permei, Bukit Teresa, Sporttiswoode Park, Reaburn Park<br><br>i think the station name is Reaburn (Park) or Sporttiswoode (Park) other than Kampong Bahru</p>

              <p>Based on your prediction, let me analyze</p>
              <p>If LTA chose Option A, Keppel, then this NE2 will not be affected by the KTM relocation in the first place and they should have probably built a Woodleigh style and probably will open in 2030. (I cant see the use of this plot of land apart of PSA terminal, which somebody else had clamied that for CCL to connect from Marina Bay to Harbourfront will not earlier than 2027, as 2027 is the year where the land lease had ended)</p>
              <p>If LTA chose Option B, Kampong Bahru, yes they are seriously affected by the KTM tracks. So, I think this is more likely option, as it is also much nearer to residential areas as well.</p>

              <p>Dont be a retard can? People (Malaysians) are moving the station to Woodlands liao. So after that then built la (They move means they dont own the land liao and no need to ask permission. Only some idiots and noobs will ask permission de.). You are such a noob that deserve a ban / block in MSN.</p>
