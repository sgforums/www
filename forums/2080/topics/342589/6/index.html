              <p><strong><span>Circle Line fares will be the same as North-East Line: PTC</span></strong></p>
              <p>Fares for rides on the Circle Line or CCL, which will cut travel time by up to 27 minutes, will be the same as that on the North-East Line.</p>
              <p>When the 5 MRT stations on the CCL from Bartley to Marymount open on May the 28th, the Public Transport Council or PTC says more than 31,000 adult train trips per week will see fare reductions of 5 cents to 77 cents per week since they will travel shorter distances, with the new line.</p>
              <p>This represents savings of up to 48 per cent.</p>
              <p>When the CCL is fully opened, the PTC says more commuters will benefit as about 10 per cent to 15 per cent of trips that are currently made on some of the most heavily-loaded sections of the existing MRT lines are expected to move over to the CCL.</p>
              <p>With the opening of 5 stations on the CCL between Bartley and Marymount, there’ll be many more new inter-connections available between the North-South Line and the North-East Line.</p>
              <p>For a start, residents in the north and north-east will benefit as they will no longer need to make trips to the city centre in order to transfer to another MRT line.</p>
              <p>Bus commuters will also have more choices to make a faster journey.</p>

              <p><br>i think they took into account average transfer time for the 27min.</p>
              <p>yes, from Bishan to Lorong Chuan very fast, 2 min is possible, i think can even be slightly faster. because the MRT route is straight and direct, cutting through CTE, and doesnt follow any of the roads(AMK Ave 1, Braddell Road) used to go from bishan to lor chuan.</p>
              <p>just like from Bishan to Braddell stations, none of the roads are as direct as the underground mrt route.</p>

              <div> </div>
              Leong Wee Keat<br><br>weekeat@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>
              <div> </div>
              WHEN the first five stations of the Circle Line swing into operation two days early on May 28, you would shave as much as two-fifths off the time it takes to travel from Buangkok to Toa Payoh Hub, or 15 per cent off the fare.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              That’s because the journey using the new MRT line would be both 7 minutes quicker and cost 26 cents less than on the current train lines. And the Circle Line trip will take 18 minutes less than the direct bus Service 159, though the fare would be 14 cents more.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Overall, with the links that the new line will provide, more than 31,000 adult train trips per week would see fare reductions of between 5 and 77 cents. Commuters will also see travel time cut by as much as 27 minutes, depending on their origin and destination stations, said the Public Transport Council (PTC) yesterday.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Train fares on the new Circle Line will be the same as on the North-East Line (NEL), when service begins at Marymount, Bishan, Lorong Chuan, Serangoon and Bartley stations. Currently, a ride on the NEL costs 5 to 25 cents more than on the North-South and East-West lines.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Announcing this, the PTC noted that the projected unit operating cost of the Circle Line is at least 2.5 times that of the North-South and East-West lines, and similar to that of the NEL. Indeed, the Circle Line “is expected to operate at a loss in its initial years”, observed the council.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              On the five-station stretch, automated three-car trains — which can hold about 930 passengers each — will run every 3 to 4 minutes during the peak periods, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA).
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Boost for bus connectivity?
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Residents can take comfort in the authorities’ assurance that no basic bus route will be changed with the opening of the Circle Line stretch. When the NEL opened in 2003, at least 20 services were stopped or re-routed.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              And the good news, for those not within walking distance of the new stations: The LTA said a few private operators have expressed interest in providing bus services to some of the stations.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Cheery Bus Transport Service has applied to run a premium bus service linking Sin Ming Estate to Marymount MRT Station. The PTC is processing the application.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Bus Hub has also shown interest in running a service between Serangoon Gardens and Serangoon MRT.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              The operator has conducted a market study and is still exploring the possibility, said director V Anilan. Some factors he is mulling over: Market size, bus schedules and fares. “I’m careful about going in,” Mr Anilan told Today. “We don’t want to enter a service but close the route in less than a year.”
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              As for the Circle Line operator, when asked about the projected initial operating losses, SMRT Trains vice-president Vincent Tan said: “As the next four stages of the Circle Line complete and open progressively, we expect ridership to grow ... We expect Circle Line to be accretive when the entire line opens.”
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              By then, it is expected that about 10 to 15 per cent of trips currently made on the most heavily-loaded sections of the MRT network would have moved over to the Circle Line. </span></div>

              <p>from Serangoon to Orchard can take CCL and transfer at Bishan. zaobao says it takes 18 min to reach compared to 21 min taking NEL and transferring at Dhoby. i suspect both ways take about the same time and i dont believe can reach in 18 min because from Bishan to Orchard is already about 15 min. i dont know how they calculate the Serangoon to Orchard one as the press release only gave Buangkok to Toa Payoh and Bishan to Serangoon as examples.</p>

              <p><br>i used to take from Bishan to Orchard. its about 15 min excluding waiting time at bishan and including time for stopping at each station. from Bishan to City Hall is about 20 min.</p>
              <p>from Serangoon to Dhoby Ghaut is about 12 min. so their 21 min definitely took into account transfer time, and so should their 18 min take into account transfer time since they made a comparison. and fact is from Serangoon to Orchard even if dont take into account waiting time also cannot take 18 min so fast.</p>

              <p>ya, still needs passengers who directly access the CCL stations, because maybe some people may not like the idea of transferring and walking twice when going from, say AMK to Eunos, when they can just cross the platform at city hall, so even if the CCL route saves them some time, they may still choose not to take.</p>
