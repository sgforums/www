              <p>CCL is supposed to be medium density with 3 carriages and a smaller station compared to NEL, yet the CCL entrance at Serangoon near the bus interchange is much nicer than all the NEL entrances; its bigger and more grand... the other CCL entrance also looks nicer than all the NEL entrances. in fact both the CCL entrances are more accessible to the majority of the population in Serangoon compared to the NEL ones which are nearer to Serangoon Ave 1. </p>

              <p>Was there a CCL fault on monday?</p>
              <p>I was walking past Serangoon station when the station LED sign outside flashed "Train Service fomr BLY to MRM and MRM to BLY disrupted due to train fault" and another message "This train is not for passenger service"</p>
              <p>Anyone knows if this is real or just a test message? Its weird to have messages like "This train is not for passenger service" right at the station entrance...</p>
              <p>btw it was at 12 noon on monday 9 Mar. at both Serangoon entrances</p>

              Thats what i meant in a previous post that the CCL entrances are more accessible to the majority of population in Serangoon. Unless u live around Serangoon Ave 1(or near the yellow entrance), most people i believe, have to walk up the slope to the red entrance and i am quite sure many dont like it. when CCL open i(and i believe many others) will use the Entrance at Serangoon Ave 2 instead of walking all the way past the bus interchange and up the slope just to go to the Red NEL entrance.

              we definitely cant compare to Japan's system...it's way on a different level
              
              Japan's trains, especially in the central area, have to go at higher speeds to allow the insertion of more trains on the rail but there are definitely some segments of the tracks that have speed limits (taking the yamanote line for example, shinjuku to shibuya is probably like 70 to 80 while shinagawa to shinbashi is like 90 to 100)
              
              furthermore, singapore's mrt has not reached full capacity yet...not many people might agree with this view but from my opinion, it's definitely not on full capacity so there isnt a need to raise the train speed yet (that would definitely be a last resort without having to do any construction of new lines or railways)
              
              if we put Japan's lines aside, we can compare Hong Kong's; the tsuen wan line is probably very crowded during rush hour that i wasn't almost able to get a space big for my footing in the carriage...singapore's mrt carriages, however, is still squeezable in rush hour
              
              in short, the circle line is just for the sake of reaching more areas to encourage higher usage of the trains since the future plan is to gradually demote buses to a feeder level
              
              well, if circle line carriages are perpetually congested, the project to construct it is definitely a success ;)

              <p><br>oh ok thats good to hear... i think the CCL entrances are nicer than the NEL ones in general as they have a futuristic element to them... The entrance at serangoon  ave 2 are also quite big...</p>

              <p><br>fast? maybe 80 is fast but the trains, especially the NEL ones, hardly hit the max anyway... the NEL ones are usually at 60, at worse still the stretch from Little India to Dhoby used to be place where the trains went the fastest but after they installed the stupid moving advertisements they have decreased the speed tremendously so ppl can see those adverts longer! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>
              <p>adding to that the trains take suber long to come to a halt plus they enter the stations at a much slower speed compared to SMRT's trains. Even when the TO is driving they also take really really really long to stop a train.</p>
              <p>I hope its not an Alstom thing to be so slow as I don't want to see CCL as a slow train service...</p>

              <p>Five new MRT stations of the Circle Line or CCL, from Bartley to Marymount, will start operating from May the 28th.</p>
              <p>That’s two days earlier than originally scheduled.</p>
              <p>The Land Transport Authority says final testing of the electrical and mechanical systems have progressed smoothly.</p>
              <p>SMRT is the operator of the Circle Line.</p>
              <p>LTA Chief, Yam Ah Mee says both SBS Transit and SMRT won’t change any bus routes for now as a result of the opening.</p>
              <p>He adds that the two operators have determined that there’s already
              good connection between the bus and rail networks in this area.</p>
              <p>When more stages of the CCL open progressively from next year
              onwards, the LTA as the central bus network planner will review the
              need to adjust bus routes to improve bus- rail integration.</p>
              <p>However, LTA says a few private bus operators have expressed
              interest in providing bus services to some of the five CCL stations to
              further enhance the connectivity around the residential estates and the
              stations.</p>
              <p>One operator has already submitted an application to the Public
              Transport Council to operate a premium bus service to link Sin Ming
              Estate to Marymount Station.</p>
              <p>The application is currently being processed.</p>

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">Circle Line fares will be the same as North-East Line: PTC</span></strong></p>
              <p>Fares for rides on the Circle Line or CCL, which will cut travel
              time by up to 27 minutes, will be the same as that on the North-East
              Line.</p>
              <p>When the 5 MRT stations on the CCL from Bartley to Marymount open on
              May the 28th, the Public Transport Council or PTC says more than 31,000
              adult train trips per week will see fare reductions of 5 cents to 77
              cents per week since they will travel shorter distances, with the new
              line.</p>
              <p>This represents savings of up to 48 per cent.</p>
              <p>When the CCL is fully opened, the PTC says more commuters will
              benefit as about 10 per cent to 15 per cent of trips that are currently
              made on some of the most heavily-loaded sections of the existing MRT
              lines are expected to move over to the CCL.</p>
              <p>With the opening of 5 stations on the CCL between Bartley and
              Marymount, there’ll be many more new inter-connections available
              between the North-South Line and the North-East Line.</p>
              <p>For a start, residents in the north and north-east will benefit as
              they will no longer need to make trips to the city centre in order to
              transfer to another MRT line.</p>
              <p>Bus commuters will also have more choices to make a faster journey.</p>
