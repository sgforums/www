            <div class='col-md body'>It might be over judgemental to call such occurances as "mechanical faults".<br><br>As is the norm in mechanical and even aerospace engineering, there are always fields of tolerence, unless the problem is flagged as unsafe, it is still within the limits of safe and daily operations, so one need not read too much into such things.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>relac la... its not crap standards. I'm sure I know what are u talking about.<br><br>The constant thumping sound that is heard whenever the train is moving is caused by the wheels.<br><br>u have to understand that the wheels have to support 35 tonnes of mass excluding passenger weight and the non-peak trains grind metal between wheel and rail all day. the grinding causes the wheels to lose its round shape and that causes the noise.<br><br>Its perfectly safe dont worry and just go notice at any particular station. sometimes the train floor height is higher than the platform floor and sometimes its lower... if its higher it probably points that they changed the wheels.</div>

Banging sounds are caused when a train passes through a crossover track with different train frequencies, and that causes the banging sounds.<br><br>To date, there are a few 1G trains with rumbling sounds during travel. Extremely noisy.<br><br>093/094<br>107/108<br>127/128<br>131/132<br><br>And some more... I forgot a few of the numbers.<br><br>107/108 causes banging sounds when it passes by crossovers.<br><br>Maintainence? They do service the trains everyday, clean up, etc. How do you expect SMRT to keep changing gear frequencies? In fact, do they even have the machinery to hold it up? Stop grumbling. 1G trains are manufactured from 1986 ~ 1989, of course more problems surface from these trains. SMRT has tried to improve 1G commuter comfort standards by refurbishment, but I doubt there is any way they would be able to lift up the trains to change their gears... even then, do you know how much it costs for a set of gears?<br><br>Singaporeans simply love to complain. Trains in other countries have frequencies of like 15 mins per train, and NO ONE complains. People here complain when train frequencies during peak hours are like, 2 minutes? How fast do you want trains to go? 10 second per train?<br><br>Grow up, SMRT is already providing the best of the best service of trains to Singaporeans, compare this to other countries, whereby trains are super faulty, dirty floors, and the tracks are not filled with gravel stones. Then what do you want SMRT to do? Provide rocket trains that comes every 5 seconds?<br><br>Now...<br><br>1) Bishan platforms vibrate NOT BECAUSE of the train, come on... common sense tells you that next door they are building CCL stations for Bishan... that doesn't cause vibrations?<br><br>2) Air-con fault is understandable, because SMRT technicians are able to fix air-cons.<br><br>3) Come on, you mean trains from 10, 20 years ago still MUST run perfectly today? Technical faults do happen. It's just whether you're "lucky" enough to board a faulty train.<br><br>Please, stop complaining. Have some brains to know which things can be done, which can't. If you LOVE to complain so much, why not be a SMRT technician?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I find those flat wheel sounds make a train sound, although it may not be so in a positive way...<br>Quite alot of Japanese trains I took in their home country also have flat wheels, many tracks have heavy grades and snow/wet conditions, this increases by time. And those wheels cannot reuse again, its not like they can be re-grooved. New wheels have to be made, so cost increases too.<br>Flat wheels are subjected to monitoring, as long as they have not passed the standards, they can still run like a normal wheel.</div>
