              <em>By <strong>Leslie Lee</strong></em><br><br>It could be the highest rated Mediacorp reality show to date. It could become the most talked about SPH organised event ever.<br><br>No, it’s not Singapore Idol or the New Paper Big Walk.<br><br>I am talking about The Great SMRT Crush Load Challenge!<br><br>In light of SMRT CEO, Ms Saw Phaik Hwa’s theory that:-<br><br>“<em>Even at its most crowded, an SMRT train carries 1,400 passengers. This is “not crush load”, where a train is carrying more passengers than the standing load it is designed to carry under normal circumstances. Crush load happens when a train carries more than 2,000 passengers. People can board the train – it is whether they choose to.”</em><br><br>I would like to see the local mainstream media take up Ms Saw’s challenge to see if it is indeed possible (taking safety and some degree of comfort into account) to fit a maximum of 1,500 people into a single train service.<br><br>Ms Saw says that at 1,400 passengers, we still have a choice whether to board the train. So let’s try out that theory with a hundred more passengers, but yet not reach 2,000 (because that would be a “crush load”). We will put out a call for 1,490 willing participants for this challenge.<br><br>So why 1,490? Because I would like Ms Saw herself, together with the 9 other Directors on the Board of SMRT to be an integral part of this challenge by being passenger numbers 1,490 to 1,500.<br><br>How would this work? The mainstream media – either Mediacorp or SPH – together with SMRT – issues a call to action for 1,490 willing bodies of all ages, shapes and sizes (we need a cross section of people – from age 10 to 80 for this exercise) to take part by registering for this event.<br><br>On a designated day, time and venue, all 1,490 participants, together with the ten SMRT Directors will report to the train station (or depot, if we can, to make it easier for crowd and security control…we all know how secure SMRT depots are) to board the train.<br><br>Since there are a total of six cabins per train service, each cabin will try to board 250 passengers, with Ms Saw and fellow directors leading the way in the first cabin.<br><br>If we are able to squeeze all 1,500 passengers on board the train (again, without compromising security, safety and some degree of comfort), we will put Ms Saw’s theory to rest and not begrudge SMRT for their systems and processes with regards to passenger capacities.<br><br>However, in the event that even a single person is unable to board the train service, or an independent security company deems the service to be unsafe for all passengers, SMRT will provide each of the 1,490 participants with free travel on SMRT train services for one year.<br>What do we get out of this challenge?<br><br>Mediacorp gets a gripping, nail biting one-hour reality show, SPH gets great circulation for a day and SMRT/passengers get to prove a point.<br>Ms Saw and her team of Directors deserve nothing but the best efforts of all their customers to prove her theory right (or wrong, as the case may be).<br><br>SMRT’s website puts “customers, the environment, safety, security, community outreach, philanthropy and community outreach” as their corporate commitments. Lets put at least four of these to the test once and for all.<br><br>I would be quite curious to see how it all pans out.</div>

              <div id="post_message_2849704"><strong>Dear Ms Saw…  </strong><br><br><a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/author/theonlinecitizen/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #22229c;">theonlinecitizen</span></span></a> on July 1, 2010 <br><br><br><em>The following is an email which was sent to Ms Saw Phaik Hwa, CEO of SMRT Corporation, on 1 July 2010.</em><br><br><strong><img src="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/smrt320240.png" border="0" alt="">Dear Ms Saw,</strong><br>I refer to the Straits Times report, “SMRT: Tighter security will not mean higher fare”, on 27 June 2010.<br><br>Specifically, I refer to your remarks in these paragraphs as reported by the Straits Times:<br><br><em>As to what SMRT plans to do as trains seem to be maxing out their capacity, she said: “Trains will be crowded during peak hours. The question is, how crowded?”</em><br><br><em>She did not think that trains here are as packed as those in cities like Hong Kong, Taipei and Shanghai.</em><br><br><em>Even at its most crowded, an SMRT train carries 1,400 passengers, she said.</em><br><br><em>This is “not crush load”, where a train is carrying more passengers than the standing load it is designed to carry under normal circumstances.</em><br><br><em>Crush load happens when a train carries more than 2,000 passengers.</em><br><br><em>“People can board the train – it is whether they choose to,” she said.</em><br><br>As a regular user of public transport, especially the MRT trains, I am rather puzzled by your last remark in that Straits Times report mentioned above. Together with my friends and other commuters, our experiences seem to be opposed to your assertion – namely, that “people can board the train – it is whether they choose to.”<br><br>In my personal experience, I have at times had to let one, two or even three trains go by, because they were full and packed to capacity, before I could get onto one. Other commuters have also expressed similar experiences.<br><br>It is thus unfortunate that you seem to be laying the blame on commuters – that somehow we choose not to board trains which have space available.<br><br>I would like to ask how you arrived at that conclusion: 
              <ul>
              <li>When was the last time you took a train yourself – at peak hour? </li>
              <li>Is your assertion – that “people can board the train” – one that is borne out of personal experience? </li>
              <li>Are you aware that the situation of crowded trains has been one dating as far back as 2007? </li>
              <li>Are you asserting or claiming that commuters are to blame for trains being crowded?</li>
              </ul>
              Coincidentally, in the Straits Times report on the same day, it was reported that the Minister for Transport, Mr Raymond Lim, “shared commuters’ concern that the public transport system was getting more crowded…”<br><br>Do you share the minister’s and commuters’ concern?<br><br>We are glad that the minister gave the assurance that the operators are “aggressively increasing” the capacity of the trains.<br><br>And lastly, I would like to present to you some pictures taken by commuters. Please have a look at them and perhaps you could tell us if you expect commuters to squeeze themselves into the trains, packed as they are.<br><br>As your remarks were reported in a widely-read mainstream newspaper, and the matter is of public interest, this email to you will be published on the website which I run. It is called The Online Citizen and you can visit it by <a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/"><strong><em><span style="color: #16387c;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">clicking here</span></span></em></strong></a>.<br><br>I welcome your reply and would greatly appreciate it if you could explain your comments as reported by the Straits Times to our readers – who are users of SMRT’s trains – who might be offended by your remarks.<br><br>Your reply will be published on our website as well.<br><br>Thank you for your patience.<br><br>I look forward to your prompt reply.<br><br><em><strong>PS: This email is copied to Minister Lim.</strong></em><br><em>Regards,</em><br><em><strong><br>Andrew Loh</strong></em><br><em><br>Chief Editor, The Online Citizen</em></div>

              <p>You have to stand, though it is not as crowded as morning or evening peak period.  Probably around 70% of peak period numbers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <h2 class="posttitle">Why Saw Phaik Hwa has missed the point<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></h2>
              <div class="postmeta left"><span class="left"><a title="Posts by theonlinecitizen" href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/author/theonlinecitizen/">theonlinecitizen</a> on July 6, 2010</span></div>
              <div class="postmeta left"><strong>Andrew Loh</strong></div>
              <div class="postmeta left">
              <p><a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/saw.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-24639" title="saw" src="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/saw.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="220"></a>Ms Saw Phaik Hwa seems to have missed entirely the concerns which commuters may have about crowded trains and stations.  She seems to be of the opinion that the issue is simply about ferrying commuters from Point A to Point B in the shortest possible time. She seems to think that the solution is a rather simple one: that commuters should “push” themselves in if trains are crowded, as she admitted doing so herself.</p>
              <p>She is missing bigger concerns here – the safety and security of our trains and stations.</p>
              <p>While overcrowding has given rise to frustrations and unhappiness among commuters who hope to get to their destination in time in a fairly comfortable manner, transport operators should be more aware of the safety and security concerns which are exacerbated by packed trains and stations.</p>
              <p>For a start, the more people there are in a station, for example, the harder it would be for security personnel to spot would-be trouble-makers, terrorists included.</p>
              <p>Just a few days ago, I was at Orchard station with a friend. Both of us were looking for security features or security personnel. There were virtually none. And this is the situation not only at Orchard station. The same is seen elsewhere, in particular City Hall, Jurong East, Yishun, etc.</p>
              <p>The crowds inside these stations are substantial.</p>
              <p>My friend and I at Orchard station asked ourselves, “What if a bomb went off here?” The consequences would be terrible for sure – but it would be exacerbated given that stations are bursting at the seams, packed as they are with commuters.</p>
              <p>There would not only be casualties from the explosion itself but also inevitably from the resulting stampede of people.</p>
              <p>And then remember this: it is not one crowded station we are talking about here. It is virtually all major stations throughout Singapore. Each of them is a convenient target for terrorists who, one can imagine, would target stations which have the most number of people, for maximum impact.</p>
              <p>And with the many stations which are overcrowded, security personnel are stretched to the maximum as well.</p>
              <p>In 2008, Law Minister and Second Minister for Home Affairs, Mr K Shanmugam, admitted this in Parliament:</p>
              <p><em>“Our Home Team officers at the front line are stretched and strained over a high alert that started since end 2001.  The total number of overtime hours ICA ground officers at the checkpoints have to put in every month to cope with the volume of work varies between 23,000 and 28,000 overtime hours.”</em></p>
              <p>According to Mr Shanmugam, “the volume and scope of work have greatly expanded, with increased population, tourist arrivals and more international events which require higher security coverage.”</p>
              <p>In 2009, Workers’ Party chairman and Non-constituency MP, Ms Sylvia Lim, again highlighted the concern. Without counting the added demands of having the casinos, she said, “this study confirmed work overload and understaffing in several areas, even before the casinos are functional.” She was referring to the Ministry of Home Affairs’ own study, “Human Factors”, on operational fatigue on the officers of the Home Team.</p>
              <p>What about Transcom, the security outfit which was set up in 2008 to specifically deal with transport security?</p>
              <p>Overcrowded stations and trains are death traps.</p>
              <p>How much have we learned from the bombings of London and Madrid? Or have we learned anything at all? And contrary to what the government has said, security of our stations and depots are not, should not and must not be the responsibility of the transport operators.</p>
              <p><img class="alignright" title="mrt19" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Public%20Transport/MRT%20Trains/pkchukissjurongeast.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="225">And how well-prepared our security personnel are, is an open question, going by what the Law Minister himself said.</p>
              <p>I do not recall Ms Saw showing or being concerned about this matter. She seemed to be more concerned about the “maintenance” of the trains themselves!</p>
              <p>In light of the recent security breaches at Changi depot and the escape of terrorist-suspect Mas Selamat, one wonders how seriously the authorities take security issues.</p>
              <p>If ever a bomb should go off – and this is no far-fetched imagination as the Jemaah Islamyah’s targeting of Yishun station has shown – no amount of “review” of our security system would comfort the families and those who are victims.</p>
              <p>The arrogant attitude of Ms Saw, as displayed through her remarks about crowded trains, leaves one wondering if she is the right person for the job – or if she is even aware of the wider implications of overcrowded stations and trains.</p>
