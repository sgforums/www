              <p>SINGAPORE: Commuters on the North-South Line on Tuesday morning (Nov 14) were affected by delays during rush hour, with stations announcing a train fault near Toa Payoh.<br><br>Facebook user WB LM posted that he boarded the train at Sembawang before 6.40am and the train was moving normally, but it stopped for about three to five minutes at each station. He reached Khatib at 6.53am, he said. The estimated travel time between the two stations, according to the TransitLink website, is usually six minutes.<br><br>There was an estimated 15 minutes' delay in travel time from Yishun to City Hall, he added.</p>
              <p>WB LM also said his train cabin was leaking water at two spots.<br><br>The delay persisted for more than an hour, with multiple commuters taking to social media to post about announcements estimating delays of between 10 and 20 minutes along the line.<br><br>As of 8.50am, SMRT had not posted any updates about the train fault on its social media channels.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: Commuters on the East-West Line (EWL) reported a delay in their travels during the evening rush hour on Wednesday (Nov 22), with some reporting announcements of a track fault near Clementi MRT station.<br><br>"I heard on the intercom that there was a track fault near Clementi, and to expect an extra 10 minutes of travel to Jurong," said commuter Mr Alvin Chong.</p>
              <p>Others subsequently reported announcements warning of an additional 20 minutes' travel time towards Jurong East.</p>
              <p>Twitter account MRT Train Delays reported that the stretch between Queenstown and Jurong East MRT stations was affected.<br><br>Others complained about the lack of updates on transport operator SMRT's social media accounts.<br><br>As of 7.10pm, there was still no announcement on SMRT Twitter's page.<br><br>Channel NewsAsia has reached out to SMRT for a response.</p>
              <p>"This is probably nothing in light of what happened in the last few days, but just shows we have to adapt to a new normal," said commuter Mr Clement Tan, a communications professional who boarded the train in the central business district area. "I guess it's a sign that we have reached the likes of London and New York then, first-world cities must have train faults and reduced weekend schedules."<br><br>The delays come after several MRT-related incidents in recent months, including a train collision at Joo Koon MRT station that left 38 injured last week and a flooding along a North-South Line tunnel in October that saw service disrupted for about 20 hours.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: A train fault on the Downtown Line (DTL) caused travel delays on train services from Bukit Panjang to Expo stations for about 40 minutes during the morning rush hour on Thursday (Dec 21).<br><br>SBS Transit said on its official Twitter account at around 7.50am that train service on the line was delayed from Downtown station towards Expo station, and that commuters should add 10 minutes to their travel time.<br><br>It said at around 8am that full service had resumed.<br><br>The delays were said to be caused by a defective train at Downtown station that had to be pushed out of the DTL, resulting in train service disruption from Bugis to Bendemeer stations, according to SBS Transit's senior vice president for corporate communications Tammy Tan.</p>
              <p>A Channel NewsAsia reader who did not want to be named said he boarded the train at Bukit Panjang MRT station at around 7am, but the train did not move off and an announcement was made 10 minutes later telling commuters to alight.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: There is no train service on parts of the Bukit Panjang LRT due to a train fault, operator SMRT said on Thursday (Jan 18). <br><br>The affected stretch is between Choa Chu Kang and Phoenix stations. Train service on the Bukit Panjang loop is unaffected. <br><br>SMRT said in a Facebook post at 4.10pm that their engineering staff were attending to the fault. <br><br>Free bus and bridging bus services were activated.</p>
              <p>Tweets from commuters showed that the delay started as early as 3.34pm. <br><br>One commuter, Lee Shi Min, first said that the train she was taking had not been moving for the past 10 minutes.</p>
              <p>At 4.08pm, she sent out another tweet, this time saying that the "LRT broke down" and that SMRT "did not make an announcement".</p>
              <p>Another commuter said he was stuck on the LRT for about 20 minutes in a tweet sent at 3.50pm.</p>
              <p>Ms Wong Chooi Yoke, 38, told Channel NewsAsia that when she reached Jelapang station at 3.30pm, there was a train at the platform. But the train did not move, and after 15 minutes of waiting, she decided to exit the station and take a bus instead. <br><br>"There was no announcement. I had to call them using the ticket intercom ... No free shuttle bus was arranged at the time when I left," Ms Wong added. <br><br>In a subsequent tweet sent out at 4.54pm, SMRT said that the fault was cleared and "normal train services" across the Bukit Panjang LRT were being restored. <br><br>Free regular bus services and bridging bus services were made available until 5pm, SMRT added.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: Train service on the North-South Line on Wednesday (Feb 14) morning was affected by delays over a four-hour period due to maintenance work being carried out by rail operator SMRT. <br><br>At 5.45am, SMRT announced on Twitter that south-bound trains were travelling slower near Raffles Place MRT station. <br><br>It added that commuters travelling before 10am should add 20 minutes more to their travelling time from Ang Mo Kio to Raffles Place stations.</p>
              <p>In a Facebook post, it explained that the trains would be travelling slowly while approaching Raffles Place "for the safety of commuters". <br><br>"We are sorry for the delay and the inconvenience you experienced," it added. <br><br>More than three hours later, SMRT updated that the additional travelling time had decreased to 10 minutes from Ang Mo Kio to Raffles Place. <br><br>However, it said that maintenance work was still ongoing.</p>
              <p>At around 10am, SMRT said that normal train service had resumed.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: A "power fault" disrupted Light Rail Transit (LRT) services along the Sengkang West loop on Friday (Feb 16).<br><br>The fault caused a Light Rail Vehicle (LRV) to stall at about 11.10am as it approached Sengkang Town Centre (STC) station, said SBS Transit in a statement. <br><br>Videos posted online on the first day of Chinese New Year showed passengers stepping out of the LRV and walking along the track. An eyewitness also reported hearing a "loud boom" before seeing the vehicle "stalled on the track".<br><br>"At the time of the incident, a loud noise was heard due to a dislodged power collector shoe on the LRV. This caused the LRV to stall immediately as a safety feature," said SBS Transit's senior vice-president for corporate communications, Ms Tammy Tan.<br><br>"Our staff quickly attended to the situation and helped the 15 commuters on board to detrain safely so that they could get to the nearby STC station. <br><br>"Another LRV was used to help push the defective LRT out of the line so that service on the Sengkang West Inner loop could resume," she added. <br><br>Service resumed at 1pm. <br><br>SBS Transit also highlighted that the Sengkang West Outer loop was operating during this period, serving the same stations. <br><br>"We apologise to affected commuters for the inconvenience caused. Meanwhile, we are investigating the cause of the fault," said Ms Tammy.</p>

              <p>Shortly after, the delay was increased to 25 minutes. At 6.45pm, this was increased again to 35 minutes.<br><br>Free bus services between Novena and Marina South Pier were available, SMRT added in a separate tweet.<br><br>A commuter named Mr Kannan told Channel NewsAsia that passengers were not able to enter the trains at Newton station as they were packed. <br><br>Mr Kannan added that it was so crowded he had to miss five trains.<br><br>While SMRT's announcement said that the delay was for travel towards Marina South-Pier, the journey in the opposite direction towards Woodlands was also affected, said Mr Kannan.</p>
              <p>Commuter Harvinder Singh, an education officer, told Channel NewsAsia that when he arrived at the platform at Dhoby Ghaut station at about 6.20pm, he noticed that the platform doors had "malfunctioned".<br><br>"SMRT are handling it well though ... trains slowing down to ensure passenger safety, and SMRT staff ensuring that passengers keep clear of the openings," the 30-year-old said.<br><br>He said the platform was "not that crowded yet", and that there was the "normal rush hour crowd", but that this was "building up".</p>

              <h1 class="article__title">Passengers walk on tracks after train fault on Bukit Panjang LRT</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Several stranded commuters, including those with young children, had to walk on the train tracks on Saturday (May 19) after a train fault on the Bukit Panjang Light Rail Transit (BPLRT) brought services to a halt. <br><br>Train service was disrupted for nearly two hours.</p>
              <p>In a tweet at around 2.20pm, SMRT said there was no train service on 
              the BPLRT due to a “train fault” between Phoenix and Bukit Panjang 
              station.</p>
              <p>In a subsequent tweet at around 2.50pm, SMRT said that 
              Train Service A had resumed and that its engineers were working to 
              recover Train Service B. </p>
              <p>At around 3.50pm, SMRT said the train fault was cleared and that Train Service B was "gradually being restored".</p>
              <p>In photos submitted by a Channel NewsAsia reader, passengers can be seen walking on the train tracks. A woman can also be seen carrying her young child as she made her way to the nearest station.<br><br>A passenger who was on the affected train told Channel NewsAsia that the LRT  was “stuck” between Phoenix and Bukit Panjang station for about 20 minutes before an engineer came to their rescue.</p>
              <p>After 10 minutes of 
              “troubleshooting”, the passenger said the engineer allowed them to walk 
              along the track to Bukit Panjang station. The passenger also noted that 
              the train cabin was “very hot” as there was no air conditioning during 
              that period.</p>
              <p>In March, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said the upcoming replacement of LRT vehicles and renewal of signalling systems on the BLPRT will improve passenger service.<br></p>
