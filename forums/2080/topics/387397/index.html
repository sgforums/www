              <p>Whether a C151 or a C651(in its current unrefurb-ed state) was faster?</p>

              <p>A C651 after refurbisment would most likely be faster.</p>

              <p>Acceleration and speed is largely dependent on inverter and the motor. Motor has a rated power output at a certain rpm (revolutions per minute). That you cannot alter anyway you like or risk destroying the whole motor by overloading the coils.</p>
              <p>Inverter wise controls the voltage and current, how fast it reaches the motor and the efficiency. This also talks about the speed the rising current reaches the motor, so the faster the current rises the more acceleration there would be produced.</p>
              <p>Factoring in the friction from the wheels, resistance in the components etc... Much power would be compromised by the time you feel the train move off.</p>
              <p>With the same components, a simple solution to increase the performance would be make the train lightweight. Lightweight train cars coupled with the same motors can make the train go faster.</p>
              <p>So internal decorations, floorboard components, walls etc can be stripped and simplified to make the train lighter. Bogies can also be modified to lightweight ones to increase performance. All these however, will compromise safety, in the event of an accident, protection for occupants would decrease.</p>
              <p>Some extra talk, pardon me for going long-winded...</p>
              <p>When investigating the JR West Amagaseki (2005-04-25) accident, investigators thought that lightweight trains are the main cause for them to buckle in a crash. In the accident, the third car was forced upwards and then buckled in the middle when crashed in the building side, causing the most deaths in the train. However this theory was rebutted when an accident at a slightly lower speed occurred to the JR East Series 485 - 3000 express train later that year.</p>
              <p>Compared to the Amagaseki accident train (JR West Series 207), the JNR-era Series 485 was built like a tank. Non-motor cars weight over 30 tons, and motor cars are 44 tons. Compared to the 20 - 30 ton weight of the Series 207, this is considered heavy. However in the accident the first train car, a non-motor control car, buckled at the roof when impacted against a building. Thus this showed that impacts at angles would not matter whether the vehicle is heavyweight and thick or lightweight and thin. Roof and wall components are equally weak compared to the floorboard/chassis.</p>
