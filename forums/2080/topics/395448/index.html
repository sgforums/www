              <p>Hi guys this is a little redundant, but being someone with sensitive ears, I'd like to ask if anybody has noticed a flattened bell tone when NEL trains <span style="text-decoration: underline;">pull into</span> some stations?</p>
              <p>I only frequent between SER and DBG so I don't have the time to notice other stations. This is the usual bell chime, in the key of G major broken chord (G D B G D for those who can read notes)</p>
              <p>Particularly when trains pull into Little India and Potong Pasir for both directions, the bell chime sounds lower! A semitone down to be exact: (F# C# A# F# C#).</p>
              <p>For those with musically inclined ears, do have a listen! I can't figure out why these stations have a lower bell chime than usual!</p>

              <p>It's not called bell tone , it's called chime.</p>
              <p>I also noticed it , they are played at Chinatown , Little India , Potong Pasir , Hougang stations. One more thing is that the chime is played every three stations , NE4 , NE7 , NE10 , NE14 (not counting NE11). After this low chime , they will play a "Please do not lean against the doors." annoucement.</p>

              <p>I pass Potong Pasir MRT Station everyday coming home from school, and I agree with you, though I have never heard it while passing Little India before.</p>

              <p>SMRT 32373238, are you a pianist by any chance or have perfect
              pitch?</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>From what I hear(I have perfect pitch), it is 7/8 of a semitone,
              not a full semitone... A bit "off" from F-sharp though...</p>

              <p>Hey Fryderyk, yea I'm a pianist, but I'm not perfect pitch... U got the term wrong there... You can't say 7/8 of a semitone as 'semitone' is used to describe 1 single step <span style="text-decoration: underline;">between 2 notes</span>... That would mean that the notes are all out-of-tune from each other!</p>
              <p>Hmmmm I can't judge what is 7/8 though... according to orchestra tuning of 440Hz or concert band tuning of 442Hz? Its relative haha</p>
              <p>I've heard real-sounding MIDI though... There exist some patches of MIDI sound that actually sound kinda real... the format depends on what the sound is recording/converted to... I used to compose in MIDI format and convert it to mp3 =)</p>
              <p>You musician too?</p>

              <p>The entire soundtrack for that matter, is 7/8 of a semitone flat. The entire thing.<br>All notes. So that terminology is correct.</p>
              <p>Yes I'm a pianist.<br>It's hard to say exactly that is the Hz, but I can safely say it is around 7/8 of a semitone flat. Got to be just a few Hz.</p>

              <p>I do composing on GarageBand(I use a Ã¯Â£Â¿)... Can definitely tell the diff between MIDI and even MP3/4/avi.

              <p>Hmmmm so by saying a sound is 7/8 a semitone flat you also mean it could be 1/8 of a semitone sharp? take a C. 7/8 of a flattened C is also 1/8 of a sharpened B.</p>
              <p>And what constitutes a real C? I don't think one can comprehend a 'real' C. To Europeans who use 440Hz tuning, a 442Hz C is very sharp. To an American, a 440Hz C is flat... Its all relative!</p>
              <p>Wow i didn't know that MIDI format can be distinguished from mp3. What if my MIDI sound is recorded in mp3 format would it be distinguishable? I couldn't tell the diff last time when i tried...</p>

              <p>I pass Potong Pasir MRT Station everyday coming home from school, and I agree with you, though I have never heard it while passing Little India before.</p>
              <p>Though I am more concerned that when passing by Woodleigh Station, without fail, there will be an EXCESSIVELY LOUD and annoyingÂ chime to remind us about the prohibition of eating and drinking on the train or something of that sort.</p>

              <p><br>When from Potong Pasir to Woodleigh that chime u talking about, is the one which is actuallyÂ inÂ F# major(original, not flattened)</p>
              <p>as for the flattened tone in question, i guess that it is here to stay since until now it is still not corrected.</p>
              <p>my guess for why this thing happen(as nobody has reallyÂ mentioned about any reason), is because they edit the clip to slow it down a bit. and if u decrease the speed of the whole thing, the pitch is affected too. and the person who edit the clip did not bother to separate the G major chime from the voice which is suppose to be slowed down.</p>
              <p>those with good ear can try to listen to the whole clip carefully and see if there is any slight decrease in speed(or if the voice of the announcer is somewhat lower in pitch). if not, then my guess is wrong of course. this is the only possible reason i can think of.</p>
