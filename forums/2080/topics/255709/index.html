Clearly it was not a situation where there was any premeditation. What happened was a split-second impulsive act. And it's unlikely to happen again. He's calmed down a lot, and he's healthier."<br><br>Kwong has also apologised to his 26-year-old ex-girlfriend Jenny Low Siew Mui over the incident.<br><br>He had pushed Jenny off the platform and into the path of an oncoming train, following a quarrel in which he refused to break up with her.<br><br>Jenny, who is also a Malaysian, managed to dash across the tracks to safety.<br><br>Kwong, who came to Singapore as an ASEAN scholar, has since promised not to hound Jenny in future.<br><br>Shashi Nathan, Kwong's lawyer, said: "We conveyed his apology by way of a letter, and she has accepted the apology. So we wanted to inform the court he's contrite, and he's genuinely remorseful for what he's done. He wants to start his life anew, he has his brother and sister, his parents to go back to. This is just a painful part of his life and he wants to put it behind and get on with his life." - CNA/ir</div>

I saw everyone gathering at the front of the train so I went there to have a look. I saw a guy walking quite far away and I saw two MRT staff chasing after the guy. I have no idea how come he can go down to the track and the MRT staff take so long to respond - because the distance between the guy and the MRT staff was quite far away. I saw the guy was walking and the MRT staff were running.</span>"<br><br>Mr Low said the train started moving again after about 10 minutes.<br><br>He described what he saw at Tanah Merah MRT Station.<br><br>"<span style="font-style: italic;">I saw the guy and the two MRT staff accompanying the guy towards Tanah Merah Interchange. He looked quite normal walking with the MRT staff at his side. He's quite calm, quite peaceful walking.</span>"<br><br>SMRT has verified that the train service had been deactivated at about 3.10pm today because of this incident.<br><br>Trains between Eunos and Tanah Merah MRT stations were suspended for about 20 minutes.<br><br>SMRT says the man, in his 20s, has since been detained by the police.</div>
