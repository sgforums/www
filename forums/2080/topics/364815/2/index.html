              <p>secondly-NEL,EWL lines if they should be automated..their existing TOs most likely might be converted to CSO..so it saves them some manpower on that part..if also means that they might have the manpower they need for NEL/EWL..so almost no chance of recruitment there..only can get posted there..but also small chance too.</p>
              <p>so either way you look at it..other than TO as in Technical officer( where  it is all maint job)..your choice to go in to SMRT just to operate trains might seem highly limited..the CSO is the only closest post to that job, and CCL or DTL CSO will be the only available opening for you..be it if you like it or not...your choice here is still stuck to this 2 lines for now.</p>

              <p>so either way you look at it..other than TO as in Technical
              officer( where  it is all maint job)..your choice to go in to
              SMRT just to operate trains might seem highly limited..the CSO is
              the only closest post to that job, and CCL or DTL CSO will be
              the only available opening for you..be it if you like it or
              not...your choice here is still stuck to this 2 lines for now.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Which means that, in the future NEL and EWL are going to be automatic train? No long have TO/CSO operating?</p>
              <p>In that case, how am i going to apply for the job if there's no TO post? CSO is the only choice? But CSO job is service the customer right? No other choice?</p>
