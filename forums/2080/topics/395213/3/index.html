              <p>This is why I am all for to flame the SM(RT) things. It looks ricdiculous to me anyway, bcoz a terrorist can simply go there and spot everything / participate in events like CCLD (Or similar in other lines) and board DNBs in Tai Seng (Happen in the event itself due to confusion between crowds, take a chance! Must got guts --- "Dhoby Ghuts") etc in order to plan a place to blow up a particular station as he / she liked.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: OT a bit, but one time, all the 8 CSOs went to board a DNB train to get the crowd out of the train in Tai Seng, but as the crowd were confused and the time interval to close the doors were simply too short, it came with little result. I was one of them who managed to board on it and it went to...... Tai Seng Slidings (Towards Depot). This had resulted a serious unbalance of number of available staff, which is why by the time when the train returns to Tai Seng again, all of them simply run towards the other (next) terminating train in order to assist the only remaining CSO to get the passengers / visitors out of the train. They have some conversation or what, which later resulted into better management to get the crowd out of the terminating trains.</p>

              <p>Looks like in the past few posts Mr Samuel Lee had stirred up another issue. I appreciate his curiosity in exploring do-not-board (off service) trains to see slidings and etc, but here being Singapore and even if this is not Singapore, certain rules in society have to be followed.</p>
              <p>Lets take crossing the road, just like that, yes there are no signs saying you cannot cross the road at some places, but crossing the road by looking left and right and left again versus crossing the road using your ears only versus, crossing the road not looking because you will hear a horn before you start to run and miss any car coming towards you. Which is the safer method, taking you can choose any of the three.</p>
              <p>While the staff spent extra effort trying to ask people out of the train during the Discovery session, you added their workload by boarding the train, knowing fully as a train enthusiast that you should not do so. <strong>Can you still say that you are a train enthusiast?</strong> Quite similar to Japanese train-nuts who open their tripods on the platform, shout and scream at passengers, staff and <em>other trains</em> to get out of their cameras and photographs to get a 'clear' shot!</p>
              <p>Regarding ill-intending persons able to participate in events like Discovery and open house to plan their ill-intending acts, why not think about this, they can remain in the comfort of their hideout using only pictures that the visitors posted to plan their attack? Same as what Willis is trying to tell you guys here, refrain from shooting pictures and videos for a while, is to let the heat die down, no new photos for those persons to work on etc.</p>
              <p>Remember the good-intentions that some members put forward here, they are not being paranoid or what, but to keep ourselves out of the trouble, before trouble catches up with you for doing something. There are <strong>no solid rules or regulations saying no photography</strong>, yes no signs either, <strong>but knowing that persons as early as 2006 have been caught and questioned in detail</strong> about photography at stations, terminals and interchanges, would make you think whether you should consider these advices.</p>
              <p>Thank you for reading through.</p>
