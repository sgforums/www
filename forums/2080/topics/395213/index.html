              <p><br>There is really no black and white about the photography rule, but my advise is ONLY take when there is no MRT Staff or MRT Police. As long as you don't get caught is ok, but thats your own rule to safeguard yourself.</p>
              <p>But, take a look at it this way. You are taking photo at a place where the staffs are in-charge, so you have to follow what they say. Metaphorically speaking, if you go to people house, you'd listen to your friend about where to go, what to do etc.. Same goes to the station.. You are their place, you play by their rules.</p>
              <p>Nontheless, please ask the Station Manager on duty, BEFORE, doing any photo-taking at the stations, just to be on the safe side.</p>

              <p>But as I stated on top, either they do it all the way that hurt your pride (The train fan's pride or confidence etc), that says a big NO, and that IS their safe side, or they allow you (The train fan's request) BUT, they are risking themselves either. This makes you feel good, not only on request granted side, but you think that you have ask already, feel no guilty or "I can answer to my heart already" (é—®å¿ƒæ— æ„§), but the back other side of the story that the station manager will say is another question, which is something that many people do not understand, resulted in earlier flamewar.

              <p>Yes, that is adult, but some of the train fans are minors that no more than secondary kids. So adults may treat them differently? Now get out of my elite uncaring face before I flamed and even if I flamed previously, I dont use such word as of yet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And you are right, since they dont care, I also dun give a care as well, dont ask and shoot. Simple, they are not SMRT shareholder as well, so they dont own it. And you are also spoiling my mood.</p>

              <p><br>Based on past experience, CCLD won't bring you to KCD, unless there is a change this year. Haha, but I doubt so.</p>
              <p>The KCD Open House was opened to all SMRT Staffs &amp; Families..So we took a train from Bishan to KCD. Also got a tourguide that brought us all around the depot, including the OCC.</p>
