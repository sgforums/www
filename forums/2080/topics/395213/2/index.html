              <p>Yes, that is adult, but some of the train fans are minors that

              <p>There is no damn need for you to refer to me as "SQ 006", you
                  know perfectly well that is derogatory term, having so many people
                  perished in that accident. Everyone knows exactly what you are
                  hinting at. And what the heck is "sudo".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your English seriously needs improving. And btw, what you are
                  doing constitutes trolling. If you have unsubstantial and
                  unverified info and want to launch your own ideology and rant about
                  SMRT's customer service, do it with them, we don't need to hear
                  your politicisation.</p>

              <p>"And I do not u to judge who like / hate me as well."<br> What the heck is that? Do not me to judge? What nonsense.</p>

              <p>I never said I was smart. You were the one who started this

              <p>Ok, but some other numbers apart of 006, such as 007 also can. That is nothing much. (Edited Note: "Me" can put a what number, suggestion please, as SQ = Excuse)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, do research what is "su" means and then compare the meaning of "su" and "sudo", do research please.</p>
              <p>&lt;Note:&gt;OT for the su and sudo, because both are Linux commands on super user / root (Equivalent to Windows' Administrator), which depends on various Linux distros. However, su can means Shut up, without the "TF" mentioned by somebody above. Since he think he "so admin", then i bet he is using su and sudo commands. I hope this can clarify the intention.</p>
