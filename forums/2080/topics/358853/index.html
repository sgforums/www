              <p>Share yours! Don't be shy... :P</p>
              <p>I'll share mine. The most embarassing thing was being "kiap" between the train doors at Dhoby Ghaut Harbourfront Bound platform on the 1st day of the NEL passenger svc. That caused the PSDs and the train doors to reopen and everyone was looking at me. -_- Was quite a painful experience though.</p>

              <p>Nothing but the truth. I am cautious of my own behaviour. :)</p>
              <p>Happened to take a north bound train some time this year, and coincidentally saw a big sized train fan standing in the crowded train, same carriage. Since I don't know him well, and I decided not to approach him. Then I heard a loud fart sound, and everyone turned around to find out who did it. So I knew who he was. He did nothing else other than staring at the crowd, not even a simple apology.</p>
              <p>I alighted and wait for the next train to continue my journey. Other than my real life experience, I also heard similar cases of this train fan farting on buses. Alright, its getting disgusting. I will not name this person in front of so many people. Those who know who, let's not shame.</p>
              <p>I was glad I wasn't too close to him or I might feel so embarassed. :x</p>
              <p>My simple advice, please control your diet, eat more fruits for better disgestion. :)</p>

              <p>At City Hall, when the train door opens on the left instead of the right.</p>
              <p>I was standing at the side of the door with my bag on the floor (leaning against the glass panel) in a C651. When the train doors closed, the door got jammed! Reason? Because a part my bag got stuck and the train doors could not close. I was afraid then that the train would leave without this door closing, but luckily a kind soul assisted me in pulling out the jammed part, and after that the doors closed and the train left as per normal.</p>

              <p>I alighted and wait for the next train to continue my journey. Other than my real life experience, I also heard similar cases of this train fan farting on buses. Alright, its getting disgusting. I will not name this person in front of so many people. Those who know who, let's not shame.</p>
              <p>I was glad I wasn't too close to him or I might feel so embarassed. :x</p>
              <p>My simple advice, please control your diet, eat more fruits for better disgestion. :)</p>
