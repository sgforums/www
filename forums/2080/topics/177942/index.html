I don't think it's the Downtown Extension. It will probably come far in the future. I've not heard LTA mention about CCL6's planned route before.

Both may not be accurate. There're 4 stations (excluding its route-split station). It doesn't go onto Pulau Serangoon (aka Coney Island). I don't think it needs a middle platform ba... BP6 Bukit Panjang Station managed to be a route-split station for quite a few routes without requiring an additional platform.</div>
