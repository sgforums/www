              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Been reading this forum on and off for years, very informative.</p>
              <p>Just curious about what you are allowed to take photos of in Singapore.</p>
              <p>I visit Singapore a few times a year and use trains and buses extensively.</p>
              <p>Recently while walking around one evening, I started taking photos with my phone of one of the nearly completed new stations on this line. There was a mesh fence around the station entrance and I took some photos of the entrance. While there was an open gap in the fence I didn't go through it.</p>
              <p>While I was there a man in cargo shorts and a white polo shirt ran over from the other side of the road and demanded to know if I was with the contractor, or if I was a government employee. I told him no, so he asked why I was taking photos. I told him I was a tourist and interested in transport, true. He told me there were many tourists and people who took photos and he was employed to stop them.</p>
              <p>He asked me to delete my photos in front of him which I did because I had no interest in getting in trouble over a few photos. He said I was allowed to take a photo of the station name but nothing under constuction. Seemed odd to me but did he really have the right to stop me? Is there some law in Singapore about taking such photos? I can't see how it would be a security issue because you can go to Google Maps and see the entrance to any MRT station you like. Interested to hear from any locals about this.</p>

              <p>If he is a security officer he should be in uniform and also have an ID badge. Were you taking photos of the station entrance from across the street?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I forsee a possible round of bus service rationalisation with DTL3 turning operational. Possible changes lie ahead for Routes 65, 67, 171 and 700.</p>

              <p>Hi Iveco,</p>
              <p>No uniform like I would expect an SMRT employee to be wearing. Maybe he worked for the construction contractor as a security guard? His white polo shirt had a red and blue logo on it, something like the letters MRA maybe. I should have asked for ID but was caught off guard by his totally unexpected approach. The way he spoke sounded official, like it wasn't the first time he had done this. For a second I thought about challenging him to call the police if I really was doing anything wrong but then I decided that might not be such a good idea.</p>
              <p>I was taking photos from the public footpath, right outside the mesh fencing but not tresspassing as far as I am aware. There was no signage I saw about photography being banned and I don't understand why it would be. After all, the station is on a main road. He said he was employed to stop people taking photos. Seems like a strange job to have outside a train station that will open in a few months time.</p>
