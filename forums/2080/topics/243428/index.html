            <div class='col-md body'>Not to mention only the top 10 lah, we have an auto system and yet we cannot achieve much, ppl in other places like Japan, London and New York have to place their hands firmly on one or two handles for hours on end and can even exceed our standards, talking about standards, not even basic ones can be reached, like 40-60 seconds for peak hours, thats like so basic of frequencies...<br>Guys who went to open house last week should know that our system is fully auto, means that unless there are dire acts of God, we won't be seeing trains crashing into each other. So why worry so much, just let the trains run. 40-60 seconds as mentioned don't demand much, but can carry more people at one time, and at least less complains will arise...<br>Talk about manual systems, they can acheive 30 seconds frequency in peak hours (Tokyo Metro, JR Yamanote Line, London and other subway/urban train systems), and all that separates life and death is the control stick, so isn't that a more dire situation?<br>We can and are able to do more...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I got send SMRT about the frequency problem and they replied. We are already improving our frequency. One word I don't think so, sometimes waiting at Admiralty Station for a South Bound train can take 7 minutes. Come on SMRT you have 15 trains in the depot resting and sleeping. Bring them out and put them on service.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
