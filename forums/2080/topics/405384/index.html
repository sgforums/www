              <p>Would like to highlight this potentially damaging advert ran by 100 Plus' advert agency. Took this photo few months ago, but only recently managed to dig it out. It has been placed at train stations and some buses(one DM3500 confirmed had this ad sometime ago).</p>
              <p><img src="http://i401.photobucket.com/albums/pp100/hengpenghock/PlagiarisedAdvertisement.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Don't know what is plagiarized? Ok I'll tell you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. The train.</p>
              <p>The train used is Deutsche Bahn's InterCityExpress ICE 3 / T / TD, which is that in the picture. It is so damn obvious, there can be no other possibility that it is some other train. They only removed the DB/ÖBB/NS Hi-speed trains liveries.<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/NS_ICE_4651_at_Amsterdam_Centraal_a.jpg"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/NS_ICE_4651_at_Amsterdam_Centraal_a.jpg/800px-NS_ICE_4651_at_Amsterdam_Centraal_a.jpg" alt="File:NS ICE 4651 at Amsterdam Centraal a.jpg" width="800" height="600"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. The station.</p>
              <p>Gosh. The only ultra-modern glass façade station which remotely looks anything like that. Berlin Hauptbahnhof. Don't believe, check out wikipedia for pictures of its façade.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. TRAIN-SPRINTER?!</p>
              <p>Deutsche Bahn has its own InterCityExpress Sprinter service. Obvious copycat? Don't believe, check out Deutsche Bahn's website and browse its product offerings. ICE Sprinter services are there for less-stop quicker ICE services. And that service requires a tariff. Go check it <a href="http://bahn.de/international">here</a>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Tri-color</p>
              <p>This is debatable. 100 Plus' logo is tricolored, green, red and blue. But Germany, where the technology for the DB ICE 3 / T / TD comes from, has a tricolored yellow, red and black flag. Having the words "Train-sprinter" on the tricolored log doesn't help its image you know?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The people working in RailEurope's Singapore branch, which DB, ÖBB and NS Hi-speed are part of, will not be happy seeing this plagiarized ad going around.</p>

              <p>Plagiarism means to take someone else's idea or work (in this case, an advertisement) and presenting it as your own. For example, if there is a very similar ad by Gatorade of a man chasing after a train, then it can be said that 100 PLUS is plagiarizing from Gatorade.... which is clearly not the case here.</p>
              <p>Or if the train company itself had put out a very similar ad, then yes, that would also be plagiarism. For this advertisement to be plagiarized, it has to be plagiarized from another advertisement or publication.</p>
              <p>Using a photograph of a train in an overseas country is by no means plagiarism. At the very most, it is an unauthorised use of a photograph without giving due credit to the photographer who took it.</p>
              <p>And even that is unclear; for all you know the ad company may have paid royalties for using the photograph, or the photograph may have been in the public domain for free use.</p>
              <p>Everyone, please understand the concept of plagiarism properly.</p>

              <p>100-Plus, the advertiser, designs and pay money for the ads on

              <p>SBS Transit, the producer, makes the ad and paste it on trains

              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you even think that anyone will fly to Europe just to take
              this photo?</p>
              <p>Will an ad have "Source : &lt;------------&gt;" below?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meaning if you don't put the source - paid royalties or
              copyright infringement </p>
              <p>If any company were to do this without paying royalties, the CEO
              is really mad, waiting for a lawsuit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 100 Plus and the ad placed by the ICE or whatever is just a
              coincident. </p>
              <p>This is not plagiarism, its coincident.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way, Fryderyk HPH, you are always causing trouble when
              you come to Thread number 2080, Singapore Trains. ALWAYS, I don't
              know why but it is a coincident that every time I see you, I smell
              trouble. </p>

              <p>Did I say SBST plagiarised it?<br>No.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look at my first statement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Quote:</p>
              <p>Would like to highlight this potentially damaging advert ran by
                                      100 Plus' advert agency</p>
              <p>:Unquote</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, I stated that the placement was on SBST's buses and trains, not once did I mention SBST created the advert.</p>
              <p><br>Fine, if you think it is a coincidence, so be it. My view still stands.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In response to your last statement, have you ever realised that it is due to the negative and narrow mindset of people like you, that stereotyping of people becomes existant and more prevalent? When I asked a question in the questions thread, it was in a polite manner. Apparently it is due to some of you people here that trouble brews. Btw if you hadn't realised, you have already stereotyped me by thinking everytime I post, I create trouble. I shan't even ask who gossiped with you on me and what goes on in the grapevine in this forum. What a joke.</p>

              <p>Would like to highlight this potentially damaging advert ran by
                  100 Plus' advert agency. Took this photo few months ago, but only
                  recently managed to dig it out. It has been placed at train
                  stations and some buses(one DM3500 confirmed had this ad sometime
                  ago).</p>
              <p><img src="http://i401.photobucket.com/albums/pp100/hengpenghock/PlagiarisedAdvertisement.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Don't know what is plagiarized? Ok I'll tell you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. The train.</p>
              <p>The train used is Deutsche Bahn's InterCityExpress ICE 3 / T /
                  TD, which is that in the picture. It is so damn obvious, there can
                  be no other possibility that it is some other train. They only
                  removed the DB/ÖBB/NS Hi-speed trains liveries.<a rel="nofollow" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/NS_ICE_4651_at_Amsterdam_Centraal_a.jpg"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/NS_ICE_4651_at_Amsterdam_Centraal_a.jpg/800px-NS_ICE_4651_at_Amsterdam_Centraal_a.jpg" alt="File:NS ICE 4651 at Amsterdam Centraal a.jpg" width="800" height="600"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. The station.</p>
              <p>Gosh. The only ultra-modern glass façade station which remotely
                  looks anything like that. Berlin Hauptbahnhof. Don't believe, check
                  out wikipedia for pictures of its façade.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. TRAIN-SPRINTER?!</p>
              <p>Deutsche Bahn has its own InterCityExpress Sprinter service.
                  Obvious copycat? Don't believe, check out Deutsche Bahn's website
                  and browse its product offerings. ICE Sprinter services are there
                  for less-stop quicker ICE services. And that service requires a
                  tariff. Go check it <a rel="nofollow" href="http://bahn.de/international">here</a>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Tri-color</p>
              <p>This is debatable. 100 Plus' logo is tricolored, green, red and
                  blue. But Germany, where the technology for the DB ICE 3 / T / TD
                  comes from, has a tricolored yellow, red and black flag. Having the
                  words "Train-sprinter" on the tricolored log doesn't help its image
                  you know?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The people working in RailEurope's Singapore branch, which DB,
                  ÖBB and NS Hi-speed are part of, will not be happy seeing this
                  plagiarized ad going around.</p>

              <p>HAHA! Dare to challenge the moderators and act like a boss huh!? If you think this is indeed a European train, why dont u go and kpkb in your Eurorail forum and nobody will give a damn in it? Just because the ad is placed in Singapore MRT station so it must be in 2080 forum? Why not you say just because the train used is a European train and therefore it should go to Eurorail instead and keep here a peaceful environement?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you look carefully, why is it a Singapore MRT instead of European one</p>
              <p>1: The white colour body and red painting, hello, your train with a orange but not a red strips. Granted, they can photoshop it, but nobody will so bo liao go Germany to take such photo and requires to do some image editing for the advert. As you have said, you can wikipedia for the station, granted, Even if the station is indeed in Germany, it does not mean the train must be taken from there.</p>
              <p>2: 2 doors VS 4 doors? Hello? What logic is that? Since the image used in the advertisement is in stretched mode, rather than your "evidence" image, which is a near shot, one could easily tell that the door might have just stretched and cannot be seen clearly.</p>
              <p>3: Granted, even if the second point does not make sense, the shape of the door used in the advert and your "evidence" is so much of difference, hence you know what I am going to say.</p>
              <p>4: Overhead cantary / 3rd rail? Hey, this is an advert please! Do you think that the advertisers will give a damn care on it? And one cannot see clearly that the train depict in the advert has a overhead cable. (Even if the train in the station is really run by overhead cables). Granted, you may say that the overhead cables does not look nice on the advert and hence the advertisers had zapped them off. But, by doing so, the entire train really looked more like C151 unrefurb or C651 (Made in 
              <a class="mw-redirect" title="Vienna, 
              Austria" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna,_Austria">Vienna</a> --- by another Germany company, Siemens leh!) than the dunno-what-train you are talking about.</p>
              <p>Summary: You should really reflect yourself because usually you are the one that shows attitude / act like a big boss without thinking how others will react. If you keep grudges against somebody, I believe under normal circumstances, those people will also keep grudges against you, and the final outcoming will ensure you meet with mishaps without knowing why it had happened. Please lock this thread, or move it to Eurorail forums, to the minimum and keep 2080 peace.</p>
