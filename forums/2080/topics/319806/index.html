              <p><br>Don't think anyone jumped. Because if they did, train service wouldn't have been at Admiralty (refer to STOMP article @ <a href="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/singaporeseen/viewContent.jsp?id=24807">http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/singaporeseen/viewContent.jsp?id=24807</a>).</p>
              <p>Heard it was a technical glitch. About 5-7 JE bound trains were forced to turn around at Yishun towards Marina Bay. 2 Pasir Ris bound train duties were called off. Saw 235/236 at AMK Southbound platform awaiting green light to start duty. Code 106F.</p>
              <p>JE bound train service was badly affected, platforms at Khatib, Yishun, and Admiralty were almost exploding (even the southbound platform which sees more people taking the train on morning peak than the northbound platform at Yishun had lesser people). The station master made an announcement to inform passengers at Yishun that service was disrupted and frequencies of trains heading to JE at that period from 7.45 ~ 8.10 was around 12-14 minutes per train. The other JE bound trains were called off to execute turnaround at Yishun.</p>
              <p>I believe train service went back to normal at around 8.30am.</p>
              <p>Anyway, a little bit off topic, the 7 trains heading to Pasir Ris in the morning have gotten their run duty codes changed. (Please look below.)</p>
              <p>040 changes to 101.<br>041 changes to 102.<br>042 changes to 103.<br>043 changes to 104.<br>044 changes to 105.<br>045 changes to 106.<br>046 changes to 107.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>According to my friend who lives in Sembawang and was taking the train to school this morning at around 7.45am, a train sort of "broke down" at Sembawang NB. Maybe someone jumped, not sure. So all NB services were affected and thats why all Jurong bound trains after 7.45am were called to turnaround at Yishun while they fixed/brought away the train.</p></div>

              <p>wah! today i on 349/350 in the evening almost reaching Kranji stn, then got lightning strike, and the next moment, the train e-brake. wait for around 1.5 minutes, then started moving very slowly. not sure wad happened though.</p>

              <p><br>it is simply because, usually The train officer knows that it going to rain and furthermore a lightning strike. So what he did was he "trip" the train so that the train automatically stops.... i give u 3 scenarios.</p>
              <p>1st scenario:</p>
              <p>So what happen in the 1.5 minutes waiting proccess?</p>
              <p>a) Once train stops, he go contact the 'controller' can he procceed in CM mode because in Auto mode if raining comes, high chance the train will over-run the platform ahead. F.Y.I CM mode can only authorised by OCC.</p>
              <p>b) Once granted, he procceed with caution.</p>
              <p>2nd scenario:</p>
              <p>a) the train already in CM mode driving, and the T.O reacts quite slow to pull the master handle to brake... and the train sense it does an overspeed after 3 secs. So the computer "trip" the train and thats where the train brake all the sudden.</p>
              <p>3rd scenario:</p>
              <p>a) The train is in Auto mode and all the sudden it is Red aspect at the front. So the train stops immediately so that it will not pass the Red aspect (light)</p>
              <p>b) the T.O inform "controller" about the red aspect. because he receives no speed codes.</p>
              <p>c) the "controller" activate the speed codes for that particular train once the line ahead is clear.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's about all... mainly if u experience train stops all the sudden. Always remember it is not cause by a train failure. or any machanism mulfuntion. It was due to the aspect (light) points is set for him and also the route is in his favour. =)</p>

              <p><br>What about for trains that are coming out of the tunnel? I have taken many train rides whereby the train leaves the tunnel (e.g. Lavender going to Kallang) and then once it exits the tunnel the train stops, TO switches to CM and drives at a slower speed to Kallang.</p>
              <p>Just a question, does the train <strong>automatically</strong> stop when the light points (the NXX whatever thing) show red, or the TO has to <strong>manually</strong> stop it?</p>

              <p><br>to admit it. Yes the T.O did the "triping" of the train when goes out from tunnel. But that's usually when came out from the tunnel &amp; it's raining. So he automatically switch to CM.</p>
              <p>For your 2nd paragraph, If the train is on AUTO, the train will stop automatically. when the train is in CM, then yes the T.O need to stop as soon as possible. becoz when at the speedometer indicates red light, that means the speed codes is 40/0 (max speed 40 / next target speed 0)</p>
              <p>what is speed codes? in SMRT system (for those who wants to know) it is always :</p>
              <p>MAX SPEED / Next TARGET SPEED.</p>
              <p>so its when the train is approaching red aspect (light) this how it works before train come to the stop at speed code 0/0</p>
              <p>78/77, 78/61, 62/39, 40/0, 0/0. This apply to CM &amp; AUTO. So if it's in CM driving, the T.O has to watch out for the speed codes. </p>
              <p>The idea is when the train come to its stop, the target speed will gradually decrease so that the train slows down and stop. </p>
              <p>If it is apply an E-Brake, the speed codes does not exist. It will straight away cut all the brake loops step and straight away apply the brake shoe to the wheels. </p>

              <p>Ah the speed codes, small little green lights next to the speedometer... :D</p>
              <p>Just interested to know, how does the TO changes mode from Auto to CM? :D</p>
              <p>And just one note, there was once I took the first train from Clementi station (0606hrs) and afetr leaving Buona Vista station, the train was on CM mode, there were several low tone beeps as the train is travelling, and soon, there weas one long low tone beep and brakes were applied immediately after it ended. Does it mean that the train exceeded the sectional speed?</p>
              <p>Correct if i am wrong: The emergency brakes are applied by controller, through a big red button on the board and not by the stick?</p>
              <p>Some terms I may not be sure as I am more into the Japanese system of ATS and so on...</p>
