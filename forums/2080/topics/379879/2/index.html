              <p>Anyway EMF are created by particles releasing energy so all these coming from train stations, power lines and all, shouldn't come as a surprise. As for whether your health is actually affected by EMF at longer wavelengths (such as radio waves), that is subject to debate.</p>
              <p>No-one debates over whether the short wavelength ones do any harm though. Just standing in the sun for one whole day should tell you as much.</p>

              <p><br>he is right.after all,if you get killed on the MRT because of that,all trains would have ceased operations or the operators use other trains,which would cost a lot without proper funding.and there are safety measures.</p>

              <p>Btw, pardon me for my ignorance</p>
              <p>EMF is caused by a changing magnetic flux linkage and a current</p>
              <p>The magnetic field (B-Field) is from your iPhone compass</p>
              <p>The movement may be due to the movement of train</p>
              <p>Therefore, emf is induced. </p>
              <p>But, it is inconclusive to just base a increase in emf due to the meter in iPhone as the reliability of the meter is in doubt, yes, is from 50 to 200 emf, but the meter may amplified the emf 50 times, so the change is from 1 emf to 4 emf.</p>
              <p>I suggest refer this thing to SMRT and wait for their reply</p>

              <p>It's very clear cut that those high voltage wires have a high level of EMF, you can't dispute that, but the effects of those high EMF are debatable (like how SBS2601D puts it). There are studies which shows that it leads to cancer and there are studies that refute it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then again it's better to err on the side of caution, rather than getting cancer 10 years down the road.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The spike in the iPhone EMF meter is when approaching the station and when the train is accelerating. Can't be my phone once reach station or when the train is accelerating, it will increase the signal strength. If you seriously doubt the accuracy of my iPhone, suggest you get a professional EMF meter to verify. I am just alerting commuters that high EMF radiation is present in the tunnels, it's not like I am driving a taxi, if less commuters take MRT, I will earn more from my passengers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What's the old adage again?</p>
              <p>It's better to be safe than sorry. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I agree iPhone is not 100% accurate, but based on the article above (if you had taken time to read), it does show that subway and train workers having a higher risk from EMF radiation exposure. Also, I can't afford a thousand dollar EMF meter also, if you have one, could you please help me do a reading. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><strong>High voltage power lines means high EMF radiation, I hope you can accept this fact.</strong> <strong>And your MRT trains are not powered by lithium batteries.</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whether accuracy is a question, there is an undeniable fact that high voltage power lines means high EMF radiation. </p>

              <p><br>I believe the iphone part mentioned by deepak is just a side-track and for-fun thing.</p>
              <p>One cannot deny that train stations, electrical trains in particular, produce rather high and concentrated fluxes of EMF. You don't need to use instruments. Theory is enough. There's no debate about this. And the figures shown by deepak tells as much, so it strikes me as really strange why people are continually harping about the inaccuracies of the iphone.</p>
              <p>The real debate is regarding the possible health effects caused by long wavelength EMFs produced by the excited particles in the power cables.</p>

              <p>The EMF radiation from buses would be much less, afterall it's powered by diesel fuel combustion not pure electricity like the MRT trains. Unless you start seeing a very long high voltage power line sticking out of the buses leading all the way to the SBS bus terminal or Singapore Power. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>i believe that the EMF is present in the lines , however please note that the voltage difference is a huge one compared to high voltage power lines. AFAIK the voltage on the mrt is abt 700ish volt, but based on your article the power lines voltage on those are very very high..in some countries i think more that 25KV,sg does have these but mostly in some specalized buildings where the voltage is step down to 700v.</p>
              <p>so if you based on the line voltage and the high voltage, the accuracy would have a huge gap difference and would also prove to some extent incorrect.</p>
              <p>i do agree with you that high voltage= high emf radiation but when you compare 700vdc  to 25000volts AC the obvious would tell you which is at higher risk.</p>

                                From your posts in this topic, I could see you are just being paranoid. 
                                
                                <p>I wrote on my 1st post of this topic that all electronic devices (including your iphone) emits a certain amount of EMF. I know about EMF radiation and what has been done to reduce or eliminate EMF radiation. That's why I am not paranoid but you are. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
