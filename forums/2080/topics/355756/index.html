              <p>Any unpleasant rides can be posted here.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, I was on 053/054 and what made the ride unpleasant (even though it was my first train ride on a STARIS train, I did not enjoy it):</p>
              <p>1. The train was moving at a snail's pace.</p>
              <p>2. It was driving in CM Mode when all the other trains weren't.</p>
              <p>3. After the train left Yio Chu Kang, the whole train was jerking so violently as the Train Officer was moving too fast! Instead of slowly slowing down, it just halted suddenly! The Train Officer was not scared and after passing Lower Seletar Resewoir, the train started moving so quickly and the violent jerkings started.</p>
              <p>4. At Khatib, there were many people alighting but instead of letting the passengers have a few seconds to alight, the door closing announcement sounded immediately after the doors opened and the doors closed immediately. However, the train started to depart only after 7 seconds.</p>

              <p>Today:</p>
              <p>Not unpleasant for me, but unpleasant for the passengers who entered 075/076.</p>
              <p>I was camping at JE as usual, 075/076 arrived. 2 mins later, the "doors closing" announcement was sounded. Doors closed. The train did not move. There was a driver in the train, and one outside. The one outside kept on opening the driver door and peer in, before closing again. When i saw this, i went to take a closer look. Not knowing what happened, i waited. After a while, the next train arrived, and waited near the connecting track.</p>
              <p>Then, the driver opened the doors and made an announcement for the passengers to alight and wait for the next train. After all the passengers got out, the train left southbound, and looked like it had no problem. Wierd?</p>
              <p>The next train that arrived was 327/328. It was super packed - packed until passengers were standing very close to the door, just like during peak hour.</p>
              <p>075/076 is the most recent train to be refurbished and alr have problem???</p>
