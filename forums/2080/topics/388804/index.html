              <p>Last week, I was rudely stopped by a SMRT station manager, accused of being a “terrorist”, and had my IC taken down.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>The act of terror? A photograph of a faulty display panel taken by a cellphone camera.</p>
              <p>The SMRT staff quoted a “Prevention of Terrorism Act”, which doesn’t exist, and insisted on his authority and reason for demanding my IC.</p>
              <p>SMRT’s reply was that photography and filming is strictly not allowed in our trains and stations. Yet such a “rule” is merely a company policy, and not at all found in the Rapid Transit Systems Regulations. Neither is the policy displayed prominently in stations and trains nor are most commuters aware of it. Moreover, SMRT has even held photography competitions in its stations, where winning entries are displayed prominently.</p>
              <p>SMRT’s staff are supposed to be friendly and helpful. Yet the station manager’s conduct clearly proves otherwise. Even my complaints to customer “service” were treated with insincerity and contempt. With service staff in such dismal conditions, how can we expect commuters to be caring and considerate?</p>
              <p>While an unwitting customer may have done something he’s not allowed to do, SMRT’s staff could have resolved the issue swiftly, in a cool and calm manner. Is there a need to start treating commuters as criminals or terrorists? An offer was even made to delete the innocuous photograph — of a malfunctioning display message, not potential bomb sites: apparent to all reasonable eyes that it cannot be used for terrorism activities. Yet the station manager insisted on taking down my IC and wasting everyone’s time.</p>
              <p>The access to such personal information without authority or valid reason is disrespectful and deleterious to a customer’s personal security and privacy, not to mention illegal.</p>
              <p>I understand the customer relations officer’s need to defend the company’s acts against complaints, and by his own admission all these is condoned and even part of SMRT’s policy: They found nothing wrong with staff treating customers with contempt. But it is time for SMRT to start reflecting on its organisational attitude and policies.</p>
              <p>The misdeed may be small, even trivial. But such a nonchalant attitude reveals a great deal about a soulless organisation and serves only to alienate its customers.</p>
              <p><strong>(Mr) Raymond Chong</strong></p>
              <p><strong>EDITORS’ NOTE:</strong></p>
              <p><em>Mr Raymond Chong had lodged a complaint on the day of the incident to SMRT which took more than one week to reply to him. The corporate communications officer insisted that they had done nothing wrong and again accused him of breaking the law. Mr Chong emailed them again and criticized their insincerity in taking the matter seriously and this time another corporate communications officer replied with a softer and less condescending tone. She offered her apologies to Mr Chong but still failed to answer his questions. Mr Chong has also sent his letter above to The Straits Times which was published in the Straits Times Forum on 20 January 2010 in a watered-down version. Singaporeans need not depend on the mainstream media to have their voices heard in public now. Our readership is now on par with TODAY Online and we promise we will publish all your letters within a week completely UNEDITED in its original version unlike the Straits Times.</em></p>
              <p><strong>Train operator’s split personality</strong></p>
              <p>RECENTLY, I was stopped by an SMRT station manager and had my identity card (IC) number noted for photographing a faulty display panel with my cellphone camera.</p>
              <p>The SMRT staff quoted a Prevention of Terrorism Act as the reason for my ‘booking’.</p>
              <p>SMRT’s reply to my complaint was that photography and filming are not allowed in trains and stations. It cited company policy, yet this is not displayed prominently in stations and trains.</p>
              <p>In fact, SMRT has held photography competitions in its stations, where winning entries are displayed prominently.</p>
              <p>The other dissonant point was the difference between the public face the SMRT tries to project of its staff – friendly and helpful – and the absence of this basic attitude in the station manager’s tone, which bordered on rudeness.</p>
              <p><strong>Raymond Chong</strong></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">SMRT’s reply was that photography and filming is strictly not allowed in our trains and stations.</span>   ===&gt;  This is just BULLSHIT!     I have seen so many foreigners, especially the ah nehs take photo in the trains and MRT stations and no MRT personnel stop them.    The govt and MRT company practising double standard.   this is a good proof that locals are treated badly by the govt.</p>
              <p>Please feedback to all Singaporeans about this and let opposite parties know about it so they can bring this up during election campaign.</p>

              <p>To the best of my knowledge, the MRT folks do not have the authority to demand Mr Chong's IC. He has every right to refuse to provide the details and if SMRT forcefully retrieve the information, Mr Chong can sue them.</p>
              <p>On another note, some of my friends were previously stopped by SMRT from taking photographs too. The officer then was using a casual tone and mentioned about the terrorism issue. My friends complied and the episode ended without any drama. </p>

              <p>Eh i here not trying to add oil to the fire but just to share experiences.<br><br>case 1. Personal experience</p>
              <p>I was with a group of 3 friends on the MRT platform on a saturday evening. There were many people on the platform and my friends and i were waiting for the train  close to the yellow line. A lady that seem to be in a hurry tried to walk pass us but there was not enough space. My guy friend kindly took two steps back and let the lady pass. That few steps happen to touch the yellow line slightly...<br><br>After which a female SMRT staff came to confront us.<br>She yelled for us from a few metres away, then started yelling as she came closer, saying about going so close to the line. What she has been watching us...Say this is the last warning, what dunno need to warn us how many times. (ahem u mean other people?)</p>
              <p>My guy friend said sorry and moved the group a few steps back, squeezing ourselves into the crowd. She continued to yell at us. She was so unfriendly and mean, if my friends havent stop me i would have requested her to mind her tone.</p>
              <p>We are teenages but humans too.Talk until so bo song dun work there lah. Not like my friend purposely step on the line, she didnt ask us either. Even if she had a bad day also no need out on us kids right? very not happy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>case 2. Friend's experience before they tighten rules of no eating in the train</p>
              <p>My friend was in the MRT he had da bao sandwich from subway. He was reaching his stop and was eager to bite into his lunch, he was hungry lah. He took out the sandwich that is still covered with the paper cover and stared at it. =.= (sound dumb but my point comes later) Then he reach his stop but before he can get off he was pulled out of the MRT by a SMRT staff.</p>
              <p>The staff told him he cannot eat food in MRT, and wanted to fine him. My friend said sorry and explained himself. The staff continued to scare him with the fines and that kind of thing. My friend plea, guess wad the staff said? Eh u help me fill in a form say i very helpful staff i let u off. The staff didnt let my friend go till he finish filling the form with praises...<br><br><br>After sharing this two cases, i wana ask...is all the SMRT staff like that one or are they just targeting or picking on us kids cause we not likely to complain or sue them?</p>
