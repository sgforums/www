              <p>Kid, yes u mentioned 47% but have you thought of the other 53% and how many families will still earn less than 1k a month? If your family is well off and you don't have to worry about money matters, that doesn't mean everyone in the country doesn't.</p>
              <p>You might be able to slp all u like till 1-2pm for all u care but there are kids just slightly older than you who have to work to help their family or to earn their own allowance because their family is poor. Your life is too comfortable for you to understand the lives of those less fortunate.</p>
              <p>The govt can only do that much for the needy. They cannot fully provide for them all the time nor give them a life that a normal average family can lead. Unless you have real first hand experience dealing with the needy, knowing how their lives are like, don't just use your imagination and think the govt or someone will take care and ensure everyone can live well. That is just a dream that will never be reality.</p>
              <p>Even the poor, some have the integrity to want to work and earn money on their own even if its low rather than behave like a begger and rely on others to support them.</p>
              <p>Do not overestimate the govt nor underestimate the needy.</p>

              driving MRT where got difficult de. I am sure people will be interested to join MRT to drive the train.
              
              but pls, train the driver properly. some drivers skill are really atrocious. stop suddenly, start, stop and start. dunno what the hell are they doing. some more they are keeping quiet if they need to stop and stay stationary for a few mins. make some annoucments that due to a technical fault or what, need to stay stationary for a while.

              <p>There is no job that u will find people not wanting to do. There might be less who are willing to but still there will be people who need jobs such as toilet cleaners, road sweepers etc. Such jobs earn much less than a train driver, much less comfortable yet there are still people who does them. Why? Because people need to earn a living unlike you.</p>

              <p>There is no job that u will find people not wanting to do. There
              might be less who are willing to but still there will be people who
              need jobs such as toilet cleaners, road sweepers etc. Such jobs
              earn much less than a train driver, much less comfortable yet there
              are still people who does them. Why? Because people need to earn a

              <p>They should keep the system manual. You're right that automatic trains are better, but there're some more things that you should consider.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>C151s and C751Bs are already automatic, just that they aren't when in CM and RM mode.</li>
              <li>It will use up lots of money for the upgrade.</li>
              <li>Just as other people said, what will happen to the existing TOs? Retrenchment is a no-no.</li>
