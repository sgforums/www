              <p>TOs are still needed in times of rain and construction sites near the tracks. If I'm not wrong, the TOs in the cab now during normal conditions are basically just sitting there and watching out for any form of problems that may arise.</p>

              Replying to the topic: Fully Automated NSL and EWL
                      
              Definitely no to that as it will increase the amount of time the train stops at a station. The main problem lies in that NSL and EWL has stations above ground, which means that if there's a rain, the computer cannot accurately calculate the amount of brake needed to stop as friction is greatly reduced. If this full auto is implemented, the following will happen;
                      
              -Rain sensors will be placed on all part of the above ground tracks.
              -Signalling system will communicate with train to apply dry mode or rain mode
              -Train check to implement dry or rain mode at intervals on above ground section
              -If dry mode, stop at station as per norm
              -If raining mode, stop implemented in steps of 6 (40km/h/138m, 30km/h/70m, 20km/h/40m, 10km/h/20m, 5/10m, stop/0m) and enter station at 40km/h. (Gonna take hell of a time to stop compared to CM mode, maybe like 40~60 seconds?)
                      
              So is it worth the money and effort? If yes, please enlighten me.

                                  singaporean will be millionaire? ALL singaporean pays will rise
                                  from the economic push in china and india(<em>projected india, they
                                  are catching up fast so buy their company stock when they are cheap
                                  now</em>) unless they are bullied by their boss lar. And by 2017
                                  Singapore population will be around 5 million, do you think that
                                  the same old 2 min frequency on NSL or EWL will work during even
                                  and morning peak? Surely it will require some upgrading. Fully
                                  automated will be very possible since government plan to be the

                                  fibre network. So by that time singapore will be so advanced. The

              <p>Our population now is already 4.8 million. Do you mean our population is gonna grow by only 200K in the next 8 years? The frequency now is 2 minutes and there's no trouble coping with the human traffic. <br><br>Stats show that 1.5 million people use the MRT everyday, which is one-third of the population. And by following this, we can estimate that an additional 66K people using the train when it reachs 5 million. Considering each train's capacity to be 1.5k people, that would take a total of 1000 train trips. And if you put that into context, we're just having another 66 people on each train and an average increase of less than 3 people at each door, so is there a need to increase frequency now? No. And not even in 2017 if the projected population is only 5 million.</p>

              <p>Back to topic, well automating NSL &amp; EWL can of course increase our frequency but than there is a cost, you need rain sensors, new signalling, new system and new trains (you want increase frequency need more train what, you can't expect 126 trains to do 90sec frequency on both lines which is impossible). The total cost would probably cost at 3/4 billion, considering that trains are not cheap. Than there is TO retrenchments which I think can be solved by asking them to become inspector, like those in SBS transit where they stay in a train and if the automatic system they take over. Last but not least, how are they going to upgrade the system without causing massive problems like, closed sections. Personally I do not know how well is SMRT good at shuttling but last I heard was very bad.</p>

Also, imagine the time and the work needed to upgrade/replace the systems. Most of the equipments in SMRT right now are probably working as smooth as clockwork, and replacing something that's working fine isn't a great idea.</p></div>

              <p>There may be another configuration for driving the train in rainy weather. Or they might also have a driver on board to drive it then. (Notice the driver cab on both ends of the train)</p>

              <p>I heard that full automation was supposed to be on trial in 2005 (i heard it really really long ago when i was a kid say in the 90s) but after all the self-KO jumping ppl at elevated stations it became really difficult as our dear TOs have an extra jobscope of looking out for them.</p>
              <p>Adding to that with full auto I doubt u can ever have a smooth 60sec freq cos the trains will obviously be fitted with min distance and since the trains cant bunch like they do now, no more 1min freq = commuters unhappy and deem the auto system a spectacular failure</p>
              <p>and even more importantly, our dear TOs always look out for the chiong passengers who rather die than miss the train as they sprint to beat the closing doors. i bet ALOT and i mean ALOT of ppl will get caught on closing doors if trains become fully auto given the ultra high flow of commuters on NSL and EWL compared to NEL</p>
              <p>On top of that the NSL and EWL systems will become much slower as there will be fixed timings for train doors to close and these times will have to be really long especially in city areas. I agree with "more accuracy" but inevitably the whole system will slow down.</p>
