What he state is quite true.</div></blockquote>Theoretically speaking it sounds true to him, but in reality, how is this going to work?<br><br>Expansion of the train platform means that a larger part of the track has to be straight. How is this going to work at stations like Braddell and Lakeside, whereby it's a straight merging curve right outside the station?<br><br>Next, for underground stations it means addition of Platform Screen Doors. And we all know it costs a hefty sum for PSDs to be installed in all stations. Approx. 1 million per set of doors.<br><br>Thirdly, expansion of stations means more train cars are needed. How is SMRT going to do that, now that most trains are already fixed at 6 cars and to get additions it means buying more train cars (not koping train cars from other trains).<br><br>Lastly, for aboveground stations, how is extending of the platform going to work now that buildings and roads have already been built around it? Furthermore like I said, all MRT platforms are built in a straight line which means train tracks needed to be straightened for this to work. And in reality, this can't be achieved.<br><br>Although I might agree adding more passenger trips would work, expansion of the train platform is seriously a nonsensical and rubbish idea.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Many train stations around the world has curved platforms. Singapore is an exception as we have a very minimal platform gap. Since most of the wheelchair lots are around the centre of the train set, why cant able-bodied passengers cross a slightly wider platform gap? Even if the platform pinches together, there wouldn;t be much passengers going to the end nyway. So, it is a plus for those who would like to avoid the crowd.<br><br>Expanding train platforms isnt a solution as the Joker did not ask SMRT to buy new train cars so <span style="color: red;">point invalid</span>.<br><br>The MRT isnt as packed as what the Joker claims to be. No matter what, most passengers would have a small personal space between them and the next person. Apparently the Joker thinks that the MRT is his car.<br><br>For those working in the CBD and living up north, my advise is to backtrack to Marina Bay. That way, you have a higher chance of gettign a seat. Only downside is that you have to get out at Marina Bay to see the train destination.<br><br>If the Joker can't even wait for 2 minutes, perhaps he should learn to wake up earlier.</div>

Those more popular ones, do a Bishan style construction (trains and platforms still operational). Buses ha, just use SS buses, like what they did before MRT opened to shuttle between the closed stations and the nearest open stations.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think some of you guys are missing the point here. The complain is about the sardines packed in the train at times, it's a joke, girls get molested (well almost), could be your girlfriend or mother or aunt, but we don't care, the problem here is that the mrt is totally packed at the moment, it will be worse in the future if nobody address this issue. Instead of saying there are no solutions or your solution is totally stupid (well it might not be, for some silly solution could be tweaked to become perfect solution just by looking at different angles), we're more concern about the problem so we can recognize it and try to address the issue, not to laugh at other people's proposed solution.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>suggested solution is possible.... hell saince they say nothing is impossible...<br><br>lets say installing PSDs on BSH stn is taking like 6 months... imagine how long it takes to dig and build like 2 cars worth of platform... plus on every station... what u gonna do? close MRT for like 10 years? or carry on the work on every station at the same time? like that u gotta hire like thousands of workers to get the job done.<br><br>solution is to either get SMRT and SBS to increase off peak freqs to 3 mins or get them to purchase more trains if this isnt possible. i guess more $12m trains is much cheaper than trillions of bucks spent on expanding platforms.</div>
