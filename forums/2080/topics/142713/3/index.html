That loco is a 19 Class shunter. It is most likely to be No. 19103 as this is the only known shunter assigned to Tanjong Pagar at present. Shunters do not work the main line. They work in the yard such as arranging consists into various sidings or fetching the coaches from the shed to the platform and vice versa. That is why they are painted in bright orange. Normally, it is paired with a brake van where another crewman directs the driver as well as help to couple/uncouple the cars.<br><br>The 19 Class is the last shunter model of KTMB. They were manufactured in Japan by Hitachi and were new in 1983. This diesel-electric locomotive has 650 HP and a Bo-Bo wheel configuration.</div></blockquote>Well how do you know of this?!<br><br>Maybe I have heard of its fns long ago.</div>

Anyway, here's the "big brother" of the 19 Class. Also new in 1983, the 23 Class, or Hitachi BFA-23S, is the second type of mainline loco sourced from Japan. The loco is powered by a Pielstick 12 cylinder diesel engine. With a power rating of 2310 hp (nominal), it is capable of a maximum speed of 110 kmh. The 23 Class weighs 88.6 tons and have an overall length of 18141 mm long. It is the longest KTMB loco until the arrival of the 26 Class Blue Tiger in 2003.<br><br>In this picture, 23109 is coupled to 3 ASCs (Air-conditioned Second-class Coach) for the 6 PM local train to Gemas. These Hyundai ASCs were originally non-airconditoned. They were sent to Spain for re-furbishment and is now equipped with underfloor air-con units.<br><br><img src="http://photobucket.com/albums/v377/thebusguide/ktmb/23_01t.jpg"></div>

But the main disadvantage there is that there are no shelters against the sun and I think there's a bees nest somewhere. I was surrounded by bees on one outing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>25201 has been the duty shunter for quite some time already. This is because all the 19 Class locos are due for maintenance. The freight and Ekonomi Siang trains are almost always pulled by 23110 and 23115 respectively.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The video of HK Airport Express train:<br><br>Airport Express, an integral part of New Airport Project in HK, is meant to carry passengers in a speedy way between (new) Chek Lap Kok Airport and downtown Hong Kong (Tsing Yi, Kowloon and Hong Kong).<br><br>Opened on 6 July 1998 together with the new airport, its ridership was poor due to high fares (even my family can seldom afford a ride on AE).<br><br>In December 2005, AE was extended to AsiaWorld Expo (very near to airport). AsiaWorld Expo was where the AE trains turned back to town as an empty train before making a brief loading stop in the Airport station in the past, before the station was built.<br><br>Currently it continues operating at 12 mins interval, taking 24 minutes to Hong Kong station, and at an exorbitant price.<br><br>It must be noted that onboard the train there are luggage racks, and a TV at the back of each seat. Also there is an AE-related souvenior shop located on the arrival platform of Airport Station.<br><br><a href="http://s20.photobucket.com/albums/b222/SGEMP/MTR%20trains/?action=view&amp;current=ae1.flv" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b222/SGEMP/MTR%20trains/th_ae1.jpg"></a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><strong>Complete pictorial collection of KTMB passenger trains that are serving Singapore as of 22 June 2006</strong></span><br><br>After the cancellation of Singapore --- Johor Bahru Shuttle Service on 15 April 2006,  there are 7 pairs of passenger trains running into/out of Singapore, including the prestigious Eastern &amp; Oriental Express.<br><br>Here are the complete pictoral collection of all 7 pairs of KTMB passenger trains, including the E&amp;OE, as follows:<br><br><strong>Ekspres Rakyat (ER 2 Singapore --&gt; Kuala Lumpur; ER 1 Kuala Lumpur --&gt; Singapore)</strong><br><br>Introduced in 1970s to replace the 3-car-long rapid railcars (also between KL and SG), it ran as a through service between Singapore and Butterworth (Penang) via KL originally.<br><br>On 27 June 2001, due to double-tracking and electrification works between Rawang and Ipoh, the ER was shortened to run between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. Back then, no official reasons for this could be found in KTMB timetable dated 27 June 2001. Only in December 2001 when my family travelled around in Bangkok, Thailand, did I found out the reason for the truncation of ER train services from the State Railway of Thailand timetable (the one stated earlier in this paragraph).<br><br>Till now, it is always the first KTMB passenger train to leave Singapore daily.<br><br><img src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b222/SGEMP/KTM%20trains/Ekspres%20Rakyat/er2_r.jpg"><br><br><strong>Ekspres Sinaran Pagi/Petang (XSP 5 "Pagi" Kuala Lumpur --&gt; Singapore; XSP 6 "Petang" Singapore --&gt; Kuala Lumpur)</strong><br><br>Introduced in 1980s with the arrival of 23-class locomotives, it provides a speedy link between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.<br><br>Originally, its scheduling caused it to run using one trainset on the Kuala Lumpur--&gt;Singapore--&gt;Kuala Lumpur route, within one day.<br><br>Due to decline of ridership on Ekspres Tebrau (SG---KL weekend day service; already cancelled) and Ekspres Sinaran trains, both trains merged in 2003 or 2004 to form Ekspres Sinaran Tebrau. Ekspres Sinaran Tebrau disintergrated into its original consituents in 2004. Not long after, Ekspres Tebrau was withdrawn, and Ekspres Sinaran survived.<br><br>Last year, the timing for Ekspres Sinaran Petang was adjusted, so that passengers from Singapore and southern Malaysia could connect directly to Senandung Langkawi (KL---Hatyai) without the need to stay in KL for about 1 day. This arrangement has caused the XSP6 to leave Singapore long before the XSP5 arrives Singapore.<br><br><img src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b222/SGEMP/KTM%20trains/Ekspres%20Sinaran%20Pagi-Petang/xsp6.jpg"><br><br><strong>Senandung Malam (SM11 Kuala Lumpur --&gt; Singapore; SM12 Singapore --&gt; Kuala Lumpur)</strong><br><br>Existent for very long time (previously as "Night Express" or "Southern Cross"), this service provides a good option for all kind of travellers, ranging from Business travellers (maybe for the Koc Selasa), to economy travellers/backpackers (for Airconditioned Economy Coach). This service also conveys parcels and mail between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur (mails and parcels from this train would be handled in Singapore during late morning of everyday).<br><br>This service also takes the longest time to travel between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, that is about 8 or 9 hours. Before the 15 April 2006 rescheduling, this train is also prone to delays that could affect the ER2's punctuality. Also, its consist is very long (roughly as long as the E&amp;OEs), with the parcel vans jutting out of Singapore station's platforms!<br><br>So far, SM runs on 2 trainsets, while there are 6 Koc Selesa luxury sleepers over the entire KTMB network (this is only sufficient for 2 trainsets)<br><br><img src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b222/SGEMP/KTM%20trains/Senandung%20Malam/sm11_r.jpg"><br><br><strong>Ekonomi Siang (ES61 Gemas --&gt; Singapore; ES64 Singapore --&gt; Gemas)</strong><br><br>This is the KTMB train that is shortest in length, only on a 4 cars long trainset (1 power generator car + 3 airconditioned second class coaches)!!!<br><br>Its scheduling means that the train would run from Malaysia to Singapore and back within one day!!!<br><br>And if the passengers are "heng suay", they may get Airconditioned Economy Coach instead!!!<br><br>This train is prone to delays, especially for the southbound ES train. Northbound one is not that prone to delays, though.<br><br>Note that although in KTMB timetable it was said as mail train, this train actually does not carry any mail at all!!!<br><br><img src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b222/SGEMP/KTM%20trains/Ekonomi%20Siang/es61.jpg"><br><br><strong>Mail Train (M57 Gua Musang, Kelantan --&gt; Singapore; M58 Singapore --&gt; Gua Musang, Kelantan)</strong><br><br>Going directly into the mountaineous central part of Kelantan, it provides a cheap option for passengers heading for East Coast of Malaysia (i.e. the Taman Negara). Occassionally it would carry mail and parcel (in parcel vans, attached to the rear of the train). It also allows passengers to see the rural sceneries and rainforests of East Coast of Malaysia.<br><br>So far, this is the only train service in Singapore that has non-airconditioned coaches attached to its consist. It is the non-airconditioned buffet coach, attahced to the rear of the train (if going towards Gua Musang).<br><br>Other than the NAC BC and power generator, all other coaches in this consist would consist of Airconditioned Economy Coach.<br><br>Very prone to delays in all directions.<br><br>Takes about 10-12 hours to complete its journey. This is applicable for all directions.<br><br><img src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b222/SGEMP/KTM%20trains/Mail%20trains/mel58.jpg"><br><br><strong>Ekspres Timuran (XST15 Tumpat, Kelantan --&gt; Singapore; XST14 Singapore --&gt; Tumpat, Kelantan)</strong><br><br>Previously known as "Golden Blowpipe", this service provides a speedy link between East Coast of Malaysia and Johor Bahru-Singapore regions.<br><br>Running at night, this train deprives passengers the opportunity to see the rainforests in East Coast of Malaysia.<br><br><img src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b222/SGEMP/KTM%20trains/Ekspres%20Timuran/xst15.jpg"><br><br><strong><span style="color: green;">Eastern &amp; Oriental Express</span> (Bangkok --&gt; Singapore or Singapore --&gt; Bangkok and many more routing options) </strong><br><br>Introduced in 1993, this service provides luxury and direct (but very expensive) link between Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.<br><br>Green and milky-white in colour (very much like English luxury trains), this train runs on 1 trainset of 22 cars long (with 2 restaurant cars, 1 lounge car, and 1 observation car), with a fixed capacity of 132 passengers.<br><br>However, this train is not directly controlled by KTMB (it is owned by Orient Express). It also departs and runs punctually at proper speeds.<br><br>This train departs from Singapore on selected thursdays at 1100h, taking 3 days and 2 nights (about 48 hours) to Bangkok (return from Bangkok is on selected sundays) On the departure day, there are special E&amp;OE personnels in green (with walkie-talkies) waiting for passengers at Tanjung Pagar.<br><br>For more information and the dates of departure from Singapore, please refer to <a href="http://www.orient-express.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.orient-express.com</a><br><br><img src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b222/SGEMP/KTM%20trains/EnOE%20express/eoe_1_r.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b222/SGEMP/KTM%20trains/EnOE%20express/eoe_2_r.jpg"></div>

A very sad accident which cost the lives of 107 rush hour commuters and a driver, who had been in the job for only 11 months and had his record stained several times with platform overruns and delays.<br>On that fateful day, he too overrun the platform at Itami station several kilometres from the accident site. He had to back the train, causing a minute or two of delay. Surviving commuters from the fourth compartment later testified of burning smell, most likely by hot motors (imagine how hot the motors became!). After that the train departed Itami, travelling at ever increasing speed. As it passed the next station which it did not need stop, commuters testified that the train had severe lateral movement, while on a curve 1800 metres radius (considered a smooth curve).<br>The train approached the fateful curve, at 126km/h, while the maximum speed for the area was 70km/h. The train captain tried to apply brakes, but it was too late and the train derailed at high speed, slammed into the building that you can see in the picture.<br>The following impact forces killed 106 commuters and the train captain.<br>The picture was taken by me on 17th December 2005, after a determined 20 minutes walk from Amagasaki station, which is on the Sanyo Line and the station 5418M would have stopped if it had travelled through the curve at less than 70km/h. I was too shocked by the accident although I was in far away Singapore, and when I finally had a chance to go to Japan, I was destined to go there and take a look and pay silent respect to those killed in one of the worse rail disasters in recent history.<br>Side note: 5418M was re-numbered as 5818M and given a total of 1 minute and 10 seconds of extra time following the accident, and other trains on the Fukuchiyama Line were too given extra running and stopping time.</div>
