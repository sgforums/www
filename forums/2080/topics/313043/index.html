              <p><br>As much as I'd like to agree with this plan... people above the Tanah Merah block would have to suffer twice the waiting time then people below the Tanah Merah block. Because of this crossover feature. Let's say people above the TNM block wait for 7 minutes, people below the TNM block wait for 3.5 minutes, because there is an extra train run.</p>
              <p>2nd thing, during peak hours the crossover tracks before TNM is already utilised like nobody's business, because by that time Changi would be dispatching trains out to supply the peak hour demand. People like Ben whom I've explained to about the peak hour situation around TNM would know because the trains coming out from Changi will turn the "peaceful" scene of TNM into a messy one.</p>
              <p>3rd... C151s are undergoing refurbishment. Do you know that after refurbishment, the C151s bear more features than C751Bs? Things like illuminated emergency exit sign on both ends of the train cannot be found in any C751B.</p>
              <p>Last... it doesn't matter which line will get more trains. Ulu Pandan Depot sits in on both lines and it serves the main depot into dispatching trains out for peak hour. And do remember trains in any depot are not fixed; they can hop from one depot to another in just two days. Finally, TOs pick any train in the depot that is ready for passenger service to do their respective shifts/duties, there's no regulation on whether a TO can only take C751B out. What if all the C751Bs break down, just like when they were all withdrawn from service due to faulty gearboxes in early 2001?</p>

              <p>all the LCD TVs are non functionable. C151 unrefurb still good for me. Now its the C751B turn to get new announcements and then the LEDs in C751Bs with new announcements arent used at all. not even the clock and date. its like turned off. my phone clock is synchronised with 349/350 LEDs. till yesterday they are still synchronsied nicely. hopefully they dun remove so fast like how the new announcements were implemented on those C651s.</p>

C151 only left with 017/018, 053/054, 055/056, 117/118 still using old for both.</p>
