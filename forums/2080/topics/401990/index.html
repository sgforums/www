              <p>NONONO!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Stage 4 and 5 will open together in 2011, my personal estimation might be March or August (If it opens in March 2011, it is because it follows the trend of Stage 3 in <strong>May </strong>2009, Stage 1 and 2 in <strong>April</strong> 2010 and AFAIK based on the signboards on the roads nearby and not something illegal, the Holland Village station should be expected to be completed by 2010 December. --- So heres the hint. If it opens by August 2011, it is probably a joint operation with Woodleigh as well, as stated in Wikis since the International School there in Woodleigh area is opening as well.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Marina Bay Extension? It will be done by 2012 and <strong>NOT 2015</strong>. This is because there is a maintenance facility in Marina Bay, probably the DTL rolling stock will be inserted in Marina Bay, and start running by 2013. Dont forget that DTL Stage 1 opens by 2013 and the Gali Batu Depot for DTL Stage 2 along with Kim Chuan Depot for DTL Stage 3 is not even ready then.</p>

              <p>I disagree. In fact I find the Eastern section is useless / not anywhere faster unless you travel from Bishan to the East OR you use the stations in between (PYL CCL to DBG NEL and OTP to West will in fact slower than direct EWL)</p>
              <p>BTW, it is useful on South Western sector (Harbourfront - Buona Vista / Holland Village)</p>

              <p>for CCL from bishan to PYL , yes, much faster.</p>
              <p>BUT the same also applies those going west, it take a load off the trains now going westbound and also thru the northline.</p>
              <p>the problem lies in those going from jurong east to yishun and orchard areas. NS lines are ALWAYS almost crammed full especially during office hours.</p>
              <p>don't believe me?? go try take 1 from city hall all the way north to jurong east, you 'll be suprised at the flow of people from these few areas.</p>
              <p>so if CCL3 and 4 from bishan to jurong east the line is useless, i suggest  you have to rethink again on that apsect.</p>
