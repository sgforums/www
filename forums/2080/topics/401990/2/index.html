              <p>for CCL from bishan to PYL , yes, much faster.</p>
              <p>BUT the same also applies those going west, it take a load off
              the trains now going westbound and also thru the northline.</p>
              <p>the problem lies in those going from jurong east to yishun and
              orchard areas. NS lines are ALWAYS almost crammed full especially
              during office hours.</p>
              <p>don't believe me?? go try take 1 from city hall all the way
              north to jurong east, you 'll be suprised at the flow of people
              from these few areas.</p>
              <p>so if CCL3 and 4 from bishan to jurong east the line is useless,
              i suggest  you have to rethink again on that apsect.</p>

              <p>CCL works as a CBD reliever. Its expected to carry about 500k ppl daily, the same as DTL but DTL should be higher since DTL2 has tons of schools and at Bukit Panjang there are tons of residents dying to go to the city as fast as possible.</p>
              <p>DTL3 serves Bedok Reservoir, one of the most densely populated (I lived there once). Its madness lol. It is expected to pass through the whole of Bedok Reservoir Rd and should be almost parallel to EWL.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>CCL is somehow a balancer IMO. It balances off load from the EWL to NSL and vice versa.</p>
              <p>This is how it works.</p>

              <p>Passengers going to Buona Vista from Bishan :</p>
              <p>Instead of adding the load between Bishan and City Hall and City Hall and Buona Vista, CCL cuts the load between this 2 segments.</p>
              <p>Passengers going to Paya Lebar from Bishan.</p>
              <p>Instead of adding the load between Bishan and City Hall and City Hall and Paya Lebar, CCL cuts the load between these segments. </p>
              <p>That applies the same to the rest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>CCL runs almost parallel to EWL, its more of a reliever.</p>
              <p>Only this segment will have lesser load.</p>
              <p>BUONA VISTA ~ PAYA LEBAR(EWL)</p>
              <p>The NSL part would only have a lighter load when Thomson Line open.</p>

              <p>Neither it really relieves the leg to Raffles Place as ppl has a choice of buses to Newton instead along Bt Timah.</p>

              <p>In MRT, the fares are charged on the fastest route and not the distance travelled.</p>
              <p>You can go to Marina Bay from Woodlands via Jurong East or just ride the Southbound train. SAME FARE!</p>
              <p>We can't increase the frequency until the signalling system is upgraded of there are more than 5 depots (Tuas depot is suppose to house the C151As and the other bunch of "SPARE" trains). To achieve 1 minute frequency we need 200+ trains while we currently only got 106 trains. </p>

              <p>Regarding loading between Buona Vista and City Hall once the CCL4 and 5 start operating, I foresee that stretch will remain just as pack.</p>

              <p>In MRT, the fares are charged on the fastest route and not the distance travelled.</p>
              <p>You can go to Marina Bay from Woodlands via Jurong East or just ride the Southbound train. SAME FARE!</p>
              <p>We can't increase the frequency until the signalling system is upgraded of there are more than 5 depots (Tuas depot is suppose to house the C151As and the other bunch of "SPARE" trains). To achieve 1 minute frequency we need 200+ trains while we currently only got 106 trains. </p>

              <p><br>So which is e fastest route? Take direct DTL via Bayfront or via OTP?</p>
              <p>In any case it cost 200% more by MRT from Potong Pasir to Toa Payoh compared to taking Sv 142. $1.40 in fact.</p>
              <p>They're bringing in more trains as well as upgrading Jurong East Int to make it 2 mins freq. But it's not going to be of any use if they keep on increase MRT lines at e same time and removing bus svs.</p>
              <p>Tat's why the policy is no more towards MRT but w/ both MRT and buses.</p>

              <p>It's too long. There's Sv 963 from NUH corridor to Hillview Ave itself. I believe the net travelling time by DTL/ CCL would be longer bearing in mind of 1 more tx or walking from Upp Bt Timah Rd.</p>
              <p>As for Bt Panjang - Woodlands leg, there's no MRT coverage.</p>

              <p>I disagree. I see that CCL 4 will in fact much faster than NSL in terms of distance travelled if people from Boon Lay / Clementi going to Ang Mo Kio, Yio Chu Kang and possibly Yishun. Woodlands might be really better off using Jurong East NSL.</p>
              <p>And I find that transfering in Outram Park is a bit too far when CCL4 opens (Unless u mean people in Redhill / Queenstown and people in Commonwealth can seriously consider CCL).</p>

              <p>CCL hardly runs parallel to any of the existing MRT lines. its main purpose is simply to link up mostly suburban areas, where most commuters currently use buses to get around. CCL links these areas together and also to the existing lines such that ppl can x-fer to the existing lines at the interchanges and then travel to/from the CBD.</p>
              <p>thus, CCL does not really help to ease the load of the existing MRT lines, but instead adds to the commuters travelling by MRT by making it possible for ppl staying ard those areas to do so.</p>

              <p><strong>if I am going to AMK/BSN area, CCL4 will be faster. for TPY/YIS the time savings is smaller, but there is still a difference. the transfer at BNV is going to be like PYL one so should be relatively seamless as well.</strong></p>
              <p>At present commuters from West (BV onwards) heading
                          Serangoon/Hougang/Sengkang/Punggol, make transfer at Outram. CCL4
                          and 5 will not change this pattern, again for it is too cumbersome
                          to make transfer at BV and Serangoon again.</p>
              <p><strong>I do believe the CCL is still faster in this instance. going down to OTP will take over 20 mins (and you are only at the second southernmost station along the line) and the connecting linkway is longer.</strong></p>
              <p>The need in making transfers at BV, Bishan, Serangoon may put
                          many commuters off. Residents from West will 'switch' to CCL
                          probably only if their final destination was along one of the
                          stations in CCL.</p>
              <p><strong>dont think it would be many. just some.</strong></p>
              <p>And no idiots from West will travel on CCL to
                          Dhobby Ghaut or Esplanade.</p>
              <p><strong>well of course.</strong></p>
              <p>Thus it seems to me that the loading will be just as heavy as it
                          is today.</p>
              <p>Residents from West will see benefits in CCL only when DTL, DTL2
                          operating. For DTL goes into the city.</p>
              <p><strong>only if you live at BP/Hillview and areas of CCK covered by LRT, not CLE/BBT/JUR/BNL.</strong></p>
              <p>And residents along CCL4 and
                          CCL5 may make transfer at Botanical Gardens and head toward
                          Rochor.</p>
              <p><strong>CCL3/4 maybe. CCL5 residents may find it faster to go down to HBF.</strong></p>
              <p>Just wish that DTL and DTL2 start operting soon.</p>
              <p><strong>I believe everyone hopes so as well!</strong></p>
              <p>Still there are some who will still benefit from CCL4 AND 5.</p>
              <p>1. Residents along CCL4 and 5, not many except those residents
                          in estates at Telok Blangah and Farrer Road.</p>
              <p>2. Workers and students in BV, One-North and Kent Ridge.</p>

              <p>yup am just using the more known acronym for the area. thanks for the clarifaction anyway.</p>
              <p>after all circle line is a loop that connects suburban areas except CCL1 that serves the city. only problem is CCL1 is not quite as accessible for western residents than those in the east.</p>

              <p>CCL in Western areas just simply lack of the Harbourfront Extension (Marina Bay - Harbourfront sector). After that, it should be a long term useful line.</p>
