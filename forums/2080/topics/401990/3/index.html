              <p>It was reported that CCL4 and CCL5 will operate together by second half of 2011. I guess is that they will open CCL4 / 5 and Woodleigh together, as it was reported that Woodleigh would open by August 2011 as the international school is completed. (The school will have about 3000 students). Woodleigh's source was from Wikipedia.</p>

              <p>There was somebody said potentially is NEXT to the NEL platform (Known as current Platform A is a "middle platform") but I doubt so (Source from LTA MRT map where you can compare various interchanges logo from Tanah Merah / Jurong East one, City Hall / Raffles Place and Outram Park / Serangoon / Dhoby Ghaut / Bishan. Harbourfront one is same as Promenade [With inclusion of DTL] / City Hall / Raffles Place (The interchange logo is no different from Tanah Merah / Jurong East)</p>

              <p>Source: LTA</p>
              <p>The only nearest hint to your query is Vivocity, there was a signboard that states the construction thing and a station map to it, and from that, it seemed to suggest (NOT so clear) that, the crossover before Harbourfront from Outram Park, is that, to connect with CCL.(A bit stupid, I think they have screwed up everything + waste tax payer's money) and IF that is true, then the existing NEL platform A has to be "middle track" and not directly below it (It IS directly NEXT to it)</p>

              <p>There was somebody said potentially is NEXT to the NEL platform
                  (Known as current Platform A is a "middle platform") but I doubt so
                  (Source from LTA MRT map where you can compare various interchanges
                  logo from Tanah Merah / Jurong East one, City Hall / Raffles Place
                  and Outram Park / Serangoon / Dhoby Ghaut / Bishan. Harbourfront
                  one is same as Promenade [With inclusion of DTL] / City Hall /
                  Raffles Place (The interchange logo is no different from Tanah
                  Merah / Jurong East)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only nearest hint to your query is Vivocity, there was a
                  signboard that states the construction thing and a station map to
                  it, and from that, it seemed to suggest (NOT so clear) that, the
                  crossover before Harbourfront from Outram Park, is that, to connect
                  with CCL.(A bit stupid, I think they have screwed up everything +
                  waste tax payer's money) and IF that is true, then the existing NEL
                  platform A has to be "middle track" and not directly below it (It
                  IS directly NEXT to it)</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I think I get what you mean. I've always believed that interchanges with 1 white circle meant that we only have to cross platform, or no need walk so much, while multiple circles like OTP and DBG meant we had to walk to another mrt station.</p>
              <p>Why would they have wanted to connect NEL to CCL? All the while no link one what... 6-car vs 3 or 4-car (back then they havent decided 3 or 4 yet i think)</p>
              <p>Now that we're talking about HBF platforms, what is the reason for platform B being so useless? I know its becos got no crossover from OTP to HBF platform B, only after HBF... but why did they build it like that? If there was no reason they might as well have built one platform.</p>

              <p>I highly blileve all of u know part A (what I labeled) has been done and I can see the very very normal CCL board &lt;Welcome to SMRT Circle Line&gt;, but I find it rather funny to construct both sides (correct me if im wrong). In the above, U may find that it looks as if a side platform was used, and they are constructing them.</p>

              <p>They have just started building the entrance to Haw Par Villa station a few weeks ago, the entrance is just next to the villa, along Pasir Panjang Rd. Those structures in the photos at West Coast Highway next to YESS Centre are ventilation shafts.</p>
              <p>The pedestrian overhead bridge connecting Labrador Park station to PSA Building is still under construction.</p>

              <p>SMRT is leasing the shop spaces at Botanic Gardens, Holland Village and one-north. The estimated available date is June 2011.</p>
              <p>WIll we be seeing different operational dates for phase 4 and 5? Or there isn't any retail shops available in any of the phase 5 stations?</p>
              <p>It seems TOP by end 2010 for phase 4 stations is not possible, especially for Holland V and BV stations.</p>
