                      									Christopher Tan<strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Construction works on Downtown MRT line begin</strong></p>
              <p>IN 12 years' time, Singapore residents should be able to get to every
                      major residential and commercial centre across the island by hopping
                      onto an MRT train.</p>
              <p>At a groundbreaking ceremony on Tuesday morning to mark the start
                      of construction works on the $12 billion 40km Downtown Line, Land
                      Transport Authority chairman Michael Lim said Singapore's rail network
                      would have doubled in length to 278km by 2020, 'comprehensive enough to
                      support access to points across the island, supporting Singapore's
                      vision for public transport as a choice mode of travel'.</p>
              <p>The first stage of the Downtown Line is 4.3km and will have
                      six stations: Chinatown, Cross Street, Landmark, Bayfront, Promenade
                      and Bugis. When this stage is ready by 2013, commuters will have quick
                      access to developments in Marina Bay, such as the Business Financial
                      Centre and Sands Resort. The rest of the Downtown Line will be
                      completed by 2016.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim noted that the Downtown Line is but one of several new
                      rail projects rolling out in the next decade or so. Others include the
                      Thomson Line, and extensions to the North-south and East-west lines.</p>
              <p>Together with projects that are ongoing today - such as the
                      Circle Line and Boon Lay Extension - Singapore has committed $40b on
                      new MRT lines.</p>
              <p>'Despite the high volume of infrastructure projects taking
                      place across the island, safety is a top priority for LTA throughout
                      the construction process,' the chairman said.</p>
              <p>He cited LTA's safety record in the last few years.</p>
              <p>In 2003, it lost 252 man-days per million man-hours spent on its projects.</p>
              <p>The following year, it hit a high of 1,049 man-days lost, when
                      a Circle Line cave-in caused Nicoll Highway to collapse, killing four
                      workers. But since then, man-days lost had fallen to 435 and 320 in
                      2005 and 2006 respectively.</p>
              <p>Last year, it dropped to a low 49 man-days.</p>
              <p>'Safety competence and professionalism are core values LTA regards highly,' Mr Lim added.</p>

              <p><em><span class="update">By Wong Mun Wai, Channel NewsAsia | </span><span class="update">Posted: 12 February 2008 1829 hrs</span></em></p>
              <p><strong>Locations of Downtown Line stations will depend on commuter traffic</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Construction of the Downtown Line began on February
              12 and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said it will decide where to
              build future stations for the new line after looking at commuter
              traffic.
              <br> <br> Besides the Chinatown Station, the first phase will consist of another five stations.
              <br> <br>But for the other 27 stations, which fall under phases two and
              three, the LTA has yet to finalise their locations on the train line.
              <br> <br>One major factor that will determine where the stations will be is
              commuter traffic. And many future stations may also be located
              underground.
              <br> <br>Lim Bok Ngam, Deputy Chief Executive of Infrastructure &amp;
              Development at LTA, said: "Typically, we do not want to sterilise land.
              So you find that many of the stations are located at junctions and the
              lines are running below the road. That, on the bigger context, saves
              land for the government. <br> <br> "But then of course, in terms of construction, it makes it more
              difficult because you need to make sure traffic flows (smoothly) at the
              same time."
              <br> <br> The existing Chinatown Station will have an additional entrance at Hong Lim Complex.
              <br> <br>LTA is using a method that allows excavation to continue through
              underground openings while the hole is covered. This way, excavation
              works will not affect the flow of traffic above ground.
              <br> <br>On Cross Street, a road bridge from Raffles Quay to the east of
              China Street is due to be completed by the fourth quarter of the year,
              with the aim of minimising congestion. The viaduct will be in use till
              the completion of Phase one of the Downtown Line in 2013.
              <br> <br> The two remaining contracts for Bugis and Promenade stations will be awarded by the end of the year.   - CNA /ls</span></p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Construction Work On Downtown Line Stage 1 Begins</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">1. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) today marked the start
              of construction of the S$12 billion, 40km Downtown Line with a groundbreaking
              ceremony for the Chinatown Station on DTL1.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">2. The 4.3km fully underground DTL1 will comprise six
              stations: Chinatown, Cross Street, Landmark, Bayfront, Promenade and Bugis.
              Construction for DTL1 will be completed by 2013.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">3. When completed, DTL1 will provide a strategic transport
              link to serve workers, residents and visitors in the exciting Marina Bay area
              and upcoming developments such as the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resorts and
              the Marina Bay Financial Centre. DTL1 will run through some of the busiest and
              most vibrant corridors in the city such as Bugis and Chinatown and ease
              congestion at major interchanges like Dhoby Ghaut and Raffles Interchange.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">4. To date, five contracts have been awarded for DTL1. The
              remaining two contracts, for Bugis and Promenade stations, will be awarded by
              year-end. (Please refer to Annex 1 for DTL1 contracts awarded)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">5. The Government's continued investment in public rail
              infrastructure underline the importance of a comprehensive and reliable
              transportation network to support the economy and enhance the quality of life
              for all Singaporeans. Plans for new rail lines such as the Thomson Line, the
              Eastern Region Line and new extensions to the North-South and East-West Lines
              announced in January 2008 are already underway. This will see an investment of
              S$20 billion in rail projects over the next 10 to 15 years. By 2020, Singapore's
              rail line will have doubled to 278 km. The rail network will be comprehensive
              enough to provide access to points across the island, supporting Singapore's
              vision for public transport as a choice mode of travel. These rail projects will
              offer ample opportunities for qualified local and international companies to bid
              for projects.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">6. In carrying out these infrastructure projects, workplace
              and workers' safety will remain a key priority. To help achieve higher
              standards, LTA adopts international safety and health best practices. Stringent
              guidelines are enforced to ensure safety at worksites. These initiatives have
              helped LTA to better manage our projects and have resulted in a decline in the
              accident frequency rate and death rates at our construction sites. The number of
              accidents per million man-hours clocked fell by about 40% in 2007 compared to
              2003. These improvements are the result of deliberate and consistent application
              of safety standards at our worksites. (Please refer to Annex 2 for LTA's Safety
              Records)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">About the Downtown Line</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">7. The DTL will be built in three stages, with Stage 2 to be
              completed in 2015 and Stage 3 in 2016. When fully completed, the DTL will
              strengthen the connectivity of the Rapid Transit System network and facilitate
              direct travel from the northwestern and eastern areas of the island to the
              Central Business District and the Marina Bay. The DTL is projected to see a
              daily ridership of more than half a million when in full operation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">8. For commuters, the DTL will offer significant savings in
              travelling time. For example, a public transport journey from Bukit Panjang to
              the city centre will be reduced by a third from the current 1 hour. The DTL will
              help reduce travel time for commuters in Bedok Reservoir and Tampines area who
              currently need to take bus to transfer to the MRT stations on the East-West
              Line. It will also relieve passenger crowding at the East-West Line,
              particularly during the peak within peak period.</span></p>

              2,000 graves to be exhumed for Downtown Line depot in Woodlands 
              
              Christopher Tan 
              Tue, Feb 26, 2008
              The Straits Times 
              
              THE Government has identified a 21-hectare site off Woodlands Road to be used as a train depot for the MRT Downtown Line.
              
              The plot, next to the Sungei Kadut Industrial Estate, is almost twice the size of the Circle Line's Kim Chuan Depot, touted as the world's biggest underground train depot.
              
              Construction of the new depot, which will serve Stages 1 and 2 of the $12 billion Downtown Line, will start in December this year.
              
              It is expected to be completed in 2015, a year before Downtown Line 2 is due to finish.
              
              But before excavation can begin, 1,957 graves on part the Kwong Hou Sua Teochew Cemetery will have to be exhumed.
              
              This is because the planned depot encroaches on part of the graveyard, which is said to date back to the 1940s.
              
              Exhumation will start in mid-October this year.
              
              The remaining graves in the cemetery - estimated at more than 3,000 - will be exhumed later to make way for development of an industrial site.

              <p><strong>Downtown Line Depot To Be Constructed Near Woodlands In<br>December 2008</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">1. The site for the Downtown Line depot has been gazetted
              today after extensive technical studies and site surveys. Located off Woodlands
              Road, the 21-hectare depot, situated at the north end of the Downtown Line Stage
              2, will house the Operation Control Centre and provide stabling, maintenance,
              operations and support facilities for Downtown Line Stages 1 and 2. Construction
              for the depot is scheduled to commence in December 2008 and will be completed in
              2015.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">2. As the construction of the depot encroaches on part of the
              Kwong Hou Sua Teochew Cemetery, some 1,957 graves on the affected site will need
              to be exhumed. [Please refer to Annex 2 for details of the exhumation exercise]</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">3. Phase 1 of the exhumation of the graves for the Downtown
              Line depot development is scheduled to commence in mid-October 2008. The
              remaining graves which are not affected in Phase 1 will be exhumed under Phase
              2, which will be carried out by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">4. The construction of the $12 billion Downtown Line is part
              of the plan to develop a comprehensive rail network system to meet our travel
              needs in the future.</span></p>
