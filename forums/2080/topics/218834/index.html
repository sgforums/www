            <div class='col-md body'>05 November 2006<br><strong>MRT feasibility studies underway for Downtown Line</strong><br><br>SINGAPORE: A new 40-kilometre MRT line could be in the works to connect the Bukit Timah and eastern parts of the island to the New Downtown.<br><br>Feasibility studies for this are currently underway.<br><br>This and other projects are in the pipeline as the Transport Ministry takes stock of the public transport system and develops a new road map for the next 10 to 15 years.<br><br>Last year, the Land Transport Authority announced plans for a Downtown Extension Line to serve the Marina Bay area.<br><br>Now, it is carrying out studies to check the feasibility of extending this to the Bukit Timah and Eastern Region Lines.<br><br>Together, all three could form a 40-kilometre Downtown Line that will connect people from the northwest and east to the planned Business and Financial Centre and integrated resort at Marina Bay.<br><br>Previous reports have said that the Eastern Region Line will be a rectangular loop around the Jalan Besar area and the East Coast while the Bukit Timah Line will link Upper Bukit Timah to the city.<br><br>Meanwhile, buses will continue to be a key part of the transport system - with the focus on making it more commuter-friendly such as reducing waiting times and considering options like full-day bus lanes.<br><br>More rail lines and better bus services are only part of the solution. The review will also look at how the entire transport system is set up.<br><br>One issue is the public transport operator setup, which new GPC Chairman for Transport Cedric Foo, feels can be improved.<br><br>Mr Foo said: "The two are separately listed in the Exchange, they compete with each other. So, obviously they will not try to help one another and that creates problems for commuters.<br><br>"For example, when SBS issued monthly seasonal passes, the same seasonal monthly pass cannot be used on SMRT."<br><br>Over at the ports, work has started to make Pasir Panjang Terminal a mega-port that will be able to handle the next generation of ultra-large container ships.<br><br>Whilst tax incentives were introduced earlier this year to maintain Singapore as a preferred base for shipping. Focus is also on growing maritime services to be a second engine of growth, creating more jobs and business.<br><br>And Changi Airport's Terminal 3 is on schedule to open in 20-08, by which time Changi Airport will be able to handle up to 67 million passengers annually.<br><br>Air travel will also become easier and cheaper as Singapore pursues more liberal air services agreements with key areas like China, India and ASEAN. - CNA/so</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nov 6, 2006<br>MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Network review for a more seamless journey</strong></span><br>Move to improve access, connectivity of bus, train services<br><br>By T. Rajan<br><br>THE Ministry of Transport (MOT) has begun a review of the land transport network in its drive to improve access and connectivity.<br><br>One key thrust of the review is to develop the train and bus networks over the next few years.<br><br>In the ministry's addenda to the President's Address at the opening of Parliament on Thursday, Transport Minister Raymond Lim also outlined his plans to shorten public transport travel times.<br><br>'In a city-state like ours, the vast majority of Singaporeans will have to rely on public transport as their principal mode of travel,' he said.<br><br>Mr Lim added that building a high-quality and affordable urban transport system is crucial. As the population grows, future travel needs will also increase.<br><br>To help achieve these goals, the MOT will continue to invest in the public transport infrastructure, he said.<br><br>Mr Lim noted that moves to expand the network are already under way. He cited the Circle Line as one example of works in progress.<br><br>When it is completed, from 2010 onwards, travel to the city from the suburban areas like Pasir Panjang will be faster, bypassing busy stations like City Hall.<br><br>Also, the development of Marina Bay has made better rail access to the area more important.<br><br>The Downtown Line, approved last year, will allow commuters to get across the island faster to places like Marina Centre, he said.<br><br>Also on the cards are two new lines to link the northwestern and eastern areas of the island to the <strong>60km Downtown Line</strong>.<br><br>Mr Lim said the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is conducting feasibility studies to see how it can <strong>link the Bukit Timah Line and the Eastern Regional Line to the Downtown Line</strong>.<br><br>Mr Lim will also be training his focus on improving bus service quality and concerns over issues like waiting times and reliability.<br><br>The Public Transport Council's new set of Quality of Service Standards, introduced in July, will help ensure this, he added.<br><br>Mr Lim also said that improving access for the disabled to the public transport system will continue, with initiatives like buses with wheelchair access, launched four months ago.<br><br>He said: 'The LTA will upgrade commuter and road facilities... to help not only less mobile Singaporeans move around more easily, but also the average commuter to have a more seamless journey from door to door.'<br><br>trajan@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright Â© 2006 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.</div>

ERL runs along jalan besar. 100m away. and that's the difference! soon, no buses will run on these two roads!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
