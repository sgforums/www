              I'm wondering whether if its feasible for Singapore to have trams; just like Melbourne?
              
              My suggestion:
              Ban buses into the city and CBD such as Shenton Way, Chinatown, Marina Square/Suntec, Orchard; and probably also include Marina South, Sentosa and Harbourfront.
              Set up bus-tram interchanges along the city fringes for transfer onto the tramlines to the city.
              
              During my stay in Melbourne, I noticed that trams there cut across open fields as a short cut. In some sections, trams travel along tramways designated only for trams, hence reducing travelling time. In more built-up areas, trams share the road together with other vehicles.
              
              Instead of a tramstop just like the current bus-stops at Orchard Rd for example, I suggest allowing the tram to turn into the shopping centre for passengers to board and alight (just like taxi stands). Trams are non-polluting and I believe such design would encourage travel on public transport.
              
              I'm wondering whether if its feasible to block off the current bus lane to be converted to tram track. At traffic intersection, introduce tram signals for them to move about.
              
              Please feel free to comment.

              <p>You know, there definitely is a reason why they discontinued the previous tram service.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if you block the bus lane, then there will only be 2-3 lanes for other vehicles to move about. Not really good.</p>

              Good one, but only 1 problem qestion,
              If they put trams at CBD, den got construction site like downtown MRT construction or road resurfacing, and the trams run on its track, part of the track kena cover by the construction.. How?
              Rebuild temporary track or diverte the route?

              <p>I personally think that MRT is the only best solution VS tram. Overhead cable line seem very messy. That why our MRT train tap the power from third rail instead of overhead cable line, except the NEL.</p>

              <p>Hmmm.. I think having trams/monorails in the city would be more realistic if we are building an entire new city from scratch now, so that all shopping centres can be built and integrated all in one row, with a tram line running right inside the shopping centres on the 2nd storey, so that it can continue running elevated to avoid the traffic below.  Isnt that great? Passengers can also be protected from the weather and once step out, its the office or shopping centres! By the way, I got this inspiration from Genting Highlands Lotte World's monorails. Our new Sentosa monorail that will be integrated with the casino &amp; IR is also a little similar to my proposal.</p>
              <p>Trams are different from trains as the distance between stops are shorter. Trams are different from buses as they can be much longer hence greater carrying capicity as they are running on tracks. Trams do not emit smoke as they are electrified. Trams do not necessarily need to be powered by overhead cables. There are alternative versions in other countries too.</p>

              <p>As mentioned in my earlier post, I was thinking of trams that run on elevated tracks in the city to avoid the traffic below. Its something like the current LRT system; but  with tram stops that integrates into the shopping centres.</p>

              <p>Here's a link to trams without overhead cables:</p>

              <p>You mean trams that run on elevated tracks also takes up more space? I believe by having trams that run on elevated tracks in the city, it frees up a bus lane, and having a public transport in the city that can avoid heavy traffic jams.</p>

              <p>Tram =/= Monorail =/= MRT</p>
              <p>Trams are articulated street cars run by electricity. May run on elevated lines too, depending on location (eg. Hong Kong's LRT, Amsterdam Tram)<br>*Our Sentosa Beach Tram is a fake tram.</p>
              <p>Monorail is a vehicle that travels <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on a single beam track</span>. (eg. Sentosa Express, Shanghai Maglev)</p>
              <p>MRT is a rapid transit system. (eg. our MRT, HK's MTR)</p>
