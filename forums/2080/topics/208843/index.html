            <div class='col-md body'>Businessman Vincent TanÂ’s shoe shop at Dhoby Xchange is eight times as large as his outlet at Bugis Junction. And yet, it sells just 250 pairs of shoes a month, compared to the 1,000 pairs that fly off the shelves at his smaller establishment.<br><br>Another Dhoby Xchange tenant, Ms Wong May Lai, owns a shop selling handbags but says it is common to register Â“zero sales for consecutive daysÂ”.<br><br>Said Ms Wong: Â“I can roller-skate from one end of this shopping area to the other without bumping into people. I sell just one or two handbags a day.Â”<br><br>She and Mr Tan are not alone. Two weeks ago, 28 tenants submitted a petition to SMRT, which manages Dhoby Xchange.<br><br>In the petition, the tenants say they were initially promised three F&amp;B outlets in the shopping mall. At present, there is only one and they are blaming the lack of eateries as a Â“major reasonÂ” for the low human-traffic.<br><br>They also want more publicity material to attract customers to Dhoby Xchange and are requesting a reason for the areaÂ’s delayed launch.<br><br>The official launch, initially set for May, has been pushed back thrice and is now set for the end of the year.<br><br>When TODAY visited the 15,600-sq-ft shopping mall yesterday during the evening rush hour, there were fewer than 50 shoppers.<br><br>Tenants say that commuters from the MRT station simply bypass the mall on their way to popular haunts such as Plaza Singapura, Park Mall and The Cathay.<br><br>Â“And on Sunday, itÂ’s a dead town,Â” lamented Ms Priscilla Chew, who runs a fashion accessory shop at Dhoby Xchange.<br><br>According to SMRT, 46 out of the 54 units are occupied. Shops selling fashion accessories dominate the space. The problem seems to be that the shopping centre is easily missed as it has only two access points. Although it was pened in April, tenants estimate it draws just 2,000 people daily, compared to nearly 40,000 at Wisma Atria.<br><br>In response to the petition, SMRT told the tenants in a letter dated Sept 4 that its publicity efforts and the increase in shopper-traffic Â“may have gone unnoticedÂ” by the tenants.<br><br>While SMRT rejected the tenantsÂ’ request to hold a joint meeting, it has arranged to meet them individually.<br><br>Responding to media queries, an SMRT spokesperson said the sluggish business is common Â“with all new commercial spaces and businessesÂ”.<br><br>She said: Â“Although SMRT as landlord is not contractually bound to promote and market the Xchange, it is in our interest to have our tenants do well. More time is needed to create awareness and shopping traffic.<br><br>With regard to the amount of human traffic, we would like to clarify that from January to July, the usage at Dhoby Ghaut Station has increased by 30 per cent.Â”<br><br>The spokesperson added: Â“We recognise that while human traffic in the station is high, people are passing by Dhoby Xchange.<br><br>Â“Furthermore, due to construction work on the Circle Line and landscaping works for the IMF and World Bank meetings, there were road hoardings around Dhoby Ghaut area which were only removed recently.Â”<br><br>Some tenants appreciate SMRTÂ’s efforts.<br><br>Said Mr C H Lim, who manages a bakery that did not join the petition: Â“At first, business was quite bad. Then, my boss went to SMRT and they spent money from their own pockets for promotion and marketing efforts. Business has improved slightly but is still not up to expectations.<br><br>Â“SMRT is listening to us. But it needs time. For example, it promised to seriously look into our suggestion to broaden the walkway.Â”<br><br>SMRT has also placed signs to divert human traffic to the shopping mall, its spokesperson said.<br><br>Â“We would like to clarify that we have been communicating with the tenants and working with them on promotions,Â” she said.<br><br>Â“We have offered to meet up with them individually, as we believe it would be more fruitful to address the specific concerns of each tenant. Although some tenants have declined our offer, we will continue to communicate with them to discuss solutions if they are facing difficulties.Â”<br><br>The spokesperson added that SMRT would develop commercial spaces in another 18 MRT stations next year, including another two Xchanges in Choa Chu Kang and Tanjong Pagar. - TODAY/ra</div>
