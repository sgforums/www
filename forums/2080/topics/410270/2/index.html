              <p>- Fully Elevated line<br>- 13.5 km long with 2 legs: Tuas West Extension and Tuas South Extension<br>- Total 6 stations and a depot<br>- West Extension is 7.5 km long with 3 stations plus one interchange station with South Extension.<br>- South Extension is 6 km long with 2 stations, a future line.</p>
              <p>EW30 to EW33 will be on Tuas West Extension to be completed in 2015. EW34 and EW35 will be on Tuas South Extension, a future line.</p>
              <p>EW30 (the next station after EW29 Joo Koon) will be the interchange station of the 2 extension lines. EW30 is proposed to be located along Tuas Road, near the junction of Tuas Ave 3 and Gul Circle. EW30 will be at least 20m from ground level.</p>
              <p>EW31 will also be at least 20m from ground level, it will be build around 8m above a proposed road viaduct along Pioneer Road. EW31 is proposed to be located above the Pioneer Road viaduct near the junction of Tuas Crescent and Tuas Avenue 2.</p>
              <p>EW32 is proposed to be located along Pioneer Road near Tuas West Road.</p>
              <p>EW33 is proposed to be located along Tuas West Drive near Raffles Marina.</p>

              <p>It is, but i doubt it would be.</p>
              <p>Building underground would definitely be more expensive, and since the land in the west is so plentiful, why waste money building underground?</p>

              <p>For what would a person with right mind to build a station on <strong>20m</strong> on top of the land (BTW, Raffles Place is 21.4m deep, which is the deepest EWL / NSL stations) and build the extension on underground in only 1 ~ 2 stations away?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW, I have checked with the map, it might be only possible to have underground stations in Tuas South extension is because there is a sea / deep water in between mainland Singapore and small sector of mainland Tuas South (It is kind of C shape, where the Tuas South Extension makes it a cent logo. 1 cent... 2 cent.....), at the cost of ignoring the first sentence of that poster:</p>

              <p>In summary, it is a no for underground, but it might be possible only for the Tuas South extension, and likely to be only on Tuas South Extension 3 ("EW36") or further, if any in long long long term plan. (They only confirm to build 2 stations in Tuas South Extension, but I doubt that is the final state of EWL because:</p>
              <p>1: That wont justify to build a 60 train car depot, where the C151As can fit perfectly without the need of this depot. (UPD can have maximum 35 trains, BSD can have maximum 53 trains, CHD can have maximum 40 trains = 128 trains, where 128 - 19 (C651) - 21 (C751B) - 66 (C151) = 22, which again, is the number of C151As)</p>
              <p>2: A 2 stations long extension will not justify the need to have a "double middle track", making it a Jurong East pre-JEMP, Ang Mo Kio, Tanah Merah, Paya Lebar CCL like station with a another middle track beside its, effectively a double island, 4 platforms that holds maximum 4 instead of 3 like the above mentioned stations at any given time. (Which is a Standard station with the middle track a Dover style)</p>
              <p>3: Tuas is known to be reclaming land, and it has to reclaim southwards. So I guess this will continue, and within 50 years from now, I would expect a further extension from present "future" Tuas South Extension.</p>

              <p><br>If the height of Jurong East station is known, then we will know roughly the height of that track you mentioned and do a comparision to find which one is higher.</p>
              <p><strong>Assume</strong> that the height of a HDB flat is 3m, than EW31 will be at a height of 7 storey HDB flat.</p>
              <p>EW31 is on top of a proposed road viaduct. Just imagine a MRT station build on top of Bartley viaduct, Keppel viaduct, Upper Serangoon viaduct or West Coast Highway viaduct.</p>

              <p>9 meters in 1 kilometer. 9/1000, which is 9 per mil. MRTC states that its gradients are not more than 3%, which is 30 per mil, which is 30 meters in 1 kilometer. 9 per mil is strictly no issue.</p>
              <p>MRTC also defines that its trains must be able to attain standard acceleration from 0 to 35 km/h. In this range, its either climb or roll back. And our trains are actually very powerful (4Q/GTO in this rating can handle 35 per mil without problem) when this is defined. I have come across trains which can only attain standard output for less than 0 - 20 km/h range.</p>

              <p>Hi, I got a question to ask,</p>
              <p>As the fact is the deepest NEL station is Dhoby Ghaut, on 28m in B5, and hence I find it weird to have Dhoby Ghaut CCL at B4, at dunno how deep it is, can have about 3 bus stop distance (or 2), towards Bras Basah, at 35m deep, being the current deepest station.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know this has nothing to do with Tuas extension, but how to calculate the estimated CCL trains' rating?</p>
              <p>Does that means that maglev train or other forms of high speed train can have attain
              standard acceleration from 0 to 50 km/h or even up to 100km/h?</p>

              <p><strong>From the article:</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The MRT will be extended to the Second Link by 2015, as part of the East-West Line’s forked Tuas extension. Construction work for the line could start in the second half of next year, and be completed in 2015. Plans for a cross-border metro extension, to be ready in 2018, were first announced in May by PM Lee Hsien Loong and his Malaysian counterpart, Datuk Seri Najib Razak.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The plans call for a rail viaduct which is built 20m above the Ayer Rajah Expressway/Pan-Island Expressway intersection, as well as running along a road viaduct at some point of the MRT line.</strong></span> Although the alignment of the extension has not been finalised, the Transport Ministry has confirmed that a stop will be sited near the Second Link. The Ministry however ruled out extending the East-West Line to Johor from the Second Link Station.</p>

              <p>First point:possible,but not in the near future.Maybe to the extension's extension?then it can turn towards tuas south.</p>
              <p>Second point:maybe the 25x series can move there.However,demand may be higher in Boon Lay and i dun think that the commuters want to travel to Tuas just to get a bus.Anyway,there's already 192 and 193.</p>
