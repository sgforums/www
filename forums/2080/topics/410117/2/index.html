              <p>Instead of comparing amount of lines etc, lets forsee future MRT / LRT lines before deciding DTL should be under who. (Bolden company = most likely company to win the tender --- excluding extensions from present line such as "Changi Airport Extension / Tuas Extension / Boon Lay Extension"</p>
              <p>Known Future LRT lines (Look, LTA just say that they wont build LTA until dunno what -- they did give a rule to build LRT one):</p>
              <p>Punggol North Line (Sure SBST as it is part of Punggol LRT)</p>
              <p>Jurong LRT Line (Most likely <strong>SBST</strong> as they have better management of LRTs and Jurong West is still SBST territory)</p>
              <p>Known Future MRT lines:</p>
              <p>Thomson Line (Most likely <strong>SMRT</strong>, due to Woodlands area)</p>
              <p>Eastern Region Line (Most likely <strong>SBST</strong>, due to the entire stretch of East Coast from Changi all theway is under SBST)</p>
              <p>*The below are mentioned in URA 2001 concept plans and / or LTA 1996 whitepaper.*</p>
              <p>North Shore / Coast Line (Quite tricky, as the southern end from Changi is SBST area while the Northern end at Sembawang etc is SMRT area, but I will still vote <strong>SBST</strong> because it could be an extension from NEL [and being a second OHLE system train] , or it might be connected to ERL such that, it is still most likely a SBST train also. You might want to counter this argument as possibility to connect with TSL, but the depot is known to be at somewhere in Mandai and it is pretty illogical to connect a train line in Sembawang to Woodlands without any revenue service purpose.)</p>
              <p>Holland Line (Most likely <strong>SMRT</strong>, especially if as some people speculated as Dhoby Ghaut - Promenade sector is a branch line of another line AFTER the circle has closed.)</p>
              <p>Seletar Line (Most likely <strong>SBST</strong>, because even if North Shore / Coast Line does not become a second NEL, then Seletar Line might do the job. The entire sector of Seletar - Serangoon North - Kallang / Geylang Bharu - CBD areas are more like SBST territory)</p>
              <p>Kallang Line (By now, it would be Kallang Extension so as to make NSL a loop line [Kind of Bukit Panjang LRT line in MRT version, where "Choa Chu Kang LRT station" would be Jurong East MRT station and "Bukit Panjang LRT station" would be Ang Mo Kio MRT station. Oh --- "Jelapang LRT station" will be somewhere in Marina Barrage or Marina East, depending on future NSL development. Well, proposed Kallang Line is 16km long and based on the whitepaper, it braches from Ang Mo Kio, and coupled with the fact of the distance in Bishan - Kallang should be around 7km, there is no reason to say that Kallang Line will not start from Ang Mo Kio and terminates at Marina areas.] IF the plan was not totally scrapped. Hence, it would be under SMRT.)</p>
              <p>I do expect an extension from Paya Lebar CCL to ERL Marine Parade, or an extension from DTL Bedok Town Park station (Based on old leaked schematic diagram, it has a middle platform.) to Bedok MRT station and linked to Bedok South ERL station or both. Other extensions do include Downtown Line to finish Bukit Panjang - Kranji link (Based on cheapo design of DTL2 to follow the road, there is no way they will plan to connect Yew Tee in long term plan) and Expo - Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal ERL link.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok, so based on above analysis, I think the more likely <strong>SMRT</strong> because even if we do not count the future LRT lines, SBST will have ample chances to have more lines.</p>
              <p>Well, although I think that even with all these lines by SBST, they wont have similar rail distance, otherwise, it would be unfair to SMRT. By the way, dont forget that most likely my personal prediction, is that DTL trains will park at KCD first (Using CCL tracks since there is a Promenade crossover), despite they have a maintenance facility in Marina Bay. [Otherwise how the train be installed ---- not gonna to open a big hole on Bugis, Chinatown right?].</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, SBST have never run a long rail (NEL is shortest one) before, so there is no way LTA will give that to SBST, given that they do consider if operator is financially capable to run that or not. (NEL is suffering loss in the inital years, and rumours said SBST might sell that to SMRT but not now anymore.) I believe the planners will not believe SBST is ready to run DTL despite SBST's official stance is they are ready to run DTL.</p>

              <p>Also, SBST have never run a long rail (NEL is shortest one)
              before, so there is no way LTA will give that to SBST, given that
              they do consider if operator is financially capable to run that or
              not. (NEL is suffering loss in the inital years, and rumours said
              SBST might sell that to SMRT but not now anymore.) I believe the
              planners will not believe SBST is ready to run DTL despite SBST's
              official stance is they are ready to run DTL.</p>

              <p>wow, thanks for writing such a big article , so in conclusion for DTL which company you hope it will be awarded to ? SMRT or SBST?</p>

              <p>Instead of comparing amount of lines etc, lets forsee future MRT / LRT lines before deciding DTL should be under who. (Bolden company = most likely company to win the tender --- excluding extensions from present line such as "Changi Airport Extension / Tuas Extension / Boon Lay Extension"</p>
              <p>Known Future LRT lines (Look, LTA just say that they wont build LTA until dunno what -- they did give a rule to build LRT one):</p>
              <p>Punggol North Line (Sure SBST as it is part of Punggol LRT)</p>
              <p>Jurong LRT Line (Most likely <strong>SBST</strong> as they have better management of LRTs and Jurong West is still SBST territory)</p>
              <p>Known Future MRT lines:</p>
              <p>Thomson Line (Most likely <strong>SMRT</strong>, due to Woodlands area)</p>
              <p>Eastern Region Line (Most likely <strong>SBST</strong>, due to the entire stretch of East Coast from Changi all theway is under SBST)</p>
              <p>*The below are mentioned in URA 2001 concept plans and / or LTA 1996 whitepaper.*</p>
              <p>North Shore / Coast Line (Quite tricky, as the southern end from Changi is SBST area while the Northern end at Sembawang etc is SMRT area, but I will still vote <strong>SBST</strong> because it could be an extension from NEL [and being a second OHLE system train] , or it might be connected to ERL such that, it is still most likely a SBST train also. You might want to counter this argument as possibility to connect with TSL, but the depot is known to be at somewhere in Mandai and it is pretty illogical to connect a train line in Sembawang to Woodlands without any revenue service purpose.)</p>
              <p>Holland Line (Most likely <strong>SMRT</strong>, especially if as some people speculated as Dhoby Ghaut - Promenade sector is a branch line of another line AFTER the circle has closed.)</p>
              <p>Seletar Line (Most likely <strong>SBST</strong>, because even if North Shore / Coast Line does not become a second NEL, then Seletar Line might do the job. The entire sector of Seletar - Serangoon North - Kallang / Geylang Bharu - CBD areas are more like SBST territory)</p>
              <p>Kallang Line (By now, it would be Kallang Extension so as to make NSL a loop line [Kind of Bukit Panjang LRT line in MRT version, where "Choa Chu Kang LRT station" would be Jurong East MRT station and "Bukit Panjang LRT station" would be Ang Mo Kio MRT station. Oh --- "Jelapang LRT station" will be somewhere in Marina Barrage or Marina East, depending on future NSL development. Well, proposed Kallang Line is 16km long and based on the whitepaper, it braches from Ang Mo Kio, and coupled with the fact of the distance in Bishan - Kallang should be around 7km, there is no reason to say that Kallang Line will not start from Ang Mo Kio and terminates at Marina areas.] IF the plan was not totally scrapped. Hence, it would be under SMRT.)</p>
              <p>I do expect an extension from Paya Lebar CCL to ERL Marine Parade, or an extension from DTL Bedok Town Park station (Based on old leaked schematic diagram, it has a middle platform.) to Bedok MRT station and linked to Bedok South ERL station or both. Other extensions do include Downtown Line to finish Bukit Panjang - Kranji link (Based on cheapo design of DTL2 to follow the road, there is no way they will plan to connect Yew Tee in long term plan) and Expo - Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal ERL link.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok, so based on above analysis, I think the more likely <strong>SMRT</strong> because even if we do not count the future LRT lines, SBST will have ample chances to have more lines.</p>
              <p>Well, although I think that even with all these lines by SBST, they wont have similar rail distance, otherwise, it would be unfair to SMRT. By the way, dont forget that most likely my personal prediction, is that DTL trains will park at KCD first (Using CCL tracks since there is a Promenade crossover), despite they have a maintenance facility in Marina Bay. [Otherwise how the train be installed ---- not gonna to open a big hole on Bugis, Chinatown right?].</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, SBST have never run a long rail (NEL is shortest one) before, so there is no way LTA will give that to SBST, given that they do consider if operator is financially capable to run that or not. (NEL is suffering loss in the inital years, and rumours said SBST might sell that to SMRT but not now anymore.) I believe the planners will not believe SBST is ready to run DTL despite SBST's official stance is they are ready to run DTL.</p>

              <p><br>looking at the MRT blueprint set out it seems like Thomson Line and Eastern Region Line will be one long line together like the DTL passing thru Orchard, Great World, Outram Park and Marina Bay areas before heading east.</p>
              <p>Anyway, SBST gets my vote for DTL.</p>
