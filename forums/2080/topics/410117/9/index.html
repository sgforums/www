              <p>Anyway, Cantonese is a dialect of Chinese. Singaporeans think that the terms "Chinese" and "Mandarin" are interchangeable. They are NOT. China is huge; there were many different ways of speaking Chinese and there still are today, albeit some dialects being very unpopular. But Cantonese is spoken in cities like Hong Kong and also in the province of Guangdong - both very well known. Together, that would be nearly 100,000 speakers of Cantonese. Not very little, is it?</p>
              <p>All right, not to backseat mod, but back to voting instead of arguing about Chinese dialects, please?</p>

              <p>You know what, i'm voting for SMRT.</p>
              <p>Here are some reasons why:</p>
              <p>1.) Can SBST take the loss when they only open a small stretch of 6 Stations of DTL 1? (2013) It's just a small stretch around the city &amp; benchmarks will be most probably below average.</p>
              <p>2.) When they first start DTL 1, the trains will come from KCD (Kim Chuan Depot) , not GBD (Gali Batu Depot) as GBD has yet to be completed on 2013. Expect SMRT and SBST to have disputes over the depot? Unless both companies can work together and peace out.</p>
              <p>3.) SMRT has xchanges (as mentioned) that actually helps a lot as it pays for the loss when DTL 1 starts running.</p>
              <p>4.) SMRT is RICH enough to continue making loss unlike SBST. If SBST were to take the future DTL and when DTL 1 starts running, mayb a few days (exagarration) later you will see the NEL owned by SMRT .</p>
              <p>5.) Although i admit that SBST has good quality customer service (I seen alot.) and SMRT needs MAJOR IMPROVEMENT on their services (no rasist, to tell you the truth, those foreign (Bangla) staffs are getting out of hand.) esp bus drivers -.-, SMRT shuld suffer. Cos their custoemr service Bi bu liao SBST.</p>

              <p>1) Agreed</p>
              <p>2) Agreed but most likely for DTL1, trains will be starting from KCD, but primarily parking at Bugis slidings / Marina Bay maintenance facility. Anyway, if my memory did not fail, the number of trains involved should not be more than 10 anyway. (I think it was about 5 or 6)</p>
              <p>3) Disagree. Although SBST does not have SBST Xchange, but in certain stations, such as Sengkang, Dhoby Ghaut (There is some arcade on the NEL part, but whether is that part of CCL is another question), Little India, Chinatown and Boon Keng got some shops. So, to some less extent, there is some form of XChange as well. It is not none definitely. Afterall, certain NEL stations are located a bit Ulu / station design issue such that a big scale shopping street not feasible. Why dont you look at SBST has a parent company of Comfort Delgro, got a larger Bus and Taxi company scale on top of some other miscelleaneous business including car rental / driving school etc that can compenstate the 'loss' for the DTL or even the profits less earned due to a lack of a XChange concept.</p>
              <p>4) Who says? NEL, already starts to profitting a bit and indeed SBST take up the loss for the first few years of NEL operation thanks to the profits in bus business. Afterall, just 2 years later, the Bukit Timah sector is ready and it should be profittable and 2 years after it, the Bedok sector is ready and can take up even more profit.</p>
              <p>5) No comments, but maybe agree to some extent.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">yeah, I agree on this, but you see which mrt station doesn't have shops(except closed stations)? SMRT only named that area for the shops as "xchange". Even if SBST operates there's still going to be shops, less the name.</span></p>

              <p>CCL has their own tracks to enter the depot, while DTL has their own one. However, what I might have to point out is Alstom VS Bombardier.</p>
