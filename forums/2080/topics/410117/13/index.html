              <p>Sorry for any confusion caused... Yup I was referring to the placement of ETA boards, not the distance of walking. I do understand the reasons for the distance because of construction implications. BPLRT transfer at CCK stn is a result of an old design (give them a break it was their first foray into LRT system! Bet they didn't even know what they're doing as they haven't built any LRT before)</p>
              <p>Of course I have my reasons for liking SMRT more, but this does not play any part in my point above. Imagine if every line was run by SMRT. When you walk from NEL side to EWL side, that current useless NEL sign at the transfer linkway displaying the time, date and "this way to EWL" would at least have a better use telling commuters when their train arrives. This may sound trivial and redundant but people who transfer trains everyday like to be informed and not miss their trains, especially when they're late.</p>
              <p>As for DBG NSL transfer to CCL or NEL, both ETA boards can see once you come up the escalator because linkway belongs to SBST. However from the other end, NEL transfer to NSL commuters have to walk/run all the way to NSL before realising they have missed their train. Same point here. If only the SBST boards displaying "NSL... use upriding escalators ahead" were used as NSL ETA, things would be simpler.</p>

              <p>The ETA boards at PYL are not too far away for PYL transfers. Just have to take escalator up/down =). The best is BSH NSL (towards MRB) transfer to CCL ETA same level.</p>

              <p>Yes the all-time famous blogger. He used to be a writer for TODAY newpaper and his article on the newly opened NEL back then captivated me. He also did not see any point in competition because geographically speaking, all lines are running at different directions plying different routes serving people living everywhere. So what is there to compete? Nicer staff uniform colour? Nicer tunnel TV/Moove Media ads? Cleaner stations? Faster trains? (I'd really love to see that happen, pity the limitations of 3rd rail)...</p>
              <p>The part about getting the govt to build one more NEL beside the current one and let SMRT run it to 'compete' with SBST was his little joke at the end of the article I would never forget. haha</p>

              <p>High chances for SMRT to be the operator of DTL. Reason being that SBS Transit is now spending a huge sum of money to buy 300 Citaro and 300 B9TL Wrights plus they might not gonna be spending another sum of money just to make the DTL trains into SBS Transit Livery, trains station with installed announcement, boards etc. </p>

              <p>I think they are listed company and they always can make loans from bank if they need to do so. I dont think buying buses or even taxis (SBS under Comfort group with lots of Taxis) etc will have any impact on the decision to grab DTL.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, I feel that SMRT will get it due to CCL "integration" but there again, SBST would certainly wants a more "important" (longer?) line than NEL, which is DTL. If they failed, most likely ERL will go to SBST and maybe TSL will go to some foregin transport company, consider that TSL is the likely candidate to extend it to JB and really makes sense upon opening up our Transport industry for competition. (Consider that ERL most likely wont need a 4 carriage 5 doors configuration)</p>

              <p>SBS buying buses has nothing to do w/ DTL.</p>
              <p>Many kids here are still thinking SMRT pays for EWL, NSL, SBS pays for NEL. Wake up! It's your parents tax paying $$ + petrol or road taxes paid for the construction and train procurement.</p>
              <p>SMRT only runs and keeps the profits. As good as free. Else I doubt SMRT is going to be able to post any profit right till now.</p>
              <p>SPH's co fund dun contribute a single cent for the 22 trains, it's our tax paying $$!</p>
              <p>It's only that from DTL, they've to contribute an amt to a sinking fund. But it's of a little BOT.</p>
              <p>Also, SBS buying buses is fleet replacement. Dun tell me SMRT no need to buy buses to replace O405/ O405G? Use bus until 30 years? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>That's why all the comments, I dunno is it to cry or laugh</p>
