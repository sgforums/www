              <p><br>I think people still do not get the point. Like what 1224Y says, SMRT doesn't have night tracks. If only they saw further and built night tracks so that day tracks can be inspected at night while night tracks can be inspected in the day.</p>

              It's necessary to close the tracks a few hours in the night to ensure the tracks are in tip-top condition.
              
              Who mentioned that there's only inspection going on at night and no wielding/repairing going on? How to let commuter trains pass like that?

              <p>what can be done is that 1 train in svc and the frequency is every 2 hours. charged at the NightRider rate of $3. den that sad train uses the northbound track on mon, wed, fri and sun. and uses the southbound track on tue, thu and sat.</p>
              <p>singaporeans only know how to complain. majority dunno how to look for solution de sadly. cant imagine our next government.</p>

              <p>You try building then.</p>
              <p>I have nothing more else to say. If you insist that night tracks can be built, then let it be.</p>
              <p>Go on, submit your proposal to SMRT. See what they say.</p>
              <p>If you think that I'm ridiculously wrong, think again. Singapore is planning for a 6.5 million population and they can't be bothered to built a third track just to serve people going home at night. Plus, where can they alight without building another platform?</p>

              <p>Ah man, your response dissappoints me greatly. And to think I was actually expecting a solid answer as to why night tracks arent built due to Singapore's "small size"...</p>
              <p>Allow me to just point out quite matter-of-factly that I actually stated that night operations was <em>not</em> possible, and nowhere did I actually insist that third tracks should be built. What I was questioning you, however, was the reasoning you gave to explain why they were not built. How this equates to me insisting on building that track is beyond my intellect level. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"> So do you think I need to respond to your silly SMRT challenge?</p>
              <p>Singapore is aiming to be a 24-hour city, and recent surveys has shown that Singaporeans are amongst the world's sleepers who stay in bed for the shortest time. The number of businesses and establishments opening round-the-clock are mushrooming, and we can expect infrastructure upgrades which will cater eventually to this rapidly expanding market. If you have sources or statistics to show otherwise, I would love to see them.</p>
              <p>Singapore has absolutely no problem accomodating 6.5 million people comfortably. Heck, it could very well support over two or three times that number even using contemporary technology, and I am saying this based on my study of the URA's master and concept plans for over a decade.</p>
              <p>Building a third track involves expanding the rail reserve, and it can be easily observed that there is often ample land reserve on most segments of the track for expansion purposes. Even if this was not so, repossess is a challenge relatively easy to accomplish under the current government. This is not like some cities where it can cost billions for the government to repossess private land to build public infrastructure.</p>
              <p>How they are going to alight? Erm....never heard of rail junctions??</p>

              <p>So far the only rail system I have heard that is 24 hours would be the New York subway.</p>
              <p>Tokyo is nearby, with some trains ending at 1.30am and starting at 4.30am.</p>
              <p>But for a smaller city like us, I don't think night trains will be feasible for the next few decades; even Hong Kong does not have trains for night service.</p>
              <p>I remember reading a report in the newspaper that SMRT is not earning a profit through the pretext of having under capacity even during peak hours.</p>
              <p>I suppose that until our trains are congested until people are squashed like packed sardines, we won't have any night services for train.</p>

              <p>I disagree with that nightrider train ideas, this only let Train company mark up their fare again for maintaining these type of service. Those ppl that still late at night, 90% of ppl dont even consider take train but they prefer to take cab.</p>

              <p>I still remember buangkok MRT station, all claimed that they will use the station but end up, only a few kitty is using that station.  </p>
