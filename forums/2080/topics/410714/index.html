              <p><br>Ok. Some of the suggestions are quite good, but some of the area (like Simpang) must be fully developed. Changi Airport Terminal 4? The SCA Skytrain will be extended to there, since it is a connection of the terminals.</p>
              <p>By the way, since the name 'Stations Suggestions' is there (meaning station names suggestions), can everyone suggest a name for the names of DTL3 (since the names are working names and not finalised)?</p>

              <p>Yes, the road was closed. Somapah was an area north of Upper Changi Road, which is where the present day Singapore Expo Hall 10 stands. It used to be where buses to the airport terminate if I remember correctly. The area was gone around the 90s, partly because of the Singapore Expo project. However, many old folks in Singapore and some taxi drivers know where Somapah is. Stations need not be named after a road. If so, why is Harbourfront called Harbourfront? It isn't exactly in front of a harbour, and Harbourfront Walk was only named after Vivocity was completed.</p>
