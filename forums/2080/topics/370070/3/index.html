              <p><br>In the scenario you described, why did the train jerked? Did the train operator has poor train maneuvering skills or there's a slight uneven surface on the rail. The MRT staff should be looking into that instead.</p>
              <p>Do you need more and more rules, regulations, laws for Singapore to make people behave? Singapore is already such a "Fine" country, you still want to make it even more "Fine" by having more rules, regulations and laws?</p>
              <p>What happened to public education by SMRT? I don't see posters at MRT stations and trains asking people not to eat / drink. I don't see advertisement on tv either.</p>
              <p>Other western countries can allow their commuters (young and old) to eat / drink in trains, why can't SMRT? The best part is the train operators there are not charging the passengers train fares but SMRT is.</p>
              <p>Being fare-paying passengers, the passengers are customers of a transport company. Which company fine it's customers?</p>
              <p>SMRT is already making billions with the train fares, do they still need to fine people for eating / drinking to increase their revenue?</p>
              <p>I feel that SMRT being a transport company, whether private or GLC, does not have the right to fine passengers.</p>

              <p>You are right about the lacking of social responsibility among Singaporeans, but why is it lacking? Did the parents never taught their children about being social responsible beings when growing up? Did the schools never taught their students about being social responsible beings when growing up?
