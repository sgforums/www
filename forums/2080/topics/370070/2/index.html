                                <p>Imagine this. You're on the MRT going out to meet your date.
                                While on your way there, an ah pek beside you takes out his cai
                                peng and starts munching on it. Suddenly the train jerks and his
                                cai peng (with curry) flings out and ruin your new shoes.</p>
                                <p>The MRT staff are trying to prevent that from happening. Thought
                                we might have to admit that they are a tad bit overboard in doing
                                it. Besides that, what is so bad about trying to prevent the above
                                scenario from happening?</p>

              In the scenario you described, why did the train jerked? Did the train operator has poor train maneuvering skills or there's a slight uneven surface on the rail. The MRT staff should be looking into that instead.
              
              <p>Do you need more and more rules, regulations, laws for Singapore to make people behave? Singapore is already such a "Fine" country, you still want to make it even more "Fine" by having more rules, regulations and laws?

              <p>Anyways, this rule is just a giant truckload of road apples if you ask me. Firstly I can understand why vehicles have to be heavily priced in Singapore because of our heavy land constraint, but that's one thing, and having a company with an overbombastic management isn't helping at all. I didn't know of this rule until I saw it on the internet, and trust me I thought it was a joke.</p>
              <p>Lets look at whats going on here. So we aren't allowed to drink plain pH7 water thats not going to attract any form of pests into a high-speed 10000volts powered train whilst passing through intense scanners and large groups of people? And we can't take any form of medication r lozenge for sore throats in the train unless you receive the permission of an SMRT worker who somehow isn't always around when someone gets a sickness? And they aren't going to listen to any suggestions and instead make use of the media to brainwah us into thinking that its all for our own good? Wow a first world transport system indeed. I love Singapore.(Yes I got that from Paris and Milan so shut up about it now)</p>
