              <p>BRUSSELS (AP) -- A commuter train ran a stop light
                                      during morning rush hour and collided head-on with another train in
                                      a Brussels suburb Monday, killing at least 18 people and injuring
                                      55 in Belgium's deadliest train wreck in decades, officials
                                      said.</p>
              <p>The impact peeled away the front of one train car and
                                      threw at least one other off the tracks, causing amputations and
                                      other severe injuries, witnesses and officials said. Train service
                                      across Western Europe was disrupted.</p>
              <p>The Flanders provincial crisis center said in a
                                      statement carried by the Belgian media that at least 18 people were
                                      killed. Thirty survivors remained hospitalized, several of them in
                                      a "very serious" condition, the statement said.</p>
              <p>Lodewijk De Witte, the governor of the province of
                                      Flemish Brabant, told reporters that one train "apparently did not
                                      heed a stop light."</p>
              <p>The trains collided in light snow just outside of the
                                      station at Buizingen around 8:30 a.m. (0730GMT).</p>
              <p>The force of the collision smashed one train deep into
                                      the front of the other, tearing back the metal sides. The trains
                                      tipped high into the air and broke overhead power lines.</p>
              <p>One of the front cars appeared to have careened across
                                      the tracks, demolishing a small maintenance shed next to the rail
                                      line. A high concrete wall around the train yard seemed to have
                                      kept debris from hitting nearby houses.</p>
              <p>It appeared to be the country's worst train wreck since
                                      1954, when a crash near Leuven killed 20 German soccer fans and
                                      seriously injured 40 others. In March 28, 2001, eight people died
                                      when a crowded train plowed into an empty train driving on the
                                      wrong tracks.</p>
              <p>Belgian National Railways spokesman Jochen Goovaerts
                                      said his agency was awaiting the outcome of the investigation
                                      before discussing the cause of Monday's accident.</p>
              <p>"It was a nightmare," Christian Wampach, 47, told The
                                      Associated Press after medical workers bandaged his head at a
                                      sports complex where the less seriously injured were treated. Those
                                      hurt more badly were taken to several hospitals in and near
                                      Brussels. The Red Cross appealed for blood donations.</p>
              <p>"We were thrown about for about 15 seconds. There were
                                      a number of people injured in my car but I think all the dead were
                                      in the first car," said Wampach, who was in the third car of a
                                      Brussels-bound train.</p>
              <p>Photos from the scene showed rescuers pulling the
                                      wounded from a car that appeared to have tipped onto its side.
                                      Other emergency officials rushed victims on stretchers along the
                                      tracks.</p>
              <p>"When we came out we saw dead bodies lying next to the
                                      tracks, some mutilated," said Patricia Lallemand, 40, who was in
                                      the same car as Wampach, and was unhurt.</p>
              <p>Wira Leire, 20, said he was woken by a loud crashing
                                      sound and leapt to his bedroom window to see two cars jackknifed
                                      directly in front of his home.</p>
              <p>"There were people lying on the ground next to the
                                      train, so I grabbed some blankets and ran into the back garden," he
                                      said. "But I but couldn't climb over the concrete wall, so I just
                                      threw the blankets to the rescuers who were already gathering."</p>
              <p>Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme canceled a trip to
                                      Kosovo, turning around his plane minutes after landing at
                                      Pristina's main airport, the Kosovo prime minister's office
                                      said.</p>
              <p>Eurostar reported on its Web site that its high-speed
                                      trains had suspended service in and out of Brussels and could
                                      remain shut down all day.</p>
              <p>The international high-speed network Thalys, which
                                      links major cities in Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands,
                                      temporarily halted all traffic because its trains use the same
                                      rails as commuter lines near Hal, said Patricia Baars, a company
                                      spokeswoman.</p>
              <p>At least four Thalys trains were stopped en route, and
                                      the railway operator deployed staffers to stations where they were
                                      rerouted to provide assistance to travelers on board, she said.</p>
              <p>"No (Thalys) train is moving for the moment ... it's
                                      very hard to know today when services will resume," she said. "It
                                      appears this was a very severe accident."</p>
              <p>Thalys has at least 25 round-trip trains operating
                                      between Paris and Brussels each day, plus seven linking Brussels
                                      and Amsterdam and six from Belgium to Cologne, Germany.</p>

              <h1>EU officials express 'shock' over Belgian train crash</h1>
              <p>EUOBSERVER / BRUSSELS – EU officials on Monday (15 February)
              expressed their shock and offered condolences to the families affected
              by a train crash near Brussels, which killed at least 18 and severely
              injured dozens of passengers.</p>
              <p>"It is with profound shock that I've learned of the terrible train
              crash in Halle this morning. My thoughts and those of the European
              Commission are with the families of those affected by this tragedy," EU
              commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said in a statement, while
              also offering EU assistance to the Belgian local and federal
              authorities.</p>
              <p>His remarks were echoed by the head of the European Parliament,
              Jerzy Buzek, who also expressed his "sincere sympathies and
              condolences" to the families of the victims.</p>
              <p>Former Belgian Prime Minister Herman Van Rompuy, now the permanent
              president of the EU council, said he received the news with "great
              shock and sorrow."</p>
              <p>All three institutions are headquartered in the Belgian capital, some 15 kilometres north of the site of the crash.</p>
              <p>Belgian authorities said at least 18 died and 55 were injured when
              two commuter trains collided in Buizingen, a suburb of the Flemish town
              Halle. Some 250-300 passengers are estimated to have been onboard the
              two trains. A third train heading to Brussels was also caught in the
              wreckage, as it was unable to stop in time to avoid the crash.</p>
              <p>Several carriages were flipped over and electric cables hit the
              ground, making it even more difficult for emergency staff to reach the
              injured passengers. Some had to have limbs amputated on the spot.</p>
              <p>"All the emergency services are there. The most seriously injured
              are being treated at the scene before being taken to hospital," Halle
              mayor Dirk Pieters told VRT television.</p>
              <p>The crash occurred at 8.45am local time on Monday morning, when one
              of the trains apparently ignored the red light and collided frontally
              with the other.</p>
              <p>An investigation into the cause of the crash has been launched.</p>
              <p>"There were two tracks crossing and one of the trains apparently did
              not quite follow the instructions … and probably ran a red light,"
              Lodewijk De Witte, governor of the Brabant Flamand province, said at a
              news conference after the accident.</p>
              <p>Many of the victims were found in a first-class carriage. Survivors spoke of "carnage" and mass panic following the collision.</p>
              <p>The Red Cross appealed to donors of blood groups 0 and A to help out, as there is specific need for these two types of blood.</p>
              <p>It is the worst train crash Belgium has witnessed in 50 years.</p>
              <p>Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme urgently returned from Kosovo,
              where he had just began an official visit. He expressed his deepest
              sympathies with the victims of the accident. "No matter what the cause
              of the accident we are left feeling defeated, first Liege and now
              this," he said. A gas explosion in the town of Liege destroyed an
              apartment building at the end of January, killing 14 people.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Eurostar and Thalys, whose high-speed trains link
              Brussels to London and Paris, respectively, have announced that traffic
              has been suspended. It is unclear if passengers will be able to travel
              on Tuesday, but they can get their tickets reimbursed, the two
              companies announced.</p>

              <p>Despite what the Czech National Railway Company says about its trains being "high-speed", they are no where near that...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ÄŒeské Dráhy, the national railroad operator, says that its trains from Praha(Prague) to ÄŒeský BudÄ›jovice are those tilting Pendolinos which run at 200kmph, but why does it take up 4 to 5 damn hours for a 230km routing?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No sense rite? Travelling by car on a direct routing will take at most 2hours and 45min... And the bus should take around 3hours.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And the trains are more a$$pen$ive...<br>Screw them seriously...</p>

              <p>Ok will do so lah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Currently what I booked was, a 1st class sleeper(single suite, one bed) for me alone on the carriage from Budapest Keleti-pu to Warszawa Centralna. The train actually goes from Budapest Keleti-pu to Praha hl.n, but the carriage I am supposed to be in, will go with that train to Ostrava, where the carriages will be decoupled, and recoupled onto another train from Wien that goes to Warszawa Centralna.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those I'm not sure which rail company is administering the compartment that I am in. This is because the routing goes from Hungary(Budapest), through Slovakia(Bratislava and others), then into part of Austrian territory, then into Czech Republic where the carriages are decoupled and recoupled to other trains, and then Poland. So all in all my carriage goes through five countries in total. Suspect either is the Hungarians or the Poles operating as it is the terminus stops.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Still quite confusing for me... But luckily for me I managed to get my suite(single sleeper), otherwise it would be the couchettes where I would have to share accommodation with other travellers and that poses a higher security risk!</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>For me, I suspect is the Hungarians operating leh... After all it starts from Budapest... Who knows, perhaps the crew is jointly operated by the Hungarians and the Poles, you never know till you travel ah!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And good thing that you have a single room. Have heard about other travellers going in couchette, and waking up in the morning finding out that they have been mugged during the night!</p>

              <p>Just realised too, that my 1st class Eurail Europe East Pass, allows me free access to enter the ÖBB lounges in Wien Sudbahnhof, Wien Westbahnhof, Graz Hauptbahnhof, Klagenfurt Hauptbahnhof, Innsbruck Hauptbahnhof and Salzburg Hauptbahnhof!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Eh wait a moment, isn't Wien Sudbahnhof closed now for renovation works?! Thought only Wien Sudbahnhof Ostbahn is working...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think for me, as my itinerary goes along, would only use the ÖBB lounges in Wien Westbahnhof, Graz Hauptbahnhof, Innsbruck Hauptbahnhof and Salzburg Hauptbahnhof! Woots! Wonder whether drinks and food is provided? Or is it just lounge chairs zomg~...</p>
