              <p><br>i don't get it.. whats there to be happy about?? after all the rise in the ridership is because of the circle line mrt is up and running, the data they have i suppose is inaccurate as they did not factor this in.</p>

              <p><br>Circle Line's ridership figure is even worst than NEL when it started on a per km basis. Anyway Circle Line started only on May 28 2009, so it has negligible impact on the NSL/ EWL/ NEL ridership over the past 2 years.</p>

              <p><br>for now i would agree with you on this point but once the stage1 and 2 are runniing, we might see a reverse in the trend in your last sentence though i cannot comfirm it, based on the location of the stations near the CBD area and marina area, those are likely to have high human traffic which itself might surpass the NEL.</p>
              <p>another fact: i believe you also did not take into account on 1 station which is part of circle line and NSL-Doby ghaut &lt;- this is the key station which is the merging of all 3 lines which 2/3 of it is already operated by SMRT, thus it would also affect the upcoming data when it opens with Stage 1 and 2</p>
              <p>these are just my estimates though.</p>
