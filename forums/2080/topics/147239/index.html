There will be an upfront compensation of $10,000 per unit."<br><br>Some owners may even get up to $100,000 from the LTA.<br><br>The LTA has also provided a list of alternate units in other areas to help those affected by the move.<br><br>It said the acquisition and demolition of Hock Kee House would go ahead even if the Nicoll Highway accident had not happened.<br><br>Paul Fok, Civil Engineer of the LTA, said: "The decision to demolish Hock Kee House was made about a week ago, and the tenants and residents were informed of this on Thursday evening."<br><br>They will also have to move in a month's time before the LTA takes over the building. - CNA/de</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>SLA works out $17m compensation for Hock Kee House owners<br>By Julia Ng, Channel NewsAsia<br><br>SINGAPORE : The Singapore Land Authority has worked out a compensation package of about $17 million to owners of the 35 units at Hock Kee House in Paya Lebar.<br><br>On Thursday, the owners were informed of the compensation under the Land Acquisition Act, which SLA says is pegged to the current market value.<br><br>But some owners say the amount offered to them is up to 40 percent less than the valuation by their private valuers.<br><br>Since the government informed owners of Hock Kee House of the need to move a month ago, eight have already done so.<br><br>Another 24 units have indicated that they will move out before October 3 deadline.<br><br>The SLA said it had taken into account reports by the state valuer, as well as submissions by owners in working out the compensation package.<br><br>The statutory compensation is over and above the $3.2 million Special Assistance Financial Package by the Land Transport Authority.<br><br>There is also an ex-gratia payment for those who may suffer some hardship because of the acquisition at short-notice.<br><br>Simon Ong, Director of Land Resource Business at SLA, said: "The principle of payment for this ex-gratia is hardship. By hardship, we looked at individuals' special conditions. Such as their medical conditions, their mortgage status and so on."<br><br>The ex-gratia payment is on a case-by-case basis, so not every owner will get it.<br><br>But that is not the only reason owners of Hock Kee House are upset.<br><br>Of the 35 owners, 26 say they are not satisfied with the compensation amount they have been offered.<br><br>Tan Oon Fei, house owner at Hock Kee House, said: "The compensation given by SLA today is $300K. But according to my valuer, the report was $522,000. The difference is so wide! With this $300K given by SLA, I cannot even buy a same unit as mine!<br><br>"If you want to be fair, you need to compensate me with market value. Compensate with an amount which I can buy on the market value. But this is not the case!"<br><br>Ng Chee Lye, Coffeeshop owner at Hock Kee House, said: "They pay me only $1 million. My valuer valued at $1.56 million. So I am in the loss, so even in the open market, I cannot buy a coffeeshop which has around 3,000 square feet!<br><br>"Also, we claim for the ex-gratia - it is not given to me. They just give me the valuation of one million dollars."<br><br>The owners have up to September 29 to lodge an appeal (with the Appeals Board). - CNA/de</blockquote></div>
