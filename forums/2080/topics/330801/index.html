              <p>How about bangalas and the rest?</p>
              <p>One thing they all have in common is, they all like to STARE.</p>
              <p>Some stare from the corner of their eyes, some stare down at your dress because they think they are tall and have the right to see my valley of flowers, some stare openly like they have never seen the scenary behind my seat, some smiled like clowns thinking they're Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight.</p>
              <p>But I don't know why people in public transport all have this "You owe me 1 million dollars"-looks on their faces.</p>
              <p>Alot of rich people in Singapore nowadays hor....many people loaning 1 million dollars to many people. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>I have seen Singaporeans do all three farely frequently, so I arent sure if this form of racism is justifiable.</p>
              <p>In fact, the supposed habit of "squeezing" near to people can be a very welcome effort to ensure our crowded trains can pack even more folks in. Far too many people believe their "social distance" extends from the door to the middle of the carriage and refuses to budge!</p>

              <p>I consider public transport an economical way to travel around this compact city, as do many people who can afford a car or taxi, but choose to squeeze into buses or trains anyway. There is absolutely nothing degrading about being economical.</p>
