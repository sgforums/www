              <p>yes yes yes.... i alway encounter... those old uncle and aunties.. always like to stand near the door. Even though no space they would still want to go near the door and be the first to exit/board the train or bus. This is terrible behavior. Why so kan jiong i also dont understand.</p>
              <p>The worst encounter i had before was at chinatown. The bus came and it stop right infront of me. Therefore, by right I should be the first to board the bus, but then i became the last. Because there was a sudden rush of elderly folks from all direction and within seconds, the front of the door was packed with kiasu people.. damn it... this type of culture would persist for years to come. Hope in the future when the current crop of youngsters grow old, they would not repeat such behaviors.</p>
