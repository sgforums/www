SUPER small. they should enlarge them and fix them higher up around the stations and/or buildings containing the stations, instead of just fixing them above the entrance leading to the stations' concourse. elderly definitely have a problem reading them. thats made worse when the florescent tubes inside the station signs and beacons often fuse: you cant read them at all. some stations, such as Dhoby Ghaut, are even worse. they dun even have lighted external signage, just adhesive ones stuck above the entrances at atrium@orchard.<br><br>when i was in japan, the JR and Metro logos and their station names are extremely gigantic, well-lit and fixed high up on the buildings above/containing the stations. their stations can be spotted from many streets and many buildings away.</div>
