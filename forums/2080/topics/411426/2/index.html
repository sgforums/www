              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Here are some of the reasons why you won't get to see a
              consistent 2 mins per train frequency:</p>
              <p>1. We are currently facing "train shortage".<br> 2. SMRT &amp; LTA prefers to have the system to perform at it's
              optimum (24tph), rather than at it's maximum (28~30tph).<br> 3. Normal Mode and Fast Mode Exist in Auto Mode. A train coasting @
              40~60km/h is not utilizing every seconds. When accumulated enough
              over time, it will have sufficient headway to allows an
              extra train to be placed into the system for revenue service.<br> 4. Inefficient schedule. Trains are given too much time to travel
              in between stations. (See point 4)<br> 5. Schedule of train's frequencies are inconsistent.</p>
              <p>Train C &lt;--5 mins frequency--&gt; Train B &lt;--2 mins
              frequency--&gt; Train A</p>
              <p>6. During CM, performance of system decrease as TO are not
              trained well enough to operate a train as well as a computer.<br> 7. Automatic system has it's constraints and because of these
              constraints, multiple redundant failsafe mechanism are required to
              prevent an accident/incident from occuring. These failsafe
              mechanism decreases the maximum performance acheivable when
              compared to a system where trains are driven manually.</p>
              <p>Train congestion, is acceptable as long as there is no more than
              one train stopped completely waiting for the front train to clear.
              This problem can be minimized by enforcing effective &amp;
              efficient scheduling of train as well as "dwell time abuse".</p>
              <p>When the system are pushed to it's maximum:</p>
              <p>North-South/East-West Line: 45~70 seconds (6-car formation)
              (ATC-4)<br> Keikyu: 0~30 seconds (4,6,8, 12-car formation) (C-ATS)<br> Keio: 15~24 seconds (10-car formation) (ATS-S)<br> Yamanote: 25~30 seconds (11-car formation) (D-ATC)</p>
              <p>Frequencies given above are obtained by having the
              timer:<br> - Start: The moment the train starts to move off<br> - Stop: Front-end of the train behind touches the back end of the
              platform</p>
              <p>As different train system has different no.-of-car/train length,
              it's unfair to determine frequency by:<br> - Timer start when train totally cleared station, timer stop when
              train behind made a complete stop in station<br> - Timer start when the moment the train starts to moves off, timer
              stop when train behind made a complete stop in station<br> - Timer start when train has totally cleared the station, timer
              stop when front end of the train touches the back end of the
              platform</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>If train shortage, why still got train in depot?</p>
              <p>I think is TO shortage since not many people want to be TO.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6. CM mode should be used only when necessary.</p>

              <p>First of all, i think the statistics are unrelable. You really have to personally go hk maybe for a week or two week, everyday take train at peak hour, then u will see the difference.</p>
              <p>When MRT have a 1 min interval, most probably u will encounter the train stopping somewhere in the track and the it will have a "track fault" annoucement because it is too close to the train in front.</p>
              <p>In MTR, u seldom encounter that because i think MTR train never "park" at the terminus station like Joo koon. It will go one round back to the other plaform. U can take a look at hk tsuen wan terminus.</p>
              <p>For the door closing, in my experience with HK MTR, i think it is about the same time as singapore. Plus the recent overcrowding case, MRT wont be any faster.</p>

              <p>But for Tsuen Wan or Chai Wan case it seemed to be MUST use the TBS because there is no crossover in the front, whereas Harbourfront case, is they can use the TBS as there is a crossover in front as well.

              <p>1. A bus captain must have at least have a Class 3 licence, which means the person already know how to operate a car beforehand. Almost all TO have no experience in driving a train beforehand, which means the company has to invest more money in training the TO to operate a train. To recoup some of these losses, the company can opt to have a contract with the TO OR to have him start with a lower basic pay.</p>
              <p>2. To deal with suicide case, one of the many options available is to follow Japan's policy, that is to fine the family of those who suicide. Amount of fine imposed is dependant on how much delay it had caused and the number of people affected. This may not be applied to death which are not intentional and accidental.</p>
              <p>The fine may be harsh to the family as not only they had just lost their kin, but also an increased in burden due to the fine they have to pay. This force the suiciders to spare a thought for the consequences if he/she decides to suicide.</p>

              <p>I know per driver basis, per train basis or even per station basis, it take years, but if in overall, it is like taking months, just recently in 2010 where there are a bunch of suicides in Tanah Merah, Sembawang, Redhill (Not sure if it is an accident) and Bedok within 2 ~ 3 months.
