              <p>Raining, for training purposes during revenue service and when ATO fails.</p>
              <p>They are definitely improving. There're still rooms for improvement though, especially in handling the C151. No doubt it is slightly more difficult to handle, but with enough experience and judgement, one's performance can even exceed on how ATO handles the train.</p>
              <p>My definitions of handling a train well are:</p>
              <p><strong>- Fully understand on how the signalling system works<br>- Fully understand each train's performance and characteristics<br>- Knowing all speed limits in each sections<br>- Knowing the schedule and make use of it efficiently and effectively.</strong><strong><br></strong><strong>- Not releasing brake when braking into station<br>- Stop the train accurately within 25 seconds upon entering station<br>- Provides minimum shock to passengers when accelerating and decelerating</strong><strong><br>- Able to fufill the above regardless rain or shine.</strong></p>
              <p>There are of course, many other more requirements but these are some of them to list out.</p>

              <p><br>I prefer to think the reach and efficiency of the network is likely to be more important, as reflected in the LTA surveys. honestly 30 minutes isnt that long for a young person if it brings him/her very close to his/her home and do not wait excessively long for a service.</p>
              <p>although Singapore has a denser population on paper, Hong Kong's urbanised areas are very concentrated owing to its hilly terrain, and that provides the critical mass required to run more regular services. not to forget they have minibuses that bring the masses literally to their doorstep.</p>
              <p>and Hong Kong really isnt that big. 1104 square km compared to 710 square km. and dont forget much of it is low density hilly areas.</p>
              <p>this is compared to singapore's flat terrain where development is more or less equally spread out except within the central catchment and the pasir laba area.</p>
