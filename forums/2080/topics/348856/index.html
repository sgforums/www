                  in any privatised transportation company, it's rational to have the carriages packed at the maximum level..unless the government is willing to subsidise SMRT for all the profits lost in choosing to only allow a less than 100% capacity cap in each carriage for each train; at the worst case, more jobs can be created i.e. the train pushers ;)

              <p>I think the trains services i've been taking these days are fine. the only place where i do see huge crowd waiting is at City Hall northbound platform to jurong east. i think that cant be helped. because of the nature of the train route and the area it serves.</p>
              <p>NEL services are also fine, hope i wont be unlucky like few years back to be in the platform right at the time where service disrupted for 30min or more.. </p>

              <p>At 100 percent, seating is full and standing is just comfortable. At 150 percent, shoulders would rub against each other, and you still can read newspaper. 180 percent, you can read newspaper just nice, and body would have contact. 200 percent, you can feel the pressure on the body, and you cannot read magazines at all. 250 percent, you cannot move, and body might float upwards (pushed upwards). Doors might be forced open at this pressure.</p>
              <p>At 200 percent, its already bad enough, and 300 percent is almost unthinkable.</p>
              <p>I think we are barely at 180 percent, even on the worst cram ever occured excluding the Cram Jam competition. Counting that our trains are wider than Japanese ones, they would be able to pack 220 percent into our trains without much problem. 250 maybe, for external help included.</p>
              <p>Okay, sure you want to know how other lines fare. Here is the link to them all.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.mintetsu.or.jp/rail/strengthen/">http://www.mintetsu.or.jp/rail/strengthen/</a></p>
              <p>By strengthening the infrastructure, increasing carrying capacity per train, laying double tracks (improving existing network) is what can be done to cope with the increasing load. Over the years this is what Japanese engineers and transport planners did to reduce the squeeze factor, from 262 percent in 1960s to an average of 156 percent now.</p>
              <p>So we should be thankful no one tells us to <strong>squeeze 250 percent</strong> and <strong>help overload the trains.</strong> Of course squeeze and overload is not too reasonable, but by moving in and ensuring you have space around yourself just to read a magazine is what we can do on our part. The rest is not much to control.</p>

              <p>IMO, theres no necessity to say so much concept or explanation. i have already say all that i wanted to say in my prev post, if somehow or rather u still have disagreement then i dont know whats the problem here.</p>
              <p>everyone hopes for a comfortable train ride, it is as simple as that. theres no need to give 'lectures' or well-meaning 'matured' advice or judgements on how appreciative or grateful u think some people are, and i had always suspected that people who give this kind of 'lectures' are the ones who used to be like that themselves(no offence intended)</p>
              <p>and sure there are indeed some really ungrateful and unappreciative people out there who always like to complain and grumble but i think it is not the subject of discussion in this thread.</p>

              <p><br>Oh yes the boards at Serangoon Station. i agree, they could have been located at a better place (the 2 entrances at concourse level for example, or at the control there). </p>
              <p>usu the LED boards at the street level entrances will display arrival time(yellow for harbourfront and red for punggol), they will alternate between HBF and PGL quickly enough for u to catch the timing, but if sometimes HBF or PGL dont show up, usually it means train has already arrived... usually if they display 2 min on the led screen it means u have to walk fast or run already....</p>
              <p>as for the Outram/Dhoby interchange which u mentioned, this problem has always been my concern years back but not major enough for me to voice it out here, so thanks for mentioning this. I have always thought that if NEL belonged to SMRT alone they would have the sense to display arrival times of both lines at both sections of each station....now theres this SMRT and SBS 'territory" at Dhoby and Outram Interchange stations.</p>

              <p><br>Oh yes the boards at Serangoon Station. i agree, they could have been located at a better place (the 2 entrances at concourse level for example, or at the control there). </p>
              <p>usu the LED boards at the street level entrances will display arrival time(yellow for harbourfront and red for punggol), they will alternate between HBF and PGL quickly enough for u to catch the timing, but if sometimes HBF or PGL dont show up, usually it means train has already arrived... usually if they display 2 min on the led screen it means u have to walk fast or run already....</p>
              <p>as for the Outram/Dhoby interchange which u mentioned, this problem has always been my concern years back but not major enough for me to voice it out here, so thanks for mentioning this. I have always thought that if NEL belonged to SMRT alone they would have the sense to display arrival times of both lines at both sections of each station....now theres this SMRT and SBS 'territory" at Dhoby and Outram Interchange stations.</p>

              <p><br>You got a point there... To me the alternation between HBG and PGL ETAs are abit too slow for me as i walk rather fast =p... yea true somehow NEL's 2 mins is a really really short time compared to SMRT's 2 mins</p>
              <p>oh yea we'll see about the SMRT 'territory' at bishan then! I'm confident they would put the ETA for NSL on CCL side... cos these are determined by the operator mah and thanks to 'duopoly' commuters end up losing out at some stuff...</p>
