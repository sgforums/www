              <p>at least trains can run at lower frequencies. and thats why I
                  said the best option is simply running bus bridging services from
                  JKN-CLE. JUR-CLE bus bridging is just as disruptive as having

              <p>No, u failed to understand the issue. The main problem is that they need to change track on JUR EB direction. While it make sense on JKN - CLE, but you have failed to take into account of  JUR - CLE where the workers in front are changing tracks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another possiblity derived from your idea is a JUR - JKN and one train ply on CLE WB - JUR WB. But the main issue is in Chinese Garden, trains cannot do crossover.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or I may read it as CLE - JKN direct, but it will be like half hour per train, which is too dirsruptive / low efficency.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So ur suggestion is a JKN - CLE <strong>bus</strong> service. But the problem is where they find the drivers for it? (They got bus, but got no drivers and it will affect the bus schedule like mad as well!)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So my suggestion is, since this is a train issue, so must use train to solve it. And the best way is to have shuttle service, prefably 1 train from CLE WB - JUR WB and 2 trains (1 each on EB &amp; WB) for JUR - LKS and LKS - JKN is run like normal. The PSR - CLE is also unaffected.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>NSL side just have MRB - BGB normal and BGB - BBT one train on each platform (Due to high volume of passenger in CCK / Yew Tee / Woodlands) and 1 train in Jurong bound will go from BBT - JUR. (The frequency can be like 6 ~ 8 mins per train)</p>

              <p>This is my way of implementation if this were to be carried out. Of course, there are many other factors have to be considered for this switch out as it's not simple but at the same time, it shouldn't take more than 1 night to complete.</p>

              Pandan Depot<br> - EB train terminate at JE before turning around<br> - Only 2~4 train can be allowed to run between  Joo Koon and
              Jurong East, with EB train switching track at the switch
              near Lakeside and run on WB track.</p>
              <p>This is my way of implementation if this were to be carried out.
              Of course, there are many other factors have to be
              considered for this switch out as it's not simple but at the same
              time, it shouldn't take more than 1 night to complete.</p>

              <p>Nice resource. However there is some points to note:</p>
              <p>1: How to do a turnaround for EB trains in JUR?</p>
              <p>There is no crossover in Chinese Garden to do turnaround. And asking the train to proceed in front and crossover to middle track is simply plain dangerous, not to mention the train cannot crossover from JUR middle track to WB (Only WB &gt; NSL NB)</p>
              <p>2: If there is only 2 trains ~ 4 trains in JUR - JKN, then the frequency would be at least 15 minutes, so cannot leh.</p>

              <p>No, u failed to understand the issue. The main problem is that
              they need to change track on JUR EB direction. While it make sense
              on JKN - CLE, but you have failed to take into account of  JUR
              - CLE where the workers in front are changing tracks.</p>
              <p>Another possiblity derived from your idea is a JUR - JKN and one
              train ply on CLE WB - JUR WB. But the main issue is in Chinese
              Garden, trains cannot do crossover.</p>
              <p>Or I may read it as CLE - JKN direct, but it will be like half
              hour per train, which is too dirsruptive / low efficency.</p>
              <p>So ur suggestion is a JKN - CLE <strong>bus</strong> service.
              But the problem is where they find the drivers for it? (They got
              bus, but got no drivers and it will affect the bus schedule like
              mad as well!)</p>
              <p>So my suggestion is, since this is a train issue, so must use
              train to solve it. And the best way is to have shuttle service,
              prefably 1 train from CLE WB - JUR WB and 2 trains (1 each on EB
              &amp; WB) for JUR - LKS and LKS - JKN is run like normal. The PSR -
              CLE is also unaffected.</p>
              <p>NSL side just have MRB - BGB normal and BGB - BBT one train on
              each platform (Due to high volume of passenger in CCK / Yew Tee /
              Woodlands) and 1 train in Jurong bound will go from BBT - JUR. (The
              frequency can be like 6 ~ 8 mins per train)</p>

              <p>I believe SMRT has the bus drivers on weekends. they have no problems meeting chartered services like Airshow and navy open house anyway.</p>
              <p>yes I do know problem is no EB track. and E5's suggestion will mean JUR-JKN. if I had to exit at CLE, I will rather take a bus home, and I think many will think like me.</p>
              <p>not to forget I would be paying the full train fare twice, since there is no transfer rebate between trains.</p>
              <p>but I do see that it could benefit the commuters transferring from NSL at JUR though. but it will mean we are using the less efficient buses for perhaps the heaviest stretch of traffic for such transfers.</p>

              <p>Joo Koon no use leh. All shops and workplaces closed down. Anybody who want to go joo koon should alight at boon lay and take 252.</p>

              <p>I mean base on <a href="/users/223682">TPS Timothy Mok</a>'s suggestion of ending the Marina Bay bound train earlier, at 9:54pm and the last train for Toa Payoh bound train is 10:29pm which is to me making no sense at all. Why not Marina Bay bound trains end at 10:29pm because whether the train end at Marina Bay or Toa Payoh does not affect in the JEMP what.</p>

              <p><strong>NB Track</strong></p>
              <p>Due to the track changeover on the northern 
              track, we end
                                      service at 9.54pm (towards Marina Bay) 
              and 10.29pm (towards
                                      Toa Payoh). The last train will also leave Bukit
               Batok at 10.23pm
                                      going to Jurong East.</p>
