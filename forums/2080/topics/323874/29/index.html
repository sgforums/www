              <p>Took a train towards clementi just now. Apparently after Tiong Bahru, no announcement played or even when a train leaves (for example Redhill), it will start announcing the station name. Problem solved when it reached Commonwealth. Instead of mentioning that there is no train service between Clementi and Jurong East, it went to say No train service between Jurong East and Bukit Batok Instead. By the time it got to Clementi, most of the passengers were unaware that the train terminates there. Alighted, hop onto the shuttle bus. TIB862L. Took 15 mins to Jurong East. Boarded the train at Platform B. Ride was smooth. Got to lakeside, cross over to platform A. Boarded the train to Boon Lay. the whole journey took 90 mins instead of the usual 45-55 mins. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Return Journey: Boarded the train at Boon Lay. Got down At Lakeside, the shuttle train was already there. Time taken travelling from Lakeside to Chinese Garden was 6 mins. Nevermind, many passengers was already feeling agitated, especially the guy whom sat next to me. Chinese Garden to Jurong East took another 6 mins. The guy went to utter some foul words in the train. Got to Jurong East, took the train to Bukit Batok and bused back home. </p>

              <p>Overall, i felt that, instead of getting people confused at Lakeside, they should extend to Jurong East instead. X-over done at Lakeside. Save time and impatient pax would not get angry</p>

              <p>Not feasible, at any one time can have 2 concurent trains in
              Lakeside - Jurong East sector. Maybe they can try doing alternative
              trains. (Every 2 ~ 3 shuttle trains will have a Jurong East - Joo
              Koon and Lakeside - Joo Koon train.)</p>

And there are people helping me," said one commuter. <br><br>"It's quite inconvenient, because we have to turn, walk a lot of rounds, and then take the buses," said another commuter. <br><br>Some weren't happy that their journey took longer than usual. <br><br>"It's very far, very long, (and) very tiring," said a commuter. <br><br>"We want to go to City Hall. Instead of taking the East-West line, we are taking the North South line. It's a longer route and more time consuming," complained another commuter. <br><br>"We ask for the public's understanding and patience. We'll like to encourage the public to use the North South line and the existing MRT lines as much as possible. Currently public bus services are also available," said Chua Chong Kheng, Group Director (Thomson and Existing Lines), Land Transport Authority. <br><br>"And on the ground now, we have 400 over staff who are helping to manage the situation at the affected stations," he added. <br><br>Upgrading works began at about 1am on Saturday and are slated to be completed by 4am on Monday, before normal service resumes at about 5.45am. <br><br>In the first few days following the upgrading works, commuters may experience a slower train speed over the affected stretches, as the system is being fine-tuned to its full performance capacity. <br><br>The upgrading works have been described as a major and complex operation. It involves installing turnouts to connect new tracks to the existing ones at three locations. The turn outs will allow trains to move from one track to another. <br><br>The next service disruption will take place on the weekend of September 18 and 19, and will only affect passengers taking the North South line, as there will be no train services between Jurong East and Bukit Batok stations. - CNA /ls</span></p></div>
