              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN-GB"><strong style="color: black;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Expanding
              Capacity for a Shorter Waiting Time</span></strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">1.         Come 2012,
              with the completion of the Jurong East Modification Project (JEMP), commuters
              will have a shorter wait for trains along the North-South and East-West Lines
              and a more comfortable ride during peak periods. JEMP is one of the broad range
              of initiatives announced under the Land Transport Review in January 2008 to
              promote public transport as a choice mode.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">2.         Currently,
              trains travelling to and from the Jurong East and Bukit Batok stations have to
              take turns arriving and departing from the shared middle platform at Jurong East
              station. This slows down the trains running through the Jurong East interchange
              station. JEMP, which entails adding a new track alignment and platform at the
              Jurong East interchange station for the North-South MRT Lines, will overcome
              this infrastructural constraint. As a result, trains can be put through Jurong
              East station at shorter intervals.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">3.        
              Concurrently, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) will also add another 17 trains
              to the North-South and East-West Lines by end 2012 to take full advantage of the
              shorter train intervals through Jurong East made possible by JEMP.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">4.         With the
              completion of the JEMP and the purchase of additional trains, the carrying
              capacity of the North-South and East-West Lines will increase. SMRT would be
              able to run additional train trips, particularly during peak periods, to shorten
              waiting times and reduce crowding on trains.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">5.         Mr Yam Ah
              Mee, LTA Chief Executive said, "MRT ridership has increased significantly
              over the last decade. JEMP is a timely initiative to meet our travel needs. With
              JEMP and the additional trains, commuters can look forward to shorter waiting
              times and a more comfortable journey."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">6.         Commuters
              can expect a shorter waiting time of around two minutes at stretches that
              experience heavy loading during the peak within peak periods, compared to the
              current 2.5 to 4.5 minutes at some stretches of the North-South and East-West
              Lines today. JEMP and the additional trains will boost passenger carrying
              capacity by 15% to ensure a more comfortable ride.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">7.         Civil works
              for JEMP are scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2009. Measures will be
              put in place to minimise disruption to commuters using the Jurong East Station
              as well as residents in the vicinity. For instance, the new 2.5 km viaduct will
              incorporate precast concrete beams that would be cast off-site.</span></p>

              <p>I am guessing both platforms (the current shared track) and the new platform will be utilised during peak hours. Treat it like any other existing terminus station like Pasir Ris.</p>
              <p>I agree there will be a little problem happening say if a person transfers to another train during peak hours, because people will be wondering why there is a south-bound train at the new platform and possibly no train at the current middle platform for passengers transferring from west-bound train. Also, there is the problem of transfer westwards from the North South Line to Boon Lay (and Joo Koon) with the new platform, since many people work in Jurong.</p>
              <p>During off-peak hours, the current middle platform will be used I believe. Let's see how this works out 4 years later.</p>

              <p>I'm also a bit confused by the design.</p>
              <p>Ok, for example, if i transfer to northbound from westbound, which side should i alight? or this information will be displayed on the LCD before arriving at JE?</p>
              <p>It should be also indicated which platform the train will use for southbound trian, Jurong East South (the old platform) or the Jurong East North (the new one), so that people transfering to westbound may wait for the train going towards the old platform</p>

              <p>I think the best they can do is: to add a platform and track next to the eastbound. then there will be 2 tracks where you can alight at both sides (the eastbound will also have a platform on both sides like the southbound). Then they should let trains terminate and depart from the old platform (middle platform) and the northbound train going towards pasir ris during peak of peak should arrive on the new track and platform (Platform C). then passengers going towards pasir ris has a own platform, they can take the train which is coming first ( the train coming from boon lay or the train coming from bukit batok). the passengers from bukit batok where the train terminates at jurong east and go back to marina bay can use platform A to transfer to the train towards Pasir Ris and people going towards Boon Lay can use platform B to transfer to the train towards Boon lay like now. If they do like this only people in the train from Ang Mo Kio towards Pasir Ris, who are going towards Boon Lay has to go to another platform. (they will alight at platform C and then they have to go to platform B)</p>

              <p>One thing to do to existing facilities. Just a rough sketch and a small scenario.</p>
              <p>Allowing track 1 to be both 'EWL EB' and 'NSL alighting' only. Track 2, middle track that is, to be 'NSL boarding and alighting' only. Track 3 to be 'EWL WB' only.</p>
              <p>Taking zone A as platform 1, zone B as switch over from EWL EB to NSL, and zone C as platform 2.</p>
              <p>Train numbers in this scenario starting with 0 are NSL trains. Starting with 1, EWL trains.</p>
              <p>Train 001 pulls into zone A, alights passengers. 1.5 minutes behind train 002 pulls into zone C. Train 001 pulls out of zone A, goes into zone B, train 002 remains in zone C, picks up passengers and departs for Marina Bay, then train 001 pulls into zone C from B, and picks up passengers, then departs. Train 101 would pull into zone A as train 001 enter zone B. Train 101 picks up passengers, exits zone A into Clementi direction, 1.5 minutes later, train 003 enters zone A, drops off passengers, exits zone A into B. Train 004 enters zone C, drops and takes in passengers, while in the same time train 102 enters zone A and takes in EB passengers, while train 004 exits to let train 003 enter zone C...</p>
              <p>This can be applied to normal hours, not only peak.</p>
              <p>Why let one train go to the middle track, from NSL to EWL EB then to middle track, then turn back to NSL? This acts as an invisible turn-around facility, <strong>without having the train operator walk from end to end when the train is in the platform</strong> (or having operators waiting at both platform ends), wasting operation time!</p>
              <p>By routing a train to the middle service track at the eastern end of JUR station, the line can be clear for the EWL EB trains to continue service. NSL can maintain 2 minute frequency.</p>

              <p>They might do something like what the New York City Subway did to their Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station: reconstruct a new arching roof over the expanded station. When the New Yorkers went in to reconstruct and upgrade that station, they build a new, single arching roof over the large, 8-track station; it previously also had 8 tracks, but the platforms had individual roofs originally. I don't see why LTA won't want to take this opportunity to reconstruct the roof of Jurong East station and make it similar to New York's Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue, though it will definitely be a precarious and dangerous job - the New York City Subway had to close down part of that station when they were upgrading it.</p>
