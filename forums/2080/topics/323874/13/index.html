              <p>of course it poses a challenge. installing new tracks and switches involve the installation of signalling stuff, and all these deal with heavy equipments and lots of electronical stuff. high safety precautionary measures have to be taken in any situation like these.</p>

              <p>The main problem is not closing the station, is how the trains go without being affected, i mean EB and NSL got most trouble de.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think they have planned it before the commence of the work. I believe it is a challenge, but it is possible. I never say such thing can be done within an hour, but I dont believe it need to close the ENTIRE DAY. This is not like Harbourfront - Outram Park and the impact is minimal. It involves 2 lines and peak hour how?</p>
              <p>The solution to this is easy: 1 day prior the change of tracks, they just end the train service early, say instead of 11:45pm or 12am, they end by 10pm or even 9:30pm, like that the peak hour have gone le so its ok. Then they start the service slightly later on the next day, such as 6:45am first train instead of 5:45am (Like that got about 8 ~ 9 hours, still not enough? My foot!). 6:45am is choosen because it is nearest to peak hour. Sure, students will be affected but most students do not take trains (Except teritary ones).</p>
              <p>OR</p>
              <p>They do not install new tracks @ e same time. Meaning the EWL batch (The end connecting EWL) do first, like that wont affect NSL. And the NSL may do it separately.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In case you guys not happy on how to implement this, it is actually easy.</p>
              <p>Step 1: First 2 trains after the last revenue train will park themselves in Joo Koon overrun</p>
              <p>Step 2: The next 4 trains will go to Chinese Garden, Lakeside, Boon Lay and Pioneer EB platform respectively.</p>
              <p>Step 3: Careful plan must be made, such that some time later, all trains end at Clementi and do a return trip in UPD crossover. (So no more new trains stuck in this Western portion)</p>
              <p>Step 4: JKN WB overrun (Future will be heading Tuas) train will be the first one heading to UPD via WB track. JKN EB overrun train will be the next one, which it will crossover to WB.</p>
              <p>Step 5: All the remaining trains will do a crossover from EB track - WB platform. And they use WB platform to head to UPD.</p>

              <p>if the removing and welding cannot be stopped once it begins, I think a staggered schedule like this is better. though I believe they will still need to end services early and start services later the next day. 4h is pretty tight.</p>
              <p>very uncharacteristic of singapore to make things so disruptive to need bus bridging services for the entire day.</p>

              choosen because it is nearest to peak hour. Sure, students will be
              affected but most students do not take trains (Except teritary
              ones).</p>
              <p>OR</p>
              <p>They do not install new tracks @ e same time. Meaning the EWL
              batch (The end connecting EWL) do first, like that wont affect NSL.
              And the NSL may do it separately.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In case you guys not happy on how to implement this, it is
              actually easy.</p>
              <p>Step 1: First 2 trains after the last revenue train will park
              themselves in Joo Koon overrun</p>
              <p>Step 2: The next 4 trains will go to Chinese Garden, Lakeside,
              Boon Lay and Pioneer EB platform respectively.</p>
              <p>Step 3: Careful plan must be made, such that some time later,
              all trains end at Clementi and do a return trip in UPD crossover.
              (So no more new trains stuck in this Western portion)</p>
              <p>Step 4: JKN WB overrun (Future will be heading Tuas) train will
              be the first one heading to UPD via WB track. JKN EB overrun train
              will be the next one, which it will crossover to WB.</p>
              <p>Step 5: All the remaining trains will do a crossover from EB
              track - WB platform. And they use WB platform to head to UPD.</p>

              <p>There always a Plan B (Modified from your query)</p>
              <p>Example: The last train for EB from in Joo Koon is 10pm</p>
              <p>So, assuming from Clementi - Joo Koon takes 15 minutes</p>
              <p>Then, the train may park there for 5 minutes</p>
              <p>In total it means by 9:40pm, the last EB train from Joo Koon should be in Clementi ready to depart and head towards Jurong East.</p>
              <p>And thus any train after 9:40pm in Clementi will be a DNB, either do a turnaround for EB in approaching UPD or directly sleep in UPD</p>
              <p>But, the problem is Clementi is a crowded station, so does Boon Lay. It effectively suggest the last train from Pasir Ris to Joo Koon is about 8:30pm to 9pm, which kind of difficult.</p>
              <p>But there is a Plan C.</p>
              <p>Any train after 9:40pm will have a special train bridging service from Clementi - Lakeside and Lakeside - Joo Koon.</p>
              <p>We will first talk about Lakeside - Joo Koon, since it is easier.</p>
              <p>For this, both platform will presume as normal, since Lakeside got a Tandem crossover (Same as Boon Lay, except Boon Lay's is before the station and Lakeside is after it, in terms of WB). Special staff logistic is needed in Lakeside to tell passengers the train is heading either Clementi or Joo Koon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since there are 4 stations, I presume they can deploy 4 to 6 for it (Joo Koon's distance is quite long).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then the Clementi - Lakeside is more tricky.</p>
              <p>Due to lack of crossover before Lakeside (In terms of WB), most likely they will provide a bus bridging service OR provide only 1 train from Clementi - Lakeside (But the frequency will be like every half an hour per train). Since the entire route has no crossover for Lakeside - Clementi, so it is really not possible to do much.</p>

              <p>This cannot work</p>
              <p>1: The NSL sector will also need to change the tracks as well. (Ok, I did not my solution there)</p>
              <p>2: Lakeside got a tandem crossover, thus the c,d,e is quite wasteful in resource, especially between Pioneer to Joo Koon has no crossover, except before Joo Koon terminus. Why not do a Joo Koon - Lakeside direct train, where the Lakeside bound train from Joo Koon will terminate in EB platform followed by a crossover to WB when returning to Joo Koon. Lakeside WB platform can be used as terminus for Chinese Garden WB platform - Lakeside shuttle train and Chinese Garden EB platform can connect to Jurong East EB. The WB platform can serve as a shuttle train to Clementi WB. (But only 1, where the rest do a turnaround in Clementi / UPD)</p>

              <p>My suggestion for NSL</p>
              <p>1: End ther service early, say 10pm last train at Bukit Gombak. After 10pm, all trains from Marina Bay will end at Bukit Gombak, use the crossover towards Bukit Batok, so that the majority of the line is unaffected.</p>
              <p>2: 1 shuttle train from BGB - BBT and 1 shuttle train from BBT - JUR middle track.</p>
              <p>The BGB - BBT will be used in NB platform and BBT - JUR will be using SB platform instead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reasoning:</p>
              <p>The crossover from NSL to JEMP-ed platform is added in the crossover used in morning peak hour track. Thus, at night time, the platform / track is essentially unused. So it can be done without affecting much. It is the NB side, it crossover onto a main line, thus the BBT NB platform has to be closed.</p>
              <p>Regarding trains being DNB, they might just as well:</p>
              <p>A) Increase the number of Ang Mo Kio bound train (After AMK, it is a DNB)</p>
              <p>B) Use middle track to get everybody's back off. I think they can do so in CGL Tanah Merah / AMK LTE, so can they in Jurong East.</p>

              <p>any sort of train shuttle has to be JKN-CLE. any others increases the complexity of scheduling and heightens chances of delays since the plans are so precise. what's more, it will be a lot of planning for something that will only last for a weekend or two.</p>
              <p>passengers would not bother with the trains if they had to alright and wait for the next train in such a short segment either.</p>
              <p>if this was done on a weekend, I believe it will be more beneficial for commuters if a bus bridging service is operated. it is very possible to run buses along the entire length of the line from JKN-CLE and fro. there wont be any jams (except a little while for the traffic light along Upper Jurong Road near Jurong Point) and is less disruptive.</p>
              <p>only problem should be the volume of passengers. but any shuttle train service will result in poor frequencies anyway, with the added problem of multiple transfers and further delays if any train fail to keep to schedule.</p>
              <p>this is especially when frequencies are poor and with so many people packed into a train, boarding and alighting time will become unpredictable. it is a vicious cycle with trains becoming increasingly off schedule due to the delays.</p>

              <p>any sort of train shuttle has to be JKN-CLE. any others
              increases the complexity of scheduling and heightens chances of
              delays since the plans are so precise. what's more, it will be a
              lot of planning for something that will only last for a weekend or
              two.</p>
              <p>passengers would not bother with the trains if they had to
              alright and wait for the next train in such a short segment
              either.</p>
              <p>if this was done on a weekend, I believe it will be more
              beneficial for commuters if a bus bridging service is operated. it
              is very possible to run buses along the entire length of the line
              from JKN-CLE and fro. there wont be any jams (except a little while
              for the traffic light along Upper Jurong Road near Jurong Point)
              and is less disruptive.</p>
              <p>only problem should be the volume of passengers. but any shuttle
              train service will result in poor frequencies anyway, with the
              added problem of multiple transfers and further delays if any train
              fail to keep to schedule.</p>
              <p>this is especially when frequencies are poor and with so many
              people packed into a train, boarding and alighting time will become
              unpredictable. it is a vicious cycle with trains becoming
              increasingly off schedule due to the delays.</p>

              <p>If it is a JKN - CLE, then u might as well no shuttle train, just run like normal. (Cannot right?)</p>

              <p>Trains going to Joo Koon will crossover to the middle

              <p>Trains from the NSL terminating at Jurong East goes to the EB

              <p>Trains going to Joo Koon between Jurong East and Joo Koon would

              </blockquote>
              <p>No. In fact the JEMP does not mod the WB side but EB side and NSL SB side (Along with NSL JUR bound - EB track, which is most likely not in use except morning peak hours).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And there is no EB - Middle platform crossover track due to height issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just a note: If the work had affected the morning peak hour special train service track, then I can say the entire section is heavily haywired. (Coz even if the train park in middle track and proceed forward, they will still meet the mod of EB track, unless the 3 points -- NSL NB - EB crossover, NSL SB, EWL EB side are do it at different timings)</p>

              <p>Ok, 6 trains for EWL sectors and 2 trains (At most 3) in NSL sector</p>
              <p>1 train from BGB - BBT (At most 2, 1 on each platform, for quicker to reach BBT Town Centre) and the other 1 from BBT - JUR (Due to NSL SB track is modding, so the shuttle train has to use NB / JUR bound tracks.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another suggestion:</p>
              <p>JKN - LKS will run per normal, and 2 trains from each platform will ply the service from Lakeside - Jurong East (So to reduce frequency time) and 1 train from JUR WB will ply between CLE - shuttle train JUR. Like that will minimze the impact.</p>
