              <p>The TO should be able to choose to continue. He/She might be given a few days off (paid leave I guess) so that he/she can overcome this terrifying scene.</p>

              <p>Drivers are on schedule. Every week, their duty roster change. Not everyday they drive, I think abt 2-3 days break for them. They can't choose. Is the department who chooses for them.</p>

              <p>Normally after going through such an incident the company would let the driver have some time off, means leave days until he can come back for work. They would also recommend the staff to go through psychological counseling before they are deemed fit to resume work.</p>

              <p>another inconsiderate fella taking his own life. if one jumps on to the track and dies, the body will be like a road block and all the trains heading towards pasir ris is affected. likely it is in tanah merah, at least have 3 tracks.</p>
              <p>so juz do like in the past loh, one train goes to pasir ris, then the next one goes to changi airport consecutively. juz that mrt needs time to co-ordinate this.</p>
              <p>smrt should quickily half-height platform screen doors to all these above ground mrt stations. so at least it will be harder for people to jump. at least the commuters there can help to pull back whichever idiot who wants to commit suicide on the tracks...</p>

              <p>1st and 2nd from ur opinions are obviously not the case. SMRT cares no hoots about people thinking the train is haunted or pple buying 4D with the train number.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And 3rd, the train can go for a wash, a semi-thorough inspection, and be out for service by the next morning.</p>
