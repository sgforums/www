              <p>There are certain things called responsibility, well there is no such rules / laws to media to be censored but I think it could either be this OR the train by then had towed to depot for checkup / inspection such that the TRN / Train car number is not clearly flimed. I am sure there is a reason why the number is not clearly shown in the photos.</p>

              <p>That is why as a train fan, I feel sad when the number was not revealed / open <strong>publicly</strong>. (Does not show in papers / internet does not mean the staff dont know which train was involved in an incident.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Logically speaking, my stnad really looks weird, humerous and childish.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, based on previous incidents, regardless of suicide or car accident or even murders, there do really a lot of people buy these lottery and few even make some bucks out of it. So I still think that the media is avoiding kena public condemnation or sort (There surely got people ask the reporters to avoid showing such numbers one)</p>

              <p>Fryderyk is right about this one.</p>
              <p>Even a non-media student can see this.</p>

              <p>Well, you are probably right in this case along with the others, just that my logic was taken the aftermath from Chinese Garden incident, where one of the social worker mentioned on a Channel U TV talkshow that it will be better for the reporters not to report too much on such incidents before glorifying that suicide is a way to solve problem as many would have pity you etc. (Sure, that suicide case was due to $$ woes where recent reports on TNM incident shows that the male lead was coming from a rich family background and my personal educated guess is either due to failed relationship or illness for his suicide case, who knows!?)</p>
