              <div><span id="lblContent"> What kind of example is this man setting for his young son seated next to him, wonders a STOMPer, who allegedly approached the former to give up his priority seat to an old woman.
              <div> </div>
              <div><strong>Ben</strong> was appalled by this.<br><br>He emailed STOMP on Mar 21 and said:<br><br>"It was a rainy afternoon when I boarded the ever crowded train at Dhoby Ghaut. I was dismayed by the sight of a father and son, both sitting on priority seats not willing to give up their seats to a frail old lady.<br><br>"Thinking that he may be too engrossed in his papers, I tapped him and asked,” do you mind giving up your seat to someone who needs it more than you? You are on priority seats.” With the papers in his hands, he looked at me briefly and replied nonchalantly, “I mind.”<br><br>"I mean, I’ve read of cases like such on stomp and I wished id never had to witness it myself. It was the most disgusting sight I witnessed in a long while. He looked like a nice educated man. Sadly, he’s only educated in his head and not in his heart.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"Worst of all, he was with his son. There are times we question the educational system in Singapore. But seriously, what are some parents teaching their own children?</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"As the old lady refused for her picture to be taken, I have taken photos of the father and son on priority seats. I sincerely hope that photographs of them would be published! The ugly Singaporeans. Whats worse? He’s an ugly father!<br><br>"Honestly, the best part of this social experiment, everyone saw but no one but another “auntie” who gave up her own seat."<br><br><strong>Another eye-witness report:</strong></div>
              <div><strong><br> </strong></div>
              </span></div>
              <div>STOMPer Ben sent in pictures yesterday (Mar 21) of this man setting a bad example for his son by refusing to give up his seat for the elderly. Here is another eye-witness report from <strong>STOMPer SF</strong>. <br><br>In an email to STOMP today (Mar 22), the STOMPer SF says: <br><br>“This man sets a bad example for his son by refusing to give up his seat for the elderly. "<br><br>“I witnessed the whole incident, and was so dismayed by their behaviours. "<br><br>“I took their pictures, and wanted to post on STOMP, but STOMPer Ben was ahead of me. "<br><br>“Imagine a raining day and the train was as usual packed. "<br><br>“The father was reading newspaper while the son was playing his PSP. The father saw this old lady standing right in front of him, but he pretended not to see her by reading his papers. "<br><br>“This young gentleman whom I do not know, went over to approach the man (the father). I heard him asking him politely if he would mind giving up his seat to the old lady as he was sitting on a priority seat. "<br><br>“I couldn’t hear the man’s (the father) reply but I could only see that he took a look at the gentleman, shook his head and continued reading his papers. "<br><br>“Then, I heard the gentleman saying in an angry tone, ‘I hope you are not a Singaporean.’ That inconsiderate father just did not care and continued reading his paper while his son played with his PSP. "<br><br>“Many people like myself witnessed this and I was so disgusted by the ugly scene. "<br><br>“I saw some of you giving negative comments to STOMPer Ben, but I was there too to witness the inconsiderate act, and I don’t know Ben. Ben is just like any other ordinary stranger to me. "<br><br>“Like Ben, I was one of the passengers on the train who was also very dismayed by this man’s behaviour. He looks well educated but too bad, he was a totally bad example for his son. "<br><br>“Shame on him for not feeling embarrassed, as many of the passengers witnessed the entire event and even stared at him. "<br><br>“I feel that STOMPer Ben should not be receiving such sarcastic comments from some STOMPers. He does not deserve sarcastic comments. "<br><br>“At least we should feel proud of a young man, a Singaporean like him, who is willing to speak up. "<br><br>“How many young Singaporeans are willing to do so?"<br><br>"Thumbs up Ben."</div>
