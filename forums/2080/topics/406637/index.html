              <p>Reading your post I feel that you are indeed a fortunate person. Not many people who like buying Sound Level Meters have the opportunity to measure them in the convenience of their house.</p>
              <p>And what better subject matter to measure it on than our own SMRT Train System.</p>
              <p>I myself don't think i'd ever be able to take the noise of the train passing by daily. Therefore i don't think i'll ever buy a house next to the train tracks.</p>

              <p>i can't even hear a C751B from 300m away. more like a C651 would be able to do that. my house is nearly 500m away from Admiralty Station, can hear a C651 pull away from the station, but a bit vague.</p>

As they said that the noise above 75db should longer then 5mins then only can consider as a “noise”…seen the train only pass by lesser than 1 minute so it is still under requirement….they forget that the train almost pass by every 10mins.</span></p>

              for the information. Ya. Did complain to NEA…no respond from them
              as you mentioned. As they said that the noise above 75db should
              longer then 5mins then only can consider as a “noise”…seen the
              train only pass by lesser than 1 minute so it is still under
              requirement….they forget that the train almost pass by every
              10mins.</span></p>

              Buying house in which location is my personal business. Hope you
              understand it. MRT making noise and disturb our life is the problem
              they have to solve. Isn’t it?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Guys can google
              get the information about the train system in Tokyo, Soul and
              Taipei city. Their authorities really doing a good job. I believe
              Singapore can do the same. If we want it..</span></p>

              <p>I guess no choice. The only way is to move house..  <br><br>My friend lives about 800m away from the Choa Chu Kang LRT station and he always wake up by the sound of the station announcement that goes "Please stand behind the yellow line" at 5am in the morning..... The noise gets away at about 630am... when people start to fill the stations with voices.... <br><br>I am glad I live next to a park.. and all I hear is the sound of frogs and monkeys fighting ....LOL...</p>

              <p>In Singapore, everything is about cost. <br><br>Look at what SMRT responded in the past... and you know it.... <br><br>Everyone suggested building window glass gate doors on overhead stations to prevent people from falling in or committing suicide few years back.... SMRT response was that it was not economically viable. <br><br>They changed their response last year, only when there were too many people jumping into the stations and that their MRT could not resume services, leading to heavy losses where they have to provide free shuttle buses to do bridging services before they actually started installing those window panels... <br><br>What you can do is to feedback your town council.... and SMRT... but I would say the probability of building sound absorption panels is almost zero.</p>
