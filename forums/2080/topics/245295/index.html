            <div class='col-md body'>erm... abit no link huh? besides i think SMRT's AP is better than NEL...<br>even NEL took 3 months to settle the over-running problem before it opened... even in some parts of the travel can tell it had such problems... take the stretch jus before reaching boon keng going towards harbourfront for example... the train rolls constantly, suddenly speeds up and brakes jus as it pulls into book keng stn...<br><br>plus the only time i've seen over-running by SMRT trains is during peak hour at manual mode...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm quite agreeable that overruns would normally occur when manual operations are in, well, operation, but I guess the auto systems will also do necessary adjustments, but during several stretchs of the line the trains will either run very fast (Woodleigh, at least 80km/h pass station) and slow (before Serangoon stn).</div>

That's why there seems to be several faults occuring on the NEL system during the first few years of operation. but i believe will gradually improve and stabilise over the years.</div>
