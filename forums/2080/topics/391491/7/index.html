              <p>In the first place, based on LTA whitepaper, it was indeed CCL (An LRT line then) will not go to Daktoa but Marine Parade (Refer to below link Page 57)</p>
              <p>Evidence:</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>So my personal speculation is that they will extend the middle platform of PYL to Marine Parade / Tanjong Katong Road.</p>
              <p>Yes, now ERL does not go to Paya Lebar, but it does not means CCL can never go to Marine Parade.</p>
              <p>In either case, look at this example:</p>
              <p>In the inital stage of CCL, nobody would have expected a Downtown Extension, which is an extension of CCL, but now become Downtown Line.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, nobody expected a Marina Bay Extension in the first place. It was subsequently later, the Marina Bay Extension was announced.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So now ERL does not go to Paya Lebar (Or CCL does not go to Marine Parade) does not mean in future it will never as well. Just like Changi Airport Extension.....</p>

              <p>I do not disagree with your statement. However, I was talking about the confirmed Eastern Region Line. The one which runs from Marina Bay area across the East Coast. Anyway, as for your CCL LRT statement, it was supposed to be overground so the soil conditions (or more accurately, Marine Clay) can be avoided by strategically placing the viaducts.</p>

              <p>Personally, I wont disagree on your point in it (I dunno how u noe it was supposed to be overground when the places along the line with so many buildings, and even if PYL that time was not a 3 track formation, how are they are built it with the EWL up there?) and I more on speculaing it as a CCL extension / Stage 6 (If Harbourfront - Marina Bay will be of Marina Bay Extension Stage 2 or even rebranded as Harbourfront (Keppel) extension should they close up the circle)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do note that I feel that the ERL has a lack of depot facilities, even if there is one, it is at Changi Point or Changi Depot which is too near to Changi Airport / Changi Naval Base which is another security issue. (So they must have at least one more backup depot, which the middle track of PYL can be used. More details will come to light when the ERL's track schematic diagram is out.)</p>

              <p>It's an LRT. It's like how they constructed BPLRT with all the buildings at the side.</p>
              <p>I think you're thinking too much. They're closing the circle at Promenade.</p>
              <p>There is a possibility for Thomson Line and Eastern Region Line to be linked actually, judging from the sketches seen in the papers and on the news. Maybe it could be like DTL where actually 3 seperate lines were planned.</p>

              <p>Do you know that why DTL Stage 3 is delayed like mad and why Kallang Line was never materialized.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to my observation and some "field trips", I think I finally I got the answer. For me to post the answer, I need to analyze the history first</p>
              <p>1: The EWL / NSL was built in the 1980s with Jurong East, Ang Mo Kio and Tanah Merah are the only 3 stations with a middle track  / platform facility.</p>
              <p>2: Jurong East was the first station with full utilize of 3 platforms for CCK branch line / NSL after Woodlands Extension, followed by Tanah Merah (When CGA extension was reverted to branch line). Ang Mo Kio not so except the LTE service.</p>
              <p>3: Well, according to the track diagram, Jurong East's one is the most similar to Ang Mo Kio's one, as it has a track split into 2 after the station (Despite the distance for that in Ang Mo Kio was way longer). Tanah Merah does not have such, with the exception of crossover somewhere near Expo. Thus, for the starting point of the Kallang Line, which is Ang Mo Kio, must use Jurong East as a comparison.</p>
              <p>Ok, so based on the above, one of the reason for the failure of Kallang Line will be "AMMP" / "AKMP"</p>
              <p>1: Seriously, I believe that if they have built the Kallang line way backed in the 2000s, then they might need to do the Ang Mo Kio Modification Project, which will be more troublesome than JEMP, because on the left (Near the AMK hub) is not possible / technically more challenging than JEMP and neither on the right (Distance and a hill / slope issue). Do note that JEMP is possible when the left side of JUR is an empty plot of land.</p>
              <p>2: Ok, now go to analyze the Kallang Line. It would have been an extension from Ang Mo Kio to Bishan Depot (passing through) and probably follow the Kallang River. (If you go to somewhere near SBS Comfort Delgro HQ in Braddell Road, you might catch a glimsp of BSD) So the problem is, should they turn left towards Potong Pasir area and serve Kolam Ayer area / Kallang Bharu &amp; Basin area and make Kallang a interchange (Which is not based on the above LTA whitepaper link) or after Kallang Bharu / Basin area, it turn sharply to Lavender (Which matches the diagram, somehow). Most likely in either case, it will further down to Marina Bay and do a turnaround. (Maybe if they were to built now / future, it will on Marina Barrage / Pier).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, theres a catch for the above 2 possibilities.</p>
              <p>a) Potong Pasir area. Ok, this is politics. (So you can imagine a bit)</p>
              <p>b) Whampoa area. This is not politics, but seriously, I got a feel that Whampoa / St Michael / Balstier area need MRT as well, as Novena station is way out (Not so for Balstier Road la). If Kallang Line does not serve this area, it will be a waste. However, if they do, most likely it will need to interchange with Boon Keng (Instead of Potong Pasir) and a curve to Boon Keng area / Kallang Bharu area. The advantage is it will be less sharp curve to connect to Lavender MRT station but that means that Kolam Ayer area will not have a MRT line as well. (And Toa Payoh East will get a Kallang Line instead)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok, so now we know the incertainities and AMMP is the major fatal reason for Kallang Line / Extension (If they would to do a loop line in Marina Barrage / Pier, it would be a extension instead and AMMP might not be a necessary)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So now, lets go to DTL Stage 3:</p>
              <p>Ok, people are speculating on political side (Such as private property along the line) but thats not my point.</p>
              <p>But before go to DTL 3, we must analyze the latest PYL in CCL. It has 3 platforms as well. The reason why it has 3 platforms is most likely as I said, an extension to Marine Parade, regardless if it is going to be a CCL's extension or ERL's extension. Some people dont agree due to soil condition in PYL. AFAIK, the PYL was built first before the announcement of JEMP. This is probably why the construction going on with an epic failure / mistake (Along with AMK) if they are going to hit the platform / track into coffin with no future extension. (Anyway, if they are really going to extend that as a branch line, how to do a "PLMP" - Paya Lebar Modification Project? Just a note: Even if they extend it and do a PLMP, the fourth platform will be left on DBG bound, since that side is an empty plot of land -- I guess the LTA designer for PYL got their reasons --- yes, the designer not from private sector)</p>
              <p>According to LTA whitepaper instead, the Bedok Resevoir was not a complete idea and I think it is like a LRT line in Bedok. So it is something out of the whitepaper, well, and thus, we have no refernce if the DT27 (A leaked track schematic diagram says)'s 3rd platform (If there is no change) will be just a simple TNM style with direct connection to depot only. (Which is kind of weird) or it will be extended to Bedok Central and Marine Parade / Siglap? (Since the ERL has lack of connectivity to EWL which is like "AEL" of HK MTR)</p>
              <p>So in fact, I believe apart of political / private property issue (Some property developers do speculated MRT line / station map and push up the price), the reason for the delay of DTL3 is also because they need to decide if they are going to make DT27 a Buangkok / Hougang style OR a post "DT27MP" style (The first undergound station with built-in 4 parallel tracks similar to the proposed EW30? / CTH - RFP / PMD style or first underground "JEMP-ed" station style).</p>

              <p>Do you know that why DTL Stage 3 is delayed like mad and why Kallang Line was never materialized.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to my observation and some "field trips", I think I finally I got the answer. For me to post the answer, I need to analyze the history first</p>
              <p>1: The EWL / NSL was built in the 1980s with Jurong East, Ang Mo Kio and Tanah Merah are the only 3 stations with a middle track  / platform facility.</p>
              <p>2: Jurong East was the first station with full utilize of 3 platforms for CCK branch line / NSL after Woodlands Extension, followed by Tanah Merah (When CGA extension was reverted to branch line). Ang Mo Kio not so except the LTE service.</p>
              <p>3: Well, according to the track diagram, Jurong East's one is the most similar to Ang Mo Kio's one, as it has a track split into 2 after the station (Despite the distance for that in Ang Mo Kio was way longer). Tanah Merah does not have such, with the exception of crossover somewhere near Expo. Thus, for the starting point of the Kallang Line, which is Ang Mo Kio, must use Jurong East as a comparison.</p>
              <p>Ok, so based on the above, one of the reason for the failure of Kallang Line will be "AMMP" / "AKMP"</p>
              <p>1: Seriously, I believe that if they have built the Kallang line way backed in the 2000s, then they might need to do the Ang Mo Kio Modification Project, which will be more troublesome than JEMP, because on the left (Near the AMK hub) is not possible / technically more challenging than JEMP and neither on the right (Distance and a hill / slope issue). Do note that JEMP is possible when the left side of JUR is an empty plot of land.</p>
              <p>2: Ok, now go to analyze the Kallang Line. It would have been an extension from Ang Mo Kio to Bishan Depot (passing through) and probably follow the Kallang River. (If you go to somewhere near SBS Comfort Delgro HQ in Braddell Road, you might catch a glimsp of BSD) So the problem is, should they turn left towards Potong Pasir area and serve Kolam Ayer area / Kallang Bharu &amp; Basin area and make Kallang a interchange (Which is not based on the above LTA whitepaper link) or after Kallang Bharu / Basin area, it turn sharply to Lavender (Which matches the diagram, somehow). Most likely in either case, it will further down to Marina Bay and do a turnaround. (Maybe if they were to built now / future, it will on Marina Barrage / Pier).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, theres a catch for the above 2 possibilities.</p>
              <p>a) Potong Pasir area. Ok, this is politics. (So you can imagine a bit)</p>
              <p>b) Whampoa area. This is not politics, but seriously, I got a feel that Whampoa / St Michael / Balstier area need MRT as well, as Novena station is way out (Not so for Balstier Road la).

However, if they do, most likely it will need to interchange with Boon Keng (Instead of Potong Pasir) and a curve to Boon Keng area / Kallang Bharu area.

(And Toa Payoh East will get a Kallang Line instead)</p>

              <p>Just a side note: It will be interesting to note that the Tuas Extension will be split into 2 legs (Hence the EW30 with 2 island platforms with the middle portion contains 2 tracks, kind of normal + Dover style). I guess when both legs opened in 202X, there is a chance that CGA - Tuas Checkpoint direct and PSR - Tuas South direct</p>
              <p>This is because:</p>
              <p>1: Tuas South will be more industrial area</p>
              <p>2: CGA - Tuas Checkpoint gives direct connection between 2 communication lines / SG's ports and immigration areas.</p>
              <p>3: It does not make sense to have PSR - Tuas South and Tuas West while reserving at most 3 trains in CGA. By "split" into 2 lines will save resource.</p>
              <p>4: Since EW30 will be Dover Style for Tuas South leg, there must be a reason for it. Either that can become Jurong Region Line / "Western Region Line" in future, or not. Well, if the Dover style was designed not meant for future separate line provision, then, it just meant quite unlikely to have a Tuas South 2 - EW30 due to the number stations and the inconvience (Like wait for 5 minutes only to see the Tuas South bound on the other side?). Crossover issue is not mentioned here as well since it is not confirmed.</p>
