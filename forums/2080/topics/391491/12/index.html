              <p>Actually I had think that was a failure, such that they should have just continue to work on the old station and take it as if nothing as happened. By the way, so does that mean that the EWL / NSL has to be dismantled 100 years from now?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW, since Far East had brought over the Ten Mile Junction, they should have re-develop the mall and close down both BP14 and BP6 which merge into a new BP6 that seamlessly connects to DTL. Dont forget that the new distance based fare structure can only enter the MRT network once, which defeats DTL purpose for those living in BP7 ~ BP13 area and works / study in places along with DTL. Change CX-100 to Innovia at least, or Crystal Movers please.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: Now the system also create inconvience / disadvantage (Or it has been so since day 1) for people from West going to Nicoll Highway ~ Dakota. (I agree that affected people are not that much) This is because only allowed to transfer once, then people cannot alight @ City Hall using EWL from West, then walk to Esplanade via City Link Mall but force people to board CCL in Dhoby Ghaut or Paya Lebar, which might be a bit far (Not so for Dakota case) ---- Notice: Why did I say on the DBTF is because transfer @ either DBG or PYL is increasing unnecessary distance travelled and hence = pay more fares.</p>
              <p>I think that Punggol is another failure as well. The LRT station by right is a 3 tracks station (Hence the widness), but most likely it is 2.5 tracks as the middle track will not go beyond the station towards Sengkang.(Quite like a stick on a "U" shape tube)</p>

              <p>Actually I had think that was a failure, such that they should
              have just continue to work on the old station and take it as if
              nothing as happened. By the way, so does that mean that the EWL /
              NSL has to be dismantled 100 years from now?</p>

              <p>BTW, since Far East had brought over the Ten Mile Junction, they
              should have re-develop the mall and close down both BP14 and BP6
              which merge into a new BP6 that seamlessly connects to DTL. Dont
              forget that the new distance based fare structure can only enter
              the MRT network once, which defeats DTL purpose for those living in
              BP7 ~ BP13 area and works / study in places along with DTL. Change
              CX-100 to Innovia at least, or Crystal Movers please.</p>

              <p>Lol on the point 4. I mean, it is almost confirmed dead end as similar to present Paya Lebar CCL, which looks failed to me. However, the track has reached the full length in PYL but not in this case, hence a failed case. Unless they from start want to build a CGA Skytrain style, then I could say nothing.</p>
