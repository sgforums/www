            <div class='col-md body'>There were other railway stations in Singapore before 1932. Heading north, after Tank Rd Station there were Newton, Cluny Rd, Bt Timah, Bt Panjang, Kranji and the terminus at Woodlands. Passnegers will then take a ferry across the Johore Straits before continuing their journey northwards on another train. The track also extends south of Tank Road making its way through People's Park, Borneo Wharf and finally the terminal station at Pasir Panjang.<br><br>The Singapore Railway was built in 1902 and was transferred by sale to the Federated Malay States Railway (FMSR) in 1918. In 1923, it joined the railway line in Johor Bahru when the Causeway was completed.</div>

It was removed in the 1950s or 60s. Before the viaduct over Keppel Rd was built, the yard at Tanjong Pagar was much bigger. There was even a railway network within what is now the container terminal. There used to be a line joining the Tanjong Pagar yard to the port via a level crossing at Keppel Rd. The line was removed to make way for the AYE but the gate used for the level crossing can still be seen today!<br><br>Yes, the Jurong line was constructed to transport goods from the Jurong Industrial Estate and the Jurong Port. Considering the lack of proper highways linking the area then, the construction of a railway line provided a quick mode of transportation. There were never any passenger traffic on the Jurong Line.<br><br>There was another line which branches off into where IKEA stands today. The line crosses Jalan Bukit Merah near SAFRA.</div>

Bt Timah station comrpises of a station master's office and a small signal box. There is also a passing loop so that 2 trains going in opposite directions could pass each other.<br><br>A visit to Bt Timah Station is like stepping back in time.

The first diesel-electric locomotive of KTMB was introduced in 1957. They were made by English Electric and designated as the 20 Class. The locomotives were named after Malaysian flowers and the fleet started with number 20101 Bunga Raya. The 20 Class were withdrawn in the 1980s. One specimen has been preserved and it is on display at the Shah Alam Museum in Selangor. It was the only 20 Class locomotive I ever saw.</div>

KL Sentral is a through station; ie. the line doesn't end there. To the north of KL Sentral is the KL Old Station. Only the KTM Komuter stops here and the place is deserted nowadays.<br><br>The line continues northwards until Putra Station. Here, the line splits. One goes to Rawang which would then lead to Ipoh and all the way to the Thai border at Padang Besar. The other line goes to the Sentul, where the KTMB Locomotive Maintenence Yard is located. Although the KTM Komuter ends here, the track continues right up to Batu Caves but this section is now unused.</div></blockquote>If not wrong, in the past, before the ER/1 cut, trains b/t SG and PEN would run thru KL, be it KLO or KLS. (My collections of KTM timetables proved this.)</div>
