              <p>the direction of the map is correct but somehow the number of stations have changed</p>
              <p>Take for example DTL stage 2:</p>
              <p>note if you compare this one to the present map at LTA webbie, from bukit panjang to botanic gardens theres 8 stations in total, however this map show only 7 in that distance, another part is from newton to little india theres a station in this map but none in the LTA webbie</p>
              <p>another thing is that the  stations  like DBG,Bras basah, esplanade were part of the former bukit timah line which now become part of CCL stage 1</p>
              <p>other things that were accurate is the DTL stage 1and CCL 4 and 5.</p>
              <p>for thomson line and Eastern region line, best to use this map as a rough reference, the line could change, so could the number of stations also as proven.</p>

              <p>Why?</p>
              <p>1: There might be chances that, Singapore - part of JB special economic zone no need passport de. So this may not be an issue (Of Woodlands Train Checkpoint). Regarding rolling stock, track, station, I think is not an issue as well.</p>
              <p>My suggestion is for the station wise, Malaysian authority will do Malaysia JB sector. Singapore LTA will plan the track sector for Singapore side.</p>
              <p>Rolling stock? Either they formed a joint LTA, or having 2 rolling stock with different porpotions, based on the track length, proposed economical benefits etc.</p>
              <p>2: All future MRT lines should be fully underground, I think it might be possible for LRT stations in future to be underground as well. So, for no place to live is not too valid, and I think the future lowest should be around 15 to 25 floors and 30 ~ 40 floors should be the median. Dont forget that our land cannot support &gt; 240 ~ 280m in height for the buildings. So, dont expect to have many 60 (Or above) floor flats becoz it will become "Sinkapore".</p>

              future lowest should be around 15 to 25 floors and 30 ~ 40 floors
              should be the median. Dont forget that our land cannot support &gt;
              240 ~ 280m in height for the buildings. So, dont expect to have
              many 60 (Or above) floor flats becoz it will become
              "Sinkapore".</p>

              <p>Make sense.... But I disagree with ur point on the passport-free. If no need passport then Singapore n Malaysia would be out of control in terms of population count. And rmb this , the government of Singapore is expecting 6million citizens in Singapore. If no passport , ppl can go Malaysia to begin a new life there isn't it? So this is the only point I disagree...... The rest makes sense to me. :)</p>

              <p>Slight OT, but regarding of remerger with Malaysia would = Singapore is no longer a country and it will become part of JB. Well, I doubt the possibility, given the 2 countries' political viewpoint is too much of difference. (Compare the people in Singapore and Malaysia, their mindset has a big difference, regardless of their race)</p>

              <p>Well, while I believe the re-location of KTM, might be possible in 2011 or later, but a remerger could have probably in the dreams of various people / politicans and never able to reach the goals for at least in the entire generation or 2.</p>

              <p>another thing is that the  stations  like DBG,Bras
