              <p> </p>
              <p>So what about LRTs?</p>
              <p>Sengkang -- 10.7km</p>
              <p>Punggol (Phase 1, excluding Punggol North Line) -- 10.3km</p>
              <p>Expected length for Punggol LRT (Including Punggol North Line which has not built as of 2010 and that belongs to Phase 2 of Punggol LRT) -- 11.8km (<a title="http://www.mitsubishitoday.com/peoplemover/ht/d/sp/i/2669/pid/2669" href="http://www.mitsubishitoday.com/peoplemover/ht/d/sp/i/2669/pid/2669">Source</a>)</p>
              <p>Bukit Panjang -- 7.8km</p>
              <p>Total -- 28.8km (Excluding Punggol North), 30.3km (Including Punggol North LRT)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So Grand total of MRT / LRT tracks by 2020: 279.7km, 281.2km (If Punggol North LRT was built by 2020)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Remember, LTA did mentioned that by <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2030</strong></span></em>, the Singapore Rapid Transit's length will have a coverage of <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>540km</strong></span></em>.</p>
              <p>So 540km - 281.2km = 258.8km, which is about almost the other half of the network is still unbuilt. So I believe, it is more or less true, despite speculation.</p>

              <p>"Johore Line" will never happen. Provisions in JB Sentral only allow (for a metro) the Maglev system to ply 2 routes in JB only.</p>
              <p>West Coast LRT? Iirc LRT in Singapore is only meant to serve as a feeder within neighbourhoods. And it's pretty absurd to have one running from Pasir Panjang all the way up to near King Albert Park. BRT can do the job better. Same goes for Jurong Region LRT.</p>
              <p>Holland Line will be difficult west of Bukit Batok. It has to run under military restricted areas. Do note that Merlimau, Seraya and Sakra are locations in Jurong Island.</p>
              <p>Punggol North Line will only consist of 4 stations after Teck Lee.</p>
              <p>And where in the world can you have East Point station? If the train moves forward after Terminal 4, it will become a submarine to Batam and Bintan.</p>

              <p>"Johore Line" will never happen. Provisions in JB Sentral only

              <p>West Coast LRT? Iirc LRT in Singapore is only meant to serve as
              a feeder within neighbourhoods. And it's pretty absurd to have one
              running from Pasir Panjang all the way up to near King Albert Park.
              BRT can do the job better. Same goes for Jurong Region LRT.</p>
              <p>Holland Line will be difficult west of Bukit Batok. It has to
              run under military restricted areas. Do note that Merlimau, Seraya
              and Sakra are locations in Jurong Island.</p>
              <p>Punggol North Line will only consist of 4 stations after Teck
              Lee.</p>
              <p>And where in the world can you have East Point station? If the
              train moves forward after Terminal 4, it will become a submarine to
              Batam and Bintan.</p>

              <p>Ok, well points said. So, afterall, certain parts have proven wrong speculations instead (Such as PN 5 and Johore MRT, well --- there are even people who believe that one day IF Malaysian authority allows, the Thomson Line will extend to JB -- based on the positioning of the line.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jurong Region LRT is the coming LRT line, which I expect to be launched at about similar timeframe as PN LRT, but that is not a fiction line.</p>
              <p>And some others while looked absurd, one must be sure that North Coast / Shore Line plying between Woodlands (Sembawang) - Yishun - Seletar - Punggol  - Changi (Airport) can never hit 30km landmark.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By integrating CC1 - CC4 into Holland Line (HDL), another line that was mentioned in Concept 2001, then the numbering should changed as well, and Promendae should be CC1 in this case, which is unlikely. (And I do not believe HDL can hit 35 ~ 40km milestone, which is something comparable to Downtown Line / North South Line)</p>
              <p>Furthermore, another line mentioned in Concept 2001 is Seletar Line (Look @ Seletar Airport, the govt. is promoting civil aviviation and Seletar Airport is not only about military base) and some mention of the developments until 2018 or sort of. I think, that Seletar Line is a NEL reliever (As mentioned by netizens as well), so I estimate the line length ranges from 20km to 25km.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So 281.2km + 25km (Seletar Line) + 40km (Holland Line, based on the map, it seemed to be overstated) + 30km (North Shore / Coast Line) = <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>376.2km</strong></span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are some major errors and outdated information of this map, sure, but I think by 2030, the complexity should be there because there is still a lack of 163.8km, which can be given as 4 ~ 5 more LRT lines (Each about 10km ~ 15km) and the remaining 80 ~ 90km can in turn into 3 ~ 4 medium length lines.</p>

              <p>it's probably gonna be an engineering feat if we are able to reproduce that map decades later</p>
              <p>recently heard some anti-mrt complaints especially cuz of no more new long-distance bus routes (since mrt is slowly overtaking the bus network) and the depth of the newer stations (which is rumoured that any deeper will 'crack' the island apart)</p>
              <p>are there provisions made at dhoby ghaut CCL side to extend the line further? it'll be quite a difficult engineering task if they dont make provisions...hope to see them at harbourfront next year too as proof that stage 6 might be realised</p>

              <p>Wait, they also scrapped Punggol North LRT line as well. Look, the LTA only said that they will not build any more LRT lines until some major developments on the urban areas or so. (Whatever they said, it means there is a condition to be met, before more LRT lines will be introduced.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, I think they are actually not scrapped Punggol North &amp; JR LRT, but halted them for unknown time. (Dont PM me or LTA for the timeframe, because they wont know when will the areas there will be developed, considering JR LRT is also meant to serve the NTU students, the Jurong West until now, still quite ulu place.)</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>1: This is outdated and contains some errors, which NickLim has pointed out.</p>
              <p>2: The Tuas Extension, further up from Joo Koon is wrong. It should be the EW30 has an extension line, instead of EW31. The amount of stations is correct.</p>
              <p>3: Whether will the "South Pier" station exists in future or not, I am not sure. But I am sure, that the LTA did planned but halted or scrapped the idea of extend the NSL to Marina South and further up to Marina Barrage, which requires a left U-Turn. (So now only Marina South extension by 2014, and add 1 station -- Marina South)</p>

              <p>Johore Line as shown in the map is the proposed RapidJB Maglev LRT's Tebrau Line which is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fully elevated maglev system capable of a maximum speed of 80km/h</span>, minus the JB Sentral - Causeway link.</p>
              <p>You did not read the underlined sentence wrongly.</p>
              <p>Anyway, an MRT will be impossible to connect to JB Sentral, the integrated transport and immigration hub since it will have to be underground. Then there's the issue of customs. Are you going to have it like the current Woodlands Train Checkpoint?</p>
