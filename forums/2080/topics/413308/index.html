              <p>This is interesting.</p>
              <p>Station A Arrival: 12:00:00 (A), 12:07:00(B)<br>Station A Departure: 12:00:30 (A)(Scheduled Departure: 12:00:30), 12:07:30 (B)(Scheduled Departure: 12:08:00)<br><br>Station B Arrival: 12:02:00(A)(Scheduled Arrival: 12:02:00), 12:09:30(B)(Scheduled Arrival: 12:10:00)</p>
              <p>So in what way the train behind got delayed?</p>
              <p>On a side note, if a train has to stop for for an extended period of time consecutively in station due to scheduling, it's safe to conclude that the timetable is of a "bad design".</p>
              <p>Did you guys notice that the trains will coast occasionally during Auto Mode but are pushing it's maximum limit consistently during CM Mode? The coasting in auto mode is meant to displace the time lost when operating in CM Mode since TO needs "slightly more time to stop the train accurately".</p>
              <p>From this, we can in a way, conclude that our train system has a relatively "slack" timetable during off peak hour, occasionally even during peak hour. This is so-called to ensure that trains are on-time within +/- 3mins, adhering to this limit even during CM Mode. One can thus conclude that when everything is working fine, train are usually on time even during morning peak hour.</p>
              <p>In contrast back in Japan, train schedules are considerbly tight, in contrast to our 24tph on average, one of the most robust system running back in Japan is operating at 35tph. With tight schedules and passengers wanting to board the train, trains often depart 1~3mins late than scheduled in stations where passengers traffic are relatively high.</p>
              <p>But due to the operation nature of the train operators there, train are usually either on time or up to 1min late upon reaching terminus station, which happens to be a "CBD area" most of the time despite operating in a tight schedule. And not to worry, passengers comfort is at it's best, even better than what our system provides.</p>
              <p>As an added information, if the train is late by 5mins or more in Japan, one can obtain a valid certificate from the railway company to prove that one is late because the trains are late.</p>
