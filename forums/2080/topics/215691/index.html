            <div class='col-md body'>Trainset 051/052 was taken out of service on 17th October, at 1730hrs, Dover Station. Direction towards Clementi/Boon Lay. Operator tried to close doors at least 10 times. But doors refused to close, and after contacting they just bounced open again.<br>No station staff to assist, some damn attitude shown.<br>After many tries and scanning over all the systems, the operator decided the train is not fit to continue on, and requested over the PA system for all passengers to alight. Many did so grunting.<br>Operator then tried closing door, ok, then drove the train out towards Ulu Pandan Depot admist loud feedbacks from 'abandoned' commuters. Many were students of my school and their grunts were louder than 'aunties' and 'uncles' who were mentally and physically tired after work. Some attitude also... Motors were emitting the sound of first gear all the way out (P1).<br>Next train, 039/040 arrived into the station proximity (it was on hold about 150 metres away from Dover Station), sounding the horn several times. As it entered the station, several more horns were heard and the operator was signalling to the commuters to stand back. After that, with liabilities cleared, the train accelerated through half of the station and braked hard before the end of the platform. Fully loaded, the train departed the station at reduced speed.<br>Trainset 095/096 was next, sounding the horn a few times before entering the station. Some commuters were still left standing on the platform after it left.<br>Question: What happened, or what might have happened?<br>Parameters: The train was in full service condition, brakes/motors sound in their correct tones. Air reservoir recharged normally. Aircon systems were fine as well. Only the doors seem unwell.</div>
