              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Circle Line's capacity will be ramped up by 60 per cent, with 24 more trains to be added progressively from 2015.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This was announced 
              by Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew who was speaking at the 
              groundbreaking ceremony for the Tuas West extension on Friday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Construction to make it easier to commute to the Tuas area has begun.<br><br>Four stations will be added to the East-West Line, starting from Joo Koon Station.<br><br>They are: Gul Circle, Tuas Crescent, Tuas West Road and Tuas Link.<br><br>There will also be a 26-hectare depot.<br><br>The
               Tuas West extension is expected to benefit more than 100,000 commuters 
              daily. The four stations will be located close to offices and factories 
              to help reduce travelling time by up to 35 minutes for many commuters.<br><br>Even as the rail network is being expanded, capacity will also be improved in the coming years.<br><br>Twenty-four trains will be added into the Circle Line's progressively from 2015, instead of the 16 previously announced.<br><br>This will increase the Circle Line's capacity by 60 per cent.<br><br>During
               the ceremony, Mr Lui also said the government and train operators will 
              spare no effort in making the rail system more reliable.<br><br>The transport minister noted the concerns over serious trains disruptions in recent months.<br><br>He said SMRT will put in place a more robust system to anticipate potential faults and vulnerabilities in the system.<br><br>On
               the recently-announced S$900 million plan to upgrade and renew ageing 
              assets, Mr Lui said two main components will contribute to the costs.<br><br>One is replacing the sleepers of the track, while the other is upgrading of the signalling system.<br><br>He
               said the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and SMRT are in the process of 
              making sure that each party will pay a "fair share of the costs".<br><br>Mr
               Lui said: Broadly speaking, I think the formulation is that 
              infrastructural works should come under the government and the 
              replacement of operating assets comes under the operator. There is a 
              formula on how to share the costs so what is happening now between LTA 
              and SMRT is that they are going to through the details and making sure 
              that each party is paying its fair share of the costs."<br><br>On 
              whether the costs will eventually be passed on to commuters as higher 
              fares, Mr Lui said fares are determined by the fare adjustment formula, 
              which is being reviewed.<br><br>Mr Lui said fares will not be adjusted this year while the review is underway.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>
