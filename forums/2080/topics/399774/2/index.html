              <p>i think at a certain speed the train jam break it is possible for the train to brake in time. if its high speed and the train operator jam break its poossible the system may be spoilt and also endanagerred the paasemgers it carries. after all its a very long vehicle. Infact i believe every carriage has its own braking mechanism, activated from signals at the control on train heads at either end. similar to trailer trucks with their own brakingg fluid system at the rear wheels of the trailer activated via controls and signals from the truck itself.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>the train has to decelerate or be travelling at a certain lower speed for a safer jam brake to be effective.</p>

              <p>Normally the entry speed to Redhill is slower, hence this plus a sharp eye may have been the reason that an accident has been avoided. I would take the speed that the operator had spotted the person/platform emergency switch pressed at 50 km/h.</p>
              <p>At -4.68 km/h/s deceleration (EMG) it would take about 11 seconds to decelerate from 50 km/h, taking into account a 1/2 to 1 second delay in emergency brake relay. Distance can be found using a formula, but its about 80 meters.</p>
              <p>At -2.88 km/h/s (B3/ATC) it will take about 20 plus seconds.</p>

              <p>Yes, only for those who are tall enough and strong enough. It should be able to deter most if not all female suiciders (MRT got such cases before such as the Bukit Batok incident, no need HK MTR). Well, at least the intention is like prevent people from emulating the Admiralty style, jump at the TW of the station like a sitting duck (I guess he was later knocked off by train, and lying backward of the train, which is as good as the Yishun leaked video style) except the head or the body instead of stomach was cut into 2 pieces (Maybe never split into 2 in physically la).</p>

              <p>By the way, it means that it gives some time for suiciders to climb up the barriers and then by then even if no passengers saw it due to at late night / early morning, it should be enough for the station staff to be alert of it.

              <p>However, there were critrics on the special lighting because, it reinforces the suicide issue, such as what if a child ask their parents: "Hey, why are there blue lights there?" Their parents reply "So that I (people) wont commit suicide"..... WTH is this?</p>

              <p>Because people say by jumping off a building, you are scared to death and not hurt / injured by height to death and using a knife to cut oneselves is something very painful, where modern people do not act like a samurai.</p>
              <p>So now you left jumping into rivers / seas, hanging or overdose pills apart of suicide in tracks.</p>
              <p>By jumping into rivers, you will drowned to death and in the meanwhile the feel is terrible (Apart of eaten by fishes / sharks etc) because this is Singapore and not in the US with a super tall bridge with a river below it. (Based on Wikipedia, that was almost instant sure way of dying because of the height, the force hit is akin to hitting one with a brick, despite it is a water)</p>
              <p>By hanging, it was said by people that one's nose and tongue would be stuck out, like ... a ghost.</p>
              <p>By overdosing, some people claimed that it might not die, and ended up just puking all around while in the hospital. This sounds gay.</p>
              <p>So virtually, you left the tracks to suicide on. It was said that the 1997 Kembangan incident, which can be found in the Wikipedia, that the guy was dead almost instantly, and people will have the idea of fast and "painless" way of dying. But those survivals know it is not. (And probably the guy of Eunos incident in 2007 too, who has dead only after 15mins on the hospital.) The only "sure way" of instant die is the Yishun leaked video style, but the price is at least double the pain where probably, the intestine / stomach came out and the whole body puke with blood or so since the body was squashed by a train.</p>
