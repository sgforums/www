              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) will install noise
               barriers at three stretches of elevated train tracks along the 
              East-West MRT line as part of its trials to assess the effectiveness of 
              noise barriers.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Noise barriers will 
              be installed at Tampines Street 21 (next to Block 296), Jurong East 
              Street 13 (next to Block 110) and Toh Guan Road (next to Blk 266).</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>LTA said the noise 
              barriers at Tampines and Jurong East are similar to those installed at 
              the new viaduct at the Jurong East station as part of the Jurong East 
              Modification Project last year. <br><br>It added that these two 
              locations were selected for the tests as the eastern and western 
              stretches of the tracks come with two different designs.<br><br>The 
              trials will allow LTA to test the installation methodology of noise 
              barriers at different segments of viaducts, and assess the most 
              efficient way to customise them for other locations.<br><br>Work is expected to begin in the third quarter of this year and will take about a year to complete. <br><br>LTA said the noise barriers are expected to reduce noise levels from passing trains by at least 5 decibels.<br><br>Currently, the noise levels at Tampines St 21 and Jurong East St 13 are between 78 and 82 decibels.<br><br>A normal conversation typically measures about 60 decibels.<br><br>For the Toh Guan Road stretch, LTA said it would install a 150-metre long, 4.5-metre high noise barrier as part of the trial.<br><br>The
               stretch is a turnout location, which is an area where two pieces of 
              track merge for trains to be diverted from one track to another.<br><br>Noise levels are higher when trains cross turnout locations. <br><br>LTA
               said given the unique viaduct design at this turnout location, it would
               assess the effectiveness of these noise barriers in mitigating the 
              noise impact. <br><br>The installation will begin in the third quarter and will take about one and a half years to complete.<br><br>LTA said the noise barrier at the turnout location is expected to reduce noise levels by up to 10 decibels.<br><br>The noise level at the Toh Guan Road viaduct is currently between 80 and 85 decibels.<br><br>The
               installation is expected to cause minimum disturbance to existing track
               facilities and equipment as work will be carried out during the narrow 
              window when train services are not operating.  <br><br>Meanwhile, LTA said the noise barriers at Bishan will be installed by the end of June.<br><br>The
               trials, together with the results of the island-wide noise measurement 
              study, will help LTA develop an implementation plan to reduce railway 
              noise at specific locations across the island.  <br><br>LTA said it would share its preliminary implementation plan around the third quarter this year. <br><br>- CNA/al</span></span></p>
