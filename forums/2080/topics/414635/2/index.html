SMRT has been hunting train/Bus fans with any source of people with a video camera.They have checked YouTube Accounts of train-fans and are slowly tracking down us....We have been warned not to take photos of trains but can spot them..And some are in danger.."</p>

              <p>Your facts are very wrong and misleading.</p>
              <p>1) You are only fined for not switching on silent mode/switching off your phone when you are in the priority area. In other areas of the train car, you are allow to use them like in Singapore. However, Japanese are more conservative and they speak much softer on the phone.</p>
              <p>2) Separate cars for men and women are only initiated during certain times, specifically rush hours.</p>
              <p>3) You won't get kicked out of the train by not giving up their seats. You will just be shamed. However, Japanese and Koreans are much more courteous and gracious. Thus, this has become their norm.</p>
              <p>4) If there was a ban on photography/videography. Would you explain this video? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDZH47ruv4M">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDZH47ruv4M</a></p>

              <p>Yup, I think their intention is just to make sure we aren't taking videos/photos for another party to make use of and to plot against the transport system. So long as we have no connection or any interaction with terrorists, there is no reason we get arrested.</p>
