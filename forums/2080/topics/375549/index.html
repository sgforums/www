              <p><br>Cheapest is to walk, though god knows when you get there... Generally, it saves the environment mainly due to the energy consumed per person per km travelled. Of course a bus consumes more energy than a car (with it being a heavier vehicle), but consider the number of cars not used when the car users switch to bus.</p>
              <p>I doubt anyone really cares much for the environment (except for the young green yuppies) since most people I know would very much prefer a car. Think of the convenience to go anywhere and NOT having to worry about the LAST bus/train! But in some instances when parking and traffic jams are major headaches, having a public transport is more convenient. No need to worry about where to park your car or worry about accidents/scratches while being caught in the jam.</p>
              <p>As for from JKN to CGA, MRTs win hands-down. Generally, my personal rule is any travel involving 4 stations' distance or more will be faster on an MRT. (Different people have their own rule of course)</p>

              <p>For now, public transport is a cheaper form of travel.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, you can choose to crawl, walk or run to your destination.</p>
              <p>It is a way to save our environment only if ppl decides to give up their cars and switch to PT. Otherwise, we wouldn't see any significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
              <p>I will take a train. Saves more time.</p>

              <p><br> Cheapest is to walk, though god knows when you get there...
              Generally, it saves the environment mainly due to the energy
              consumed per person per km travelled. Of course a bus consumes more
              energy than a car (with it being a heavier vehicle), but consider
              the number of cars not used when the car users switch to bus.</p>
              <p>I doubt anyone really cares much for the environment (except for
              the young green yuppies) since most people I know would very much
              prefer a car. Think of the convenience to go anywhere and NOT
              having to worry about the LAST bus/train! But in some instances
              when parking and traffic jams are major headaches, having a public
              transport is more convenient. No need to worry about where to park
              your car or worry about accidents/scratches while being caught in
              the jam.</p>
              <p>As for from JKN to CGA, MRTs win hands-down. Generally, my
              personal rule is any travel involving 4 stations' distance or
              more will be faster on an MRT. (Different people have their own
              rule of course)</p>

              <p>hah? cheapest? i'll say the most expensive.</p>
              <p>imagine how much water you need to buy to hydrate yourself through the walking. 1x 1.5litres of water from 7-eleven cost about 1-2 dollars. And even if one gets the water from home, minimumly the bottle still needs to be bought right? And if really want to save money and get a bottle from a dustbin (yuck), how about thinking about the food that you'll eat when you rest...(and yeah it only applies to long distance walking)</p>
              <p>And let's say if you don't do all these, i bet one can't reach Changi Airport from Joo Koon safe and sound. You'll end up in an ambulance and hospital bills will start bombing you.</p>
              <p>In terms of environment friendly, I think that there's no 100% friendly to it. There's bound to be some form of small damage to the environment.</p>
