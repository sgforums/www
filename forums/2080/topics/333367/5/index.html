              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mrtfan:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><br> I agree with gohby. I am from Raffles Institution, and I find it
              very abhorrant that people think RI guys are nerdy, muggers, etc.
              etc. If you are not from this school, you have no right to
              criticise it.</p>
              <p>Mr. Tan Kah Kee was a great philantrophist and donated great
              sums of money to found schools. Naming a station after him is no
              big deal and I don't understand the fuss. After all, Eunos is named
              after Enche Muhammad Eunos Abdullah, a great Malay philantrophist,
              who founded Kampong Melayu, later named after him. Aljunied is
              named after Syed Omar bin Ali Al Junied, a Yemeni <span style="color: #000000;">philanthropist. H</span>is charitable acts
              included donating a large plot of land in <span style="color: #000000;">Victoria Street</span> for the purposes of a
              Muslim <a title="Burial ground" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Burial_ground"><span style="color: #000000;">burial
              ground</span></a> and the construction of a <span style="color: #000000;">mosque</span> in Bencoolen Street. The land where
              St Andrews Church stands was also donated by him. He contributed
              largely to the setting up of the Tan Tock Seng Hospital.</p>
              <p>Therefore, Kah Kee Station will not be the first to be named
              after a philantrophist. Even though Enche Eunos and Syed Omar bin
              Ali Al Junied have roads named after them, it does not mean that an
              MRT station can't be named after Mr. Tan Kah Kee. Is it that
              difficult to accept that?</p>
              <p>In other countries, metro stations are also named after great
              revolutionaries. In Paris, metro stations are named after square or
              a street, which, in turn, is probably named for something (or
              someone) else. There are metro stations named Franklin D.
              Roosevelt, George V, Charles de Gaulle, Pasteur, Bolivar,
              Michelangelo, Garibaldi and Stalingrad, just to name a
              few. Even though there is an av. Franklin D. Roosevelt, there
              are no exits from Franklin D.
              Roosevelt station to av. Franklin D. Roosevelt.
              George V station too. So, what's the fuss?</p>
              <p>NickL_C151's suggestion is sound. Probably the whole station
              could be dedicated to Mr. Tan Kah Kee, with miniature statues,
              paintings, and the station can be done up like a small museum in
              his honour, depicting his life and contributions to Singapore's
              educational system. It could even become a tourist attraction! To
              reduce confusion among the public or in the case that HCI
              moves out, we can have double names for the station (Kah
              Kee-Duchess or Kah Kee-Watten). Again, this example is taken from
              Paris, which has double-named stations like Richelieu-Drouot,
              Reuilly-Chaligny and Saint Sebastien-Froissart. Doesn't this
              satisfy everybody?</p>
              <p>Could someone suggest this to LTA.</p>

              <p>I agree that it is a great idea. There is no need for any of us to suggest this to LTA. Just ask those HCI students to do what they good at..<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>the person who post this tread making use of this opportunity to display your hatred for HCI? u didn't tell the full story, retard. hwa chong is naming it kah kee station because its being built on HWA CHONG'S LAND. use your brain. if it were not their land do you think they would name it after our founder who PURCHASED THE LAND? why don't you buy your own house, and then offer it to the public to stay for free, and then say its your neighbour's house? and why are you going mad over a station-naming exercise? </p>
              <p>if you have some unfounded hatred for the sch, just say it. don't take a stupid opportunity, find fault with it and blast it like no one's business.apparently you're just jealous you need another 200 more psle points to just scrape past the entrance score.</p>
