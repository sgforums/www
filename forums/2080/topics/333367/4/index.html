              <p>Allow me to counter this with a few statements:</p>
              <p>If Duchess station's final name ends up being Kah Kee, this name
              will be relevant to it's surroundings. But, what happens if the
              school moves out? Highly unlikely, you say, but metro lines are
              there for the long-term (there's rapid transit systems in the world
              that are over a hundred years old), and no one can be able to
              forsee what might happen in the future. Raffles Insitution's
              current address, I believe, was not it's address a mere 20 to 30
              years ago; a few of our MRT stations are that old, if not older.
              What if Hwa Chong Insitution moves out in, say, 30 years' time?
              Could the name Kah Kee, a much-unheard name, still have immediate
              relevancy to the surrounding neighbourhood? For future generations
              living there?</p>
              <p>Also, the name Kah Kee might invite unwanted jokes. I won't go
              into this, but if you speak Hokkien, you will understand the nature
              of these jokes. If he's such a great person, his name should be
              protected from such jokes to protect his dignity.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Your first point is half-valid. But I must first emphasise that its a <strong>hypothetical, unlikely scenario</strong> (which you've also acknowledged). Take for instance Expo and Changi Airport, 2 MRT stations that are evidently named as such because of the prominent landmarks nearby. Going by your logic that in the long run, nothing is guaranteed (true), can you affirm that the Expo Halls will still be located at the same place 30 years from now? Can you affirm that Changi Airport will still be situated as such in the distant future? You can't. What is more important, is the fact that Tan Kah Kee bought that massive piece of land for educational purpose in the past, which epitomised his altruism. As for Kah Kee being a much unheard name, I strongly beg to differ. For <strong>a portion of</strong> the yonger generation that are English educated and generally ignorant about our Singapore history, perhaps yes. In fact, go and ask the older generation and you will understand what I mean. And I dont understand the truncated part about RI.</p>
              <p>As for your second point of being able to tweak Kah Kee into a myriad of fanciful names, that is totally immaterial to the naming of the station and shouldnt even be pondered about in the first place. Look at the existing station names. I guess I can tweak Khatib into ________ as well? And I shant elaborate on this because we jolly well know that we can tweak many of the current stations into fanciful names. Why should we even consider name tweaking, by immatured people, as part of our MRT naming exercise?</p>
              <p>On a side note, what I find most laughable in this thread, is how some people (who posted in this thread), allow their immaturity and childish jealousy, with respect to a certain school, to blind something important such as MRT naming exercise. Worse still, <strong>attempting to psycho</strong> <strong>people and propagate</strong> their warped mentality, in the most blatant manner. Saddening, yet most hilarious. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>I actually though about Expo and Changi Airport after I posted my own post; the nature of Changi Airport and Expo is quite different from Hwa Chong Insitution, a school, famous and branded as it may be though.</p>
              <p>Expo is part of the government's plan to attract more long-term conventions and exhibitions into Singapore; the Singapore Expo complex (both building and station) is an integral part of that plan. Being a long-term plan, I highly doubt the government had been shortsighted as to build an exhibition hall there and then move it out in the next 20 or 30 years (or even as long as the next 50 to 70 years). That, plus with the combination of Changi Airport (which I will be coming on shortly), the business park, and the industrial areas nearby, it's not likely the government slapped Singapore Expo down there for the short-to-mid term; unless there's some upheaval in Singapore, or the URA decides to redevelop the entire area <em>en masse</em> (the latter being almost impossible given the nature of the industrial area, and the fact that Seletar is being developed because space is running out there).</p>
              <p>Changi Airport is a unique case. An airport, like a metro network, is for the long term; plus, Changi Airport station is dedicated to serving Changi Airport, and nowhere else. Even in the unlikely scenario that Changi Airport does moves out, the station will almost surely move with the airport, with the original being closed down unless they find another use for the land or buildings where Changi Airport could used to stand to justify an MRT station, which could result in that station being renamed - again, an almost impossible scenario. It's unique in Singapore's MRT system, being completely dependent on one single building complex for it's load; every other MRT station in Singapore serve a combination of buildings and building complexes, hence why they need names reflecting the area rather than a single building or building complex in the area.</p>
              <p>Hwa Chong Insitution, on the other hand, and as famous and branded it may be, is a school, and history has proven to us that schools, even the most famous ones, get moved around. While the Singapore Expo and Changi Airport have very long-term and dedicated plans backing their current locations, no such plans exist to back Hwa Chong Insitution's current location for the long-term. We must also be realistic about the scale of things here: both Singapore Expo and Changi Airport cater to a very broad public, while Hwa Chong Insitution's catering is narrowed down to the students studying there, as well as the people working or teaching there. Expo and Changi Airport's names are relevant not only to the area, but to a large number of people going to the area; the name Kah Kee, on the other hand, will only be immediately relevant to the students and staff of Hwa Chong Insitution. Also, Duchess station is not a station dedicated to students of Hwa Chong Insitution, but also to people living in the Duchess and Watten neighbourhoods.</p>
              <p>As for the part about Tan Kah Kee being needed to be honoured, that I have to agree. But - if he was really such a great person, why wasn't he honoured earlier in such a manner? Why weren't there roads, buildings, or such being named after him before this? Why wait until now, in this question of naming an MRT station (which should take it's name after something already established, rather than being the "pioneer" for new names in the area)?</p>
              <p>On your argument about ignorant Singaporeans not knowing about the great people in Singapore's history, I can't argue with that. Many of the younger Singaporeans are indeed ignorant on this point.</p>
              <p>On the point of names being used as jokes, it's not every name that can be tweaked as such - some names are more prone to such jokes than others, especially if they can be seen as very obvious puns or are obvious alternative names for something else. Your cited example, Khatib, has no puns that can be immediately obvious to most Singaporeans - possibly, when pronounced, it sounds like "car tip" or "car tick", but that mostly happens after people say the name over and over again, and sounds forced; "Kah" in Kah Kee, on the other hand, has it's pun in full plain view of anyone who speaks Hokkien; "Kah" sounds like "leg" in Hokkien, and this is a pun that is obvious to many Hokkien-speaking people; the leg is a body part that sometimes have dirty, negative connotations, and this connotations can result in extremely disrespectful jokes on the name, something I believe will cause Tan Kah Kee to turn over in his grave if he knows about it!</p>
              <p>On a final note, I do hope you do not take me as trying to flame you, but while I do agree that there's a lot of immaturity and childishness in this thread, your arrogant attitude and you going around calling names will not help to turn them to your opinion nor help bring mature discussion into this matter; in any case it will only isolate people with your opinions even further, and will only bring about more immaturity. You called others childish, but if you looked at your arrogant attitude in your own mirror, you will find that you yourself is not any better than the people you are spitting on.</p>
              <p>With all I have said, I think I will cease participating in this discussion. My arguments, I feel, are enough fodder against your arguments and for anyone who supports my opinion. I do respect differeing opinions; what I have no respect for are immature attitudes. If you insist on using such attitudes to counter me, then this whole debate is effectively derailing from it's subject matter.</p>
              <p>Plus, I have more important things I need to attend to in my life.</p>

              <p><br>Apprently you misunderstood some of my points. I agree with you that Expo and Changi Airport are not going to be displaced from their current any time in the near future. I would think Hwa Chong is not going to displaced from its current location any time in the near future as well, although you might argue that the time span is probably shorter. Yes. :) As posted in my previous posts, irregardless whether HC will move out or not, in the not-so-near future, the fact remains that Tan Kah Kee bought that big piece of land in 1910s for educational purpose, as an attempt to provide education for the Chinese. I thought that is something that is really commendable. I mean, its difficult to find people who are willing to fork out their own money, to build a school, to increase the availability education for others. On that account, even if Hwa Chong is displaced in the future, that doesn't render this name obselete, and unapplicable to describe that area. I get what you mean, but I hope you get what I mean too.</p>
              <p>I was actually hoping you get what I mean what I mentioned Khatib. To put it explicitly, I can tweak Khatib to Kar Ceng as well, without a putting in a deliberate effort to think of a fanciful name. Yes, I agree, some names are more prone to jokes, and in my opinion, I would agree Kah Kee is one of them. However, putting "Kah Kee" as an MRT station does not make the name "Kah Kee" more prone to jokes. People can still make fun of the name even if there is no Kah Kee station. If you are geniunely concerned about Mr Tan Kah Kee being unhappy about people making fun of his name, I would think he would be even sadder by the fact that so many people do not know about him, and people trying to deny him of some recognition.</p>
              <p>In all honesty, I didnt think you were attacking me, until I saw your last few paragraphs. I was disturbed with your indirect references in your last few paragraphs, censuring me for my "arrogance", "name calling", thus having an "immature attitude". I thought it would be better if you had given me the benefit of doubt that I had zero intention to do name calling. Had I really wanted to call names, I would have used condescending, derogatory words like "kiddy brats", "nitwit", "no brain", etc. I was merely saying that some of the replies in this thread as infantile and childish (which you also agreed). Furthermore, I wasnt targetting anyone specifically. I dont think my words constitutes name calling, IMO. As to the issue of arrogance, I would be <strong>most willing to apologise</strong> if you had found my tone arrogant, for that was not what it is intended to be. I do acknowledge your valid points, and I welcome alternative views as well too. Perhaps I shouldnt have used potentially caustically blunt words, because that may cause people to misunderstand me. And at <strong>no point in my posts did I make any attack, directly or indirectly on you, as a person, only your viewpoints.</strong> Everyone has flaws in their character. However, your initiation of you deriding me, as a person with adjectives such as "immatured attitudes", "arrogant", to name a few, reveals about your aggressive nature...... Oops. Shouldnt had said that.</p>
              <p>If you would like to comment about my inherent character, I think PM-ing would be more apt, afterall, this thread isnt a literary critique about the author's ideas, tones, etc, its about trains.</p>
              <p>I am not someone who has time to waste as well. Neither am I trying to sell my ideas. I just want to speak up what I think.</p>
              <p>P.S: Perhaps you ought to learn how to spell <strong>institution</strong> properly, for it would be most embarrassing if you misspell such a basic word during your O levels! :D</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I actually though about Expo and Changi Airport after I posted my own post; the nature of Changi Airport and Expo is quite different from Hwa Chong Insitution, a school, famous and branded as it may be though.</p>
              <p>Expo is part of the government's plan to attract more long-term conventions and exhibitions into Singapore; the Singapore Expo complex (both building and station) is an integral part of that plan. Being a long-term plan, I highly doubt the government had been shortsighted as to build an exhibition hall there and then move it out in the next 20 or 30 years (or even as long as the next 50 to 70 years). That, plus with the combination of Changi Airport (which I will be coming on shortly), the business park, and the industrial areas nearby, it's not likely the government slapped Singapore Expo down there for the short-to-mid term; unless there's some upheaval in Singapore, or the URA decides to redevelop the entire area <em>en masse</em> (the latter being almost impossible given the nature of the industrial area, and the fact that Seletar is being developed because space is running out there).</p>
              <p>Changi Airport is a unique case. An airport, like a metro network, is for the long term; plus, Changi Airport station is dedicated to serving Changi Airport, and nowhere else. Even in the unlikely scenario that Changi Airport does moves out, the station will almost surely move with the airport, with the original being closed down unless they find another use for the land or buildings where Changi Airport could used to stand to justify an MRT station, which could result in that station being renamed - again, an almost impossible scenario. It's unique in Singapore's MRT system, being completely dependent on one single building complex for it's load; every other MRT station in Singapore serve a combination of buildings and building complexes, hence why they need names reflecting the area rather than a single building or building complex in the area.</p>
              <p>Hwa Chong Insitution, on the other hand, and as famous and branded it may be, is a school, and history has proven to us that schools, even the most famous ones, get moved around. While the Singapore Expo and Changi Airport have very long-term and dedicated plans backing their current locations, no such plans exist to back Hwa Chong Insitution's current location for the long-term. We must also be realistic about the scale of things here: both Singapore Expo and Changi Airport cater to a very broad public, while Hwa Chong Insitution's catering is narrowed down to the students studying there, as well as the people working or teaching there. Expo and Changi Airport's names are relevant not only to the area, but to a large number of people going to the area; the name Kah Kee, on the other hand, will only be immediately relevant to the students and staff of Hwa Chong Insitution. Also, Duchess station is not a station dedicated to students of Hwa Chong Insitution, but also to people living in the Duchess and Watten neighbourhoods.</p>
              <p>As for the part about Tan Kah Kee being needed to be honoured, that I have to agree. But - if he was really such a great person, why wasn't he honoured earlier in such a manner? Why weren't there roads, buildings, or such being named after him before this? Why wait until now, in this question of naming an MRT station (which should take it's name after something already established, rather than being the "pioneer" for new names in the area)?</p>
              <p>On your argument about ignorant Singaporeans not knowing about the great people in Singapore's history, I can't argue with that. Many of the younger Singaporeans are indeed ignorant on this point.</p>
              <p>On the point of names being used as jokes, it's not every name that can be tweaked as such - some names are more prone to such jokes than others, especially if they can be seen as very obvious puns or are obvious alternative names for something else. Your cited example, Khatib, has no puns that can be immediately obvious to most Singaporeans - possibly, when pronounced, it sounds like "car tip" or "car tick", but that mostly happens after people say the name over and over again, and sounds forced; "Kah" in Kah Kee, on the other hand, has it's pun in full plain view of anyone who speaks Hokkien; "Kah" sounds like "leg" in Hokkien, and this is a pun that is obvious to many Hokkien-speaking people; the leg is a body part that sometimes have dirty, negative connotations, and this connotations can result in extremely disrespectful jokes on the name, something I believe will cause Tan Kah Kee to turn over in his grave if he knows about it!</p>
              <p>On a final note, I do hope you do not take me as trying to flame you, but while I do agree that there's a lot of immaturity and childishness in this thread, your arrogant attitude and you going around calling names will not help to turn them to your opinion nor help bring mature discussion into this matter; in any case it will only isolate people with your opinions even further, and will only bring about more immaturity. You called others childish, but if you looked at your arrogant attitude in your own mirror, you will find that you yourself is not any better than the people you are spitting on.</p>
              <p>With all I have said, I think I will cease participating in this discussion. My arguments, I feel, are enough fodder against your arguments and for anyone who supports my opinion. I do respect differeing opinions; what I have no respect for are immature attitudes. If you insist on using such attitudes to counter me, then this whole debate is effectively derailing from it's subject matter.</p>
              <p>Plus, I have more important things I need to attend to in my life.</p>

              <p><br>i must point out that it is unlikely for hwachong to move out, unlike the raffles school.</p>
              <p>Like what Gohby said, hwachong is built on private land, and the land deed belongs to hwachong, not the government.</p>
              <p>raffles, unlike hwachong, had a public land deed, with the land belonging to the government, and thus, they can be moved as and when the government requires the land.</p>
              <p>and given the size of the 2 schools, hci and raffles, now that both have merge into super-sized 6-years school, and given the scarcity of land in singapore, i doubt that the government is able to find alternative sites for the 2 schools, if they are ever to be moved.</p>
              <p>unless the government take back(a very serious issue if that really happens, to claim back that big chunk of privately owned land) the entire piece of hci land, hci should still be around in bukit timah for a long long time. so, i guess ur arguments tt hci not being a permanent fixture in bukit timah are invalid.</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>If you are able and willing to put aside all your inherent biasness and pre-conceived notions about this school, ask yourself, whats inherently wrong with naming it Kah Kee station? Tan Kah Kee is a philanthropist who donated large sums of money, not only to Hwa Chong, but to build other schools like Tao Nan School and Xiamen University in China. I'd say his altruism is certainly laudable. And thats only snippets of his contributions. If you dont know about him, <strong>go and read up</strong> before you allow your inherent biasness and illogical feelings <strong>to blind your rational thinking</strong>. Personally, its okay if you contain such petty and unsubstantiated biasness within yourself. Because from the way most of you put forth your points, you are making a laughing stock of yourself, seriously. Speaks volume of your maturity and jealousy for some, to put it very bluntly.</p>
              <p><br>Seriously, Duchess MRT station or Watten MRT station!?! If I were to ask you where is Duchess Rd, do you know where it is? Watten? Tsk tsk. You would probably describe Duchess Rd as a road "beside Hwa Chong". If I were to say Hwa Chong, much as many of you hate to admit, you will know decisively that its smack right in the middle of Bukit Timah. So isn't it more feasible to have the station named Hwa Chong, or somewhat related in that matter, for easy identification?</p>
              <p>And please dont draw unrelated extrapolations like "oh, if Hwa Chong can name their own MRT station as such, so can Raffles and _________________ etc etc" sort of arguments. Look at the geographical location of the MRT station before you make such flimsy arguments. For instance, some of you might be thinking Bishan Station could be named as Raffles Station instead, or Catholic High Station, (and the list goes on). But pry your eyes wide open. <em>Duchess</em> station is so near to Hwa Chong, what about others?</p>
              <p>I find statements associating Hwa Chong with bookworms, muggers, etc blindly most appalling and abhorrent. Are you from that school? If you are not from that school, who are you to criticise and make unreserved, deceitful and impressionistic opinions on that school? How well do you know the school's culture, bonds and dynamics? To me, it sadly exposes your inability to evaluate a scenario rationally.</p>
              <p>It does not take a genius to guess where I come from. Yes, your guess is probably right. And I am proud of it. Before opportunistic individuals make use of this as a platform to rebuke me, albeit in an infantile manner, about being an elitist, please allow me to make a disclaimer, I am anti-elitism. I have said my piece. I encourage comments, but I'll only bother replying to sensible and mature replies. Thank you. :)</p>

              <p>Mr. Tan Kah Kee was a great philantrophist and donated great sums of money to found schools. Naming a station after him is no big deal and I don't understand the fuss. After all, Eunos is named after Enche Muhammad Eunos Abdullah, a great Malay philantrophist, who founded Kampong Melayu, later named after him. Aljunied is named after Syed Omar bin Ali Al Junied, a Yemeni <span style="color: #000000;">philanthropist. H</span>is charitable acts included donating a large plot of land in <span style="color: #000000;">Victoria Street</span> for the purposes of a Muslim <a class="mw-redirect" title="Burial ground" href="/wiki/Burial_ground"><span style="color: #000000;">burial ground</span></a> and the construction of a <span style="color: #000000;">mosque</span> in Bencoolen Street. The land where St Andrews Church stands was also donated by him. He contributed largely to the setting up of the Tan Tock Seng Hospital.</p>
              <p>Therefore, Kah Kee Station will not be the first to be named after a philantrophist. Even though Enche Eunos and Syed Omar bin Ali Al Junied have roads named after them, it does not mean that an MRT station can't be named after Mr. Tan Kah Kee. Is it that difficult to accept that?</p>
              <p>In other countries, metro stations are also named after great revolutionaries. In Paris, metro stations are named after square or a street, which, in turn, is probably named for something (or someone) else. There are metro stations named Franklin D. Roosevelt, George V, Charles de Gaulle, Pasteur, Bolivar, Michelangelo, Garibaldi and Stalingrad, just to name a few. Even though there is an av. Franklin D. Roosevelt, there are no exits from Franklin D. Roosevelt station to av. Franklin D. Roosevelt. George V station too. So, what's the fuss?</p>
              <p>NickL_C151's suggestion is sound. Probably the whole station could be dedicated to Mr. Tan Kah Kee, with miniature statues, paintings, and the station can be done up like a small museum in his honour, depicting his life and contributions to Singapore's educational system. It could even become a tourist attraction! To reduce confusion among the public or in the case that HCI moves out, we can have double names for the station (Kah Kee-Duchess or Kah Kee-Watten). Again, this example is taken from Paris, which has double-named stations like Richelieu-Drouot, Reuilly-Chaligny and Saint Sebastien-Froissart. Doesn't this satisfy everybody?</p>
              <p>Could someone suggest this to LTA.</p>

              <p>I would like to add on something.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Where is Eunos? It's near Geylang Serai.</p>
              <p>Where is Aljunied? It is between Geylang and Woodleigh.</p>
              <p>Where is Kah Kee? Er...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I may sound like I am anti-KahKee but let me elaborate on my point.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan Kah Kee has indirectly assisted the education system in Singapore by funding quality schools. If the station was named Hwa Chong, I would still accept it since I can say at a snap of a finger I know where Hwa Chong is. However, Kah Kee station may cause some confusion among the senior citizens in Singapore. Most of them know who Mr Tan Kah Kee is but do not know where the location of the new station Kah Kee is. There are other ways to honour this noble man, it's just that an MRT station would be inappropriate way since people would use the MRT for the purpose of commuting rather than to honour Mr Tan Kah Kee.</p>
              <p>If Kah Kee station is chosen, I would like to suggest a mini museum in the station or even a new building beside the station depicting Mr Tan's life and contributions or some other things related to him.</p>
              <p>Otherwise Duchess, Watten or even Hwa Chong would be a better option.</p>
              <p>Just my two cents worth.</p>

The Skytrain in Bangkok is officially named the Elevated Train in Commemoration of HM the King's 6th Cycle Birthday (<span lang="th">à¸£à¸–à¹„à¸Ÿà¸Ÿà¹‰à¸²à¹€à¸‰à¸¥à¸´à¸¡à¸žà¸£à¸°à¹€à¸�à¸µà¸¢à¸£à¸•à¸´ 6 à¸£à¸­à¸š à¸žà¸£à¸°à¸Šà¸™à¸¡à¸žà¸£à¸£à¸©à¸²</span>).

              <p>Hang Tuah LRT Station in KL is named after the street, not the Melakan hero himself, similarly, Dang Wangi station is so named. It doesn't take its name from the Melakan noblewoman. As mentioned above, the Metro stations in Paris are named in a similar manner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Boon Keng Road, Eunos Link and Aljunied Road got their names from important people in history, so did Raffles Place. Having subway stations named after them is natural. As for TKK, we have no street named in his honour, so naming an MRT station after him may cause a little bit of confusion.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">i spent 6 years of my life in TCHS and then HCJC, but that's not the point because i didn't like HC that much, in fact i hated it. Maybe because i am not a bookworm and i fail everything? But even with my limited grasp of the english language, i can more or less make out what the objectives of the naming exercise are.</span><span style="font-size: xx-small;">  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">1. Identify the location readily so that all commuters can easily remember the names and identify the area of the station</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">2. Illustrate the history and heritage of the station surroundings if relevant</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">3. Reflect the multi-racial, multi-cultural character of Singapore If possible</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Ok point 1. Having spent 6 yrs in HC, i only knew about the existence of Duchess in my JC2 year when i jogged past there. Because it is a relatively new and small residential development tucked inside "that road beside hwa chong". Yes, Duchess  sounds nice, it sounds ang moh, more high class. But if that development was called "Tay Ah Soon Residences", would you have insisted on it being called "Ah Soon Station"? As for Watten, wth is that???</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Of course, an MRT station should ideally be named after it's road, or other major landmark. In this case, Dunearn Rd stretches too long and over too many stations to be a viable naming option. Therefore, the next best thing would be to name it after a significant landmark. Here are a few reasons why i support hwa chong related names (not because i was from that sch, i hated tt place):</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">1) in 1919, when uncle Tan bought 79acres of land there, there was nothing there but crap. forest or jungle, whichever way you prefer. The Chinese High School was the first major development there.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">2) The institution's clock tower has been gazetted as a National Monument since 1999. Move them out? Never heard of gahmens moving monuments before. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">3) During world war 2, japanese used the institution as their command base, overseeing their brutal acts as well as the railroad not far from the school.  ==&gt; cant get more historic than this, i bet</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">4) lets face it, most, if not all of the properties in that area cite such a MAJOR FEATURE in their pamplets. "Close proximity to top schools such as NYGH/HCI/RGPS/NJC. You don't see these schools citing on their websites: "Join our school because we are located beside Duchess Residences"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">My opinions are narrow-minded and not as creative as some of the other people here. but my point is, name the station after something that has a bit of history and meaning around that area. Duchess? If they en bloc next year how? Name it NYGH or NJC or RGPS or WWII or even after alumni Ong Teng Cheong if you don't like the name HC, but not after a minor residential development with no history in that area please. Otherwise might as well name Woodlands, Bedok, etc etc as "7-11, KFC, ABC CONDO, XYZ Ang Moh Chu". </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">As for people who think Uncle Tan don't deserve the accolades or "don't name after him because no road named after him, so he can't be so great". Well, this same Uncle Tan not only funded Tao Nan, Jimei Uni, TCHS, he also funded the jungle warfares our grandfathers took against the Japs. And he continued to fund schools during the financial crisis, leading to his bankruptcy. And let's face it, if someone suggests that the station be named after LEE KONG CHIAN, i bet there won't be as many protests, since he is already so successful in the naming game. But do you know that the founder of the Lee Foundation is actually the protege and son-in-law of Uncle Tan? Without Uncle Tan's support, financially and socially, there would be no Lee Foundation. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Anyway name it Mcdonald's MRT station also can lah, just dun name it after a minor residential development. It's an insult to the rich history of that area. Or since so many rich people live there, name it Millionaire MRT or sth...</span></p>
