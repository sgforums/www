              <p>seriously, the choice of names for the station sounds weird.</p>
              <p>Duchess and Watten are essentially 2 residential slipways, with most of the landed properties along these 2 strips of road habited by expats.</p>
              <p>and Kahkee sounds strange. it does not sounds that normal like "eunos"...</p>
              <p>aniwae, i think it is quite stupid to build so many mrt stations so closely together. lrt may be more suitable, since the length between each stn is quite short. you can walk from serene center to blackmore if you want.</p>

              <p><strong>Inche Muhammad Eunos Abdullah</strong> was the Chairman and co-founder of the <em>Kesatuan Melayu Singapura</em> (the Singapore Malay Union) and the first Malay representative of the <a title="Legislative Council of Singapore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_Council_of_Singapore">Legislative Council</a>, the then governing body of Singapore. In 1927, he appealed to the government and was granted $700,000 that the <em>Kesatuan Melayu Singapura</em> used to purchased 240 <a title="Hectare" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare">hectares</a> of land, which later became known as <em>Kampong Melayu</em>.</p>
              <p>----------</p>
              <p>Kampong Melayu is present day Geylang Serai so yeah, station and area is named after him. We haven't seen a Kah Kee Road anywhere near Duchess though.</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>If you are able and willing to put aside all your inherent biasness and pre-conceived notions about this school, ask yourself, whats inherently wrong with naming it Kah Kee station? Tan Kah Kee is a philanthropist who donated large sums of money, not only to Hwa Chong, but to build other schools like Tao Nan School and Xiamen University in China. I'd say his altruism is certainly laudable. And thats only snippets of his contributions. If you dont know about him, <strong>go and read up</strong> before you allow your inherent biasness and illogical feelings <strong>to blind your rational thinking</strong>. Personally, its okay if you contain such petty and unsubstantiated biasness within yourself. Because from the way most of you put forth your points, you are making a laughing stock of yourself, seriously. Speaks volume of your maturity and jealousy for some, to put it very bluntly.</p>
              <p><br>Seriously, Duchess MRT station or Watten MRT station!?! If I were to ask you where is Duchess Rd, do you know where it is? Watten? Tsk tsk. You would probably describe Duchess Rd as a road "beside Hwa Chong". If I were to say Hwa Chong, much as many of you hate to admit, you will know decisively that its smack right in the middle of Bukit Timah. So isn't it more feasible to have the station named Hwa Chong, or somewhat related in that matter, for easy identification?</p>
              <p>And please dont draw unrelated extrapolations like "oh, if Hwa Chong can name their own MRT station as such, so can Raffles and _________________ etc etc" sort of arguments. Look at the geographical location of the MRT station before you make such flimsy arguments. For instance, some of you might be thinking Bishan Station could be named as Raffles Station instead, or Catholic High Station, (and the list goes on). But pry your eyes wide open.<em> Duchess</em> station is so near to Hwa Chong, what about others?</p>
              <p>I find statements associating Hwa Chong with bookworms, muggers, etc blindly most appalling and abhorrent. Are you from that school? If you are not from that school, who are you to criticise and make unreserved, deceitful and impressionistic opinions on that school? How well do you know the school's culture, bonds and dynamics? To me, it sadly exposes your inability to evaluate a scenario rationally.</p>
              <p>It does not take a genius to guess where I come from. Yes, your guess is probably right. And I am proud of it. Before opportunistic individuals make use of this as a platform to rebuke me, albeit in an infantile manner, about being an elitist, please allow me to make a disclaimer, I am anti-elitism. I have said my piece. I encourage comments, but I'll only bother replying to sensible and mature replies. Thank you. :)</p>

              <p>The Hwa chong guys are doing it again, that time they suggest
              Hwa Chong as the name of the station outside their school (which
              was tentatively Duchess), now they want that station named after
              their founder, Mr Tan Kah Kee. There are three choices for Duchess:
              Duchess, Watten and Kah Kee.</p>
              <p>Yes Mr Tan Kah Kee has been a great contributor to Singapore and
              the Chinese community, but naming the station outside Hwa Chong
              after their founder is too much. Already Zaobao is reporting that
              the students would vote for Kah Kee, so chances of them winning is
              quite high if there is only a few people participating in the
              naming exercise. But is it necessary for a single non-university
              institution to have a station with a name related to their school
              outside their school, if like this, every other school with a MRT
              station should participate in naming competitions naming it after
              their school.</p>
              <p>Go to the following website and click surveys then <span>"Downtown Line Stage 2 – Public Polling Exercise" (or maybe
              available at main page side panel)</span> to poll. Please vote for
              Duchess instead of Kah Kee.</p>

              <p>Allow me to counter this with a few statements:</p>
              <p>If Duchess station's final name ends up being Kah Kee, this name will be relevant to it's surroundings. But, what happens if the school moves out? Highly unlikely, you say, but metro lines are there for the long-term (there's rapid transit systems in the world that are over a hundred years old), and no one can be able to forsee what might happen in the future. Raffles Insitution's current address, I believe, was not it's address a mere 20 to 30 years ago; a few of our MRT stations are that old, if not older. What if Hwa Chong Insitution moves out in, say, 30 years' time? Could the name Kah Kee, a much-unheard name, still have immediate relevancy to the surrounding neighbourhood? For future generations living there?</p>
              <p>Also, the name Kah Kee might invite unwanted jokes. I won't go into this, but if you speak Hokkien, you will understand the nature of these jokes. If he's such a great person, his name should be protected from such jokes to protect his dignity.</p>
