Only a few stations requires us to walk a big round. This is especially for stations with Circle Line construction works i.e. Buona Vista, Bishan, Serangoon etc etc.<br><br>2. Not always escalator repair. maybe once in a few months.<br><br>3. Inside MRT Stations, dustbins are removed --- for security reasons.<br><br>4. Security Check --- occur at random.<br><br>5. Toilet cleaning during peak hours? Unbelievable. I never see Bedok or Tanjong Pagar MRT's toilets being cleaned during peak hours. Anyway there is a fixed timing for toilet cleaning --- refer to notices posted on the doors of MRT stations' toilets.<br><br>6. Agree though. I cannot sleep on MRT trains easily thanks to these sort of annoucements.<br><br>For this, I have came up with the possible remedy --- stop using announcements on any C751A (NEL) or C751B (SMRT) trains, and change to use the in-train TV/EDS instead.<br><br>7. Again agree though. Appeared as though "we are not deserved to good views since we pay cheap fares". That is unfair to passengers anyway!<br><br>8. This is to prevent crowding around ATMs/SAMs/Postboxes.<br><br>9. One thing I hated to see is long train frequency of 7 mins/train during off peak. Especially infuriated by this when I am on a rush - and the train left off just as I went up the platforms!<br><br>But all these are thanks to the small population we had here - as well as the kind of fares we are paying.<br><br>However, a consolation was: very frequent 2mins/train during peak hours.<br><br>10. That is not enough to make stations appear darker than usual.<br><br>11. You referring to AVMs?<br><br>Noticed that some AVMs accept only cash - or only NETS cards. Can be an inconvenience to passenger though if the AVM(s) accept only cards.<br><br>12. Cannot be helped although I find ads a nonsense.<br><br>13. What?! I thought the NSL - EWL through trains can help a bit?! thats.......<br><br>14. I have to agree that this is very very very common during off-peaks and when the other train is crowded.<br><br>Again a matter of infuriation.<br><br>But, I have observed on last wednesday morning (0830-0833h) that there is a rather empty northbound NSL train waiting at City Hall MRT for EWL train. And only after the EWL train started pulling out of City Hall MRT did the NSL train shut its doors and pull out of City Hall MRT. I saw EWL passengers strolling to NSL train when the EWL train was at the City Hall platforms.<br><br>So, that does not mean the other train would <strong>always</strong> close doors whenever the connecting train arrives.<br><br>----------------<br><br>Concluding my reply, I would like to add a point:<br><br>15. Exhausted passengers cannot rest easily onboard the MRT trains. Sometime trains are way too crowded until tired persons have no seats for them to take a rest --- they have to stand all the way until interchanges in town centers (or their destinations if they are very unfortunate.) I have experienced this x-times before.</div>
