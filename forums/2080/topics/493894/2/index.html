              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">More Bus
              Services for Greater Accessibility in Tuas</span></strong></p>
              <p>Commuters travelling to Tuas can look forward to greater
              convenience and enhanced public transport connectivity with the
              introduction of two new bus services and four amended bus services
              to complement the new Tuas West Extension (TWE) which begins
              operations on 18 June 2017. New Bus Services 247 and 248 will link
              Tuas South with the new TWE stations and provide an expanded
              coverage within the area.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">New</span> Bus
              Services:</p>
              <p>Service 247: This new service will operate from Tuas Bus
              Terminal and serve Tuas Crescent and Tuas Biomedical Park I (i.e.
              Tuas South Avenues 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and Tuas Bay Link).
              Commuters can connect to Service 247 at Tuas Crescent and Tuas Link
              MRT Stations.</p>
              <p>Service 248: This new service will operate from Tuas Bus
              Terminal and serve Tuas Biomedical Park II (i.e. Tuas South Avenues
              5, 9, 10, 12 and 14). Commuters can connect to Service 248 at Tuas
              West Road and Tuas Link MRT Stations.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Amended</span> Bus
              Services:</p>
              <p>Service 254: The service will be amended to ply Pioneer Road,
              and skip Tuas Crescent and Tuas Avenue 20. The amended service will
              connect commuters to Tuas Crescent and Tuas West Road MRT Stations.
              The skipped sectors will be served by new Service 247 from Tuas
              Crescent MRT Station, or new Service 248 from Tuas West Road MRT
              Station.</p>
              <p>Service 192: It will be amended to ply Pioneer Road to serve
              Tuas West Road MRT Station. On the other hand, it will skip Tuas
              Link 4 and Tuas Avenue 7, which will be served by new Service 247
              from Tuas Crescent and Tuas Link MRT Stations instead. Within the
              Jurong West area, Service 192 will also be amended to ply Jurong
              West Street 62 instead of Jurong West Street 63.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Integrated</span> Bus
              Services:</p>
              <p>In tandem with the amendment to Service 192, Services 256 and
              258 will be integrated as one service. The integrated Service 258
              will operate from Joo Koon Bus Interchange and loop at Jurong West
              Street 64, via Jurong West Street 81 and Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim. The
              skipped sectors along Jurong West Street 62 and Upper Jurong Road
              will be served by the amended Service 192.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bus</span> Services
              Unchanged:</p>
              <p>Service 182/M from Joo Koon Bus Interchange will serve Tuas Link
              MRT Station en route to Tuas West Drive and Tuas South Avenues 3,
              4, 5, 8 and 9.</p>
              <p>Service 193 plying between Boon Lay Bus Interchange and Tuas Bus
              Terminal will serve Gul Circle, Tuas West Road and Tuas Link MRT
              Stations, where commuters can connect to Tuas Avenues 2, 4, 5 and
              9, as well as Tuas West Drive.</p>
              <p>New bus stops have been constructed to support the bus route
              changes. Please refer to the Annex for more details.</p>
              <p>When adjusting the bus service network, LTA has consulted
              stakeholders including the Advisers and grassroots leaders in the
              Jurong West area and companies in the Jurong and Tuas Industrial
              Estate and has taken every effort to minimise inconvenience to
              existing commuters while enhancing the overall travel
              experience.</p>
              <p>Information on the new, amended or existing public bus services
              will be available at all affected bus stops, bus interchanges, and
              on buses, as well as online at LTA’s website http://www.lta.gov.sg/
              and SBS Transit’s website http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/. Service
              ambassadors will also be available to help commuters.</p>

              <p>There is 243G/W every 03-04 minutes. This move is great. Those from JW ST 75/81/82 can transfer to sv 172/178/180/240/251 without having to enter the interchange and wasting time. Calculate the amount of time they will save for transfer.</p>
              <p>Have you seen the amount of time it takes to enter interchange during peak hours? Those going to MRT, have a short walk from the bus stop to MRT.</p>

              <p>Hi sir,</p>
              <p>I understand your concerns, but i guess its too bad that LTA made these plan which ultimately wants their consumers to take more MRT than bus so that they hopefully can reduce the vehicle numbers on the road, and so maybe this bad planning as you claimed. Personally, I thought that it is pretty OK, given that it came from LTA and they should have a good team of people who can plan routes and this is the best they can come out with. In reality, nothing can please everyone, so there are some parts to this admendment where some people's convenience and well-being have to be sacrified. I shall apologise on LTA's behalf (though im do not work there) and sympathise you.</p>
              <p>In fact, i recommend you to team up with your fellow friends who share the same view, voice it out to your MP. If it does not get through, you may want to submit a report (a dissertion would be good, since you can write pretty goot essays) so that it makes your argument on reverting 258 back to boon lay int more convincing. At the same time, start a petition and persuade ppl that the current plan is not ideal. By garnering enough support, who knows u could effectively change the plans made by LTA</p>
              <p>Cheers</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope not to burst your bubbles, only the 300G/W case was successful. The 76/134/150 saga did boil for some time, but u dont see ppl complaining over social media all the time at LTA's/SBS's page about it becoz most of us got used to it alr. If you think this case would inconvenient you for your entire worklife and your fellow friends, then i guess its time to make a move. Good luck ;)</p>

              <p>Okay, BusAnalayzer, I get your point.</p>
              <p>Hopefully, the route amendment can help me get to Boon Lay MRT
              Station faster.</p>
              <p>But, that bus stop is some distance away, and it's not
              sheltered. Furthermore, that area got a lot of people
              smoking...</p>
              <p>Honestly, if the "long waiting time" is the reason, I really
              don't know what LTA is thinking.</p>
              <p>because by merging 256 into 258, you are already removing one
              bus service from Boon Lay Bus Interchange. Won't that improve the
              "long waiting time" problem already?</p>
              <p>Why need to remove 258 from Boon Lay Bus Interchange, and make
              it loop around Boon Lay MRT Station?</p>
              <p>By the way, I feel that Boon Lay Way is more congested than
              Jurong West Central 3 during peak hours...</p>
              <p>Anyway, I don't want to argue.</p>
              <p>I just want to voice my concern, and my job here is done.</p>
              <p>Thank you for taking time to read my messages.</p>

              <p>I dont see your point of whining again when I just told you that if you need to go to interchange take 243G/W that comes every 03-04 minutes with a good number of DDs.</p>
              <p>If you need to transfer to 172/178/180/187/240/251 take 258 and do transfer at same stop. Walking to MRT also quite near by. There is a shelter on the bus stop and covered pathway to MRT. Tell me two drops of rain you cant survive till you reach covered shelter from bus stop!??</p>

                                              <p>Actually, there's no point in having 254 ply Tuas Crescent or Tuas West Road stations, if people can only use the stations to get to work, and not to get home.</p>
                                              
                                              <p>It is messy; not "synchronous". People will still use Joo Koon Bus Interchange, to transfer between bus and train.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>254 amendment is probably to shorten the route, to reduce travel time and improve reliability, and not really to connect to the new stations.</p>

                          <p>Honestly, I'm surprised that they use 247 and 248 for the new routes, when Tuas area is actually 25-something.</p>
                      
                      <p>And why they don't want to take this opportunity to re-number 182, 192 and 193 to the 25-numbers, or the 24-numbers?</p>
                          
              <p>Maybe Joo Koon is 25, whereas Tuas is 24.</p>
