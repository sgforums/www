            <div class='col-md body'>I REFER to the letter, 'SMRT should look into problems with train doors' by Ms Elaine Wee (ST Online Forum, Nov 17).<br>We would like to assure commuters that SMRT has in place stringent operational procedures to ensure passenger safety. Apart from indicators to warn commuters that the doors are about to close, trains have built-in safety features which ensure trains will not move off if an object comes between the train doors. An indicator in the driver's cab will also light up, prompting the driver to re-open the train doors. Train doors are also operated pneumatically so the closing speed is reduced when they are about to close. This will minimise the impact should any passenger be hit by them.<br><br>Ms Wee observed that the train doors closed on an elderly woman at City Hall MRT station on Oct 27. Our investigations showed that the woman tried to board the train when the train doors were closing, and after the door closing announcement came on. As a result, the woman was caught between the doors, which were subsequently re-opened to allow her to board.<br><br>We take this opportunity to advise commuters not to rush into the train at the last moment, especially after the door closing announcements and the buzzer are played. On our part, we will continue to remind train officers to exercise greater care when closing the doors.<br><br>We thank Ms Wee for sharing her observation with us.<br><br>Kuek Chor Ling (Ms)<br><br>Manager, Corporate Marketing and Communications<br><br>SMRT Corporation<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/Online%2BStory/STIStory_181006.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/Online%2BStory/STIStory_181006.html</a><br><br>Looking at the comments stemed from the article...<br><br>#1: I don't think people would care too much about "rush(ing) into the train at the last moment" if you increase the frequency of your services?<br><br>#2: #1's suggestion to improve services by increasing frequency is a great suggestion, but alas it would impact the bottom line! The response from SMRT Corp puts the onus on commuters not to get in the way of its train doors, so let us all be warned. For an aspiring "first world" country we do lag way behind on consumer rights and treating people as people - we now reap what we have sowed and despite all the talk about being caring, etc the top down bullying style still persists, sometimes cloaked in pleasant words. Time we walked the walk.<br><br>#3: Typical Singapore corporation reply: "Solly, hor, but oso your fault what."<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Sigh... really hopeless lah, Singaporeans.<br><br>Train door safety has got nothing to do with frequency, the onus is on passengers themselves to ensure safety for themselves on-board trains. Since SMRT has warned (pasting stickers on their doors in all 4 ethnic languages to warn people not to rush into trains when doors are closing), the emphasis is now on people on whether they wish to comply with the rules. It's clearly the elderly woman's fault that she rushed in when the doors are closing. Even though doors have sensors to indicate an obstacle in between the doors, isn't it the responsibility of the passenger to ensure that they enter the train safely? Singaporeans are just too <strong>kiasu</strong>, train doors closing also must rush in. Bear in mind that trains do have a schedule to follow, and they can't possibly wait for every single person to board before closing it's doors. If that is so, train schedules get heavily stretched, and waiting times increase.<br><br>The bottom line is, train doors closing =/= frequency of the trains, it's the passenger's responsibility to ensure his/her own safety. SMRT has put in place safety measures to ensure safety of commuters, it's time people here reflect on themselves whether they do have a part to play in ensuring they enjoy their trip.<br><br>Seriously, the comment on #1 is way too off-topic. If Singaporeans know how to ensure their own safety, no matter how long the waiting time is, there wouldn't be any case of injury right? Even if SMRT decreases the frequency to 2 minutes we still see people rushing in. It's very clearly observed during peak hours. Why is this so? People always rushing what, see train doors closing also rush. They don't care when is the next train is arriving; they just want to go into the train. Such <strong>kiasu</strong> attitude makes such injuries a high possibility for people who rush into trains the last minute. Thus, train door safety has nothing to do with frequency of trains; it's the persistence of such <strong>kiasu</strong> mindsets of Singaporeans that such cases of injury is very common. If we can all step back and reflect on our own actions, we can still enjoy a comfortable train ride home without worrying about the doors closing on us again.</span></span></div>

If the train doors are about to close, an announcement is made, and for newer trains they have a blinking red light. Surely the light is visible and the announcement is audible. For underground stations, a blinking light is shown just above the PSD. All these were put in place to tell you that doors are closing, please don't rush.<br><br>If the girl did not rush, surely she would not have been caught in between the doors. No matter what time the doors close, does the train driver know when to close? Some TOs step out of their driving cabs to look at the doors before closing. The moment they press the close button, will they know if anyone else is rushing in?<br><br>No matter when they close the doors, if someone is really so desperate and <strong>kiasu</strong> to board the train, they will rush. Close 1 second later is the same as close 1 second earlier. The doors still close. People still try to rush in when doors are closing.<br><br>If I'm the girl, what can I do? As long as safety measures are in place (i.e. trains do not move off if doors are not closed properly), the doors will eventually open. All that I can say for myself is that I was too <strong>kan chiong</strong> and therefore I should be responsible for my own injury.<br><br>Remember, time waits for no man; TOs have a train schedule to follow.<br><br>It's time Singaporeans wake up from their cozy comfortable bed and reflect upon their own actions.</span></span></div>

However in case of door failure there is still a red lever.</div>
