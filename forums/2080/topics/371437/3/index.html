              <p>People, if you don't know anything about them, don't assume
                  things.</p>
              <p>And for those who are so confident that they are committing
                  suicide, how you know? If we all don't know anything of what
                  happened to them, how come you know more than us? You were at the
                  scene? So if you don't know anything don't even jump into

              <p>Simply put, no human being with both an iota of intelligence and a willingness to live would sit at the tracks of an active railway line at 0524 hrs before the rising of the sun and fail to move away upon being horned at by the incoming train.</p>
              <p>Of course, it <em>is </em>entirely possible that they were perfectly intelligent beings who somehow got around to the conclusion that such a course of action was perfectly logical.</p>
              <p>We're just saying that the scenario in my second paragraph seems to be very unlikely.</p>

              <p>Tazzhong maybe right. The train driver could have just blasted the horn once and then acclerated when he saw the couple on the track. Like car drivers in Singapore.</p>
              <p>It could be causing death by a reckless act with a train, or even murder.</p>

              <p>Have any of you ever taken a ride on an old style train (Singapore-Malaysia express) that is not powered by electricity like our MRT but by diesel? The train is extremely noisy. I have stood by tracks and could hear the train even a few hundred meters away before it arrived, not to mention the vibration that can be felt from the ground.</p>
              <p>If the couple were on the tracks, it is unlikely they did not hear the train and even more unlikely they did not feel the vibration transmitted through the tracks while the train was still quite far away.</p>
              <p>Straits times reported the boy was cheerful but how often do teenagers express their problems to friends? On the other hand, this is a very painful and gruesome way to die. Unless they were trying to make a statement, they would have chosen a more humane way like taking an overdose of sleeping pills etc.</p>
              <p>Basically I don't think this case was an accident. My speculation is that either this is a double suicide or a murder-suicide or perhaps even a double homicide.</p>

              <p>Look, seriously speaking, for what reason were they sitting on an active railway track at 5.24 am in the morning?</p>
              <p>I take it that you probably know the couple and I take it that you find it hard to accept that it was an unnatural death. But really...... <em>what on earth were they doing there in the first place</em>?!?!</p>

              <p>what on earth are they doing in the wee hours of the morning? they arent even suppose to be in the railway area in the first place!</p>
              <p>ive been in touch with the KTM sectors for 2 years. from drivers, to station masters, to railway maintenance crew. all this people i've met before. they always emphasise safety while near the railway line.</p>
              <p>the train is heavy, run by diesel.. imagine, train running between 60-75kmh, at a blind spot.. it will take sometime for the train to stop, and by that time, the train might have hit them already..</p>
              <p>im sure the driver got no intention to hit them, but the train is moving. same like cars. even if they e-brake, they dont stop immediately.</p>

              <p>singapore police were called.</p>
              <p>they got hit in singapore, bukit timah. near railmall.</p>
              <p>i think the polis bantuan KTMB went there to accompany the other railway staffs there. that's the SOP in KTMB, if i'm not wrong.</p>
