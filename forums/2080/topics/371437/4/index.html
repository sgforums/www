              <p>There you go. The driver sounded his whistle, and then applied the brakes ASAP. Sounds like reasonable procedure to me. Do you know Newton's 1st Law and what it says about inertia? You know how much inertia a moving train has and its minimum stopping distance to prevent derailment? Do you know Newton's 2nd Law and what it says about the train's momentum and resultant force applied on the couple on the tracks?</p>
              <p>But never mind the train. The truth is that they just have no business sitting on the tracks of an active railway line. Do you know that KTM train toilets empty out onto the track? That is to say, after you do your business in the toilet bowl and you flush, it all goes down onto the tracks?</p>
              <p>Combine that with all the dust, smoke, diesel fumes, darkness at 5.24 am, and the very real threat of getting langgar-ed by a high-momentum, high-inertia train.... what business do they have sitting on the tracks?!?!</p>

              <p>In the first place, they aren't supposed to sit at the railway. Knowing trains can come at anytime of the day.</p>
              <p>If there are still trains running on the line, the line and land still belongs to them. An example is the former Jurong Branch Line. That land isnt used anymore, and Singapore took the land back from Malaysia.</p>

              <p><br>Yes..</p>
              <p> If I recalled correctly, they won't stamp on your passport. They will stamp onto your declaration card. Just a chop like, KTM TG PAGAR 10 AUG 2009</p>
              <p>Then when you are returning back to Singapore via train.. They will take away your declaration card, and will sign, in red ink, with the officer's Signature, and the date you depart from Johor... Something like, <em>Ahmad </em>11/8/09</p>

              <p>via a corporation and not directly, so this is not a sovereignty issue, arbor we can say ports in Dubai or India belonging to PSA Intl is actually Singapore land</p>
              <p>i believe the error was corrected, hence you wont see Malaysia Immigration stamping passports until we are well out of Singapore</p>

              <p>the cause of their death = complete mystery</p>
              <p>1) cannot be drunk cos' blood tests show no traces of alchohol or anything</p>
              <p>2) cannot be stuck in trackscos' from the photos, even if stuck in track, very easy to remove and considering the noise from train so loud, they could have heard it from far away and plenty of time to remove leg / shirt / pants / shoes / whatever. And btw, the dimensions of the gap is not enough to trap a leg or anything.</p>
              <p>3) cannot be unaware of train coming due to loud noise of train in the middle of the night</p>
              <p>4) RAILWAY TRACK GOT GHOST???!!</p>
              <p>and yeah, i agree driver not at fault cos' it's just IMPOSSIBLE to brake the trains in such a short time and plus, it's night. The driver very likely didn't see those guys until some distance away and by then, too late liao.</p>
              <p>this is what happens to kids who don't want to go home and still want to stay out late.</p>
              <p>see lah, got problem liao. 2 young lives 20 and 19 yrs old........big big pity.</p>
              <p>my condolences to them.</p>
