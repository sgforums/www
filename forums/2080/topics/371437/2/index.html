              <p>hmm.. planned suicide? i don't know.</p>
              <p>or most probably they were just relaxing, and didnt expect a train would come at this hour? nontheless, it's better to stay out of the railway line.</p>
              <p>but.. if they saw the train, and they didnt move, i guess it shld be a planned one. if not, why they didnt want to move?</p>

              <p>I definately agree with HyuugaNeji.... those two was definately high on Alocohol or perhaps other stimulants.</p>
              <p>There is sure many easier way to commit suicide... and I reckon to suicide this way take alot alot of courage, think about the Kamikaze Pilots in WW2....</p>
              <p>From a psychological point of view, it is a very tought way to suicide.</p>
              <p>And the fact is both are being affected. Cos it takes alot of psycho for one to influence the other to suicide in such a violent way.</p>
              <p>Hence, there could be many many possiblities....</p>
              <p>but definately, they must be so high on alcohol and other stimulants, that they will were not reacting normally... and not sober enough to see the train and get away from it</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>which every animal survival instinct will be to escape from it</p>

              <p><br>They should be scared then..</p>
              <p>But even if they stopped the train, it will still hit them. That place where they got hit, is considered as a blindspot area for train drivers, where they have to horn quite a few times, in this case, I think the driver have horned at them, but they didnt seem to move, and the driver must have had applied the brakes, still resulting them to be hit.</p>

              <p>People, if you don't know anything about them, don't assume things.</p>
              <p>And for those who are so confident that they are committing suicide, how you know? If we all don't know anything of what happened to them, how come you know more than us? You were at the scene? So if you don't know anything don't even jump into conclusion.</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>
