            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore 2009: MRT Suicide Rates Risen:<br><br>Every 3 in 5 suicide victims end their life by jumping down the MRT. SMRT is seriously facing a big problem with train operators quitting their jobs and this made MRT an 'unreliable' mean of transport. SMRT claims that their ridership had fallen tremendously by a million riders this year compared to last year. Not only them suffered. SBS and SMRT's sister company SMRT Buses are facing a sharp rise of ridership and this caused SBS to deploy more and more services till they came down to the last bus from each depot. This had caused major traffic jams in the CBD and the PTC had annouced yesterday that the MRT line will undergo refurbishment, including installations of barrier doors at each station. Due to this, SMRT had ammended it;s trains routes to be shortened. East West line will be shortened from Bugis to Queenstown and the North South Line from Bishan Depot to Marina Bay. SMRT will complete it's refurbishment works by 2011.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you are unhappy with life, and you decide to end it, consider carefully. You only live once. Cherish this one life. Do not throw it away just like that if you're depressed. Even if your troubles are gone, what about your loved ones? Consider their feelings. Though your troubles are gone, theirs' are far from over. Even if you still want to end your life, there are many ways to do it. You can cut your throat with a knife, you can hang yourself from a tree, you can overdose on medicine, you can suffocate yourself in a locked room with closed window... etc etc.<br>So of all the ways to end your life, why jump in front of an MRT train? Why? By doing so, you have not only hurt your loved ones, you have also traumatised those who witness the accident. Think about the other passengers on the platform, waiting to board the train. They are calmly waiting for the train to arrive. As it drives into the station, they hear a loud honking of the train and a screech of tyres, followed by a loud thud. They turn their heads, to see the MRT train come to a stop, with a person sprawled underneath. How would they feel? Shocked, traumatised, with their hearts thumping like mad? And what about the train driver? He is driving the train normally, when a figure on the platform leapts out at the windscreen. He slams the brakes, hoping to prevent a crash, but it is just too late. A sickening crunch, and blood splatters on the windscreen. How would he feel? Guilt-ridden for the rest of his life, that he caused the unintended death of an innocent guy? And what about the undertakers carrying the body away? Or the people cleaning the train after the accident?<br>Is this how you want to end your life? Your troubles may be over, but certainly not for those who witnessed the accident. Think about it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys! Man I have always thought of being a TO if all else of my studies cannot give me a job. Seriously I wouldn't mind seeing all this because I ahve seen it before (vehicular accidents) and hence I have no fear. Have went through some trauma and come out to be stronger person (I felt dah, maybe proven wrong at any time). The only concern i have is the 'mc' they give, you would not step into a train cab from then on unless you prove pyschologically alright, I think, or else it will be away from the controls.<br>For me, I guess SMRT will not employ me at all, because if I see someone jump, I will not press e brake because this may cause injury to other passenges on the train (Japan Railways does this, because their trains are long) but for me is passenger safety concern. So I will let the train brake to normal stopping point, monitor all systems in the meantime with professionalism, switch off the console with professionalism, announce to passengers that there is an emergency with professionalism. Not be in distress and complain about it later and eventually lose the job.<br>I have simulated emergency on simulators (no blood, no graphics, but just simulate) and I must say, you need a strong heart.<br>I am ready to replace those without strong hearts. But do keep in mind, I hate people who jump the tracks too, they spoil the image of train, SMRT and the TOs. And they truely prove that they are, the coward end of life.</div>

Man I have always thought of being a TO if all else of my studies cannot give me a job. Seriously I wouldn't mind seeing all this because I ahve seen it before (vehicular accidents) and hence I have no fear. Have went through some trauma and come out to be stronger person (I felt dah, maybe proven wrong at any time). The only concern i have is the 'mc' they give, you would not step into a train cab from then on unless you prove pyschologically alright, I think, or else it will be away from the controls.<br>For me, I guess SMRT will not employ me at all, because if I see someone jump, I will not press e brake because this may cause injury to other passenges on the train (Japan Railways does this, because their trains are long) but for me is passenger safety concern. So I will let the train brake to normal stopping point, monitor all systems in the meantime with professionalism, switch off the console with professionalism, announce to passengers that there is an emergency with professionalism. Not be in distress and complain about it later and eventually lose the job.<br>I have simulated emergency on simulators (no blood, no graphics, but just simulate) and I must say, you need a strong heart.<br>I am ready to replace those without strong hearts. But do keep in mind, I hate people who jump the tracks too, they spoil the image of train, SMRT and the TOs. And they truely prove that they are, the coward end of life.</div></blockquote>If people jump when a train is reaching the station, why bother pressing E-Brake anyway? Just continue on or accelerate, because the person eventually dies. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

They find that this life is boring, not fun, stressful whatever. They wish to be in another phase of life, like going to the Blissed Land for happiness. Being here, as a human they suffer through untold pain. So they wish to be released from this untold pain and move on. All those "cowardly ending your life", dying etc is insulting.
