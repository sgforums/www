              <p>Recent event: Just 2 days ago I took the last CCL train from Serangoon to Dakota, and filmed the entire train ride. Before I even started so, I asked the Station Manager for his permission, and he allowed. Along the journey, I filmed at the first door, just behind a few TOs. When they saw me, the first thing they did was to apologise to me and move back a few doors behind cos they were chatting, and scared they will spoil my video. I was so stunned loh. When I asked about the strict rules on video &amp; photography on trains, they affrimed me that all these are allowed but do not upload any videos showing their technical operations on the train.</p>
              <p>So I'm still quite surprised that some of us had experienced the otherwise and even ended up in the hands of the police. I dunno what's happening nowadays haha! O.o</p>

After all, it's not like terrorists can't just go on a train or station and observe it if they can't just get on YouTube and watch a video of it. It's just a pointless exercise to stop us from taking videos and personally I don't quite see how it will enhance security from terrorism.</p>
