              <p>For me, yes I will film at Overhead Bridge BUT I will wait until the SMRT SAY can take photo and video and no bombing in other country(ies). But I'm sure that they will NEVER announce this notice. <strong>If no more bombing next several years.

              <p>According to a forumer who claimed to have relatives work as station manager, told him that such things are not allowed at all with the relevant procedures, IF no permissions was asked before hand. Kind of such things is 100% depends on the staff there, and not blaming the policeman, LTA or the head of SMRT. (So the rule is apart of play by owner's rule, it is more on self-restrain as well)</p>
              <p> Quote from him:</p>
              <p>"</p>
              <p>you are at a person's house, do you go around, walk here walk there, touch here touch there at your own will?<br>would you like it?<br>same goes to smrt<br>you are their place<br>you play by their rules, not the ACTS of the RTS<br></p>
              <p>"</p>
              <p>Note: Corrected. (Maybe some awareness campaign should be made, so that it relieves certain people's worry on such videos / photos are easily available on the net which poses security threat, and at the same time, people will have no excuse / reason to defy the staffs since people at the same time, usually feel shocked and unhappy as well when encounter such issue. So kind of killing 2 birds in a stone.)</p>

              <p>the ban has been made temporarily by people due to security

              <p>Banned dates:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>28 March 2010 - 9 April 2010: Probably due to Moscow subway
              bombings (Please read 'Refrain from taking photos and videos for
              now'.)</li>
              <li>19 May 2010 - TBA: Due to the terrorists circled Orchard
              station (read earlier post).</li>

              <p>The ban means cannot take photos and videos in MRT, due to the Orchard MRT Station suspected terrorist attack and Moscow subway bombings, for the sake of security reasons. We did not lift the ban yet. Apart from security to go normal, we still don't even bother to lift the ban and start taking photos and videos.</p>
              <p>Videos for youyuan - 'No video until further notice' means will wait until June 10, 2010.<br>Videos for C751BLovur - Videos for Trains will be in Overhead Bridge View, not anywhere else.<br>Videos for willischong - Still can take.<br>Videos for jcqh1 - Still can take, but not uploading.</p>
