              <p>Dear train enthusiasts, train fans, and the general public,</p>
              <p>PLEASE DO NOT UPLOAD ANY TRAIN MEDIA UNLESS YOU HAVE PRIOR PERMISSION TO DO SO BY SMRT AND SBS TRANSIT STAFF. This is due to the suspected planned terrorist attack at Orchard Station. Any video uploads without knowledge of staff may cause suspicion in you helping the terrorists.</p>

Well, this may alert the security in Singapore so please try not to upload anymore videos and photos for now. I won't know when this will resume, but will probably be a long time...

              <p>I know everyone is sad. I'm sad too. But please help us and restrict your train photo and video uploads to a certain limit, which is to be as low as possible.</p>

              <p>[QUOTE from  <span class="author">willis_chong from </span><a class="entry-title" rel="bookmark" href="388213">Press Releases</a>]</p>
              <p>I'll roughly translate it out then.</p>
              <p>"Singapore has train fans who enjoys taking 
              photos of trains and
                                      sharing them with other train fans online. This 
              has made the public
                                      worried.</p>
              <p>In this discussion room for Singapore Trains,
               it congregated
                                      many train fans who likes taking media of trains</p>
              <p>As known from 'Lianhe Wanbao', these train 
              fans like to take
                                      photos of exterior and interior of train 
              advertisements, and share
                                      it with other train fans on the discussion 
              board.</p>
              <p>They also compared trains from last time and 
              the ones currently,
                                      which brought back memories of Singapore's 
              transport system.</p>
              <p>However, on 29th March, Russia's capital 
              Moscow had 2 metro
                                      trains packed with people bombed, which caused 
              39 deaths and almost
                                      70 injuries.</p>
              <p>MRT stations are now again the the focus of 
              terrorists, which
                                      caused the MRT system to raise its security even
               more.</p>
              <p>Some members of the public worry, if people 
              take media of trains
                                      within MRT stations, would the security be 
              affected? Would
                                      terrorists find out anything from those media 
              that makes it easier
                                      for bombings?</p>
              <p>One of the train fans within the discussion 
              board, posted a
                                      notice 2 days after the incident, warning them 
              to refrain from
                                      taking train videos and photos, that's because 
              'if you get caught
                                      (from taking photos and videos of trains), you 
              may not be let off
                                      easily like all other times. You may even be 
              arrested
                                      immidiately.'</p>
              <p>The moderator of the discussion board also 
              stated 'If you still
                                      want to take photos and videos of trains, take 
              them at your own
                                      risk. Tou can continue to post your pictures and
               videos of trains,
                                      however.'</p>
              <p>Many of the train fans felt disappointed 
              after reading the
                                      notice. Someone asked, 'When will security here 
              be loosen? Not
                                      being able to take photos and videos of trains 
              make us sad.' "</p>
              <p>May not be accurate, but at least gives you a
               summary about the
                                      article.</p>

              <p><br>As of situations being observed now, we can't film in Bus Int/Ter. Other places should be fine. Here's a sample of what I've filmed on the bus:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2uFBPaml0s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2uFBPaml0s</a></p>
              <p>There was once when I was at Hougang central bus int copying down regos, the route manager approached and questioned me. Then he said that there was a bunch of ppl like me snapping inside the int and was handed over to the police. I was dam stunned. Luckly he said copying regos is fine =.=</p>

              <p>I'll roughly translate it out then.</p>
              <p>"Singapore has train fans who enjoys taking photos of trains and sharing them with other train fans online. This has made the public worried.</p>
              <p>In this discussion room for Singapore Trains, it congregated many train fans who likes taking media of trains</p>
              <p>As known from 'Lianhe Wanbao', these train fans like to take photos of exterior and interior of train advertisements, and share it with other train fans on the discussion board.</p>
              <p>They also compared trains from last time and the ones currently, which brought back memories of Singapore's transport system.</p>
              <p>However, on 29th March, Russia's capital Moscow had 2 metro trains packed with people bombed, which caused 39 deaths and almost 70 injuries.</p>
              <p>MRT stations are now again the the focus of terrorists, which caused the MRT system to raise its security even more.</p>
              <p>Some members of the public worry, if people take media of trains within MRT stations, would the security be affected? Would terrorists find out anything from those media that makes it easier for bombings?</p>
              <p>One of the train fans within the discussion board, posted a notice 2 days after the incident, warning them to refrain from taking train videos and photos, that's because 'if you get caught (from taking photos and videos of trains), you may not be let off easily like all other times. You may even be arrested immidiately.'</p>
              <p>The moderator of the discussion board also stated 'If you still want to take photos and videos of trains, take them at your own risk. Tou can continue to post your pictures and videos of trains, however.'</p>
              <p>Many of the train fans felt disappointed after reading the notice. Someone asked, 'When will security here be loosen? Not being able to take photos and videos of trains make us sad.' "</p>
              <p>May not be accurate, but at least gives you a summary about the article.</p>
