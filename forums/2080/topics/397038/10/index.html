              <p>I personally find its over-reaction to prohibit filming or photographing of trains. I admire Melbourne's authorities to allow railway enthusiasts photograph at train stations and trains; but got to apply permit from train operators.</p>
              <p>I feel that by prohibiting photographing or filming is not going to prevent any terrorist attack at all. Instead our authorities should think of how to stop terrorist from walking into the train and public premises with a bag of explosives. There are no bomb/explosive detectors, etc. Transit security can do little or of any use if a terrorist were to walk into the train station and explode him/herself. I believe we are only relying on leads currently to spot any terrorist moves.</p>
              <p>Even at Changi Airport; security personnel board the buses to inspect; I don't think its of any use at all. A terrorist may just use a smaller bag, escape undetected and then detonate? Or the bomb explodes before the police officer can do anything? And how about terrorists taking taxi or private car to airport with a bag of explosives and enter the departure hall full of people? Similarly, the armed group of police officers patrolling the trains and train stations; I doubt its going to prevent terrorist attack from happening effectively.</p>

              <p>Yeah I agree, I wonder why youyuan did not mention it during the press interview. By saying that train fans does not condone or do illegal stuffs like the 2 vandals does not mean we should accept this kind of unrealistic and unreasonable ban.</p>

              <p>I remembered reading from earlier posts quite sometime ago that London Tube initially banned photography at train stations but was later lifted due to pressure from railway fans. But rather, I guess the London authorities realised that by banning railway photography, its not going to prevent terrorism from taking place (reasons as per my prev posts)?? Melbourne allowed train photography, provided permission is sought and a photography permit is issued. Instead, I feel that by banning for instance photography, it makes terrorists have the impression that our authorities are not confident enough to protect the public transport and still unsure about how to prevent terrorism, hence becoming so paranoid. I believe a suicide bomber need not go round and take photos and videos before attacking. He/she can jolly well walk a few times the train station to familiarise. And question is, how are our authorities going to tackle such situation??</p>
              <p>But at least the more sensible thing our authorities have done is for eg: to remove the dust bins to prevent bombs from hiding inside and installing CCTVs. And most important is to further improve intelligence gathering to thrwart terrorism, guard the borders to prevent explosives from smuggled in, tighter control on companies that deals in explosive related products and ingredients, cover up the void space under the benches, installing security grilles on overhead bridges to prevent bombs being thrown onto elevated tracks, etc.</p>
              <p>Design of train stations also play a part to help thrawt terrorism. Being spacious enough to meet pax volume, enough escape stairs/escalators to facilitate escape during emergency - maybe station control staff should have emergency buttons to reverse the direction of all escalators to facilitate escape during emergency, have simple and open train station and platform layout by minimising corners, educating public how to disarm a spotted suicide bomber???</p>
              <p>Besides public transport system, terrorists may also target crowded places such as shopping centres, exhibitions, etc.</p>

              <p>Technically yes [you are right that they are not banned], since neither SMRT website nor LTA website nor MRT entrance says no handphone with camera / DC / VCR but some of the staff took it like as if a big business that even alert police (They eat full and nothing else better to do) so it is kind of in practice, it is banned.</p>

              <p>I saw Facebook friends' pictures, some of them taken at shopping malls. I think they are not caught.</p>
