              By Azlinda Mohd Said<br><br>
              
              THE Land Transport Authority (LTA) has fined SMRT nearly $400,000 for causing severe disruption to train services betwen the Tanah Merah and Pasir Ris MRT stations on Jan 21.<br><br>
              
              Services were interrupted for seven hours and 17 minutes because one portion of a maintenance train hit another parked portion during routine maintenance works.<br><br>
              
              This happened at 3.10am on the rail section between the Tampines and Simei MRT stations. The incident immobilised one of the locomotives and a rail grinding vehicle, rendering the tracks impassable.<br><br>
              
              Normal train services resumed at 12.45pm, after the vehicles were removed.<br><br>
              
              Investigations showed that the incident was the result of SMRT not complying with operating procedures. It had not secured the parked portion of the maintenance train, made up of a locomotive and a wagon, during maintenance works.<br><br>
              
              The locomotive's parking brake was not applied and no wheel choke was placed to prevent movement along the gradient of the track, leading to the roll-back of the parked maintenance train, which then knocked into the other vehicles.<br><br>
              
              LTA takes a serious view of such disruptions as they cause inconvenience to not only train commuters but other motorists as well.<br><br>
              
              In this instance, many commuters were distressed, despite SMRT's efforts in deploying 70 buses to provide bridging services between the affected MRT stations.<br><br>
              
              That is why LTA has decided to impose a financial penalty of $387,176 on SMRT. SMRT has up to two weeks to show cause why the penalty should not be imposed.<br><br>
              
              LTA is now working with SMRT to make sure that should disruptions occur in future, commuters are updated frequently on the incident even before they reach the affected MRT stations.<br><br>
              
              Alternative transport will also be arranged in a timely manner and more effective bus bridging services will be provided during an extended service disruption.<br><br>

              <h1 class="clr">SMRT fined almost S$400,000 for 7—hour train disruption in January</h1>
              <p>SMRT will be fined almost S$400,000 for the severe disruption to its train services on 21 January.</p>
              <p>Land Transport Authority, which imposed the S$387,176 fine, has
              given SMRT up to two weeks to justify why that the penalty should not
              be imposed.</p>
              <p>The LTA concluded that the 7—hour disruption was due
              to SMRT’s working party not complying with operating procedures. This
              was specifically on securing the parked portion of the maintenance
              train, which comprised a locomotive and a wagon.</p>
              <p>According to
              operating procedures, during maintenance works, the portion comprising
              a locomotive and a RGV (Rail Grinding Vehicle) will proceed with its
              works, while the portion of the maintenance train is detached and
              parked at a distance from the working zone.</p>
              <p>However,
              investigations from LTA and SMRT showed that on 21 January, SMRT did
              not apply the locomotive’s parking brake. There was also no wheel chock
              placed to prevent movement along the gradient of the track.</p>
              <p>If SMRT had followed operating procedures, a roll—back would have been prevented.</p>
              <p>Some 57,000 MRT passengers in the eastern part of Singapore were affected by the disruption, which occurred in the morning.</p>
              <p>Train services were disrupted for seven hours and 17 minutes between Tanah Merah and Pasir Ris MRT stations. — CNA/ir</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: SMRT has asked the Land Transport Authority to review the
              S$400,000 penalty imposed, following a severe disruption to train
              services on 21 January 2008.</p>
              <p>Some 57,000 MRT passengers in the eastern part of Singapore were affected that morning.</p>
              <p>Train services between Tanah Merah and Pasir Ris MRT stations were disrupted for seven hours and 17 minutes.</p>
              <p>SMRT is requesting the review under the Licence and Operating Agreement.</p>
              <p>It
              said there is a provision for LTA to moderate the penalty amount by
              considering mitigating actions which SMRT had put in place.</p>
              <p>In a letter, SMRT said it had provided free shuttle bus services to help affected commuters.</p>
              <p>SMRT
              also mobilised more than 300 staff for on—site recovery, crowd
              management, dissemination of information and preparation for resumption
              of service.</p>
              <p>The LTA concluded that the incident was the result of SMRT not complying with operating procedures.</p>
              <p>It
              had not secured the parked portion of the maintenance train, made up of
              a locomotive and a wagon, during maintenance works. — CNA/vm</p>
