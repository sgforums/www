They don't even have the simple respect for such things, how can I respect them? As a Singaporean, I'm pretty ashamed that other Singaporeans go to such extent of complaining to the ST. I know the ST is a channel for thoughts and discussions, but not a channel for you to dump your complaints! Frankly speaking, if you do read comments after each ST Forum letter posted, you'd find that they are 500% more childish than what people here write.

If I, as a 15-year-old student, can be gracious enough to appreciate such things, why can't the rest? It only goes to show how disastrous Civics and Moral Education has been. Lucky for me, I get proper education from CME. That's why I believe in such things. Of course, the reverse applies; people who don't appreciate such things definitely have not received enough CME education.<br><br>Bah, why did I waste my time again?
