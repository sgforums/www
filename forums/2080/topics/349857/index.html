              <p>there was a train from the Southbound track crossing over into Jurong East. however, it was entering via the Eastbound platform and it is carrying passengers.</p>
              <p>at first I thought it may be a NSL train going off service. however quite some passengers on the train got off and made a dash for the Northbound train in the middle platform.</p>
              <p>at the same time, announcements were made that the train at Platform A towards Pasir Ris is not for passenger service. it was made by the CSO and not a recorded message.</p>
              <p>this puzzled me. anyone on the train here? did the train over run Bukit Batok because of the rain?</p>

              <p>I was at JE but I heard the CSO was saying the train at Platform B (towards Marina Bay) is not for passenger service and that people were dashing from PSR side platform to Marina Bay side. The train entered via NSL platform.  Did the CSO when speaking sound like as if she was pinching her nose? And if I remember correctly one of the train's carriage number was 3067 ... ....</p>
