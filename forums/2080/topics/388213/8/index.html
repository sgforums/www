              <p>RELIEF from overcrowded trains will come no later than next May, when the first five of 22 new trains are added to the rail system.</p>
              <p>They will cut waiting time by a minute on average for commuters using the North-South and East-West line during the peak period, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA) on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Elaborating on announcements made by the Prime Minister on Sunday, the LTA said more steps would be taken over the new few years to ease the situation, such as the upgrading of the signalling system and construction of new lines.</p>
              <p>PM Lee Hsien Loong mentioned the initiatives at the National Day Rally when he addressed complaints by many that the large number of foreigners now living in Singapore were responsible for the overcrowding.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee said that while the country needed foreigners to live and work here, the government was also mindful of citizens' concerns.</p>
              <p>On transport, he assured commuters that the authorities were studying the rail crunch and would do everything possible to help it, but urged patience as modifications take time.</p>

              <p>Sorry to disappoint you but as of current, during peak of peak, train are running at 24tph. And theoretically, since our system has an overhead of 150s, the max we can go is 24tph.</p>
              <p>So with the above data, we can say that "theoretically", we have already reached the theoretical maximum capacity of our system.</p>

              <p>Not possible, 50 seconds is just enough for the train to come to a complete stop and accelerate out of a ATP block. What about dwell time and "slack time"?</p>

              <p>I am under the impression that the NSEWLs uses Westinghouse ATP,which has the capability to run 37tph, according to my sources. If I am correct, most likely, what will happen is the installation of "more" ATP blocks, marked by these block boundary markers...</p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE : About 400,000 commuters in Singapore are expected to 
              be affected by the scheduled disruption of train services over two 
              weekends, due to upgrading works.
              <br> <br> The Jurong East Modification Project aims to boost passenger capacity by some 15 per cent.
              <br> <br> And when completed in May next year, passengers on the North South Line 
              and East West Line can look forward to a shorter waiting time.
              <br> <br> The first service disruption took place on Saturday morning, with no 
              services between Jurong East and Clementi stations till Monday.
              <br> <br> It wasn't the usual route for those using the East West line.
              <br> <br> Passengers travelling from Joo Koon station had to alight at Lakeside 
              station, before boarding another train to Jurong East station.
              <br> <br> Those continuing their journey to Clementi station and after had to take a free bridging shuttle service.
              <br> <br> "I did not have any problem, I knew exactly where to go. And there are people helping me," said one commuter. 
              <br> <br> "It's quite inconvenient, because we have to turn, walk a lot of rounds, and then take the buses," said another commuter. 
              <br> <br> Some weren't happy that their journey took longer than usual.
              <br> <br> "It's very far, very long, (and) very tiring," said a commuter. 
              <br> <br> "We want to go to City Hall. Instead of taking the East-West line, we 
              are taking the North South line. It's a longer route and more time 
              consuming," complained another commuter. 
              <br> <br> "We ask for the public's understanding and patience. We'll like to 
              encourage the public to use the North South line and the existing MRT 
              lines as much as possible. Currently public bus services are also 
              available," said Chua Chong Kheng, Group Director (Thomson and Existing 
              Lines), Land Transport Authority.  
              <br> <br> "And on the ground now, we have 400 over staff who are helping to manage the situation at the affected stations," he added. 
              <br> <br> Upgrading works began at about 1am on Saturday and are slated to be 
              completed by 4am on Monday, before normal service resumes at about 
              5.45am. 
              <br> <br> In the first few days following the upgrading works, commuters may 
              experience a slower train speed over the affected stretches, as the 
              system is being fine-tuned to its full performance capacity.
              <br> <br> The upgrading works have been described as a major and complex 
              operation. It involves installing turnouts to connect new tracks to the 
              existing ones at three locations. The turn outs will allow trains to 
              move from one track to another.
              <br> <br> The next service disruption will take place on the weekend of September 
              18 and 19, and will only affect passengers taking the North South line, 
              as there will be no train services between Jurong East and Bukit Batok 
              stations. - CNA /ls</span></p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Upgrading signalling system for trains to cost $1b, says SM Goh</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: It will cost the government S$1 billion to upgrade the 
              train signalling system to increase capacity and reduce waiting time for
               commuters.
              <br> <br> Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong revealed this at a dialogue session with 
              more than 200 residents from the Marine Parade ward, which he takes care
               of.
              <br> <br> The event is to gather feedback on the Prime Minister's National Day Rally.
              <br> <br> SM Goh said Singapore today is grappling with the problems of success.
              <br> <br> He said problems can be resolved rationally but noted that for every solution, there are consequences.
              <br> <br> Citing overcrowding in trains, SM Goh said the problem is expected and can be addressed.
              <br> <br> In this case, resources have to be put in place to upgrade the system.
              <br> <br> The cost may not be passed down to commuters directly, but SM Goh pointed out that it has to be defrayed.
              <br> <br> Similarly, there are consequences with measures introduced in the property sector.
              <br> <br> SM Goh acknowledged the situation has resulted in many unhappy Singaporeans, and he sought to put things in perspective.
              <br> <br> "Those who missed out, those who can't buy this, who can't upgrade and 
              so on, so we are really feeling the unhappiness, question is was the

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Confusion at 2 MRT stations</span></strong></p>
              <p>MANY commuters were caught offguard by the weekend's disruption of train services between Jurong East and Clementi MRT stations, made necessary by upgrading works at the Jurong East station.</p>
              <p>This was despite efforts by SMRT and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) in the last two weeks to alert them to it through fliers, notices and the media.</p>
              <p>When The Straits Times visited the stations on Sunday, a good number of commuters, especially the elderly and foreigners, were confused about what to do when their train would go no further. Those headed east from Joo Koon were supposed to get off at Jurong East station and take a shuttle bus to Clementi station, from where a train would take them city-ward.</p>
              <p>Likewise, those who were west-bound from Pasir Ris had to alight at Clementi and board a shuttle that would take them to the Jurong East station, from where trains ran to the last few stations on the East-West line.</p>
              <p>The free shuttle bus rides were provided as a bridging service during modification works at Jurong East, which involved laying tracks and building a passenger platform to raise commuter capacity by 15 per cent.</p>
              <p>At Jurong East station, half the commuters appeared clueless about their need to board the shuttle buses, which added up to 40 minutes to their travel time on the two</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Construction of Downtown Line 1 rail network 60% completed</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Downtown Line One rail network is 60 per 
              cent completed and excavation work at the Promenade Station in Marina 
              Bay is 40 per cent completed.
              <br> <br> Constructions works for the Downtown Line One rail network began in 2008 and is expected to complete in 2013. 
              <br> <br> Upon completion, the Promenade Station, which will serve commuters in 
              the Marina Bay area, will be Singapore's deepest train station at about 
              15 storeys below ground. 
              <br> <br> The station will intersect with the existing Circle Line rail network 
              and the complexity of the construction works have posed several 
              engineering challenges.
              <br> <br> Sim Wee Meng, group director, Rail, Land Transport Authority, said: 
              "Promenade Station is going to be a interchange station with Promenade 
              Circle Line station. [The location] where we are building part of the 
              station wall is going to built below the current existing station subway
               so the height that pose to us is a very low height. In terms of that, 
              we have to bring in special machinery."
              <br> <br> A $10-million, 500-tonne Tunnel Boring Machine has been used to pave the
               way underground at a rate of six metres a day for the future Downtown 
              Line route.
              <br> <br> The Land Transport Authority has also put stringent measures in place 
              that exceed legal requirements to ensure the safety of workers.
              <br> <br> The lifting machines on the site are inspected on a half-yearly basis compared to the yearly inspections required by the law.
              <br> <br> Hawazi Daipi, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Manpower &amp; Health, 
              said: "For this kind of work, where heavy equipment is used, workers are
               working in deep tunnels as well as deep underground; safety is most 
              critical.
              <br> <br> "Well we have learnt from past mistakes I observed and a lot of measures
               have been taken to ensure that the workers' safety is taken very, very 
              seriously."
              <br> <br> In 2004, an underground tunnel collapsed during the Circle Line's construction at Nicoll Highway, killing four people.
              <br> <br> Some 50 delegates from across the region visited the Promenade station construction site on Tuesday.
              <br> <br> They were here ahead of the inaugural Singapore Workplace Safety and Health Conference, which will begin on September 15.
              <br> <br> The station is on track to be finished in 2013.
              <br> <br> Work on Downtown Line 2 has also started while contracts for Downtown Line 3 are out on tender.
              <br> <br> The rail network is scheduled to open in phases from 2013. - CNA/fa</span></p>

              <p>As far as what I heard from Dragonaxe, there are gonna to build a new crossover from Bayfront - Esplanade / Esplanade - Bayfront without via Promenade and not the straight (The opposite platform from current CCL) + turn (From current CCL platform) style.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is why he feels that there is high chance of alternating trains in Marina Bay to go Harbourfront and Dhoby Ghaut. (Hence, it has to be alternate trains from Dhoby Ghaut to Marina Bay and Dhoby Ghaut to Harbourfront)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But personally, I think that crossover is not gonna to do passenger service, because:</p>
              <p>1: 40 trains is definitely not enough to meet the frequency of 3 mins ~ 5 mins (I think so). (In peak hours where SWT are involved, even this alternate trains comes one in 7 mins, I doubt there is enough of them to do SWT. Anyway, it should be enough if they "maintain" in this frequency, meaning every 7mins one train in platform, but with this alternating schedule, it becomes every 14mins a DBG or MRB bound train and one waits for 3 ~ 7 mins for another train in Promenade.)</p>
              <p>2: For Marina Bay - Dhoby Ghaut, we have straight NSL trains. Like that how to decide should take NSL or CCL. (NSL should be faster still)</p>

              <p>That cross-over I was referring to is tracks intersecting with each other, without diverting to the other track. It's like an X or something.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LTA  and SMRT to intensify publicity on weekend train disruption</strong></span></p>
              <p id="articlecontent"><span>SINGAPORE: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) and Singapore Mass 
              Rapid Transit (SMRT) are intensifying their publicity outreach in 
              preparation for the train service disruption this weekend between Jurong
               East and Bukit Batok stations.
              <br> <br> The section will not be in service due to works on the Jurong East Modification Project at Jurong East Station.
              <br> <br> LTA officers had already made house-to-house visits to over 1,000 residents and 600 households in Jurong East.
              <br> <br> Grassroots leaders will join LTA officers once again on Friday, 
              September 17, to distribute flyers at Jurong East and Bukit Batok 
              Stations.
              <br> <br> This followed feedback that some commuters were not aware of the service
               disruption between Jurong East and Clementi stations two weekends ago 
              despite the publicity.
              <br> <br> This time round, LTA and SMRT said more prominent directional signs will
               be put up at strategic locations of the affected stations.
              <br> <br> Staff will also be deployed onboard the trains as well to provide assistance to commuters and attend to their queries. 
              <br> <br> The queue formation for bus bridging services at Jurong East Station 
              will be adjusted for smoother passenger flow and to facilitate faster 
              boarding.
              <br> <br> There will also be priority boarding for the elderly and the young.
              <br> <br> The Jurong East Modification Project will improve train frequency for 
              the North-South-East-West Line from the current six to eight minutes to 
              4.5 minutes over the weekend all day. - CNA/fa</span></p>
