              Northern Singapore</span></strong></p>
              <p>A 15-MINUTE power failure which hit the northern parts of
              Singapore disrupted train services and retail businesses on
              Thursday afternoon.</p>
              <p>The outage, which lasted from about 1.30 pm to 1.45 pm, halted
              some trains in the Ang Mo Kio and Bishan areas as the doors could
              not open properly.</p>
              <p>Shops had to resort to manual practices as their cash machines
              stopped working and shoppers could not use their credit cards to
              pay.</p>
              <p>Said a sales assistant of a shoe shop in Junction 8 shopping
              mall at Bishan: 'We had some customers in the shop when the
              blackout hit us. Our cash machine couldn't work so we had to write
              out invoices and make the customers pay in cash.'</p>
              <p>Singapore Power is investigating the cause.</p>

              <p>A BRIEF power cut in the early afternoon caused confusion in the Ang Mo Kio and Bishan areas on Thursday when it affected trains, shopping malls, homes, schools and industrial buildings.</p>
              <p>A cable fault had caused a trip in the electrical supply, according to preliminary findings, said SP Powergrid. It did not specify which areas were affected.</p>
              <p>The 15-minute disruption between 1.30pm and 1.45pm, stalled 17 trains between Orchard and Marsiling on the North-South Line.</p>
              <p>Backup emergency power had to be triggered for emergency lighting and ventilation inside the trains, some of which had stopped in the tunnels between stations, said SMRT.</p>
              <p>At 13 stations between Newton and Marsiling, there was no train service.</p>
              <p>At five underground stations, the air-conditioning stopped and emergency lighting had to be provided.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>S$60b to be spent over next decade to double S'pore rail network</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore will spend S$60 billion over the next decade 
              to double the rail network, Prime Minister Lee said at his National Day 
              Rally speech on Sunday.
              <br> <br> He said this will involve the Downtown Line, Thomson Line and Eastern Region Line.
              <br> <br> Mr Lee said he understands the congestion problems commuters face, especially during morning peak periods.
              <br> <br> He said the Circle Line has helped improve the situation, and more will 
              be done, including running an extra train during peak hour on the 
              North-East Line by next year.
              <br> <br> Also, more trains <strong>(NEL</strong>) will be bought and systems upgraded <strong>(EWL &amp; NSL)</strong> to cope with expected traffic growth.
              <br> <br> He said the government is doing everything possible to improve things, 
              but he hopes Singaporeans can understand that MRT trains will always be 
              packed during peak traffic. 
              <br> <br> "(Such a situation) happens in all cities. Please be patient. (It's) not
               possible to guarantee that every passenger can get onto every first 
              train, but the next train will just be a few minutes away," he said. </span></p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LTA to upgrade train signalling system</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) said the upgrading 
              of the train signalling system will result in shorter waiting times for 
              commuters and a 20 per cent improvement to its existing capacity.
              <br> <br> It said the upgrading, which will start next year, applies to the North-South and East-West lines.
              <br> <br> Plans to further enhance the rail network were first revealed by Prime 
              Minister Lee Hsien Loong last Sunday during his National Day Rally.
              <br> <br> Among the plans announced were the Jurong East Modification project, which is targeted for completion in May 2011. 
              <br> <br> LTA said by 2012, the North-South/East-West line capacity is expected to
               increase by about 15 per cent and with the modification, commuters 
              would be able to enjoy a shorter waiting time of between two and three 
              minutes. 
              <br> <br> The current waiting time during peak periods is 2.5 to 4.5 minutes.
              <br> <br> Singapore's rail network will be expanded and upgraded over the next 10 
              years to cater to the increased demand in commuter travel.
              <br> <br> The current train signalling system on the North-South and East-West train lines have been operational since 1987.
              <br> <br> LTA said it was time to improve its performance.
              <br> <br> "Due to obsolesce of components and parts as well as need for 
              improvements in performance, we have to do the upgrading," Land 
              Transport Authority group director (rail) Chua Chong Kheng said. 
              <br> <br> "We are going to take advantage of this upgrading exercise to further improve on the headways we currently have. 
              <br> <br> "The current headways are 120 seconds based on the current signalling 
              system and we are aiming to reduce that to 100 seconds with the new 
              signalling," Mr Chua said.
              <br> <br> As part of the upgrading programme, LTA also wants to improve the 
              trains' operational headway, which is the time between two trains 
              arriving at a station.
              <br> <br> Trains now run at intervals of 120 seconds at peak periods.
              <br> <br> LTA's target is to bring this down to 100 seconds in order to cater to increasing passenger load.
              <br> <br> "Train loadings are increasing as we saw the trend and so we will need 
              to take proactive steps and measures and this is one of the things, we 
              are looking ahead," Mr Chua said. 
              <br> <br> "(The) current system may be bearable, but certainly we don't want to 
              wait for things to happen before we start to do anything," he said. 
              <br> <br> So the upgrading process will involve replacing equipment on nearly 120 
              existing trains, along the trackside, at the stations and operations 
              control room. 
              <br> <br> Upgrading the signalling system on a line which is already operational is a complex process the LTA said. 
              <br> <br> So work on the North-South Line and East-West line will be carried out in stages. 
              <br> <br> Work on the North-South line will be completed in six years' time and the East-West line two years later. 
              <br> <br> LTA also assures that all safety precautions will be taken when the works are being done.
              <br> <br> "Obviously we want to do this work without any disruptions to the operations," Mr Chua said. 
              <br> <br> "In this instance we will work within the existing railway and do our best not to affect the operational railway." 
              <br> <br> This means upgrading works can only take place after the trains have stopped running for the day.
              <br> <br> LTA said more trains would also be ordered for the North-South and East West lines.
              <br> <br> Meanwhile , the Circle Line from Marymount Station to Harbourfront is scheduled to open next year.
              <br> <br> It will provide an alternative route for commuters to the city and will 
              reduce loading along the Toa Payoh to Novena sector by 10 to 15 per 
              cent.

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Train commuters looking forward to better travelling experience</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Commuters say they are looking forward to a better 
              travelling experience on trains following plans to expand and upgrade 
              the rail network.
              <br> <br> However, some hope that the plans like the upgrading of the train signalling system can be rolled out earlier.
              <br> <br> Overcrowding is one issue that the upgraded train signalling system, to be fully completed in eight years, is hoping to address.
              <br> <br> More trains will be added, while commuters can look forward to saving 
              some 20 seconds of waiting during peak periods on the North-South and 
              East-West lines.
              <br> <br> A commuter said: "Less traffic, less crowded trains, and I will be able to board the train on my first try."
              <br> <br> Another said: "In six to eight years, I will be working, so I will be 
              probably be taking the transport, so it will be beneficial for me."
              <br> <br> "I don't mind waiting six to eight years, for an improved train system," a third added. 
              <br> <br> However, others are hoping the upgraded system will be rolled out earlier.
              <br> <br> "I think they should make it faster, because the issue now is quite 
              immediate because you can see during peak hours, a lot of people just 
              cannot get up on the train," one of them said.
              <br> <br> "I just hope they will accommodate the growing population, which is now 
              five million, and well in eight years, the population will probably grow
               further," another said.
              <br> <br> The Land Transport Authority and public transport operators say they are
               mindful of the increasing travel demand on the rail network. And they 
              are doing all they can to increase rail capacity to improve the overall 
              travel experience for commuters.
              <br> <br> And some commuters say they too have a part to play. One of them said: 
              "Some of them (the passengers) just cannot be bothered to move in." 
              Another added: "Everyone just gets blocked at the entrance."
              <br> <br> Experts say there is a limit to boosting capacity on train systems.
              <br> <br> Associate Professor Lee Der Horng, Department of Civil Engineering, 
              National University of Singapore, said: "For the street traffic, we can 
              actually shorten the time between each vehicle to some very minimum 
              distance.
              <br> <br> "But in the MRT environment, we cannot really do this because we will 
              have to consider the safety issue. Safety can become a constraint to the
               overall system capacity. But we cannot compromise."
              <br> <br> Similar upgrading projects like the Victoria Line in London will take 
              some nine years to complete. Even then the trains there will take 10 
              seconds longer to arrive compared to Singapore.
              <br> <br> LTA said an additional train will also be added for the North East Line 
              (NEL) during peak hours next year. More trains will also be purchased to
               boost capacity and reduce loading on the NEL.
              <br> <br> The trains will be delivered in four to five year's time. LTA added that
               it expects to progressively increase the peak capacity by some 50 per 
              cent for the NEL.

              need to take proactive steps and measures and this is one of the
              things, we are looking ahead," Mr Chua said.<br> <br> "(The) current system may be bearable, but certainly we don't want
              to wait for things to happen before we start to do anything," he
              said.<br> <br> So the upgrading process will involve replacing equipment on nearly
              120 existing trains, along the trackside, at the stations and
              operations control room.<br> <br> Upgrading the signalling system on a line which is already
              operational is a complex process the LTA said.<br> <br> So work on the North-South Line and East-West line will be carried
              out in stages.<br> <br> Work on the North-South line will be completed in six years' time
              and the East-West line two years later.<br> <br> LTA also assures that all safety precautions will be taken when the
              works are being done.<br> <br> "Obviously we want to do this work without any disruptions to the
              operations," Mr Chua said.<br> <br> "In this instance we will work within the existing railway and do
              our best not to affect the operational railway."<br> <br> This means upgrading works can only take place after the trains
              have stopped running for the day.<br> <br> LTA said more trains would also be ordered for the North-South and
              East West lines.<br> <br> Meanwhile , the Circle Line from Marymount Station to Harbourfront
              is scheduled to open next year.<br> <br> It will provide an alternative route for commuters to the city and
              will reduce loading along the Toa Payoh to Novena sector by 10 to
              15 per cent.<br> <br> -CNA/wk</span></p>

              <p>1 extra service train...... Today zaobao say  NEL got 25 trains with 22 of them are used in daily operations. So, it is like wth, why cant have 3 extra trains, before the arrival of new trains.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Regarding <a href="/forums/2080/topics/409878">some sources</a> that says SKD can have 15 more trains, I expect that LTA will have to buy 15 trains and not 12 or 13 trains for NEL because they usually buy in bulks and cannot be like ordering 1 train 2 train thingy (C151A cost LTA $369 million for <strong>22</strong> trains, if they just buy 1 or 2 train, they are likely to get less than $40 million --- which is = eating "North West Wind", do what business). If they actually buy 7 ~ 8 trains only, then it might not able to reach increasing the capacity by 50% without using the reserve / maintenance train.</p>

              <p>I see, I thought that it is like upgrading a computer with "512MB RAM to say 1GB RAM" which is like whats the point and "why not change the motherboard etc such that the RAM can go more than 4GB".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, I think if I am not wrong, the LTA claim of 120s is saying <strong>near 120s</strong> and not = to 120s. And may I know how did you find out that our system is actually has an overhead of 150s?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On a side note, based on your attached image, does that mean that Japan train has a maximum frequency of 1 minute or even 30 seconds per train?</p>
