              <p><strong>Smoother, faster peak-hour ride for most commuters of new Circle Line 
              stations</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : A smoother and faster ride - that was what most 
              commuters said of the new Circle Line stations during the morning peak 
              hours on Monday. 
              <br> <br> But still, there were some who were not sure where to go, especially at 
              the interchanges. 
              <br> <br> Though some were not familiar with the station layout, most had a smooth
               trip, and saved time ad money.
              <br> <br> "The morning crowd is crazy if you are taking the red line but if you 
              take this Circle Line, it is really a lot better," said one commuter.  
              <br> <br> "It is pretty good. I am surprised that it is not too crowded even 
              during peak hours. It is comfortable, and I don't really feel the 
              congestion," said another commuter.  
              <br> <br> SMRT has put up signs to make sure commuters do not board the wrong 
              train. 
              <br> <br> It will park 16 service ambassadors at the interchanges this week to 
              help with directions.  
              <br> <br> "The first and second day was a bit confusing, and people are curious...
               Today, it's bit more under control," said Service Ambassador Pamela 
              Chin. 
              <br> <br> One station that was particularly confusing, according to feedback from 
              commuters over the weekend, was the Promenade Station. 
              <br> <br> Train platforms are located on top of each other, instead of side by 
              side.
              <br> <br> "The Promenade Station is designed to be an interchange, hence you see 
              the two-level platforms, similar to what you have in City Hall and 
              Raffles Place. Passengers will be familiar with it after a couple of 
              travels but in the meantime, we have put in additional signs and 
              messages to guide them to the correct platform," said Chia Chun Wah, 
              deputy director of SMRT.  
              <br> <br> The 16 Circle Line stations that have been opened so far are expected to
               serve some 200,000 passengers daily. - CNA /ls</span></p>

              <p>I'll roughly translate it out then.</p>
              <p>"Singapore has train fans who enjoys taking photos of trains and sharing them with other train fans online. This has made the public worried.</p>
              <p>In this discussion room for Singapore Trains, it congregated many train fans who likes taking media of trains</p>
              <p>As known from 'Lianhe Wanbao', these train fans like to take photos of exterior and interior of train advertisements, and share it with other train fans on the discussion board.</p>
              <p>They also compared trains from last time and the ones currently, which brought back memories of Singapore's transport system.</p>
              <p>However, on 29th March, Russia's capital Moscow had 2 metro trains packed with people bombed, which caused 39 deaths and almost 70 injuries.</p>
              <p>MRT stations are now again the the focus of terrorists, which caused the MRT system to raise its security even more.</p>
              <p>Some members of the public worry, if people take media of trains within MRT stations, would the security be affected? Would terrorists find out anything from those media that makes it easier for bombings?</p>
              <p>One of the train fans within the discussion board, posted a notice 2 days after the incident, warning them to refrain from taking train videos and photos, that's because 'if you get caught (from taking photos and videos of trains), you may not be let off easily like all other times. You may even be arrested immidiately.'</p>
              <p>The moderator of the discussion board also stated 'If you still want to take photos and videos of trains, take them at your own risk. Tou can continue to post your pictures and videos of trains, however.'</p>
              <p>Many of the train fans felt disappointed after reading the notice. Someone asked, 'When will security here be loosen? Not being able to take photos and videos of trains make us sad.' "</p>
              <p>May not be accurate, but at least gives you a summary about the article.</p>

              <p>TRAIN operator SMRT is investigating a complaint that a door on one 
              of its new Circle Line trains opened while it was travelling between 
              stations.</p>
              <p>A passenger, who wanted to be known only as Miss E. Goh, 19,
               said the incident occurred on Saturday afternoon - the first day of 
              operations for 11 newly opened Circle Line stations.</p>
              <p>The teaching assistant said she was travelling on a train 
              heading from Paya Lebar station towards Bishan station when the carriage
               door behind her opened, creating a gap of about 30cm.</p>
              <p>Miss Goh, who was with a few friends, said the door stayed 
              open for a few seconds. 'We didn't scream because we were more in shock 
              than anything else,' she said.</p>
              <p>'All I could say was, 'Oh my God, the door is open',' said 
              the teenager, who was headed to a concert at Republic Polytechnic in 
              Woodlands.</p>
              <p>She added that after a few seconds, a friend pulled the door
               shut.</p>

              <p><strong>SMRT sees increased train ridership during 1st weekend opening of Marina
               Bay Sands</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The first weekend opening of Singapore's second 
              integrated resort has led to an increase in traffic flow to the downtown
               Marina Bay area.
              <br> <br> SMRT saw a ten to 15 per cent jump in ridership at the Promenade Station
               while businesses in the area are looking forward to more customers.
              <br> <br> Many visitors hoping to check out Singapore's latest downtown attraction
               opted to get there by public transport and SMRT said it's taking 
              measures to ensure that passenger needs are swiftly attended to.
              <br> <br> Chia Chun Wah, deputy director of Station Operations, SMRT, said: "We 
              are increasing our staff on duty for the three stations Raffles, Marina 
              Bay and Promenade.”
              <br> <br> Most passengers ask for directions to the Helix Bridge which leads to 
              the integrated resort.
              <br> <br> Ahmad Sulaiman, manager, Promenade Station, said: "We're giving them 
              pamphlets and we have staff to direct them to the location."
              <br> <br> With only 35 out of the 300 stores open at Marina Bay Sands, visitors 
              head to the nearby shopping centres and restaurants.
              <br> <br> One restaurant at the Esplanade has seen more customers streaming in 
              since Friday and expects a 15 per cent increase in customers this 
              weekend.
              <br> <br> Shireen Khoo, business development manager, Simply Peranakan, said: 
              "During their conversation, the customers say they have no time and they
               ask us to serve them quickly because they have to go to Sands for a 
              walk."
              <br> <br> For now, Ms Khoo said there are no plans to introduce special promotions
               to draw in more MBS visitors.
              <br> <br> But the restaurant may do something to coincide with the F1 race in 
              September.
              <br> <br> Businesses at the One Fullerton which include restaurants and pubs said 
              they're also hoping for a spillover effect from the resort's opening. 
              <br> <br> However, most of them said it's still too early to tell if there will be
               a noticeable increase in customers and they're adopting a wait-and-see 
              approach before deciding if special promotions or an increase in 
              manpower is needed.  - CNA/vm </span></p>

              <p><strong>April 23 rail incident among "more major" 
              disruptions: SMRT</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The lightning strike on the Bukit Panjang light rail 
              transit network nearly two weeks ago, was one of several that have 
              disrupted rail services in the last decade. And it was one of the more 
              major incidents, damaging the power equipment of one of the trains, 
              according to operator SMRT.
              <br> <br> But lightning strikes don't always spell bad news for commuters, 
              according to a lightning protection expert.
              <br> <br> This is because of the lightning protection devices in place, which 
              could reduce potential damage by 90 per cent, said Professor Liew Ah 
              Choy, an electrical and computer engineering don at the National 
              University of Singapore. 
              <br> <br> This means that in 10 instances of a lightning strike, only one incident
               would cause service disruption.
              <br> <br> The devices include lightning protection tape on the rails and surge 
              arresters to limit potential damage to the rail network's electronic 
              systems.
              <br> <br> The tape safeguards against direct strikes on the rail. "When the 
              lightning current gets injected into the lightning protection tape, 
              there will be a large voltage rise and a lot of current flowing, and a 
              very large magnetic field generated," explained Professor Liew. 
              <br> <br> The "very high" voltages induced by lightning vary from several 
              kilovolts to 100 kilovolts, and can cause power failure. 
              <br> <br> But in some instances, the surge arresters are able to limit the voltage
               values so that no damage is caused, said Prof Liew.
              <br> <br> While no lightning protection safeguard is fail-proof, Singapore has 
              done a good job of minimising the frequency of disruption, he said. 
              <br> <br> Since the Bukit Panjang LRT system began operations in 1999, there have 
              been three instance of delays caused by power surges, said Mr Tay Tien 
              Seng, SMRT's light rail operations director.
              <br> <br> In the April 23 incident, engineers managed to get one of the trains 
              functioning again, while a rescue train was sent to push the second 
              defective train to the nearest station. 
              <br> <br> About 100 passengers were on the two trains, but none was in danger at 
              any time during the incident, said SMRT in a statement after the 
              incident.
              <br> <br> However, a 60-year-old Bukit Panjang resident, Mr Chen, who was affected
               by the disruption, said station staff could have done more to prevent 
              would-be passengers from scanning their cards and heading up to the 
              train platform.
              <br> <br> Had there not been a thunderstorm, passengers could have got off the 
              train and walked on the track to the nearest station, said Mr Tay. 
              <br> <br> They would have walked a safe middle passage flanked by the train 
              tracks.
              <br> <br> Meanwhile, last month's disruption also threw up another interesting 
              statistic. 
              <br> <br> Three other lightning-induced train disruptions reported in the media 
              since 2001 have also occurred in April - one of the months with the most
               thunder days alongside May and November/December, according to 
              statistics from the National Environment Agency.  - CNA/vm

               and Tanah Merah for about an hour on Friday afternoon. This was due to a
               track incident at Bedok Station.
              <br> <br> About 6,500 commuters were affected when a 54-year-old man was hit by a 
              train at around 1.45pm.
              <br> <br> Callers to MediaCorp's news hotline said the man jumped onto the tracks 
              when the train was approaching.
              <br> <br> The driver, who saw the incident, will be given counselling and a few 
              days to recover from the trauma.
              <br> <br> All train services resumed at about 3pm.
              <br> <br> Twenty-four free bus bridging services were deployed for commuters 
              affected by the disruption.
              <br> <br> Passengers who could not complete their journeys can get a full fare
