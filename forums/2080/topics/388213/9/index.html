              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LTA and SMRT
              to intensify publicity on weekend train
              disruption</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) and
              Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT) are intensifying their
              publicity outreach in preparation for the train service disruption
              this weekend between Jurong East and Bukit Batok stations.<br> <br> The section will not be in service due to works on the Jurong East
              Modification Project at Jurong East Station.<br> <br> LTA officers had already made house-to-house visits to over 1,000
              residents and 600 households in Jurong East.<br> <br> Grassroots leaders will join LTA officers once again on Friday,
              September 17, to distribute flyers at Jurong East and Bukit Batok
              Stations.<br> <br> This followed feedback that some commuters were not aware of the
              service disruption between Jurong East and Clementi stations two
              weekends ago despite the publicity.<br> <br> This time round, LTA and SMRT said more prominent directional signs
              will be put up at strategic locations of the affected
              stations.<br> <br> <strong>Staff will also be deployed onboard the trains as well to provide
              assistance to commuters and attend to their queries.</strong><br> <br> The queue formation for bus bridging services at Jurong East
              Station will be adjusted for smoother passenger flow and to
              facilitate faster boarding.<br> <br> There will also be priority boarding for the elderly and the
              young.<br> <br> The Jurong East Modification Project will improve train frequency
              for the North-South-East-West Line from the current six to eight
              minutes to 4.5 minutes over the weekend all day. -

              <p>So now then they decide to use D-ATC and according to the
              article, it will only be fully operational by around
              2016 for NSL.</p>
              <p>Let's see, D-ATC is fully operational on Yamanote Line
              in 2005. So looking at this, we are about 10 years behind in terms
              of railway technology...</p>
              <p>But nevertheless, choosing D-ATC as the new signalling
              system is an excellent choice.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The new MRT jingle debate</span></strong></p>
              <p>TRAIN is coming, train is coming...</p>
              <p>You would have heard this new message over the public announcement system in MRT stations across the island, if you are a frequent train commuter.</p>
              <p>The new jingle, sung by the Dim Sum Dollies, is a campaign by SMRT to promote gracious behaviour on trains. But is it refreshing or simply annoying? Commuters were quick to comment on how they feel about it.</p>
              <p>The railway track opposite a condominium in Hillview could have used the new warning announcement. A woman's body was found on the tracks on September 7th.</p>
              <p>That was not the only transport related accident in Singapore last week.</p>
              <p>Citizen journalists sent in reports of accidents occurring all over the island - from Potong Pasir to Choa Chu Kang, and the CTE to the TPE.</p>
              <p>An incident that was definitely no accident was the September 7th S-League match between the Young Lions and Beijing Guoan, which turned from football to 'footbrawl' and ended in a chaotic free-for-all on at the Jalan Besar Stadium.</p>

              <p>I am sorry but I don't really get what you meant.</p>
              <p>If you meant "What is the warning distance if a train is 65m from the train in front?", here's the answer;</p>
              <p>The train enters a YY block which has a speed limit of 25km/h when it is about 120m~180m from the train in front. Failure to adhere to this speed limit will result in EB being applied to bring the train to a complete stop. A warning is given at about 20~40m before the block. Failure to heed the warning will result in EB being applied to bring the train to a complete stop.</p>
              <p>At about 50m from the train in front, there is a point which has a speed limit of 15km/h. Failure to adhere to this speed limit will result in EB being applied to bring the train to a complete stop. A warning is given at about 20m before this point. Failure to heed the warning will result in EB being applied to bring the train to a complete stop.</p>
              <p>At about 20m from the train in front, there is a point which has a speed limit of 7.5km/h which will gradually decreased to 0km/h. Failure to adhere to this speed limit will result in EB being applied to bring the train to a complete stop. A warning is given at about 10m before this point. Failure to heed the warning will result in EB being applied to bring the train to a complete stop.</p>
              <p>The end of the block is about 5~10m from the train in front. If the train has proceed beyond the end of the block, EB will be applied to bring the train to a complete stop. The train will normally come into a complete stop within 4m.</p>
              <p>To "answer" the warning, the driver has to apply brake accordingly to keep the train's speed below the speed limit imposed before it reaches any of the point/block. A visual marking/signal can be seen to denote the position of each points/block.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: A southbound train service from Yishun to Ang Mo Kio MRT stations was disrupted in the early hours of Sunday when a passenger on the track was hit by a train pulling into Khatib MRT Station.</p>
              <p>As a result of the incident at around 12.45am on September 19, passengers on the last four southbound trains for the day were unable to continue their journey.</p>
              <p>SMRT said it activated bus bridging service to ferry affected passengers from Yishun MRT Station to Khatib, Yio Chu Kang and Ang Mo Kio stations, where these trains were scheduled to end service. About 50 passengers were affected.</p>
              <p>Passengers who were unable to complete their journeys due to the disruption can claim a full fare refund from the Passenger Service Centre in any of the 69 SMRT stations within the next three working days.</p>

              <p><strong>(Malaysia) Govt to form panel to discuss Rapid Transit System with Singapore</strong></p>
              <p>The Government will form a committee comprising personnel from the Economic Planning Unit, Treasury and Johor government to discuss the Rapid Transit System (RTS) with Singapore.</p>
              <p>Transport Minister Datuk Seri Kong Cho Ha said Malaysia and Singapore had reached a bilateral agreement to jointly develop the light rail system during a meeting between Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak and his Singapore counterpart Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
              <p>He said the committee members would first hold intensive discussions on the development of the RTS among themselves before meeting with the Singapore side.</p>
              <p>“The discussions will include the type of RTS that we are going to use; whether to build a bridge across the Straits of Johor or build a causeway, or an expensive underground tunnel that has minimum effect on the environment.</p>
              <p>“We have some of the options, we still have to sit down to discuss and come out with an agreement on how to jointly develop it,” he said at a press conference after attending a ministry Hari Raya open house yesterday.</p>
              <p>Kong said no budget had been worked out so far, adding that both countries would have to work together on the cost considerations.</p>
              <p>He said the 1.5km rail system connecting Johor Baru and Woodlands was expected to be completed by 2018 as part of efforts to “increase connectivity” between the two countries.</p>
              <p>He said Malaysia had identified a plot of land in Tanjung Puteri to build the rail station.</p>
              <p>On the relocation of the 78-year-old Tanjong Pagar railway station operated by KTMB, the minister said the station would be moving to its new site in Woodlands by July 2011, while the current station would be turned into a heritage site.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">CCL from Dhoby Ghaut to Bartley is 11-kilometre long comprising 11 stations - Dhoby Ghaut, Bras Basah, Esplanade, Promenade, Nicoll Highway, Stadium, Mountbatten, Dakota, Paya Lebar, MacPherson and Tai Seng.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">With Paya Lebar Interchange Station joining CCL to the existing East-West Line, passengers travelling from the eastern parts of Singapore can now bypass the busy City Hall and Raffles Place interchanges to get to the city and northern parts of Singapore. The same holds true for those travelling from the north and north-east commuting to the city and the eastern part of the island.</span></p>
