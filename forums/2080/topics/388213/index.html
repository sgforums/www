              <p><strong>Resorts World Sentosa prepares for visitors ahead of Jan 20 hotel openings:</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Public bookings for Resorts World Sentosa hotels opened on Monday and more than 3,300 enquiries poured in.
              <br> <br> Some 300 reservations were made on the first day of bookings as people took advantage of discounted opening rates.
              <br> <br> The hotels are set to open to the public on January 20.
              <br> <br> To help ensure smooth visitor arrivals at the integrated resort, taxi
              drivers were given a drive-through tour of the three main drop-off
              spots.
              <br> <br>"This is a new place for us... so the orientation benefitted us,"
              said a taxi driver. "Passengers want to come to this hotel. Like Hard
              Rock Hotel and Festive Hotel. So (now) we know where it is."
              <br> <br>There are three taxi drop-off points at the integrated resort,
              which are near to attractions such as the Universal Studios Singapore
              theme park and the casino.
              <br> <br> Apart from cars and taxis, visitors can also hop onboard buses and trains to reach the integrated resort. 
              <br> <br>Robin Goh, spokesperson for Resorts World Sentosa, said: "The most
              cost-effective and convenient (way to travel) would be public transport
              so visitors can choose either taking a bus – the Sentosa bus – to
              Sentosa... <strong>or they could actually hop on the Sentosa Express and get
              off at the first station called the Waterfront Station</strong>." <br> <br> <strong>The station will open on January 20, </strong>providing the integrated resort with an integrated transport solution<strong>.</strong></span></p>

              <br> <br> Transport Minister Raymond Lim made this announcement after a station

              <p><strong>Next phase of Circle Line to open on Apr 17</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The second phase of the Circle Line will open to
                   
                      passengers on April 17. The 11-station stretch, from Bartley to 
                  Dhoby 
                      Ghaut stations, will start operations almost a year after the first 
                  five
                       stations were opened to the public last May. 
                      <br> <br> With this new opening, about half the Circle Line or about
                   16 stations 
                      will connect commuters to places like the new Sports Hub through 
                  Stadium
                       Station, to Suntec via Promenade Station and the museums via Bras 
                  Basah
                       Station. 
                      <br> <br> Transport Minister Raymond Lim said: "This is a 
                  significant thing for us
                       because now you have these direct connections. So if you are on the
                   
                      eastern side, north-eastern side, you have a direct line that 
                  connects 
                      you instead of having to go to the city centre." 
                      <br> <br> So a commuter going from, say, interchange station Paya 
                  Lebar to Bishan 
                      can shave off about 18 minutes or half his travelling time, said the
                   
                      Land Transport Authority. Commuters can bypass the busy City Hall 
                  and 
                      Raffles Place stations.
                      <br> <br> Building the Paya Lebar Station was not easy. One of the 
                  challenges that
                       engineers faced in building this interchange station was that they 
                  had 
                      to connect an underground line to an existing above ground station. 
                      <br> <br> For commuters who also had to endure congestion during 
                  road diversions, 
                      the opening has been welcomed. 
                      <br> <br> Said one man in the street: "The transportation was very 
                  bad and there 
                      used to have jams all over and time taken from one place to another 
                  was 
                      very bad. Now of course, there are a lot of changes." 
                      <br> <br> "It saves time, like when we are rushing to meet friends 
                  and family, it 
                      will be much more better," said another commuter. 
                      <br> <br> Transport authorities now expect the Circle Line ridership
                   to spike to 
                      about 200,000 daily. 
                      <br> <br> Also operating will be the station that caused a delay to 
                  the opening of
                       the Circle Line when the site at Nicoll Highway collapsed. 
                      <br> <br> Sim Wee Meng, group director, Rail, Land Transport 
                  Authority, said: 
                      "Nicoll Highway, we have built at the new site which is 100 metres 
                  away 
                      from existing site. It's now completed and will open as part of 
                  Circle 
                      Line 1 &amp; 2." 
                      <br> <br> As for the possibility of bus rationalisation, Mr Lim 
                  said: "The LTA 
                      will have to work with the operators to see whether they need to 
                      streamline any of the services in order to feed into the Circle 
                  Line." 
                      <br> <br> The final phase of the Circle Line, which will link up the
                   western parts
                       of Singapore to the line with stops in places like Botanic Gardens 
                  and 
                      Holland Village, is expected to be ready next year.     - CNA/vm</span></p>

                               stays
                              and works in Mountbatten, is ecstatic about the impending 
                      opening of the
                               new CCL
                              segment. Ms Teo is pursuing a part-time diploma at an 
                      educational 
                              institute in
                              Queenstown and currently takes the bus to connect to the

                              go
                              for my studies. With CCL, I can take my time and still won't be 
                      late for
                              classes!" said Ms Teo.</span></p>
