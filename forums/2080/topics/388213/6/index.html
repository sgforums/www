              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SMRT to add over 300 more train trips for YOG opening, closing ceremonies</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: SMRT says it will add over 300 more train trips on 
              August 14 and 26 - the opening and closing ceremonies of the Youth 
              Olympic Games - to bring spectators and participants home after the 
              events.
              <br> <br> For the Opening Ceremony on Saturday, close to 200 train trips will be 
              added along the North-South, East-West and Circle Lines after 10pm to 
              shorten waiting time.
              <br> <br> Train services will also be extended that day, with the last northbound,
               eastbound and westbound trains leaving City Hall MRT Station at 1.30am.
               
              <br> <br> The last trains towards Dhoby Ghaut and Marymount on the Circle Line 
              will be adjusted accordingly, to allow commuters to make their transfers
               at Bishan interchange station.
              <br> <br> Likewise, the last Bukit Panjang LRT trains will be adjusted to allow 
              commuters to make their transfers from Choa Chu Kang MRT Station. 
              <br> <br> For the Closing Ceremony on August 26, more than 100 train trips will be
               added on the North-South, East-West and Circle Lines after 9.30pm.

              <p id="articlecontent"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Circle Line fare anomalies?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: It is a fare conundrum that has caused some train 
              commuters to wonder if they are being overcharged: Why are Circle Line 
              fares not based on distance travelled?  
              <br> <br> For instance, the Circle Line fare from Bishan to Paya Lebar is $1.45, 
              which is the cost of travelling via the longer North-South and East-West
               lines. Measured on Government website onemap.sg, the distance via the 
              Circle Line is about 7.4km, which should cost $1.40.  
              <br> <br> Other commuters have noticed similar anomalies on the North East Line. 
              The fare from Kembangan to Chinatown, for instance, is based on the 
              11.9km travelled from Kembangan to Outram Park on the East-West line, 
              then onward to Chinatown. But commuter H J Tan, 38, said it should be 
              based on the shorter 11-km Kembangan-City Hall-Dhoby Ghaut-Chinatown 
              route.  
              <br> <br> Responding to MediaCorp's queries, the Public Transport Council (PTC) 
              revealed on Thursday that travelling time - and not just distance - is 
              also used to charge train commuters under Singapore's distance-based 
              fares system.  
              <br> <br> "The general fare-setting principle for MRT lines is to charge for the 
              distance travelled based on the fastest route," a council spokesman 
              said. "This takes into account the walking and waiting time required if a
               switch to another rail line is involved."  
              <br> <br> So, the North East Line anomaly is because the fare is based on the 
              "fastest travel route via a transfer at Outram Park", which requires a 
              single transfer compared to the shorter route, which requires two 
              transfers.  
              <br> <br> The Circle Line situation is more complex: Basing fares on 
              North-South-East-West rates results in some commuters paying more, but 
              "the majority of affected customers paying lower fare", said PTC.  
              <br> <br> Bishan and Paya Lebar stations are interchange stations, and how fares 
              are set between these two stations affect any travel along this stretch.
                
              <br> <br> When travelling from Ang Mo Kio to Aljunied, for instance, the fastest 
              route is via a transfer at City Hall. In this case, the 
              North-South-East-West fares are also cheaper. But PTC did not give the 
              estimated proportion of commuters who benefit from lower fares.  
              <br> <br> Commuter Mr Tan wondered, though, if the current system is "rather arbitrary since transfer times fluctuate".  
              <br> <br> PTC said it would continue to "harmonise fares" as new rail lines are opened.  
              <br> <br> A first step could be to have uniform fares across all rail lines, 
              suggested Government Parliamentary Committee (Transport) chairman Lim 
              Wee Kiak. Currently, North East Line and Circle Line fares are higher 
              than for the North-South-East-West lines.  
              <br> <br> Dr Lim has filed a question for Parliament's session on Monday on 
              whether any study has been done to see if two-thirds of commuters 
              benefit from distance-based fares, which kicked in July 3. "It seems 
              there are a lot more people complaining about their fares going up," he 
              said.  
              <br> <br> But he believes a distance-based system is equitable. "The issue is how you execute it," he said. - </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com/">TODAY</a></p>

              <p>I wouldn't support this, I haven't even take the last train yet, and the last train towards Joo Koon is just a few minutes before my last bus home. Nevertheless, it would be nice if people really take the train more often.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Distance-based fares a fairer system: Raymond Lim</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Transport Minister Raymond Lim has defended the new 
              distance-based fare structure for public buses and MRT trains as a good 
              concept that will lead to a fairer system. He said the issue now is in 
              its implementation.
              <br> <br> Mr Lim was replying to a host of questions from MPs in Parliament on Monday.
              <br> <br> He explained that previously, commuters making transfer journeys were 
              effectively paying more to keep the fares lower for commuters who took 
              direct trips.
              <br> <br> Mr Lim said the Public Transport Council (PTC) has now removed this 
              cross-subsidy or transfer penalty so that all commuters pay the same 
              fare for the same distance travelled.
              <br> <br> In this way, commuters could choose the best way to reach their 
              destination without having to worry about paying extra if they make a 
              transfer. 
              <br> <br> Mr Lim also told the House that overall, the transport operators have 
              borne a permanent reduction in fare revenue of about S$88 million per 
              year, as a result of distance fares.
              <br> <br> For the remainder of the costs, the PTC has the unenviable task of distributing the costs among the various commuter groups.
              <br> <br> These include direct and transfer travellers, short and long distance 
              travellers as well as adults, senior citizens and children.  
              <br> <br> Mr Lim stressed that if the PTC lowered the costs for one commuter group, another group would have to pay more. 
              <br> <br> If fares were to be lowered for commuters travelling long distances, it 
              would mean that the fares for another group of commuters who travel 
              shorter distances would go up.
              <br> <br> The transport minister also replied to a question on whether surveys 
              were conducted to validate the projected impact analysis since the 
              system was introduced.
              <br> <br> Mr Lim said the PTC has conducted a post-implementation validation 
              exercise, using the actual fare data collected in July under Distance 
              Fares.
              <br> <br> In all, the PTC took data from 24 million journeys made over a one-week period.
              <br> <br> Mr Lim said the exercise confirmed that the impact of Distance Fares on commuters is very close to what the PTC had expected. 
              <br> <br> Overall, 68 per cent of all commuters saw average weekly fare savings under Distance Fares.
              <br> <br> That's slightly above the 63 per cent originally projected.
              <br> <br> "This may indicate that some commuters have already started to optimise 
              their journeys by taking advantage of the flexibility under Distance 
              Fares to choose less circuitous routes to their destinations," said Mr 
              Lim.  -CNA/vm</span></p>

              <p>i have taken last train before from town back home to tampines.. everyone was running everywhere to catch the last trains back home... i would say it is a good time now too. even if it means 8mins freq.... i can say trains will still be packed.<br><br>"packed with standing space" kind.<br><br>not the kind of "packed and you can choose whether to board or not" kind. that's different.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disruption in MRT services</span></strong></p>
              <p>MORE than 70 Bendy buses will be deployed to help provide bridging services during two weekends in September when train services in Jurong are suspended for ongoing modification works that will improve capacity of Singapore's oldest MRT lines.</p>
              <p>The $800 million Jurong East Modification Project will increase capacity on the North-south and East-west lines by 15 per cent when completed next year. Part of the cost goes to a $368 million bill for 22 new trains - the first here to be assembled in China.</p>
              <p>The modification works include laying 2.5km of new tracks and erecting a new passenger platform that will allow quicker turnaround at the Jurong East station - an interchange of the North-south and East-west lines. Because a 60m section of an existing track has to be removed to facilitate the works, train services will be down over two weekends.</p>
              <p>On Sept 4 and 5, there will not be any trains running between Jurong East and Clementi stations. And on Sept 18 and 19, services between Jurong East and Bukit Batok stations will be disrupted.</p>
              <p>The Land Transport Authority is staggering the works - which involve cutting 60m of old tracks and merging the newly built tracks - over two weekends to minimise service down time. Even so, SMRT Corp will be deploying more than 70 Bendy buses - each capable of carrying 120 passengers - over the two weekends to provide free bridging services.</p>
              <p>The modification project - the first of its kind since the MRT system started running 20 years ago - began early last year, and is expected to be completed some time next year - one year ahead of original plans.</p>
              <p>Together with the 22 new trains that will be introduced progressively, relief is in sight for two of Singapore's most crowded lines.</p>
              <p>The LTA said waiting time will be shortened from the current 2.5 to4.5 minutes to 2 to 3 minutes.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blackout in Northern Singapore</span></strong></p>
              <p>A 15-MINUTE power failure which hit the northern parts of Singapore 
              disrupted train services and retail businesses on Thursday afternoon.</p>
              <p>The outage, which lasted from about 1.30 pm to 1.45 pm, 
              halted some trains in the Ang Mo Kio and Bishan areas as the doors could
               not open properly.</p>
              <p>Shops had to resort to manual practices as their cash 
              machines stopped working and shoppers could not use their credit cards 
              to pay.</p>
              <p>Said a sales assistant of a shoe shop in Junction 8 shopping
               mall at Bishan: 'We had some customers in the shop when the blackout 
              hit us. Our cash machine couldn't work so we had to write out invoices 
              and make the customers pay in cash.'</p>
