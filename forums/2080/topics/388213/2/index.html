              <p><strong>SMRT wins "Most Innovative Use of Technology Award</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Public transport operator SMRT wanted to use 
                      creativity and technology to cut cost and maximise efficiency, and thus 
                      came up with two innovative systems to make the ride more pleasant for 
                      commuters.
                      <br> <br> For its efforts, the company garnered the "Most Innovative Use of 
                      Technology Award" for the first time at the International Metro Awards 
                      in London. 
                      <br> <br> For many MRT users, passing by ticketing gantries is an everyday affair.
                       
                      <br> <br> Once in a while, passengers would try to sneak past with a free ride - 
                      by tailgating the person in front. 
                      <br> <br> SMRT is hot on their trail, with a new gantry that has more 
                      sophisticated sensors. 
                      <br> <br> David Ho, senior manager, Fare System Development, SMRT, explained: "We 
                      have more sensors, so they actually better detect the different 
                      passenger profile, for example children, adults and passengers with 
                      trolley and prams. So with a more accurate detection, it increases the 
                      throughput of passengers." 
                      <br> <br> The sensors are better able to detect if someone is trying to tailgate, 
                      or is simply taking a little longer at the gantry. 
                      <br> <br> Currently, there is only one such gantry at the Somerset MRT station.
                      <br> <br> SMRT hopes to replace its 20-year-old gantries with the new ones over 
                      the next four years. 
                      <br> <br> The train operator also hopes to improve its track maintenance work 
                      through a set of cameras tucked underneath a train car. The aim is to 
                      record images of foreign objects or detect problems with the tracks. 
                      <br> <br> Ng Chong Joo, senior manager, Permanent Way Branch, SMRT, said: "With 
                      the real vision system, we can pick up track abnormalities, which 
                      include uneven surfaces. 
                      <br> <br> "With this system, we are able to pick up the defects earlier, so that 
                      we can schedule out maintenance activity to smoothen the rail surface in
                       a (speedy) manner." 
                      <br> <br> Currently, SMRT deploys about 60 staff every alternate day to check the 
                      tracks manually, using a torch light. This approach is labour intensive 
                      and time consuming. With the new camera system, the company hopes to 
                      reduce such checks from every alternate day to just once a week. 
                      <br> <br> SMRT has installed the cameras on two trains and hopes to use them more 
                      extensively from next week. - CNA/ms</span></p>

              <p><strong>Circle Line's daily ridership expected to hit 200,000 with opening of 
              new stations</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Nine more stations along the Circle Line are set to 
              open on April 17.
              <br> <br> The Land Transport Authority (LTA) said this should push up ridership on
               the line by at least five times.
              <br> <br> Nearly 52,000 residents and grassroots leaders got a sneak preview of 
              what is in store at its open house on Sunday. LTA said the top stations 
              visited were Bras Basah, Paya Lebar and the Esplanade.
              <br> <br> Residents who have had put up with the inconveniences and disruptions 
              from the construction of the line were the first to check out the nine 
              new stations that will open soon.
              <br> <br> Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for 
              Transport, Lim Hwee Hua, said the open house is LTA's way of saying 
              thanks to the residents and businesses which had put up with the 
              inconveniences.
              <br> <br> According to the LTA, with the extension of the Circle Line to include 
              nine more stations from April 17, Singaporeans can expect ridership to 
              reach nearly 200,000 on this line each day.
              <br> <br> Also joining the Circle Line will be the Paya Lebar Interchange Station.
               With that, Singaporeans can now bypass the busy City Hall and Raffles 
              Place interchanges to get into the city and the northern parts of 
              Singapore, like schools in Yishun.
              <br> <br> One commuter said: "In the morning, my mum fetches me to school and in 
              the afternoon, I take bus number 39 back home. It takes me 45 minutes. 
              With the train, it will be faster." 
              <br> <br> Another commented: "On weekends, I take the train and this will be easy 
              for me to get from where I stay at Serangoon and to Suntec and the 
              Esplanade."
              <br> <br> The Circle Line has 29 stations.
              <br> <br> When fully operational, it is expected to have a ridership of nearly 
              half a million a day.
              <br> <br> The first five stations along the Circle Line from Marymount to Bartley 
              stations opened to the public on May 28 last year.
              <br> <br> Train ridership along this sector is about 40,000 a day. 
              <br> <br> The open house was also an occasion for charity work.
              <br> <br> Taking to the catwalk in the Circle Line Charity Runway Show were 
              prominent personalities, including Member of Parliament Fatimah Lateef 
              and the LTA's chief executive, Yam Ah Mee.
              <br> <br> The show raised about S$100,000 for the LTA Cares Fund to meet the 
              transport needs of the less fortunate. - CNA/ms</span></p>

              <br> <br>More train trips will be added and the waiting interval shortened
              for trains travelling between Dhoby Ghaut and Bartley stations, in
              anticipation of an increase in crowds. <br> <br> From noon to 7pm, commuters can enjoy a shorter waiting time of five minutes.
              <br> <br> From 9.30pm until the end of the train service, waiting times will be further shortened to 3.5 minutes.
              <br> <br> The waiting interval is normally about seven minutes.
              <br> <br> SMRT is also adjusting train timings so that commuters from the last
              Circle Line train can connect to the last trains along the North-South
              and East-West lines.
              <br> <br>Deputy Director for Station Operations, Chia Chun Wah, said that a
              high ridership is expected on the first day of operations from people
              who are keen to try out the new train service.
              <br> <br>There will also be many concert goers heading to Taiwanese girl
              group S.H.E.'s and Taiwanese rock band Mayday's concerts held near
              Stadium MRT station.
              <br> <br> SMRT added that other crowd control measures will also be in place.
              <br> <br>Concert goers heading home on the Circle Line are advised to use a
              stored-value card or purchase a single trip ticket in advance on the
              same day, to avoid queuing for tickets.

              <p><strong>Transfers between East-West &amp; Circle Line take maximum of 2 minutes: SMRT</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Two minutes. That's the longest length of time you
              will need to switch MRT lines - from the existing East-West line to the
              new Circle Line, said SMRT.
              <br> <br>The train operator and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) are
              putting final touches before the 11 new stations - from Dhoby Ghaut to
              Bartley - open to the public on Saturday.
              <br> <br> After months of checks and tests, the trains and the 11 new stations await its first passenger.
              <br> <br> They are the second set of Circle Line stations, after five opened in May last year.
              <br> <br> There will be two new interchanges - Dhoby Ghaut and Paya Lebar - that will link the East-West line to the Circle Line.
              <br> <br>Currently, a passenger at Paya Lebar station needs to change trains
              at City Hall, travelling some 13 stops and taking half an hour, if
              he/she wants to go to Bishan.
              <br> <br> Now, with the new Circle Line, the passenger can go directly from Paya Lebar to Bishan in six stops and half the time.
              <br> <br> On connectivity between lines, SMRT said passengers will only need to make a short walk to catch the next train. 
              <br> <br>"At Paya Lebar, there is very good connection between our East-West
              line," said Chia Chun Wah, deputy director of Station Operations at
              SMRT. "At the end of the platform, you can take one flight of escalator
              and straight away you reach the street level and another escalator
              (takes you to) the Paya Lebar concourse. <br> <br> "The distance is much shorter compared to the experience in Outram,
              with much shorter connection. At Dhoby Gaut, you can come up to the
              North South Line concourse, take an escalator all the way down
              (directly) to the platform."
              <br> <br> Come Saturday, SMRT will also increase its train frequencies, and services will run at between 3.5 and five minutes.
              <br> <br> One station expected to be packed is the Stadium station, as two concerts will be held in the vicinity.
              <br> <br>"The concourse of the Stadium station is designed with a large
              holding capacity," said Yee Boon Cheow, deputy director of the Circle
              Line at LTA. "At each end of the station, we are able to accommodate
              about 1,000 people at one go."
              <br> <br> SMRT said extra staff will be deployed to manage traffic at busy stations.

              <p><strong>11 new stations of Circle Line to operate from April 17, fare savings of up to 41%<br><br></strong><span>Eleven new stations of the Circle Line, stretching from Dhoby Ghaut to Bartley, will begin operations on April 17.
              <br> <br> It promises faster and cheaper travel - with fare savings of up to 41 per cent for commuters.
              <br> <br> Transport Minister Raymond Lim officiated the opening ceremony at Bras Basah Station on Friday. 
              <br> <br> The Bras Basah Station is described as an "architectural marvel". It is
              said to be the deepest underground MRT station ever built in Singapore.
              <br> <br> It boasts of a 41-metre escalator - the longest in any MRT station - and a unique reflecting pool on the roof.
              <br> <br> Commuters will save time, and money.
              <br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>For example, the journey to Paya Lebar from Bartley takes about 38 minutes and costs about $1.61.
              <br></strong></span> <br> But with the opening of the stretch of new Circle Line stations, it
              will take just 6 minutes and will save commuters 66 cents of fares -
              which is over 40 per cent cheaper than the previous fare.
              <br> <br> Culture buffs will also be pleased with the stops.
              <br> <br>"The stretch of the Circle Line also connects us to the doorstep of
              major culture destinations, such as our museums, as well as
              recreational and sporting venues like Fort Canning Park and the
              stadium, and for those headed to destinations around Suntec and the
              Esplanade. Whether for work or for leisure, the Circle Line provides an
              additional and convenient transport option, including those who
              currently drive," said the Transport Minister. <br> <br> The 11 new stations, along with five others that are already operating, are expected to bring ridership to about 200,000 a day.</span><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1050652/1/.html"><br>http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1050652/1/.html</a></p>

              <p>After reading this, I think we should really stop uploading pics of trains for the time being. I'm not sure of how long, but it would be a long while... We can still take pics of trains for personal reference and sharing among ourselves, but play safe, try as best as possible not to upload them.</p>

              <p>But well, we gonna learn to be like Kevin... an avid train enthusiast even though he does not own any recording device. I guess it is still possible to enjoy this hobby so long as we do not get ourselves into trouble, as we would definitely get demoralised by them.</p>
