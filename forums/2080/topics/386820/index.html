              <p>Yes, I do. The way of pharsing was quite misleading. Anyway, I meant why 5 trains chosen and not 2. That was explained that actually is up to maximum of 4 trains serve CGL when overcrowding. Typically peak hours is 3 trains. (Off peak is 2, which I knew that before hand)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just a question: The 3rd or even the fourth train will only start @ Tanah Merah? No chance of train being deployed in Joo Koon straight to CGA? What happens after peak hours? The train goes JKN straight or get everyone out and go Bedok or Simei to take paxes or go depot and sleep??</p>

              <p>Regarding Nickl_C151's wish, I rather hope they will resume a through train, but at a 30 to 45 minutes frequency. (Tanah Merah shuttle remains) It will be better if there is a evening peak hours crossover trains (7 trains from Pasir Ris will go to Marina Bay via Jurong East then Woodlands)</p>

              <p>You have to understand the rationale of starting the train from Marina Bay. That area is where the IRs are located, most would board at City Hall or Bugis, and some backpackers may stay in the areas between Kallang and Paya Lebar. There are no major hotels west of Raffles Place, hence it will be redundant to have the airport shuttle travel that 20km extra.</p>
              <p>At off-peak frequency, the airport shuttle may trail a normal train 3 minutes behind. At peak frequency, they may follow a schedule of 4+1, i.e. 4 normal trains before the airport shuttle. Between 12 to 2 on weekdays, they may slot in the train such that the schedule will show a normal train, lunchtime express, normal train, airport shuttle.</p>
              <p>Before you start bombing stuff like "there are many housing estates all around", airport trains are only meant for the conveneince of tourists. For locals, the only convenience they should get is ease of transfer (a la Raffles Place, City Hall, Bugis, Paya Lebar, Tanah Merah). Note that I did not introduce any City Air Terminals as this airport shuttle I suggested will also stop at all stations.</p>
