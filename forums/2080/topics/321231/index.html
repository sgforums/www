              <h1 class="clr">All—time high of 52m train rides in May</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: A combination of rising costs — fuel, parking and Electronic
              Road Pricing — has made senior sales executive Darrell Choo think twice
              about turning the ignition key in his car.</p>
              <p>While he still drives to his office at Suntec City, the 30—year—old
              has turned to public transport, especially trains, when going out to
              meet clients. "My trips are usually short so I can still stand the
              crowded trains and buses," said Mr Choo.</p>
              <p>Rising costs for
              motorists is partly why rail ridership hit record levels for the second
              time in less than six months. SMRT, which operates the North—South and
              East—West lines, saw commuters making 41,964,448 train trips last month
              — a 0.08—per—cent increase from its previous all—time high in January.</p>
              <p>SBS
              Transit, which runs the North—East line, saw some 10,540,700 passenger
              trips last month. It has seen ridership climb from a daily average of
              about 285,000 last April to over 340,000 last month.</p>
              <p>Both
              operators say the hike can be attributed to many factors, such as a
              change in travel patterns, population growth, employment growth and the
              government’s push for more people to take public transport. "The rise
              in petrol prices could also be a contributing factor as some motorists
              switch to public transport," added SBS Transit spokeswoman Tammy Tan.</p>
              <p>With
              more passengers, have train rides and loads become unbearable? SMRT
              says the addition of over 500 train trips last month on weekdays — just
              before and after the morning and evening peak hours, lunch hours and
              evenings — has been effective in reducing the average train load to
              "not more than 1,200 passengers".</p>
              <p>Regular train commuters that
              TODAY spoke to say the increased frequency would be more useful during
              the peaks themselves. They also suggested more train trips during
              weekends and holidays.</p>
              <p>With taxi fares rising, store manager Liu
              Zheng Yi noticed that trains are "quite crowded" with families heading
              out at weekends. He said: "While we may not pay for the extra comfort,
              you also don’t want trains to be packed, and with kids crying loudly."</p>
              <p>Some
              relief could be in sight. From Saturday, commuters travelling on
              weekends can expect SMRT trains to arrive every five minutes. This
              means up to 106 more train trips on Saturdays and up to 65 more on
              Sundays, SMRT added.</p>

              <p>In kuala Lumpur , crowded station, passenger Q in line in front plaform screen door, even without platform screen door, they also Q in-line waiting to go onto crowded train.</p>
              <p>I do not see this practice in SGP.</p>
              <p>did public transport council PTC stated the number of passenger allow in each train like what they stated in public buses? licsense to carry? how many standing? how many seating?</p>
              <p>so if any accident happen, their number should be like their inverted comma number!!!!!  "not more than 1,200
                                      passengers".</p>
