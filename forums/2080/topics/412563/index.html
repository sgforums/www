              I think an LRT system should be built to connect Boon Lay, Jurong West and NTU/NIE. Having an LRT there would certainly help to reduce travelling time to the connecting MRT stations and enhance travel convenience. Furthermore, I observed many of these areas got high traffic, for instance svc 99,241,242,243,179,199.
              
              I believe the proposed LRT in these areas would be much better utilised as compared to Sengkang and Punggol LRT.
              
              Any views?

              <p>Well, put it like this, for Sengkang, Punggol and Bukit Panjang, they were announced and built 2007 (In terms of annoucing the exact alignment, releasing the tenders etc) but not Jurong Region LRT was just merely announced as some of the future plans, oh yes BTW, one of the MRT station suffered from this fate is the Kallang Line, which is presumed to be a (branch) line from Ang Mo Kio via Toa Payoh East / Potong Pasir along the Kallang River passing through Boon Keng (Kolam Ayer?), Kallang Bharu / Basin and further south towards Lavender / Nicoll Highway and Marina areas (Ang Mo Kio - Kallang's distance is about 7km is a fact, and planned announcement stated that this planned line is about 16km and hence if that plan were to materialized, it has to be a similar alignment as above.)</p>

              I think the ridership for BPLRT seems to fare better than the Sengkang and Punggol LRT, probably because it serves 2 neighbourhoods - CCK &amp; Bt Panjang. The LRT system should not act just as a replacement for feeder bus routes in the neighbourhoods only, which I think will fail. The LRT system should also link up 2 or more neighbourhoods and built in crowded areas where feeder bus routes are usually packed. 
              
              For Jurong Region LRT to succeed, it should link up Jurong East, Jurong West, Boon Lay and NTU/NIE (and even IMM!). I think these areas should be considered as heavily built-up areas too. Or else, is heavily-built areas regarded as for example plenty of 40-storey HDB flats built closely together?
              
              I think the Sengkang &amp; Punggol LRT should interlink, ie LRT passengers should be able to travel direct between Sengkang &amp; Punggol to provide more direct travel, without having to transfer to NEL.

              <p>1: Which part of Bukit Panjang could you see the woods / empty fields? On large part of Sengkang West and Punggol West has. Empty fields in BPJ I could think of is one near the BKE part and beyond 10 Mile Junction (OT).</p>
              <p>2: Whats the age of the town you are comparing in SKG / PGL and BPJ. Bukit Panjang was developed as a town since 1990s but SKG / PGL was in the 2000s and it was planned to connect Jurong East to Bukit Panjang as the "Branch Line" (Now NSL) due to the residents there is higher than one in CCK [Probably is the turning curve technical reason, it cannot be implemented and was replaced by LRT instead and now DTL Stage 2]. I can still remember that the news used ask the public to stay areas including Punggol whenever there is a military exercise. Now no more le.</p>
              <p>3: I agree that the link between Sengkang / Punggol is like "eat XXit". But one has to consider a few points:</p>
              <p>A: I heard that the 41 Crystal Movers was bought with a reason. Why not 42 or 50 or 40? The answer lies at Sengkang LRT meant to use 18 of them [Hence the inital Sengkang East Loop's operation, I only see Set 01 to Set 18 in service and totally unaware of up to 41 of them until lateral days where West Loop was about into service] while Punggol LRT meant to use the remaining 23. (Punggol East Loop has 7 while Sengkang East has 5 stations only excluding Town Centre.)</p>
              <p>BTW, there is a Punggol North Spur Line and I belived not only it was just drawn on plans map / early (2002 to about 2004?) street directory maps for fun, but they just shelved instead of killing the plans which contributes about 3 of the cars (The spur line is 4 stations long only, unless they extend it into Coney Island to make it 5).</p>
              <p>Well, I mean, the 41 cars are meant to serve each loop / spur line to be sufficient for 2 mins per train despite for now, is like 6 mins per train as the demand is not there. Although I dont like this cheapo link design that takes passenger's chance of viewing the beautiful scene in TPE, but how much more trains does LTA has to buy if they allowed direct link [Even if not in terms of 2 mins per train, this spur service will have to be Punggol LRT Middle track that was covered by something that can be easily removed, cross into the main line --- opps, currently no such crossover and Punggol Modification Project is required, screwed the .... LTA planners and I dont think I talk big but I feel that I can do such job at a very satisfactionary level!!!! and cross into the inter-town link towards Cheng Lim all the way to slidings in Tongkang - Renjong which is quite long as well.], excluding the consideration on diverting on NEL's ridership and affecting NEL's purpose. (Like this is like WTF, making the pax to pay more when travelling from Sengkang LRT to Punggol LRT due to a forced use of NEL. Maybe now DBTF so no longer valid, but I remembered LRT's fares used to be calculating the number of stations.)</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>After looking in the situation in the North East which is some place that I am more familiar with, lets return to Jurong.</p>
              <p>To call a LRT line as Jurong Region Line [Not cooked up by some enthus / me etc but it was from official sources that the term used to appeared in LTA website], it is definitely will be and has to be include Jurong East, West while Boon Lay / NTU - NIE is more or less part of Jurong West and even if technically they are not Jurong, they are definitely tactical and strategical location to be included in this line and you have forgotten Teban / Taman Jurong which has no rail link at all as well. Regarding IMM, it is part of Jurong East (You meant a station there? Good idea) and further up in Toh Tuck areas is something extra but the line becomes too messy le. (They ended up drafting a backward C shape like line instead of loop line like existing ones.)</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Regarding the exact definition of heavily built up, I think this is another politics term, which means giving some impossible to achieve criteria before I will do something, meaning "I am totally ***ked up on it, so no more!!!" (Which is.....) because neither do I get the meaning of heavily built-up town.</p>

              <p>SKLRT has a better LRT ridership per/km basis than BPLRT.</p>
              <p>I think if it has to serve a big Jurong it's not going to be efficient... likely you might need to implement SWTs which is not easy to plan for LRT system.</p>
              <p>Tat's why I dun think it's going to work if Jurong East &amp; NTU is in e same picture.</p>

              line to be sufficient for 2 mins per train despite for now, is like
              6 mins per train as the demand is not there. Although I dont like
              this cheapo link design that takes passenger's chance of viewing
              the beautiful scene in TPE, but how much more trains does LTA has
              to buy if they allowed direct link [Even if not in terms of 2 mins
              per train, this spur service will have to be Punggol LRT Middle
              track that was covered by something that can be easily removed,
              cross into the main line --- opps, currently no such crossover and
              Punggol Modification Project is required, screwed the .... LTA
              planners and I dont think I talk big but I feel that I can do such
              job at a very satisfactionary level!!!! and cross into the
              inter-town link towards Cheng Lim all the way to slidings in
              Tongkang - Renjong which is quite long as well.], excluding the
              consideration on diverting on NEL's ridership and affecting NEL's
              purpose. (Like this is like WTF, making the pax to pay more when
              travelling from Sengkang LRT to Punggol LRT due to a forced use of
              NEL. Maybe now DBTF so no longer valid, but I remembered LRT's
              fares used to be calculating the number of stations.)</p>

              Since the Sengkang &amp; Punggol LRT infrastructure is already there, why not just get a few more trains (if needed) to provide a direct link between Sengkang &amp; Punggol? I believe this extra cost is small as compared to the total cost of constructing and installing the system. Furthermore, it will benefit the residents of the 2 towns through a more direct link. Imagine residents can just hop onto Sengkang LRT from Compasspoint after shopping and travel direct to their LRT stops in Punggol. Now got to take svc 83 instead. Isn't that a sort of duplicate to the LRT? Isn't it a bit wasteful?

              <p>I agree.
