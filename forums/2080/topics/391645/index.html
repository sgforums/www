              <p>Currently, the only white-liveried trains are the unrefurbed C651, scheduled to be refurbish this year. There are 2 kinds of trains that have a black livery. 1 is the Refurbed C151 and the C751B. The C751B is the newest train in the SMRT fleet and it sports an aerodynamic front end. In its interior, it has VPIS systems(currently not in use) which are installed in all C751Bs except for 347/348. It has the smallest overhead adverts and a very highpitched acceleration sound. It also uses an LED display to display the train run numbers</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The C151 uses an old fashioned roller thing to display train run numbers. Its acceleration noise is middle-pitched and it is the only type of trains to be installed with the staris system currently(with the exception of 091/092). The majority of them has been in offical use, while some others have malfunctioned. Some staris trains only have the route maps or the vfds. Those are the trains that the staris systems that are currently being installed. Such an example would be 009/010, which has been without vfds in side.</p>
              <p>There is also a C151 which has been hiding in Bishan Depot for about 5 months now and it's number is 089/090.</p>
