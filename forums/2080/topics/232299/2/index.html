It has to be linked to existing transport modes.<br><br><strong>Â“The service may probably link Malacca and Putrajaya, although nothing is confirmed yet,Â” he said. </strong><br><br>The distance between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore City is 325km. If the Velaro E is used, which has a top speed of 350km/h; travel time will be reduced to 90 minutes.<br><br>Hunter said the train's proposed seating capacity was between 400 and 500 people on a single trip.<br><br>YTL Corp has previously drawn the expertise of Siemens to develop the Express Rail Link, which connects KL Sentral and KLIA.<br><br>Siemens has also managed the Ipoh-Rawang double-tracking electrification project, hence, it feels it could offer its latest technology should the high-speed rail project receive the green light.<br><br><strong>Besides Siemens, other players that provide high-speed rail technology include France's Alstom, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Hitachi from Japan and Spain's Construccionesy Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles S. A. </strong><br><br>Although Hunter did not reveal the project's actual cost, he said it would run into billions of ringgit as factors such as land acquisition, route, civil engineering and system costs, speed and density had to be considered.<br><br>According to published reports, the high-speed rail was expected to cost RM8bil.<br><br>Â“Land acquisition cost will be significant. Funding will be another main challenge and it is unsure at the moment who will bear the cost.<br><br>Â“Private finance initiative is one of the options. The project could be completed between two and five years, but that will depend on the engineering issues that may crop up,Â” he explained.<br><br>Hunter said an agreement between Malaysia and Singapore was highly important before the project could even proceed.</div>

Good idea?</div>

In Singapore they will not drive so fast anyway.<br><br><blockquote><br>if a bullet train breakdown along the way - gone case already. the entire line will be delayed - probably for hours. and how long does it take for the recovery tow locomotive to reach the faulty bullet train and pull it off the tracks? and can the operators afford to station more recovery teams along the 300++km long route? </blockquote>That's not a major problem. The next train (I mean the train that comes after the broken down train) can cross over to the opposite track, then bypass the broken down train and then go back to actual platform again. Just need to give train enough chances to cross over to other track. So no big delay, maybe only 15 minutes or so.<br><br></div>
