              <p><strong>Man caught walking on Clementi station track</strong></p>
              <p>A MAN got on the eastbound track at Clementi MRT station and
              started walking on it, which disrupted train services for almost 10
              minutes on Tuesday morning.</p>
              <p>According to an eyewitness, the man in his late 30s walked
              about 200m towards Dover MRT station before he was stopped by SMRT
              staff and taken back to the station.</p>
              <p>The eyewitness, who lives near the track, said he went to his
              window to check after he heard a 'loud, blasting sound' coming from a
              train. He saw the man, clad in a red T-shirt and black shorts, on the
              track.</p>
              <p>'He was half-walking and half-jogging. He looked quite calm,'
              said the 63-year-old, an insurance agent who wanted to be known only as
              Mr Chan. He next saw SMRT officers hot on the man's heels. The man did
              not put up a struggle as they escorted him back to Clementi MRT
              station, Mr Chan added.</p>
              <p>An SMRT spokesman said it was a passenger who had alerted staff about the man at about 9am.</p>
              <p>The emergency stop plunger - which stops trains from moving -
              was immediately activated, the spokesman said. Electricity to the
              tracks was also cut. East- and westbound train services were delayed
              for seven minutes and nine minutes respectively.</p>
              <p>Police arrested the man under the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act.</p>
              <p>SMRT said there have been 19 cases of track intrusions between
              January and September this year. There were 31 cases last year and 30
              in 2006.<br></p>
              <p><strong> Power failure on NEL leaves thousands stranded</strong></p>
              <p>THOUSANDS of commuters were affected when North-East Line (NEL)
              train services between Sengkang and Punggol MRT stations were disrupted
              by a power supply problem last night.</p>
              <p>The fault occurred at about 9pm, and shuttle buses were activated to ferry passengers between the stations.</p>
              <p>'The line is still operating between HarbourFront and Buangkok
              stations. We apologise to all affected commuters for the inconvenience
              caused,' said SBS Transit spokesman Tammy Tan.</p>
              <p>She estimated that 5,000 commuters were affected.</p>
