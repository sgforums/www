              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As many sgf transport enthus know i'm tintinspartan and i
                                      currently studying Media and Communication in Singapore Poly. I am
                                      asking on suggestions to whether or not to esthablish a Transport
                                      Enthusiast Club in Singapore Poly. SP has alot of CCAs with
                                      diversity of fields such as Sports (Canoe, Gym Club), Fashion (SP
                                      Makeup Artists Club) and others (SP Food Connosiuer). So there is
                                      nothing odd towards this idea since there are other odd interests
                                      that have been made CCAs in SP. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For this new club, we not only want to make a presence in the
                                      modern society that we exist but also share with others who might
                                      join due to oddity what is the hobby about but not only that. the
                                      club could attempt to create partnerships with the relevant
                                      transportation authorities such as LTA, SMRT and SBST in order to
                                      give youths more exposure to how our transportation systems work.
                                      This can come in the form of visit to rolling stock maintainance
                                      facilities and dialogue sessions with some key personnel who are
                                      responsible in maintaining the efficiency of the nation's
                                      transportation network.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How will things run in the club?</p>
              <p>The club will have at the least bi-weekly meetings where members
                                      can come together and discuss about transportation topics such as
                                      new developments and do stuff together such as engaging in board
                                      games and etcetra. It's more to recreation but to keep things
                                      relevant, we will attempt to have at least monthly outings to
                                      various transportation sites which have huge significance such as
                                      the Tanjung Pagar KTM Station.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This club although sounds as if only SP students is involved,
                                      will also attempt to have transport enthusiasts from other
                                      institutions to come together once in a while for a mass gathering
                                      like a bus tour, a tour at a transportation facility and even
                                      house-visiting during festive occasions. This will hopefully create
                                      more bonds between enthusiasts in SP and in other institutions such
                                      as RP, TP, NP and some secondary schools.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, this club hopes to build relations with other transport
                                      enthusiasts whichever they are interested in from trains, buses,
                                      taxis and planes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In brief, the main purpose of this club is to:</p>
              <p>1) create relationships between enthusiasts and with members of
                                      general public who join due to oddity.</p>
              <p>2) make known to the transportation authorities that some youths
                                      are concerned for the nation's transportation system</p>
              <p>3) give youths more exposure to the day-to-day operations of the
                                      transportation network.</p>
              <p>4) have fun! :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope that this brief proposal should explain the rationale
                                      behind this club. Pls give your comments on this proposal. This
                                      club will be proposed to the relevant authorities in SP for
                                      approval if support is given.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>NOTE: IT IS NOT ONLY FOR BUS Enthus! Train, Plane and other
                                      TRANSPORTATION enthusiasts can join in.</p>
