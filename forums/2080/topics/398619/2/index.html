              <p>QX179R may answer that question.</p>
              <p>I guess fire engine is dispatched as they may have the necessary tools to remove the man trapped under the train. I doubt an ambulance would have those kind of tools.</p>

              <p>as I've mentioned in the previous page, a  SRT together with a PL was dispatched to this incident so that they can free the body which was trapped underneath the train arriage..</p>
              <p>ambulance must also be dispatched in the event of the person that jumped but is still alive but if its vice versa, then the EAS crew must pronounce that person is dead &amp; time of death which will then the case will be handed over to the police..</p>

              <p><strong> Eastbound train services Incident at Bedok MRT Station</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong>Eastbound train services between Eunos and Tanah Merah were 
              disrupted for slightly more than a hour this afternoon when a man was 
              hit by a train a Bedok MRT Station.</p>
              <p>SMRT said the incident happened at about 1.45pm. <br> <br> The train operator said to maintain service on the unaffected stretches 
              of the East-West line during the incident, all eastbound trains were 
              turned around at Eunos MRT Station. <br> <br> Some westbound trains were turned around at Tanah Merah MRT Station. <br> <br> <br> Westbound train services were not affected. <br> <br> Normal eastbound train services resumed at about 3.00pm. <br> <br> SMRT also deployed bus bridging service<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">s</span> to ferry 
              passengers between Eunos and Tanah Merah MRT stations during the train 
              service disruption. <br> <br> About 6,500 passengers were affected during the incident. <br> <br> SMRT said passengers were informed of the service disruption and the 
              free bus services through announcements, notices and the rail travel 
              information system at affected stations. <br> <br> Passengers who were unable to complete their journeys due to the 
              disruption can claim a full fare refund from the Passenger Service 
              Centre in any of the 69 SMRT stations, within the next three working 
              days. <br> <br> SMRT is assisting Police in its investigations.<span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"> </span></p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Train services were 
              disrupted at stations
                                      between Eunos and Tanah Merah for about an hour 
              on Friday
                                      afternoon. This was due to a track incident at 
              Bedok Station.<br> <br> About 6,500 commuters were affected when a 
              54-year-old man was hit
                                      by a train at around 1.45pm.<br> <br> Callers to MediaCorp's news hotline said the man
               jumped onto the
                                      tracks when the train was approaching.<br> <br> The driver, who saw the incident, will be given 
              counselling and a
                                      few days to recover from the trauma.<br> <br> All train services resumed at about 3pm.<br> <br> Twenty-four free bus bridging services were 
              deployed for commuters
                                      affected by the disruption.<br> <br> Passengers who could not complete their journeys
               can get a full
                                      fare refund from the Passenger Service Centre in
               any of the 69 SMRT
                                      stations within the next three working days.</span></p>
