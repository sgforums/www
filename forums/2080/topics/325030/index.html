              <p>Everytime when I taking MRT, I like to watch out of the windows to look for beautiful scenery at further distance. In a way, it release my stress after one whole day working.

              <p>2nd thing is the travelling time from one station to another station can take quite sometime. Why not they have this "express train" whereby the train only stops at a few crowded area, so it can minimize the number of stops it make, and fully utilize the fast speed of let's say 400km/hour, this can make our travelling time so much faster. Now the fuel price is already so high, if the 6 million estimated population in the future, is the current train system able to cope? Seriously I don't mind to pay more if travelling time from tampines to orchard become let's say 10 minutes.</p>

              <p>The advertisements help to sustain your train fares. No adverts? Fine, please pay more to cover their losses. And advertisements help company. I think youre the 0.1% of people who think advertisements make the companies suffer losses from customers who choose to not support them because they can't see trees along their route. And come on, 50% of current train lines are underground. Soon, it will be 75% or even 90% in the next 50 years to come. See what scenery?</p>
              <p>Please refer to the previous topics on "Express trains" for your express trains. The speed for emergency train service is 105km/h. Even the latest China High-Speed Rail Harmony trains only go to a max of 350km/h. What 400km/h are you talking about? With that speed, we can get from Pasir Ris to Boon Lay in 4 minutes plus. Or HarbourFront to Punggol in 2 minutes. Oh, and lets say you stay at Tampines. If your express train doesn't stop at Tampines how? Come here and post again is it?</p>
              <p>Our current train system is able to cope as we have more than enough trains to do a 1 minute frequency for current SMRT lines and 2 minute frequency for the current SBSTransit line. Only problem is why waste electricity? To please people like you?</p>
              <p>You need a transfer to get from Tampines to Orchard. There's no express crossover that links Bugis to Dhoby Ghaut. This isnt the TGV in France. Even if we have the TGV, how are you going to get there in 10 minutes? Before we can accelerate, we need to hit the emergency brake.</p>
              <p>Singapore is too small to have a Maglev system (as I infer from your 400km/h crap). <br>Please use your brains when complaining.</p>
              <p>Oh, and what do I think of this post you ask me? I think you're just spamming.</p>

              <p><br>Firstly, the window does not belong to you and thus smrt will definitely have the right to sell them as advertising places...</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Secondly... there is only one track for each direction and one platform... Unless you are going to pay for the building of new tracks and platform, you can trash your suggestion. How much more are you willing to pay? 5 bucks? they will need billions.</p>
