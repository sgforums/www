              <p>Seems like this stupid face one wants to jam the earlymorning trains which is already very packed ! peple travelling long distances from east to west and west toeast to work will now have to sandwich with the ofiice people working and alitighing at city area!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>why not they have express bus services at designated pickup points that takes people to these stations direct no stopping and charge for it instead of  jam packing the eraly trains that are already so packed!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so what if free, worse is the train breakdown early and i can say to thiose whotravel early there its a free ofeer to be trapped in trains!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>this guys is which constituency 1? please vote him out also next GE!</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px;">Close to 14,000 public service officers working in the city area will benefit from the Government's plan to provide free train rides before 7.45am.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px;">More than 40 public agencies located near the 16 affected MRT stations will back the Government's year-long trial to ease the peak-hour crush, said the Public Service Division in a statement on Tuesday. This includes the Finance and Health ministries, as well as, statutory boards like the Economic Development Board and Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px;">Public service officers can opt to start work before 7.45am under a staggered work-hours policy to get the subsidised rail travel. Officers can also choose to start work later, depending on the nature of work and so long as they put in the required working hours a week, the statement added.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px;">PSD's career development and management director Tan Hoe Soon said managers "must be mindful that officers who start work earlier should, correspondingly, be able to leave the office earlier." Work routines, such as meetings, will also have to factor this in, Mr Tan added. Separately, the Association of Banks in Singapore also welcomed the free travel trial in their own statement, saying that it will allow more in the financial sector to opt for flexible working arrangements.</p>

              <p>but in their mind they only relyand trust numbers, seeing one number bigger than the other, 58k &gt; 18k, so they think by shifting some of the 58k to the 18 k will make thigns better.</p>

              few sits expect people to stand on the spacious flooring ahr?!</p>
              <p>SBS - the aircon double decker buses bottom area also manyempty
              spaces. and worse during morning peak period you see many single
              deck ones crampped to the core on the road, then during afternoons
              off peackperiods many dounble decker ones roam the streets like
              waiuting to pick ghosts up! during monring peak house should
              utilize all teh double deckers, afternoon off peak deploy the od
              cheaper single decks! have drivers trained t drive both type of
              buses! why doaway with the older single decks? all new buses nic
              nice for show only then add all teh oeprating maintenance costs to
              our fares!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>now give free rides - later take back icrease fares again!?</p>

              <p>you are wrong....  you must understand why you see DD during afternoon (off peak)..</p>
              <p>lots of DDs are plying on the road during am peak (6am to 9am) and pm peak..(5pm-8pm). the reasons that u saw them at 2pm to 5pm is that the driver need to clock at least 7-8 hours of driving....... or else, it is really a waste of money to buy S$500 000 bus just to do one trip of 2 hours in the am peak and then another trip of 2 hours in the pm peak? total 4 hours? so how much you want to pay the bus driver? </p>
              <p>during am peak, of course all the buses are cramped. everyone going to work/school at same time. (6-8am)... for pm peak, ppl might stay back for work and school dismiss at different timing, so the crowds are lesser...</p>

              <p>read my post properly lah. i say the type of busses on the road during off peak. should be single decks instead of double decks. single decks also consume less fuel, good for off peak.</p>

              <p>during morning peak i am again refering to the type of bus. a lot of single decks then. if deploy double decks all duriing peaks, can carry ferry more people per trip per arrval.</p>

              <p><br>what is the weight of a single deck bus?</p>
              <p>what is the wieght of a double deck bus.</p>
              <p>compare them both empty with only driver as load.</p>
              <p>if both empty bus movve on the same route which one consumes more fuel?</p>
              <p>even if not ideally if a single deck and double deck bus originates form teh same manufacture seris and build, adding one more deck onto of a single deck design means more laden weight load, more empty space for aircon support.</p>
              <p>if smrt and sbs wanna have this type of palnning, they make sure their double decks bus design have engines combustion system that is efficient enuff to be on par with a single deck one when equals to their efficienycy either fully laden or empty.</p>

              <p>I do realised that, articulated ones takes up lost of space, have less seats make peopp[le satdnfor long hours in the joy rides. so in a long run they endager add stress to or traffic sitiations esp at peak hours, make commuters more discomfort with no seats have to stand. all these for power engine efficiency? the accounts and books look good, commuters noh bian suck thumb still have to take those buses what can commuters do?</p>
              <p>why deviate as if a simple search over the internet people dont know keh?</p>

              <p>NOW WE ARE TOKIN ABOUT SINGLE DECKS AND DOUBLE DECKS. WHAT YOU CANNOT CONCUR IS YOUR PROBLEM. WHAT I KNOW IS THERE IS A REASON FOR SINGLE AND DOUBLE DECKS TO EXIST.</p>
              <p>SMRT AND SBS SHOULD MAKE GOOD USE OF DEPLOYMENT FOR SINGLE AND DOUBLE DECKS TO CUT ON FUEL DURING OFF PEAK, AND MAKE FULL USE OF FUEL EVEN IF THEY COST MORE PER TRIP DURING PEAK HOURS TO PICK UP AND FERRY AS MUCH PASSENGER PER TRIP AS POSSIBLE SO THAT COMMUNTERS CAN REACH THEIR DETISTINATION.</p>
