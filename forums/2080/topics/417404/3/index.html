              <p>That is because somebody has either lived in Hougang or Changi / Whitley Holiday Homes for far too long that does not know that such plans are by ASEAN transport ministers and not some ameatur in train / transport planning.</p>

              <p><span>The Singapore-Kunming Rail Link
              (SKRL) </span></p>
              <p><span>Runckel &amp; Associates has followed news on the
              progress of The Singapore-Kunming Rail Link (SKRL) which was
              was first proposed by Asean in 1995.  The SKRL is a
              flagship project of the ASEAN-Mekong Basin Development Cooperation
              (AMBDC).  This regional railway line, spanning some
              5,000 kilometers (3,000 miles) from Singapore to the Chinese city
              of Kunming, would be a very efficient and most economical mode
              of cross-border cargo transportation.  However, the
              project has been hindered by a lack of funds and other technical
              issues in connecting the rail to major towns across the
              region.  The project also includes constructing railway
              stations and related infrastructure, and has been estimated to cost
              US$15 billion (€12.5 billion).  ASEAN hopes the link will
              be ready by 2015.</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="color: #330099;">Recent Progress in
              Cambodia:</span><br> <br> The Strait Times of Singapore reported in early 2008 that Cambodia
              received US$80m funding for its Thailand rail link.  Cambodia
              will build a rail link to Thailand after it received these funds
              from the Asian Development Bank and the Organization of Petroleum
              Exporting Countries, according to Cambodia's transport
              minister.  Work on the 48km connection between Sisophan
              in Cambodia and Poipet near the Thai border will be completed by
              2010.<br> <br> Besides the progress in funding of the Cambodia link, Malaysia also
              donated used rail tracks worth more than US$2 million to
              Cambodia for a China-Singapore link as part of regional
              efforts to build a railway linking Singapore to southern China,
              reported late last year by the Associate Press. This
              would also help fill in 48 kilometers (30 miles) of missing rails
              there.<br> <br> Association of Southeast Asian Nations's Fact Sheet - Sept,
              2007 reveals the SKRL feasibility study examining six
              alternative routes to link Singapore to Kunming, China, which all
              six routes have a common sector from Singapore to Bangkok via Kuala
              Lumpur. </span></p>
              <p><span>Route 1: which connects Cambodia, Lao PDR, Viet
              Nam and China, was selected by the ASEAN Transport Ministers for
              its high social and economic impact. It will cost an estimated
              US$1.8 billion to construct. Its 5,382 km length includes the
              missing links from Poipet to Sisophon, and from Phnom Penh to Loc
              Ninh and Ho Chi Minh City, as well as the spur lines from Ho Chi
              Minh City to Vung Tau and from Vientiane to Vung Anh. <br> <br> Routes 2 to 6 will be considered for implementation in national
              rail plans or other railway network projects, such as
              the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.business-in-asia.com/asia/trans_asian_railway.html">Trans-Asian Railway</a>. <br>  <br> <span style="color: #330099;">Developments of
              SKRL:</span><br></span></p>
              <ul style="font-size: medium;">
              <li>Cambodia’s construction of the missing links, guided by the
              Inter-Ministerial Committee for SKRL, is on schedule. Cambodia will
              also start its rail rehabilitation project on its existing rail
              system, partially funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as
              reported above.  Royal Railways of Cambodia
              Director-General Sokhom Pheakavanmony said construction of the rail
              link between Poipet and Sisophon is expected to be completed by the
              end of next year or early 2008.  For the 225-kilometer
              missing link between Phnom Penh and Loc Ninh, a border town between
              Cambodia and Vietnam, Pheakavanmony said a feasibility study on the
              missing link, funded and conducted by China, has been
              completed.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul style="font-size: medium;">
              <li>Viet Nam completed a feasibility study on the Ho Chi Minh
              City–Loc Ninh missing link and is negotiating with Cambodia for the
              location of rail connection points. A feasibility study for a spur
              link from Vung Ang to Tan Ap-Mu Gia for further linking with
              Vientiane is also being undertaken.  Vietnam Railways
              Deputy Director-General Nguyen Dat Tuong recently said Vietnam and
              Cambodia were working to finalize the connecting rail point near
              Loc Ninh. Once the two countries have decided on the exact
              connecting point, Vietnam will immediately start construction of
              the 145- kilometer missing link between Loc Ninh and Ho Chi Minh
              City.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul style="font-size: medium;">
              <li>In December 2006, the ADB approved a US$60 million loan to Viet
              Nam to assist in the rehabilitation of the Hanoi–Lao Cai section
              and a US$42 million loan to Cambodia to assist in the
              rehabilitation of Cambodia railways that include sections of the
              SKRL route. The ADB is also undertaking a detailed design study on
              the Phnom Penh–Loc Ninh sector with financing from
              China. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul style="font-size: medium;">
              <li>China has made progress on the Chinese sectors of the SKRL,
              including the Yuxi-Hekou route (Eastern portion), the Yuxi-Mohan
              (Middle portion) and the Dali-Ruili (Western portion). Construction
              of the Yuxi-Mengzi railway is scheduled to be completed in 2009.
              The feasibility study of the Dali-Ruili railway has been
              completed. </li>

              <ul style="font-size: medium;">
              <li>The Republic of Korea has completed a US$1.2 million

              <p>Cant be GBD. A new depot near there or even somewhere in JB / overseas is likely. Depot in SG for SKRL is as good as having a depot of EWL / NSL in City Hall.</p>

              <p>KTM move out next year is uptill Woodlands. It will still be operational, until 2018 when the two governments decide to make a rapid transit system between Singapore and Johor. Operating rights should be still on KTM unless there is a change, which I doubt so since we do not have any railway companies, apart from SMRT and SBST.</p>

              <p>I must say again, bullet train is nearly impossible here to be built. We have to look at a number of factors. First thing, the gauge between each country is different. Next, with such limited time, building one in 3 years time is more than a death railway.</p>
              <p>So currently, do not hope for bullet trains from Singapore - Kunming. Unless there are official news releases, then we are able to assume, but not make speculations out of it.</p>
