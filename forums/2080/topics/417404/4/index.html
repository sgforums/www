              <p>As I said, to have bullet trains, the whole network have to be rebuilt and have the same gauge throughout the network. Some may used standard guage, some narrow gauge. We need to have a consistent gauge so that it'd be much efficient. </p>

              <p>I've tried explaining to you guys through Interception_7 on his first post in this thread, but it seems like you guys don't get it yet. Lemme explain then.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There will be no bullet trains.</span></p>
              <p>The news is talking about the Singapore - Kunming Rail Link. How do I know? I watched probably the same piece of news i_luv_erky watched on Channel 8. Currently, the main missing link is in Cambodia, through to Vietnam. The main problem now is the railway here is split into 3 sections: Singapore to Laos via Friendship Bridge, the Myanmmar Railways, and Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh City) to Kunming. From Kunming, it is already possible to travel to the rest of Russia and Europe, just that it takes about 28 days.</p>
              <p>The purpose of the Singapore - Kunming Rail Link when it was planned in the 1990s was to provide landbridge services in order to free up shippuing routes in the region, not for bullet trains. The current CRH system ends at Kunming. The only possible time to take the bullet train would be to take a KTM train up to Butterworth, then SRT to Bangkok, SRT again to Aranyaphrathet or Map Taphut, Vietnam Railways to Hanoi, again from Hanoi to Kunming, and continue your journey by CHR there. However, that line only operates at 250km/h and will not hit 350km/h. The CHR extension to Kunming completes in 2014 coincidentaly, so that's where your confusion may come from.</p>
              <p>However, I have to say that the Singapore Kunming Rail Link is meant for landbridge services. This means only a change of locomotives is needed at the border checkpoint. The goods would probably be transferred to another train in Vietnam as they have dual gauge tracks (both standard gauge and meter gauge). Only passengers need to get on and off as all Asian railways except China and North Korea do not alow each other's coaches to be attached to another's rake. This is some kind of agreement they signed with the European Union of which I forgot the name. If you understood my above paragraph, it means that you can sit in a North Korean coach on a Russian Train rake, then sit on the same coach on a Chinese train rake and finally into North Korea on a North Korean train rake. However, this route is not opened for tourists, but for North Koreans only.</p>
              <p>If you still want to discuss about bullet trains to Singapore, the closest for you is between KL and Singapore only. And that project has been said on and off for years, so yeah.</p>

              <p>They do allow the coaches through, but not the locomotives, nor sharing a train (i.e. you will not see a train with both KTM and SRT coaches coupled together for normal passenger service). There is 1 train daily from KTM and SRT entering into Thailand and Malaysia respectively.</p>
              <p>Contrary to what you said, an agreement is needed to run trains through to another country, not that it has been agreed to disallow. Do note that the agreement I stated in my previous post is for rail companies involved in the line from Europe to Asia only, not for others in South East Asia, to enable travellers to buy a through ticket.</p>

              <p>Nope. Kunming to Beijing West station takes 1day14hr25min. A stay over is required, making it two days. A morning train "International Train 3" takes the Trans-Mongolian routing to Moscow Yaroslavski, taking 6 full days (+1 for overnight at Moscow) to complete the journey. That brings Kunming to Moscow to 9 days.<br><br>Moscow to, let's say, Berlin, from Moscow Byelorruski in the 9th morning would bring one to Berlin Hauptbahnhof by the 10th morning. Much less than 28 days.<br><br>However the due process, Mongolian transit visa (if still applicable), Russian visa, and Belorussian transit visa, with two bogie changes (standard 1435mm to Russian 1520mm and back again to 1435mm) each way would definitely kill any economics of this journey. A through-trip journey like this is more suited for freight (non-perishable goods) and would be more cost-effective.</p>
