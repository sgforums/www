              <p>Uhh, early answers. </p>
              <p>1) Set 40 (Correct me if i am wrong)</p>
              <p>2) DT35</p>
              <p>3) Before Coney Island / Punggol Port Road</p>
              <p>4) CM</p>
              <p>5) Increase the frequency from 4 mins to the possible 2 min frequency</p>
              <p>6) The whole line except Gali Batu depot which is at-grade</p>
              <p>7) Changi Point / Changi Village / Marina Barrage / Marina Bay</p>
              <p>8) Nope, it was meant to be in operation only when CCL 4 and CCL 5 has open</p>
              <p>9) Downtown Line</p>
              <p>10) Yeap, it was meant to be a cross-platform interchange with DTL.</p>
