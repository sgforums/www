              <p>Allow commuters to remain on train at terminus station for working trips MRT. This will "waste time" since the train is intended to terminate for a while but it gurantee seats for needy person. Not everybody willing to scarifice a few minutes for a seat.</p>

              <p>Implement Limited Express trains with special First Class seating, tickets to be bought on trains at the door in addition to the basic fare and stop at only a few stations along the EWL. This can be progressively made available to the NSL. These special trains would use crossover tracks when it is possible to do so to reduce travelling time and have a top speed of 100kmph. Then it would go through the Middle Platform of Tanah Merah for instance, not stopping there while the normal trains use the usual platform, thus making it faster than the train in front. This is further be enhanced with additional parallel tracks dedicated for this service, but it is not 100% neccessary for it to have it.</p>

              <p>Not really, they can do something similar with what they did with Paya Lebar, with the edges reaching the tracks. They've done a new station from scratch before on a running line (Dover), platform extension would be an easier job for them as compared to that.</p>

              <p>Hmm let's see...</p>
              <p>- Remove the "Normal Mode" operation when train is operating in
              Auto mode<br> Pros: Improve/shorten commuting time from A to B<br> Cons: Nil<br> Constraint: Nil<br> <br> - Removal of Yishun &amp; Yew Tee shutter service during peak
              hour<br> Pros: Improve frequency of train between Woodlands and Jurong East
              on NSL<br> Cons: Passengers from Yishun onwards may not be able to secure a
              seat during their journey<br> Constraint: Nil<br> <br> - Legthen the train from 6-car to 8-car<br> Pros: Each train will be able to transport more passengers<br> Cons: Increased Operation Cost<br> Constraint: Design of existing stations does not allow future
              expansion with low cost. Though it can be done with low cost, it
              requires track to curve within station. But this idea will
              definitely be mooted.</p>
              <p>- Implement Rapid Service<br> Pros: Enable train to skip certain station due to low demand and
              thus, benefit passengers who are travelling for a long distance on
              train<br> Cons: Need to upgrade existing station used for overtaking<br> Constraint: Infrastructure limitation due to island platform
              design</p>
              <p>-Upgrade signalling system, remove automatic operation,
              converting to full-manual<br> Pros: Full-manual system can "crush train" during peak
              hour better when compared to auto system.<br> Cons: Increased operation cost due to increased manpower<br> Constraint: Nil</p>
              <p>This are just few of the many which I can think of. =)</p>

              <p>All of them seem feasible. But the shuttles should only be removed after JEMP is done. Oh, and instead of the rapid service, let's have an Airport Express stopping at Marina Bay, Raffles Place, City Hall, Bugis, Paya Lebar and Changi Airport only.</p>
