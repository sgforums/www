              <p>i agree with that also,lengthing the trains is impossible,due to 1 more important reason:</p>
              <p>most underground stations do not have that luxary to cater for it, there are some rooms outside the platform for other functions,so to lengthen it would require to relocate the rooms and also in some areas worst still the tracks.note this suggestion is further more only applicable to NESW stations only.</p>

              <p>Which is why whoever designed the station long ago definitely did not forsee this, which is a bad thing. On a side note, how you guys think of this;</p>
              <p>- Release timetable of train departure at individual station on station and operator's website. Next, instead of showing estimated arrival time like 2 mins etc, show the exact departure time for the next 2 trains.<br>Pros: Commuters get to know at what time does the train depart from each station and plan their journey accordingly.<br>Cons: Nil<br>Constraint: Nil. It's just whether they wanna do it or not...</p>
              <p>For some folks out there, you might think this might be unnecessary because <strong>"we are a Metro system and train arrives "so often" that it is not needed</strong>". Then there will be another group who will argue and say that "<strong>our train's timetable is not consistent and adjustment is made throughout the day to meet the commuter's demand etc etc"</strong>.</p>
              <p>To these group of people, think again, train timetable should not be changed every day to meet the demand of each day. Also, despite that our train arrive "so often", it's still better to put a exact time on the board to allow commuters to plan their commute. Lastly, if there's delay, operators can update the timetable to reflect the delay like;</p>
              <p>Departure Time  Destination     Delays<br>18:19                  Jurong East    1 minute due to congestion at Ang Mo Kio<br>18:22                  Jurong East</p>
              <p>For days where special timetable is implemented like new year eve etc, operators will inform commuters of the changes in timetable in the information board, website and display the timetable used for that day.</p>
              <p>This is just my opinion, I mean no offence. However, if you find my points invalid or need clarification, just let me know. Cheers. =)</p>

              I know that platforms can be built on curves...but our MRT tracks are curved inwards "to join each other". Maybe i wasn't clear enough.
              
              And regarding slopes, I do know that it can be done.
              But i would not wish for it, imagine standing slanted on the platform while waiting for the train. That's HORRIBLE!!!

              <p>Uh, I think you confused Ampang/Sri Petaling Line (STAR LRT) with Kelana Jaya Line (PUTRA LRT)?</p>
              <p>For STAR LRT, platforms are capable of handling 3 cars, with each car articulated (6 cars to the untrained eye). Most trains now run with 3 cars with longer frequencies, unlike the past with 2 cars but more frequent service.</p>
              <p>For PUTRA LRT, the plan was to originally have 4 cars per train but some communications stuff went wrong somewhere and they had 2 cars instead. The stations were left unchanged at 4-car length though. 4-car EMUs have arrived and are undergoing testing, which will ease peak hour congestion along the line next year. The EMUs fit the platforms and PSDs nicely.</p>

              <p>RFP really needs an urgent maintenance on its announcement system.</p>
              <p>I was at RFP quite a few months ago, and 045-046 arrived. I thought it was a NB train, until the VFDs showed that "This train terminates at NS13 Yishun" I did not know that as there was no annoucement. </p>
              <p>I was at RFP 1 month ago, and there was a LTE train at both the EB and NB platform. Yet, no announcement was played to tell me about this.</p>
              <p>Car 3351 door A2 has a faulty set of DCWL. The problem has not been fixed for more than 2 months already.</p>
              <p>Lastly, I hope that the violent doors problem on 097-098 and 323-324 will be fixed as soon as possible. I saw 097-098 having violent doors for almost half a year. </p>

              <p>What I could suggest is that SMRT can provide a JUR - YWT Shuttle in the morning peak hour similar to the current shuttles provided during the evening rush hour. What I observe that usually in the morning, trains arrive at Yew Tee at a frequency around 6 minutes. This will cause the platform to be full of passengers when the train arrives. As the train proceed further to CCK, Bukit Gombak and Bukit Batok, many passengers on these stations are unable to board the train as it already jam packed inside. Maybe this could help in easing up the load?</p>

              <p> The reason why there's a 6mins in morning rush hour lies in two reasons;</p>
              <p>1. There's some train between 7am to 8.30am that will do a through service to EWL, which means that after that train crossover to EWL, there will be a "big gap" in between SB train.</p>
              <p>2. In the morning peak and evening peak, NSL frequency is about 2mins between Marina Bay and Yishun. Almost every alternate train will terminate it's service at Yishun before performing turnaround at slidings. This means that between Yishun and Jurong East, frequency can range from 3mins to 6mins depending on timetabling.</p>
              <p>I understand what you're trying to convey but to solve this problem, two things need to be done;</p>
              <p>1. Since there's train crossing over from the NSL to EWL, make another train crossover from EWL to NSL to cover up for the "losses" (This sounds abit illogical) <strong>OR </strong>Input new train into service from UPD to cover up for the "losses"</p>
              <p>2. Extend the Yew Tee and Yishun shuttle service from it's current station to Woodlands OR even better remove the shuttle service altogether.</p>

              <p> The design of our station is already "screwed" from the start. This station implement one of the best design for changing from one line to another without much hassle.;</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eCteHtuTLE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eCteHtuTLE</a></p>
              <p>This is Shinjuku station at platform 15 and 16, which services;</p>
              <p>Platform 15: Yamanote Line Outer Loop Bound for Ikebukuro and Ueno (11-cars)<br>Platform 16: Chuo Sobu Line Local Bound for Mitaka (10-cars)</p>
              <p>In case you're wondering what's the musical chimes are in the stations, they are actually door closing chimes for the trains. Each platform has different music so you can't be wrong on which train is departing soon. Now for the on-topic stuffs.</p>
              <p>Notice at the beginning and ending of the video that both train from different line depart and arrive at 30 seconds gap. This allows seamless transfer between the two line and this is what our Jurong East station should have been designed, since the current configuration uses up alot of land space. (And the timetabling too. It's sometimes irritating to see that the train you're transferring (NSL/EWL) to departs right after the train you're in opens it's door.)</p>
              <p>On a side note, I am well aware that Raffles Place and City Hall implement such transfer system.</p>
