              <p>The other night (26 Dec 2010), I was on the MRT between Clementi and Jurong East, towards Joo Koon. For some reason, the train stopped on the viaduct, and there was this "tssh" that was repeated as if the air brake or something was being applied.</p>
              <p>Earlier that day, the train stopped on the incline coming into Dover from Buona Vista. I was on the Dover WB platform waiting, and it just stopped just before the hump. The headlamps went out for a short while, then the train crawled into Dover, and the brake sound had no electrical whirring, just the mechanical brake's high-pitched squeak.</p>
              <p>Weird? Any ideas why? (It was raining like s*** btw).</p>

              <p>This was the same thing that happened that time, SmRT trains often stop in the middle of Pasir Ris and Tampines stns while commuters on board before moving again1. I used the same reason to explain the above. nowsadays, instead I would see a train stop suddnly while on a bus or car. The last time that happened was when I was taking a bus and while traveling below TPE, I saw the train sitting jjust above the train tracks.</p>

              <p>Contrary to what you have posted, it works the other way round. There may be a downhill section along the route, so the train has coasted above the maximum speed of that section of the line (ie. overspeed) so the OCC will send a signal to the train causing it to apply the emergency brake to a halt for safety. However, to take this train out of this situation, the driver needs to change to CM mode to take the train to its next station in order for the signals to reset.</p>
              <p>Changing modes does not require the TO to apply the emergency brake as the emergency brake is, as its name suggests, for emergency only.</p>

              <p>This was the same thing that happened that time, SmRT trains
              often stop in the middle of Pasir Ris and Tampines stns while
              commuters on board before moving again1. I used the
              same reason to explain the above. nowsadays, instead I would
              see a train stop suddnly while on a bus or car. The last time that
              happened was when I was taking a bus and while traveling below TPE,
              I saw the train sitting jjust above the train tracks.</p>

              was in jan.</p>

              <p>Like for example, there's two trains in the station, the train could not enter the station as both platforms are filled. So this train (the train that's outside the station) waits for one train to depart before proceeding.</p>

              <p>Contrary to what you have posted, it works the other way round. There may be a downhill section along the route, so the train has coasted above the maximum speed of that section of the line (ie. overspeed) so the OCC will send a signal to the train causing it to apply the emergency brake to a halt for safety. However, to take this train out of this situation, the driver needs to change to CM mode to take the train to its next station in order for the signals to reset.</p>
              <p>Changing modes does not require the TO to apply the emergency brake as the emergency brake is, as its name suggests, for emergency only.</p>

              <p>Emergency brakes is not only applied during emergencies, but also during non-emergency cases. A good example would be a misjudge of CSP which may result in overrun.</p>

              <p>no. The only termini I could think of is..... Paya Lebar CCL or Promenade CCL, which is potential but not real termini. Well, the stations are constructed so narrow that employs a island platform and cutting through in (Imagine Woodlands got a middle track due to an extension from its sidings) is impossible, even it had the station closed for years.</p>
              <p>Building through its side like JEMP sounds possible (Even if the disruptions is acceptable), but there again, one must consider that building such crossover from the side will cause "wide crossing" (Such as changing 2 lanes or more in normal vehicle) in any case (Either before terminating OR when the train sets to depart) unless you stack it up for above ground or stack it below for underground terminus but then the gradient is most likely unacceptable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Apart of that, one has to remember that in between stations has only and will only features 2 platforms for each direction only with some notable exceptions of 3 or 4 platforms because they are interchange / potential future interchanges from an extension line out of it and hence terminate in a 3rd platform will not help much at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hence, the solution is to use Spanish solution such as one used to be (Now rarely seen for various reasons) employed in Harbourfront where Platform A is used to disembark the pax and Platform B is used for passenger boarding so that the train generally park them in the overrun sector (Due to generally the use of scissors crossover such as one in Dhoby Ghaut CCL) and Platform B for a quicker access to trains and paxes in an orderly manner.</p>

              <p>A bit la, forget the real term. If you say like that, then only AMK LTE is Spanish.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok, but if you need more platform on <em>terminus</em> so that the train no need to wait outside, then you have to do it either on the side on above / below the station and not just slotting one more platform inside it for obvious reason. If you put it on the side, then the crossover from the side to the other direction bound will require many crossovers (2 at least) and a longer travelling distance of crossing over, which can be both jerky and time consuming due to low speed and means, trains might still have to wait outside while crossing over.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you build it above / below the existing station, crossing over impact when compared to the side is still there, but not that much, but the problem is more on the gradient which is either unacceptable steep or longer distance involved which faces space constraint. In any case, that wont work and effectively kills provision to extend it (Tuas extension from Joo Koon, olden days Yishun extend to Woodlands etc).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hence the solution is to use one like HBF, but now it is seldom (Or even none) practiced due to someone tried to see and verified that the crossover after HBF is a scissors with power supply intake / staircase access to that area which effectively kills any southern extension out of it, which I had imagined NEL extending to Pulau Semaku when the rubbish had land filled it by 2050 which according to them (Government), by then it would be a recreational area during my tour to there as part of Social Studies back then.</p>
