              <p>This thread is created for train enthus to film train safely and not offending others. It is not meant to learn these and do any thing illegal, such as suicide or planning terrorism attacks etc.</p>
              <p>These are my suggestions:</p>
              <p>1: Do it smartly, do not be too obvious.</p>
              <p>2: Do not film passengers, regardless how he / she is handsome / pretty or some "funny acts" such as you know what to do when you are attached later. People will think that you are pervert, afterall we are not meant to stomp people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Apart of the 2 common sense, IF you are caught by staff, here is what you should do and dont. Things need to work both in hard and soft ways</p>
              <p>3: No matter how hard he condemn, in a super unfriendly tone, <strong>DONT be afraid. </strong>There are <strong>NO signboards on NO Filming</strong>, unlike No Eating and Drinking, No treaspass to tracks (So this is not meant to suicide, afterall this method is very painful and there are many other ways apart of suicide), No flammable goods, No Smoking etc. So they cannot do much XXXX to you. (Must be 'man' -- Hard way, even if you are a girl. But, is there female train enthu out here??)</p>
              <p>4: When they ask for your parents phone number, just say <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>they dont have</strong></em></span>. Relax, they cant know the details (Or else WTF they ask in the first place). Instead, give yours (Esp. on handphone filming). You dont want such things to get involved your parents and next time they give you curfew and probably ban you from taking train videos. Dude -- your parents working so hard not meant to pay fine to these crooks. (Hard way)</p>
              <p>5: You can give them your address, real one. They are not likely to use that, or do a house visit. (I tried before lol. Using a soft approach here gives some respect to them and obviously, you cant be dumb until you dunno / dont have a house because this is Singapore.)</p>
              <p>6: You should surrender your IC / Ezlink card. Probably you bring them out unless you tap in / out fugaratively. (Unless you use adult EZlink card -- lol, say you dont bring IC. --- Soft way)</p>
              <p>7: Always <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>ADMIT that you are a train fan / curious on these hobby such as train spotting </strong></em></span> when you are asked what the **** are you doing? Do not fabric lies OR drag others in. This is <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>EVEN if the CSO or Police ask you who else are doing similar acts and asking for Youtube account.</strong></span></em> As I repeat, even if they can asked the Prime Minister, President <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>AND</strong></em></span><strong> </strong>the Minister of Ministry of Defense (In charge of Army) along with Minster of Home Affairs (With <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ISD, one who deals with terrorist</strong></span></em> and police), they cant do a **** to you. Unless, that is -- they have evidence to say that you are filming for terrorism purpose <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OR</span></em></strong> your videos contains like filming women (Pervertic acts, then this is you business as I already forewarned NOT to do these. In this case, you should use a hard way and be <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DUMB</span></em></strong> and no matter what, do not give out any details of other train fans. As one saying,“ ä¸€äººå�šäº‹ä¸€äººå½“”, meaning one person do things one person shall shoulder the responsibility, do NOT drag others to accompany you to "death". There is <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NO EXCEPTION</strong></span></em> to this.</p>
              <p>8: Do not be fooled by policemen, CID or the staff citing there is a police record. There is no such nonsense unless you are charged in court <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AND</span></em></strong> get <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">jailed</span></em></strong> because of it. No exception, even if you ended up with a fine. So, unless you planned to run election -- which there is a limit of amount to be fined or kenaed jailed for a certain length will disqualify you being a candidate, kena fined is just wasting your money only and will not affect your future, with a bad record and you can still participate world beauty contest, IF you are a girl, obviously (Not like the Pasir Ris Low lol!). And nobody can just anyhow charge you due to this unless the video has malicious purpose which I wont repeat. (Hard way again)</p>
              <p>9: Apologize to them later, and thank them for letting you off, because any staff will do that surely is in the bad mood. (Includes attempting to board DNBs, which will cause them real inconvience and btw, they can fine people for doing dangerous acts, which boarding DNB when the doors are closing is one of them BUT not filming trains.) This is a soft approach.</p>
              <p>10: More maybe added later.</p>

              <p>By the way, there are certain tips you need to remember:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1: Dont be too straight in thinking.</p>
              <p>Example: (Based on a dunno true or not story in TV) -- Summarized version</p>
              <p>A group of people in Hong Kong due to some heated arguments, have killed a guy somehow. These murders, (Dun care whether manslaughter or murderer whatever legal term, so long as they have somehow kill people with or without intention can liao) obviously scared and the first thing they did was to destroy evidence.</p>
              <p>However, such acts will not be condoned by the law and what happened was the police had somehow managed to find bits of clue and evidence, ended up arresting them as prime suspect.</p>
              <p>During the interrogration, a CID asked one of them: "Did you killed anyone?"</p>
              <p>"No! Ah - Sir, plz believe me! I NEVER kill someone!!!!!!"....... replied by the person, and probably with tears or whatever .... (For dramatic effect lah, sapport leh! :D)</p>
              <p>So, the CID asked him one last question, after a repeated standard answer from this suspect, and wasting many hours on this dude.....</p>
              <p>The question was "Did you handle the dead bodies? Actually, the consequences for murderer and handling dead bodies are different. One can be imprisoned by life due to murder and the latteral is not following the standard procedures by the Town Council, which requires to be declared and the consequences is just some amount of fine."</p>
              <p>And the suspect was thinking so straight that answer "yes, I did handle a dead body in XXX (The time) but I did not killed a person." OMG! This resulted the CID say: We now have evidence to say that you are (one of) the murderer for this case, we will be now officially charged you for murder."</p>
              <p>And you know what will be the next reaction lah.......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The moral of the story is, apart of one person do one person shoulder the responsibility's man act, it makes some logical and psychological thinking that</p>
              <p>Maybe a staff will ask this question when caught a person do train filming:</p>
              <p>&lt;Skipping all the asking of personal details&gt;</p>
              <p>1: Who had instructed you to do all these? Do you know that such ***** acts is not allowed and will ......XXXX?!!!</p>
              <p>The filmmer most likely will say: No, nobody asked me / instructed me. This is done solely by me.</p>
              <p>&lt;Being fed up and f**ked up, the staff or CID whatever ask the second question&gt;</p>
              <p>2: So who else in Youtube got take those train videos. Better admit!</p>
              <p>The filmmer may say: So and so.....</p>
              <p>OMG! The staff is just bluffing you and used another tactics to find out who the hell is doing such and probably believe that such method is good to find out who instructed for such "nonsense" where in fact no, and created a bloo** mess now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, you guys maybe a small kiddo that have not completed secondary school or even PSLE, but trust me, I know what I am doing, and certain things just need to use some intellect. This is why I say there are NO Exception to Point 7. See, human hearts are complex one de. Dont be naive!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It will be hard to understand various tactics, if not, many youngsters or even adults also wont get conned, in many social aspect. (Ok, pai seh for OT a bit here. I shall stop now)</p>

              <p>There is a difference between rational and emotional side. Sure, the rational side will say this is wrong. But in the first place, who are these CSOs got the authority to give such permission when there is no such rule (Not known by me, but I will be more than willing to amend it when anybody can show prove otherwise)!!! As I say, unless you can quote on the <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Rapid Transit Act or such in Singaporean Law</strong></span></em> as proof / evidence that such things need to have permission by staff (Or even, there is a chance that it is strictly not allowed, which by right, then asking for their permission is <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NO USE</span></em></strong> because isnt that contradicating as well?), then your point is valid which = dont do this kind of videoing. You are in fact siding SMRT staff, which most of such I regard as "SMLJ" instead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am really disappointed with your comments either.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I wont comment on emotional side because it is quite common sense.</p>
              <p> Below is removed in the sense that I was a bit heated up just now.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Just that the KTM railway need to ask the station manager for permission does not equal to asking permission from station manager in MRT is workable. Do remember that certain such videos are train rides between station to station. Sure I can ask for Station A's (Starting point) station manager and he / she agrees does not mean Station B's (Destination) station manger is aware and willing to agree on such which is even more contradicating.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope that anyone can give a debate here. Afterall, the younger generation are the next nation leader, who need to represent people and can speak up in parliment. Lol!</p>

              <p>There is a difference between rational and emotional side. Sure,
              the rational side will say this is wrong. But in the first place,
              who are these CSOs got the authority to give such permission when
              there is no such rule (Not known by me, but I will be more than
              willing to amend it when anybody can show prove otherwise)!!! As I
              say, unless you can quote on the <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Rapid Transit Act or such in
              Singaporean Law</strong></span></em> as proof / evidence that such
              things need to have permission by staff (Or even, there is a chance
              that it is strictly not allowed, which by right, then asking for
              their permission is <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NO USE</span></em></strong> because
              isnt that contradicating as well?), then your point is valid which
              = dont do this kind of videoing. You are in fact siding SMRT staff,
              which most of such I regard as "SMLJ" instead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am really disappointed with your comments either.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I wont comment on emotional side because it is quite common
              sense.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just that the KTM railway need to ask the station manager for
              permission does not equal to asking permission from station manager
              in MRT is workable. Do remember that certain such videos are train
              rides between station to station. Sure I can ask for Station A's
              (Starting point) station manager and he / she agrees does not mean
              Station B's (Destination) station manger is aware and willing to
              agree on such which is even more contradicating.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope that anyone can give a debate here. Afterall, the younger
              generation are the next nation leader, who need to represent people
              and can speak up in parliment. Lol!</p>

              <p>Then in that case, by your own admission, you are discarding rationality for your own emotions. And that is really not a good thing to admit to.</p>
              <p>Never mind about the rules being dumb, never mind about the rules not being set in stone - like it or not, the station staff has authority, and you don't. You know, this is really the reason why you guys get mocked on occasion.... how do you want the public to respect you if you behave like this?</p>
              <p>I am not saying that you cannot follow your passion for trains. What I am saying is that your passion for trains does not give you the right to behave like a hooligan in defiance of authority.</p>
              <p>If you really want people to not mock you guys for being train enthusiasts and see you guys as being pests, then for goodness' sake, be a good person, listen to authority, and seek permission before you do any filming.</p>

              <p>Ok ok, there is no current law stating explicitly that photography is banned in RTS stations. The last ammendment of the Railway Act was in 1991, 1 year before I was born.</p>
              <p>However, there seem to be a verbal consensus or an internal consensus within SMRT <em>(I say this because I have had no problems with SBST lines so far, but actually neither with SMRT.)</em> that photography should not be allowed. In the Singapore Law, a verbal agreement can also be considered a contract, should the case be taken to court. Just with albeit more lawyer fees and a longer trial I guess. So I would say, yes it is not allowed for SMRT stations.</p>
              <p>To play safe, just ask. Would it kill to use 20 seconds of your time to say "Hello, is it possible for me to take pictures in the station?" If they ask why, just say that you like trains or something. Lies can only be supported with more lies and the whole thing collapses. If the guy/lady says no, then walk away. I'm sure if even you were really thirsty with only 1 drink stall in sight, and the uncle behaves like he is against the entire world holding a parang in his hand, you won't go by the mantra of "I came here for a drink, I leave here with a drink." right? Same thing applies here. Although it won;t get you into some serious penal offence, is that 1GB of pics worth your time and frustration?</p>

              <p>Hey hey hey, what's with this company-ist replies? The way any company work will be very different from each other. He didn't even talk about KTM yet. Why did you have to do that? Even MTR in Hong Kong and MTR-operated Connex in Melbourne, Australia operate differently okay?</p>
              <p>You think asking KTM staff always work? You have no idea how many times I have been rejected.</p>
              <p>Fine, let me give you a damn fine example of Singapore Railways. I ask when I shoot at Punggol LRT station, permission granted. I ask if I can board the train on the Sengkang West Loop for some random HDB tour, granted. With a personal guide (staff) on board pointing out to me the depot systems and the future plans of Punggol LRT. I ask if I can film the Sentosa Monorail... Heck. Just check my gallery and YouTube okay? You'll notice that I shoot SMRT trains from the outside only.</p>
              <p>Your argument on KTM was really out of point. Just like all your other arguments involving externalities. I sincerely hope you'll stop this. Let's get back to topic.</p>

              <p>This is not about hooliganism as no violence involved. Now the problem lies at you cannot even read simple English. Now, yes the staff like Station Manager has the authority in station business, BUT is there a law or a rule set by <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SMRT/LTA whatever above</span></em></strong> (Since you so go by authority) than these CSO / Station Manager that they <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>have</strong></span></em> the right to issue such permission <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>in the first place</em></span></strong>? If no, then they are <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ABUSING</strong></span></em> their authority. Just because policemen or CID (No uniform leh, how to know real or fake -- a bit OT here) tell you take out your IC then you take out? They should go certain standard procedure like showing their pass and citing their reasons for doing so, including suspecting one for hanging for long time / late night or finding suspects etc. Or rather, just because I am the leader of a country (IF), does that equates to I can corrupt whatever I like, or kill anybody I like just because I got the authority!</p>
