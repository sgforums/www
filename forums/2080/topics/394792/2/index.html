              <p>Ok ok, there is no current law stating explicitly that
              photography is banned in RTS stations. The last ammendment of the
              Railway Act was in 1991, 1 year before I was born.</p>
              <p>However, there seem to be a verbal consensus or an internal
              consensus within SMRT <em>(I say this because I have had no
              problems with SBST lines so far, but actually neither with
              SMRT.)</em> that photography should not be allowed. In the
              Singapore Law, a verbal agreement can also be considered a
              contract, should the case be taken to court. Just with albeit more
              lawyer fees and a longer trial I guess. So I would say, yes it is
              not allowed for SMRT stations.</p>
              <p>To play safe, just ask. Would it kill to use 20 seconds of your
              time to say "Hello, is it possible for me to take pictures in the
              station?" If they ask why, just say that you like trains or
              something. Lies can only be supported with more lies and the whole
              thing collapses. If the guy/lady says no, then walk away. I'm sure
              if even you were really thirsty with only 1 drink stall in sight,
              and the uncle behaves like he is against the entire world holding a
              parang in his hand, you won't go by the mantra of "I came here for
              a drink, I leave here with a drink." right? Same thing applies
              here. Although it won;t get you into some serious penal offence, is
              that 1GB of pics worth your time and frustration?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>As I say, this is definetely an abuse of authority by some station managers if there are no such law exist. But since you have mentioned about internal
              consensus within SMRT, so why dont put like trespass into tracks also no need to state is not allowed, or rather no food and drinks allowed also no need to state clearly one leh?</p>
              <p>Sure, it does not kill by asking. But, have u thought of station to station video. How can one ask permission from both station first without actually overstay or asking in advance, where chances are, in the term of office politics (You know when you go to work), where the day or time in duty likes to give trouble leh.</p>
              <p>Eg: You come 3 days ago in Station A and B and asked nicely say I 3 days later wana take videos for my train project as an train enthu identity. 3 days later, either or both of the station manager on off day (All staff got an off day per week or 8 days or sort of, unless the station manager is your friend or relative, how would you know?) and the other guy say HELL NO! WTH are you trying to do? You explain nicely, and he give a condemned looked. Now, tell me, who is contradicating? Or rather, both are station manager (Most likely) and why is that the now station manager / CSO got higher authority than the previous one despite being same position.</p>
              <p>Even no need 3 days, you can change it to like morning tell them say afternoon or evening (Avoid public crowd please)/ night, also can.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, while I wont say is worth the effort, and I avoid a flame war, but it is matter of rights because the fate lies on tricky lawyers' mouth.</p>

              <p>This is not about hooliganism as no violence involved. Now the
                  problem lies at you cannot even read simple English. Now, yes the
                  staff like Station Manager has the authority in station business,
                  BUT is there a law or a rule set by <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SMRT/LTA whatever
                  above</span></em></strong> (Since you so go by authority) than
                  these CSO / Station Manager that they <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>have</strong></span></em> the
                  right to issue such permission <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>in the first

                  to know real or fake -- a bit OT here) tell you take out your IC
                  then you take out? They should go certain standard procedure like
                  showing their pass and citing their reasons for doing so, including
                  suspecting one for hanging for long time / late night or finding
                  suspects etc. Or rather, just because I am the leader of a country
                  (IF), does that equates to I can corrupt whatever I like, or kill
                  anybody I like just because I got the authority!</p>

              <p>Hey hey hey, what's with this company-ist replies? The way any
              company work will be very different from each other. He didn't even
              talk about KTM yet. Why did you have to do that? Even MTR in Hong
              Kong and MTR-operated Connex in Melbourne, Australia operate
              differently okay?</p>
              <p>You think asking KTM staff always work? You have no idea how
              many times I have been rejected.</p>
              <p>Fine, let me give you a damn fine example of Singapore Railways.
              I ask when I shoot at Punggol LRT station, permission granted. I
              ask if I can board the train on the Sengkang West Loop for some
              random HDB tour, granted. With a personal guide (staff) on board
              pointing out to me the depot systems and the future plans of
              Punggol LRT. I ask if I can film the Sentosa Monorail... Heck. Just
              check my gallery and YouTube okay? You'll notice that I shoot SMRT
              trains from the outside only.</p>
              <p>Your argument on KTM was really out of point. Just like all your
              other arguments involving externalities. I sincerely hope you'll
              stop this. Let's get back to topic.</p>

              <p>As I said, you still dont understand either, if these people have no authority to do that because it is not in the law, then neither can these staffs instruct can or cannot video taking. I will heed to Interception_7's advice to stop discussing until the final verdict is out because right now all can just based on what is there and argue for facts.

              <p>I had apologized for earlier company-ist comment which had pointed out by NickLim and had since censored in changing the fonts into white instead. I will keep it cool and just want to know the facts. I also wonder when the train fans are in no authority to film, then who are these CSO / Station Manager in authority to <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">give</span></em> permission when they are not the ones who write the Rapid Transit Act or own the MRT company.</p>

              <p>Chill guys.</p>
              <p>Samuel, if you wanna discuss about this matter, I would suggest that you keep the "not-so-friendly" sentences and words out of this thread as it would tends to sway a person point of view regarding a certain matter.</p>
              <p>From my point of view, what Samuel has said have made some points too. Is it stated inside the law that photography or videography is not allowed within train station? If someone managed to get an official black and white source stating it, it is only then we can conclude that it is illegal. But from the previous discussion, all you guys have are "verbal law". So before you guys condemn him, show some solid proof first.</p>
              <p>Secondly, what is the difference between shooting a photo/video inside the station and outside the station? Do you know that the people involved in the Yishun incident shot the video from the roadside outside the station? If so, does it mean that as long as the camera is facing the station, it is illegal? Then what about the street view function in Google Earth? Is what NickLim™ and the rest doing even legal even if he and the rest only shot the video from outside of the station premise?</p>
              <p>I am a person of logic. If you guys find any of my point invalid, feel free to let me know. =)</p>
              <p>By the way Interception, since you're going to meet with SMRT, how about asking them the depot tour thing too? It has been quite awhile since you've sent out the request.</p>

              <p>While it dont kill for such politely asking, but think again, why SMRT rejects? Because to them (Especially those who are not friendly ones which defintely not from some staffs that train fans have known of, or rather, having a nice chat etc before --- not always need to go in to TO cabin like some rare special experience by some fans.), we are just nothing or nuts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And to everybody outta there, I am a one who always appeal this and that until I got it or it is really no abuse of authority and my view / request is illegal etc. Simple. So dont think that you are a judge by a nickname and can condemn me here there upside down, because.......</p>

              <p>1: Fudgester is not coming in as neutral person, given that he clamining about hooliganism in the thread where what I am saying is based on facts, maybe it does not sound nice and given that he think he is a judge for no reason as well. Last but not least, he just left away because he had nothing to prove me wrong (Except the so called hooliganism, which is common by our leaders to fix the oppositions -- this is OT but real-life example)!</p>
              <p>2: That is because today they have the response AFTER you have met them to clarify about this thread, so without this thread, you wont be getting any updates on it, please think again.</p>
              <p>3: Although I looked and sounded very heated up, but think again, I am not in the list of Youtube filmmers since I dont make any train videos as of yet, what is the verdict is none of my business! Actually, I am trying to point out that either we CAN or CANNOT do these. We do not want to sabotage any staffs, just by asking them for permission when no such law exists or actually not allowed, and if they sympathy / or one who have more passion in trains rather than treating it as a 9 - 5 chore, maybe we are not doing his / her favour as well. Think again. If really cannot, I suggest we dont even ask them, just no videos can liao. (Although bit hard to do BVE, sadzzzz........) . Unless, someone can prove to me actually it is neither and like school like that, need ask permission to go toilets from teachers during lesson time, fine, you win.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And last but not least, it is because of you saying this thread to be pure bull****, dont u dare to deny that makes me boiled!</p>

              <p>Not really, I am no fan of a company (Based on my text, do I even look like SMRT fan and no -- I seemed more like condemn them, so put facts right first) and I am not comparing and I apologize if you cant read the difference because I do apperciate the facts of difference between each companies' policies, regardless of which rail road, the main thing is are they in permission to give rights. So based on your theory does that mean that if you see a station janitor in any rail road in the world and ask for permission then can lor? Why dont ask the nearby Ticketing counter as well or even better, ask permission from other passengers or nearby shop owners if applicable since they are also could be the first one you see?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Furthermore, history have shown once and again that sometimes who you have asked simply in no rights to give such permission, so they deny and reasonable. I wont ask anybody to go against it unless you managed to saw someone else and ask and luckily he/she got the real authority to allow or deny any request of yours. (Which will change your fate, dude!)</p>

              <p><br>1) Fudgester came in as a neutral person to give his opinion. This has nothing to do wih any knowledge about trains.</p>
              <p>2)  I have personally contacted the Corporate Communications department about the depot tour, and they have agreed. So before you (Samuel Lee) give out any judgemental remarks about SMRT giving no updates, think again.</p>
              <p>I am doing a favor for you guys, so please keep the discussion to a minimum. In other words, speak neutrally.</p>
              </div>
              <p>1: Fudgester is not coming in as neutral person, given that he clamining about hooliganism in the thread where what I am saying is based on facts, maybe it does not sound nice and given that he think he is a judge for no reason as well. Last but not least, he just left away because he had nothing to prove me wrong (Except the so called hooliganism, which is common by our leaders to fix the oppositions -- this is OT but real-life example)!</p>
              <p>2: That is because today they have the response AFTER you have met them to clarify about this thread, so without this thread, you wont be getting any updates on it, please think again.</p>
              <p>3: Although I looked and sounded very heated up, but think again, I am not in the list of Youtube filmmers since I dont make any train videos as of yet, what is the verdict is none of my business! Actually, I am trying to point out that either we CAN or CANNOT do these. We do not want to sabotage any staffs, just by asking them for permission when no such law exists or actually not allowed, and if they sympathy / or one who have more passion in trains rather than treating it as a 9 - 5 chore, maybe we are not doing his / her favour as well. Think again. If really cannot, I suggest we dont even ask them, just no videos can liao. (Although bit hard to do BVE, sadzzzz........) . Unless, someone can prove to me actually it is neither and like school like that, need ask permission to go toilets from teachers during lesson time, fine, you win.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And last but not least, it is because of you saying this thread to be pure bull****, dont u dare to deny that makes me boiled!</p>

              <p>Ok, sorry, back to topic, this is simply saying asking the first PSO as accurate answer, fair enough, credits goes to you, but, even if you think by knowing whether are they in authority to give such permission is a suicide, why? You know your teacher got the authority to give permission to leave the classroom during lesson time, so if they deny it is reasonable and understandable, regardless how one may dislike it. But in this case, if station manager in no position to give authority, then tell that they dont and we just walk off with no videos. I dont wish to see any station manager from any rail road in the world pretending to have the authority to yaya papaya first when they are not either. If they dun know if allowed or not, and pity / sympathy with the train fans, they should not permit us to film either, at most he / she should say personally, i will allow but, it is not stated clearly and please do it short and quick if possible to avoid potential troubles. Now the main topic is about unfriendly CSO / PSO abusing power (When they do not have the right stated black and white in transit acts or company policy, and they permit videoing without any fore-warned warning also included in abusing of power, get this straight first). I am sure even if mine maturity is not as high as your proclamied standards, but I am sure I know how to read posts carefully, though I admit that the previous post is a bit too hard and harsh.</p>
