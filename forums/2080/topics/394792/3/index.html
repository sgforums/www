              <p>Ok, sorry, back to topic, this is simply saying asking the first
              PSO as accurate answer, fair enough, credits goes to you, but, even
              if you think by knowing whether are they in authority to give such
              permission is a suicide, why? You know your teacher got the
              authority to give permission to leave the classroom during lesson
              time, so if they deny it is reasonable and understandable,
              regardless how one may dislike it. But in this case, if station
              manager in no position to give authority, then tell that they dont
              and we just walk off with no videos. I dont wish to see any station
              manager from any rail road in the world pretending to have the
              authority to yaya papaya first when they are not either. If they
              dun know if allowed or not, and pity / sympathy with the train
              fans, they should not permit us to film either, at most he / she
              should say personally, i will allow but, it is not stated clearly
              and please do it short and quick if possible to avoid potential
              troubles. Now the main topic is about unfriendly CSO / PSO abusing
              power (When they do not have the right stated black and white in
              transit acts or company policy, and they permit videoing without
              any fore-warned warning also included in abusing of power, get this
              straight first). I am sure even if mine maturity is not as high as
              your proclamied standards, but I am sure I know how to read posts
              carefully, though I admit that the previous post is a bit too hard
              and harsh.</p>

              <p>Let me understand your case first by asking you a simple question.</p>
              <p>Have you tried asking for permission before? How often do you do it and what are the general responses?</p>
              <p>You yourself admitted your previous post was hard and harsh. Since it is hard and harsh, I will obviously read it as hard and harsh, 
              no matter how carefully I read it.</p>

              <p>To end the discussion, I will only answer your question for last and I admit it seemed that the second battle has started due to clarification on earlier posts...... :( :</p>
              <p>No. Because I dont have a recording device, and thus I have no need to do so at the moment which has no responses for comparison, but main thing is I hate a lot on abusing of authority, which you guys seemed to be always side on authority, regardless if it is even correct or not, regardless if one is neutral initially or not, which is something <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>almost</strong></span></em> everyone here dont understand at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Signature: Life is always hard, where got so easy sia........ This is bitter fact and tough battle......., regardless which side are one siding on.</p>
