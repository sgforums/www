            <div class='col-md body'>Once I was on the train to Boon Lay. Didn't realise because I was reading, but next thing I knew, the train overshot Jurong East station (by about 1 1/2 cars) .. and every looked around puzzled.. About half a minute like that, the driver announced there was a "technical failure" and say that we will be skipping that stop.<br><br>So the passengers who is alighting / transfering at JE has to drop at Chinese Garden and switch..

But to do so, he would severely affect train schedules, which are extremely accurate. So he'd rather move on to the next station so that the train schedules arent disrupted</div>

The problem is that he assume he was already inside the train which is a fact for his feet but not his head. So when the MRT going to close doors, people beside siam liao dont want to witness tragedy. And when the MRT close door, the door got his head and he quickly retracted his head back into the train.
