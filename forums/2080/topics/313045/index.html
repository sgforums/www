              <p></p>
              <p>AS A Singaporean and frequent MRT commuter, and on behalf of the many people I know who feel the same, I would like to urge SMRT to review the new announcements of station names that are used in the trains, as well as the announcements on free bus services at certain stations, etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It has been a few weeks since the new announcements were put into use and, for a long time, I had thought the new announcements were recorded by internal staff and was only temporary, or that it was some tertiary students' year-end project. I had thought so simply because the pronunciation, enunciation and intonation of the spoken English was very poor and awkward.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just to name a few of the jarring problems: Orchard was pronounced as something akin to Oooh-church. Yishun sounded something akin to Yeeee-Soon. And among many other pronunciation problems, the intonation of 'Please mind the platform gap' was awfully contorted as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is totally not an issue of 'getting used to it over time'. Neither is it an issue of a local</p>
              <p>Singaporean accent, because even the average Singaporean English does not sound like that. The issue is that the announcer sounded like she deliberately put on some bizarre accent, and added tonal acrobatics, thinking that it will sound like better English.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The English heard in the train announcements just didn't make the cut.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My peers and I are quite appalled to realise that the new change is not temporary but a deliberate 'make-over' which is meant to be used permanently. We take MRT frequently, and the in-train announcements really do make us cringe, every single time.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Recently, I had two groups of foreign friends who were visiting Singapore from Vancouver and London respectively, and while travelling with them in the train, both groups had commented politely but bemusedly at the announcement voice. It was rather embarrassing, but I told them my then honest belief that the in-train announcements were just temporary.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I understand that SMRT may have good intentions in refreshing the announcement system and in hoping that the new announcements will sound younger and friendlier. However, the overhaul is really not very successful. The general sentiment of fellow commuters (including my visiting friends from Vancouver) is that the in-train announcements sounded strange, flirtatious and very 'low budget' (for lack of a better description) instead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Having said that, I do find the other new announcements refreshing - one example being the announcement for reporting of suspicious articles in the station. It sounds younger and sweeter, and words were enunciated clearly and correctly. Similarly, the Mandarin announcements were all enunciated clearly and correctly, and as I do not understand Malay and Tamil I am unable to make any comments.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nonetheless, the 'rights' do not rectify all 'the wrongs' that we hear all the time in the trains. I believe that most people do not mind a new voice for our MRT system. However, it must still adhere to a certain standard of good quality. I hope SMRT will seriously review the new announcements.</p>

              <p>Many people might confuse the C151 cars with the C751 cars on the MRT. The exteriors of the refurbished trains are painted in the new livery: black, red, gray. However, unlike the C751's streamlined-fronted trains, the refurbished C151 units will keep their flat front. The headlights on the C151 refurbished units will stay rectangular, while the C751's were circle from their original condition. The noises of accelerating and braking are different on the C151's and the C751's; the C751's noise is a lot more high-pitched and also a little quieter than the C151's. Inside the C751 cars, seats have a slight curved edge on the top part of the seats; the C151's do not have this feature. Also, the livery on the seats are different: the first and last cars on the C151 refurbished units have red seats, and the middle two cars have a darker shade of green. On the C751's, the seats are pink-purple on cars one and six, and are blue-green in cars three and four. The sky-blue livery stays the same in cars two and five on both sets. The darker-colored priority seats found on the refurbished C151's are not located on C751's. The rims around the windows of the doors can also be used to tell a difference. The refurbished C151's have the metal of the window rims showing, but the C751's rims are painted over (white on the inside side, black on the outside side).</p>

              <p>Question 6: March or April</p>
              <p>Question 22: The station's design shows that it is a station  on EWL. So it is eastbound if its not westbound</p>

              <p>For advertisment questions, I really can't guess them as I do not get the chance to take SMRT trains often. For the questions regarding accidents, it is not about guessing and I do not know the answers because I did not follow the news closely during those days of accidents.</p>

              <p>I remembered that you also had posted short-answer questions and structured eassy questions before.

              <p>Question 38 [B] : In the past, SMRT says that commuters jump onto the MRT tracks on purpose and they may climb over the platform screen doors to commit suicide and also because of the cost. However, in a speech by the Minister for Transport on <span style="color: #000000;">25 January 2008, the government has announced plans for the retrofitting of half-height automatic platform gates on all platforms at all elevated stations by 2012. This was an about turn from the government's previous stance of not supporting the retrofitting of these gates at elevated platforms due to prohibitively high costs. Costs have since fallen due to the popularity of such gates worldwide, making such a project now feasible. The platforms of Bishan Station will have full height platform screen doors retrofitted by 2008. The airconditioning of the platforms meant that full height platform screen doors had to be installed so as to seal in the airconditioning, while also providing a means to enhance platform safety at what will become an interchange station.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> The gates will be installed first at Jurong East Station, Pasir Ris Station and Yishun Station in 2009.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Question 38 [C] : This was partially due to the fact that authorities consider overhead wires to be unsightly and as such do not allow for trains to be powered using this method on elevated lines. Since this line is the first to be fully underground in Singapore, the authorities had a choice between powering the trains on this line by overhead catenary or third rail. An overhead catenary power supply was decided upon.</p>

              <p>Point 1 acceptable.<br>Point 2 acceptable.<br>Point 3 acceptable.<br>Point 4 acceptable.<br>Point 5 wrong. How can the width of the seats be shorter, yet the number of seats decrease? The width of seats in refurbished C151s are wider than unrefurbished C151s.<br>Point 6 acceptable.<br>Point 7 acceptable.<br>Point 8 acceptable.<br>Point 9 wrong. There was no increase or decrease in advertisement panels.<br>Point 10 acceptable.<br>Point 11 acceptable.<br>Point 12 wrong. The emergency call buttons remain in size, only the POSITIONING of the buttons changed.<br>Point 13 acceptable.<br>Point 14 acceptable.<br>Point 15 wrong. Unrefurbished C151s used circular headlights.<br>Point 16 wrong. How do you define clear and dark glass anyway? Refurbished C151s had full glass support but unrefurbished C151s had half-glass support.<br>Point 17 wrong. The flooring of a refurbished C151 is not <strong>WHITE</strong>.<br>Point 18 wrong. How do you know if they're louder anyway? The volume can be controlled.<br>Point 19 wrong.

              <p>For advertisment questions, I really can't guess them as I do not get the chance to take SMRT trains often. For the questions regarding accidents, it is not about guessing and I do not know the answers because I did not follow the news closely during those days of accidents.</p>

              <p>I remembered that you also had posted short-answer questions and structured eassy questions before. I remember one of the question was something like "Building MRT was a good idea in Singapore. Why?" . I would really like to try them and I hope you don't mind posting the short-answer questions and structured eassy questions.</p>
