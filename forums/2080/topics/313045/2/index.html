              <p>5) SMRT regularly has a collaboration with Shaw Organization Cinemas for one of its station, which station is that, and how do customers redeem the discount/free gifts (which are usually valid only on the day of travel)?</p>

              <p>wah seh ur questions all very hard sia, cant answer practically all of them.</p>
              <p>6) i think it's PW2 Teck Lee station. i'm not very sure but i think i read somewhere that PW2 was supposed to connect to a northern spur line that hasnt been built due to no demand, and has a middle platform. never been there before, so i dont really know, dont flame me if my answer is wrong. anyway i dont think the trackway would be in a very good condition now, since the western loop of the punggol LRT isnt open yet, and is unlikely to open anytime in the near future. therefore they wouldnt have any reason to maintain the trackway there.</p>
              <p>10) i feel it's NE15 Buangkok station. around a week before NEL opened, residents there were that buangkok station would remain closed due to a projected lack of sufficient ridership. its not so much about closing the station, but i feel that the very late notice given to the residents there really left a bad image on SBST and LTA. then obviously the residents were very unhappy and kept calling for the station to be opened. then finally the station was opened 1-2 years later, problem solved (for the residents). but now ridership at that station is very low, or at least during the last time i passed by it. it just looks very stupid that SBST/ LTA announced that the station would not open, just before it was due to open. and after it finally opens, ridership is one of the lowest among the NEL stations. just my personal opinion, i dont mean to offend anyone.</p>

              <p>2) Your guess is correct</p>
              <p>3) Yes, but name the block too</p>
              <p>4) Fernvale is one of them, it has side platforms instead of a island platform .Tongkang is not even though it has a linkbridge to Sengkang Depot. I'm looking for major features on the platform for the other 2. note that I edited the question at 10:20+pm to mean 3 stations</p>
              <p>5) No.</p>
              <p>6) Correct</p>
              <p>7) No, it has bus services planned for it as seen from the Northstar excercise.</p>
              <p>8) Correct</p>
              <p>9) No.</p>
              <p>10) Open ended. Accepted the "white elephant incident" reasoning but for the others, I have a counter argument now, Buangkok is starting to be a little more busy right now, HDB blocks are completed with NTUC (24 hours) and Kopitiam opening there.</p>

              <p>According to the looks of Google Earth, Punggol North Line will stop at Teck Lee station. For the north-bound train, it will stop at the west-most platform then fly over and then turn to the right. For the south-bound train, it will merge back before the station and stop at the same platform as the clockwise loop of the Punggol West Line. There is a plot of land for the expansion of the station as currently there is a patch of sand without any trees grown on it towards where the track for the north-bound Punggol North Line is. So the question should be corrected to this:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6) Which LRT Station <strong>in operation</strong> has a center track and what is the state of
                                      the trackway now? Give 2 reasons why do you think so.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I answered it already so nevermind. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then again, the Punggol station centre track is not electrified and there appears to be some sort of buffer before the centre line enters the station. So maybe the centre line haven't even been built yet?</p>

              <p>According to the looks of Google Earth, Punggol North Line will
              stop at Teck Lee station. For the north-bound train, it will stop
              at the west-most platform then fly over and then turn to the right.

              <p>A few questions:</p>
              <p>1) Which <strong>two</strong> stations in the Bukit Panjang LRT
                  system are the odd ones out <strong>besides</strong> Choa Chu Kang
                  and Ten Mile Junction, please note that track configuration is not
                  a factor in consideration for this question.</p>
              <p>2) Which MRT station allows you to walk from Marina Bay to
                  somewhere in Alexandra in less than 135m.</p>
              <p>3) Which is the MRT station whereby a HDB block nearby was
                  affected in such a way that its 1st and 2nd storey residents and
                  shops had to move out, name the block concerned.</p>
              <p>4) Which 3 stations <strong>besides</strong> Sengkang Station,
                  are the odd ones out in the Sengkang LRT system. &lt;= Note edit, 3
                  instead of 2.</p>
              <p>5) SMRT regularly has a collaboration with Shaw Organization
                  Cinemas for one of its station, which station is that, and how do
                  customers redeem the discount/free gifts (which are usually valid
                  only on the day of travel)?</p>
              <p>6) Which LRT Station has a center track, what is the state of
                  the trackway now? Give 2 reasons why do you think so.</p>
              <p>7) Which station is the only one without an emergency bus
                  replacement service planned for it.</p>
              <p>8) What is the purpose of a ticket machine with a swing gate?
                  Generally, what kind of stations have them?</p>
              <p>9) Which station (stations with 2 systems are counted as 1) has
                  10 GTMs, of which 8 are located on a different level as the other
                  2, name the other function besides providing normal tickets (ie
                  Standard ticket/top up) which one of the <strong>two on the
                  different level</strong> has.</p>
              <p>10) (Open ended, no right or wrong answer, just
                  <strong>justify</strong> your points) Which, do you think, is the
                  most pathetic station in the whole MRT/LRT systems, do not include
                  closed stations or uncompleted part of stations.</p>

              <p>Answers:<br><br>1) Bukit Panjang and Fajar. Bukit Panjang has 2 lifts per platform instead of 1, which the other stations have. Fajar's outer loop platform has the lift in the middle, unlike the others, which are at the end of the platform.</p>
              <p>2) Clarke Quay. Artwork on the floor which is a map of Singapore River.</p>
              <p>3) Braddell. Blk 203 Toa Payoh North.</p>
              <p>4) Fernvale. It has side platforms instead of an island platform. Also, the outer loop platform has a closed exit to a future development.<br>Kangkar and Farmway. They are stations without a large emergency platform at the ends. Instead they have the transformer rooms there.</p>
              <p>5) Choa Chu Kang LRT station. Passengers will have to tap their card on a special machine, which will print out the coupon on a piece of thermal paper which you can present it at the Lot 1 Shaw Cineplex.</p>
              <p>6) Punggol. The middle track is covered over. If you look at the ends at the middle of the platform, you can see a trackway. The trackway is for the Punggol North LRT line and is currently unused and not powered.</p>
              <p>7) Ten Mile Junction. Passengers will have to walk to Phoenix or Bukit Panjang station, though it is unknown why they dint direct passengers to Senja.</p>
              <p>8) Its for people who have underpayed or lost their ticket to get their exit ticket to exit the station. It is situated at stations without a customer service office or an exit of a station which have the customer service centre located at another side of the station.</p>
              <p>9) Expo. There are 8 GTMs in the concourse, and 2 at the platform level. GTM 10 is used for the purpose mentioned in 8)</p>
              <p>10) Ten Mile Junction. This station has the smallest entrance, one lift door and one staircase (which cannot be opened from the station itself) are the only entrances to the station. It also has low ridership (as compared to Route A and B), even with the already long 20 minutes frequency. There is no emergency bus service planned for the station and the aircon is controlled by a normal aircon controller which you can find in offices. Luckily Sheng Shiong moved in...if not it would be worse. Simply Pathetic.</p>
