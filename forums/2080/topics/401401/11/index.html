              today's ST headlines stating our govt retaliates that security of train depots is solely the trains' operators responsibility, not the govt. It say the train operators are private companies, hence not govt's responsibilities to take care of the depots' security.
              
              But I just find it weird since this is a transport infrastructure, and public transport is in fact a public service and is intended to reduce the no. of vehicles on the road hence congestion, and LTA is controlling the transport planning, fares, service standards, transport operators are obligued to provide travel concessions to the young and elderly, shouldn't our govt share some (not entire) responsibility in the public transport?
              
              At least I feel that our govt should help to upgrade the depot fencing and electronic security system, then hand over the maintenance and operations to the train operators.
              
              If securing the train depot is solely the operators' responsibility coz they are private companies, how come our govt set up checkpoints at Jurong Island, send police and troops there to patrol and guard the various installations? Aren't these places also run by private companies?

              <p>Jurong Island as a whole is still Government owned and neither Shell / Esso / Keppel Shipyard etc owns the entire Jurong Island. These private companies do secure their own entrace inside the island.</p>

              <p>Oh yes, If government pays some for the depot fencing, then aren't they using <strong>taxpayers</strong> money and does that means, <strong>We, the citizens of Singapore who pays our taxes regularly</strong> (GST, Income Tax etc) have to foot the bill of some blunt errors by a private entity?</p>

              <p>A SWISS national accused of vandalising two carriages of an MRT train, cutting the fence of the Changi depot and entering a protected place is expected to plead guilty when his case comes up on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Oliver Fricker, a 32-year-old business consultant, showed up in court yesterday - his second appearance since June 5 - and the three charges were laid before him.</p>
              <p>In open court yesterday, his lawyer Derek Kang said he would send another letter of representation to the Attorney-General's Chambers in a bid to get his client's charges reduced.</p>
              <p>Following this, Fricker, his lawyer and Deputy Public Prosecutor Sharon Lim went into a pre-trial conference, during which the consultant's next court appearance was tentatively fixed for Thursday.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the Swiss national is out on bail of $100,000, but his passport has been impounded.</p>
              <p>He was taken to court earlier this month for allegedly damaging public property and entering a protected place together with Dane Alexander Lloyd between May 16 and 17. Lloyd, a Briton, has since left the country, and a warrant has been issued for his arrest.</p>

              <p>SWISS IT consultant Oliver Fricker, 32, was sentenced to five months jail and three strokes of the cane on Friday for breaking into a protected place and vandalising an SMRT train by spray-painting two of its carriages</p>
              <p>He had earlier in the day pleaded guilty to committing the offences at MRT Changi depot between May 16 and 17 with his friend, Dane Alexander Lloyd, who has skipped town.</p>
              <p>Deputy Public Prosecutor Sharon Lim said the pair came to know each other in Australia about three years ago, and had been keeping in touch occasionally through e-mail. Earlier this year, the 29-year-old Briton told Fricker he would be coming here for a visit.</p>
              <p>At the end of March, Lloyd e-mailed Mr Arman Alluwie, who sells spray paint in Singapore, to enquire if Ironlak spray paint was available here. He later ordered 11 cans from Mr Arman and requested that they be delivered on May 16.</p>
              <p>That evening, the pair proceeded to SMRT Changi depot to reconnoiter the area and left shortly after because of the rain. Late that evening, both men, each carrying a small bag holding a few cans of spray paint, entered the depot after cutting a hole in the fence.</p>
              <p>Fricker sprayed the word McKoy on the left of the train carriage. The other word Banos was spray-painted on the right. Lloyd took some photographs of their work before they left through the gap.</p>
              <p>Fricker was arrested on May 25. The court heard that SMRT's estimated losses totalled about $11,000.</p>

              <p>No, it is a 5 months jail. And yes, the cane stroke is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>USING ONE to WHIP HORSES</strong></em></span> and not what your parents cane you one. (It <strong>IS WAY THICKER</strong> than your mum's cane and 1 stroke will means your arse got a permeant scar there. Yes, so next time when he s*x with his wife, and she will say "Oh dear! Why there is a scar there?")</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I agree that the jail term might be a bit too short, consider that they dont jail people on Sunday &amp; Public Holidays (No, they dont release people but they reduce the term, so a jail for 2 weeks would probably mean jail for 12 days since there are 2 sundays along it. And if you behave well, your sentence may reduce by up to one third.)</p>

              <p>Ok, but I am not sure thinner or thicker more painful, but what is sure is that the stroke used for caning is one used to whip horse (And no --- Despite I over 18 years old, I did not went to Turf Club @ Kranji to watch horse racing so not sure how thick / thin is the whip used for horses) and it will leave a scar for life. (According to many sources one, such as TV)</p>
