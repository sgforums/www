              <h1 class="storyheadline">2nd suspect may be in HK</h1>
              <p>THE alleged accomplice of Swiss national Oliver Fricker, who is accused of trespass and vandalism at SMRT's Changi depot, is said to have fled to Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>But Lloyd Dane Alexander, from Britain, can still be brought to Singapore even on a vandalism charge, lawyers told The Straits Times yesterday.</p>
              <p>The issue, they said, will depend on where the Briton - for whom a warrant of arrest was issued yesterday by the Singapore police - is caught and whether there is an extradition treaty between that jurisdiction and Singapore.</p>
              <p>Lawyer Shashi Nathan said: 'Extradition is not dependent on the punishment but on the offence. As long as the deed is an offence in both (jurisdictions), extradition is possible.'</p>
              <p>Singapore has an extradition treaty with Hong Kong, which also cites vandalism as an offence.</p>
              <p>The second suspect may choose to fight the extradition but this may be difficult unless he can prove he has a defence such as diplomatic immunity.</p>

                  before a police report was made about the train that was vandalised with
                   graffiti.
                  <br> <br> The company said its staff noticed the graffiti on the train on 17 May 
                  but did not sound the alarm as it was done artistically and they mistook
                   it for an advertisement. 
                  <br> <br> The alarm was raised two days later on 19 May at 4pm by maintenance 
                  staff when the train was recalled to the workshop for scheduled 
                  maintenance. 
                  <br> <br> A police report was made then and investigations led to a discovery of 
                  the security breach at Changi depot.
                  <br> <br> SMRT said it immediately reviewed security measures in all its depots. 
                  The number of security personnel and patrols at each depot has 
                  increased, and security personnel instructed to step up their vigilance.
                  <br> <br> Moving ahead, SMRT said it will improve visibility along the entire 
                  perimeter of the Changi depot, which spans 3 kilometres. The fence will 
                  also be reinforced with barbed coiled wires at the base. 
                  <br> <br> The number of security cameras will also be more than doubled. 
                  <br> <br> There will be additional cameras installed at areas where the trains are
                   launched daily at the depot.

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A warrant of arrest has been issued for Briton Lloyd 
              Dane Alexander, the man suspected to be an accomplice of the Swiss 
              national charged with vandalising an MRT train in Singapore.
              <br> <br> In a statement released late Monday evening, the Police said that, in 
              consultation with the Attorney-General's Chambers, it applied for the 
              arrest warrant and this was granted by the Subordinate Courts.
              <br> <br> It added that Alexander remains at large.
              <br> <br> It has been revealed that he left Singapore before the incident was 
              reported to the police.
              <br> <br> Swiss national 33-year-old Oliver Fricker has been charged with 
              vandalising an MRT train by spraying graffiti on it and damaging public 
              property by cutting a wired fence.
              <br> <br> He was released on Monday after posting a S$100,000 bail. It is believed
               his passport is still impounded to prevent him from leaving the 
              country.
              <br> <br> The incident was said to have taken place between late night of May 16 
              and early hours of May 17 at the Changi Depot. SMRT reported the 
              incident to police only on May 19.
              <br> <br> Fricker, a business consultant who worked in Singapore, was arrested on 
              May 25. 
              <br> <br> Reports said his accomplice, Alexander, may have fled to Hong Kong.
              <br> <br> Vandalism is punishable by up to three years' jail or a maximum fine of 
              S$2,000, plus three to eight strokes of the cane.
              <br> <br> Fricker is scheduled to appear in court again on June 21.

              <p>Another honest mistake ?</p>
              <p>It is simply disgusting to disguise the lapse of security for mistaken identity.</p>
              <p>Why is it that a bomb hoax call pranksters can be jailed and the company that have failed its basic responsibilty can run off scot free ?</p>
              <p>What happened if one of the train was in a real event and thousand of communter would have been injured or killed ?</p>
              <p>If the government agency are acting blur on these security lapse, they themselves should also be prosecuted.</p>
              <p>All citizens regardless of who you are are equal.</p>
              <p>The government and the CEO of SMRT owe the communters a proper explanation.</p>
              <p>After so much emphasis on national security, it turn soft when it happened to one of its own company.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline2">Staff mistook graffiti for ad or artwork; alarm raised only after 2 days</h1>
              <p></p>
              <div class="byline">By Maria Almenoar &amp; Teh Joo Lin</div>
              <p></p>
              <div class="ststory_large"> 
              <p> SMRT workers did not react to glaring graffiti on two carriages because they brushed it off as an advertisement or artwork, the train operator said yesterday.</p>
              <p>Consequently, a serious breach in the perimeter fence of its Changi depot - a hole opened either late on May 16 or in the early hours of May 17, according to police - went undiscovered for almost two full days.</p>
              <p>Breaking a nearly week-long silence on the incident, SMRT said that inaction on its part led to a delay in alerting the authorities. Meanwhile, the train was allowed to run in full view of train users for that length of time, leading to a YouTube video posted by a commuter.</p>
              <p>The gaffe was admitted yesterday by SMRT's chief executive Saw Phaik Hwa, who apologised for the 'serious lapse'. In its statement, SMRT said its staff noticed the graffiti on the two train carriages on May 17, but thought nothing of it.</p>
              <p>The first time someone noticed that something was amiss was at 4pm on May 19, when the train pulled into SMRT's workshop for routine maintenance.</p>
              <p>Given the seriousness of the breach, SMRT has been asked to give a full account of what happened to the police and the Land Transport Authority, said the Ministry of Transport in response to queries yesterday from The Straits Times.</p>

              <p>Man the depot staff is worst than us. We know that the metal part under the doors is the most difficult part to clean, who would paste ad stickers there? Even the depot staff was like less than 20m from the track connecting EB, still =.="</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SMRT CEO Fault, pushes the blame to Depot staff. Then I bet that poor depot staff is going to get fired just to make the nation happy although its the upstairs fault</p>
