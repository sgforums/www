              <p>Dear SMRT:</p>
              <p>We are the C651s and we have written(although we paid someone to
              do it as we have no hands)to you to ask of the timing of our
              refurbishment.We have been serving you for about since 1994,giving
              you profit,and suffering acid rain and hot sun.</p>
              <p>Look at the rest of our family.They all have some black
              livery,even Uncle C751A.We cannot wait until 2010 3/4 or 4/4 or
              2011.Brother C151 has got a new coat of paint,sets of STARIS,and
              Wheelchair acessable doors.We <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> want that
              too.Besides,Black looks good on us.Whats even more unfair is that
              Sister C751B came in refurbished and in black livery.</p>
              <p>We deserve refurbishment.If you don't Refurbish us soon,we'll
              all call you (censored).</p>

              <p>Dear Boss, SMRT Cooperation</p>
              <p>My 18 brothers and I , C651s, have been serving you, SMRT Corp, ever since the year 1994. This awesome handwriting was written by my employer's employee. We have been tanning under this hot sun for years. Suffering from thunderstorms, acid rain and helping you to boost profits.</p>
              <p>Our 66 brothers came in white too but they got refurbished just a few years back. They received better motors, a nicer coating, more jobs, cooler A/C and wheelchair-accessible door. Their new coat looks awesomely nice SERIOUS! You won't even notice if there is a speck of dust on it. </p>
              <p>For us, dust is collecting on us for at least a decade. Our sisters C751B came in with a black coat of painting and motors that can run faster than us ; About 1.5x faster than us and my brothers. Our 25 nephews C751As came automatically. They have such a large window! Everyone loves to crowd around them but they have been ranting about the dull tunnels they have been travelling. They envy us seriously but we think its the other way. Their counterparts are able to see the sun and the moon every day, any time. They sleep on top of the depot! They travel through modern flats daily. </p>
              <p>We deserve refurbishment if not we will go on strike. We will : Breakdown in the middle of Expo and Changi Airport, Jurong East to Bukit Batok (The single track), Khatib and Yio Chu Kang, Raffles Place and City Hall, Tanah Merah and Expo, last but no least, The tracks towards Changi Depot, Bishan Depot and Ulu Pandan Depot!</p>
              <p>If you attempt to tow us back, we will let the passengers alight and jam the emergency brakes. It will cause disruption until you decide to refurbish us.</p>
              <p>We, C651s, give you 1 day to decide or the above will happened. You will suffered millions in that way. WE are giving you an offer that you can't reject! We are solving two problems with 1 letter!</p>
              <p>You better refurbish us if not..._ _ _ _ You </p>

              <p>Dear SMRT and SBST:</p>
              <p>We are the C830s and the C751As respectively.We know that we come from rivalling companies but we share a common boredom--The same scenery all day long.</p>
              <p>We travel day after day running,braking,and opening our doors for the profits of you.At the end of the day,what do you do?You put us in giant buildings <strong>underground(C830s)</strong>.We travel through <strong>underground</strong> tunnels.We envy our brothers and sisters who get to see the sunshine every day,able to breathe in fresh air,watch crowds of people pass by below them.The C751As have been doing this again and again for 7 years already,and want a change of scenery.</p>
              <p>The C830s are not used to this <strong>underground </strong>tunnel,compared to their test site back in Alstom.They need some Large sized headache pills to cure their plobrem.And everyday,students rush in from Bartley(no hard feelings)and starting running and playing with our grap poles as if they were firemen's slides.</p>
              <p>We do hope for a response.Thank you for your gentle patience,and have a nice day.    Yours faithfully,                                                                                             </p>
