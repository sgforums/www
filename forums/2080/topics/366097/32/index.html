              <p> LATEST : <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">19 C651s went on strike! (FICTION)</span></strong></p>
              <p>There are 3 types of trains that run on the North South Line and East West Line. C151s, C651s and C751Bs.</p>
              <p>C651s also known as the white trains have went on strike from 4th June onwards. All 114 train sets went on strike after their employer, SMRT Corp. , refused to refurbished them as planned due to rising costs. As a result, all 19 trains failed to move when the emergency brakes were applied to change mode on a rainy day. </p>
              <p>The 19 trains were able to be towed to the nearest stations so that all passengers could alight. When the train was crossing over to the middle track to be towed back to their respective depots, all the trains mysteriously applied EMG brakes when no TO was in the cabin. The TO went in to reset it but to no avail. After 12 hours of consideration, their employer, SMRT Corp. , refused to refurbished them.</p>
              <p>The C151s that coupled the C651s were unable to decouple as the C651s held the C151s hostage. The strike led to a 3 day long disruption until their employee decided to refurbished them next year.</p>
              <p>The C651s were still unhappy as dust were collecting on their body and most of them were adless.</p>
              <p>The employee threaten their employer that all their motors will fail too if they refused to refurbished them immediately. After 12 hours, SMRT Corp. gave in and refurbished all 19 C651s within 6 months.</p>
