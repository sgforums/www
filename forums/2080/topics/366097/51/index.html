              <p>No CHD and UPD can hold 30 trains, that gives 60 trains and adding that with BSD's 46 trains slot, it means 106 trains can be hold in 3 depots.</p>
              <p>We got 66X C151, 19X C651 and 21X C751B --&gt; 66 + 19 + 21 = 106, just nice!</p>
              <p>But yes, Tuas Depot can hold 60 trains (Became main depot liao!), minus 22X of C151A, there will be 28X of new trains, which I think that will be enough to use it for Kallang Extension (I predict that Kallang Line will not be built, instead, being part of Kallang Extension, which connects Ang Mo Kio, Toa Payoh East, [might not be] St Michael / Whampoa, Boon Keng, Kallang Bahru - Kallang Basin, Kallang MRT (Initally was planned to interchange with Lavender according to 1996 LTA whitepaper), Stadium (If interchange with Lavender, then Nicoll Highway should be the choice, but...... and Mountbatten is simply too far swing le as it is more closer to Aljunied despite there people in non SGF speculating it as the Mountbatten's location was a bit weird in the middle of the road junction, which will be described later in Plan 2), Marina East (Interchange with one of the Eastern Region Line station along there, or possibly ... Tanjong Rhu), Marina Pier (And return to existing NSL).</p>
              <p>Look, initally they plan to extend the NSL from Marina Bay further South to Marina Pier and then go backward Northwards to Marina Barrage (Yes, the extension was like a U shape, if u look from Marina Bay point of view). But, that will means too near to a space-less Promenade and "infertile / impotent" Nicoll Highway (Due to the collapse, I think unless I am the Transport Minister, Nicoll Highway will not be an Interchange station ever as announced.) and from what I look from the concept plan (1996 LTA whitepaper) , Kallang Line was a planned line with 16km, with the fact that between Bishan Park to Kallang MRT station is about 6800m (I saw that on Kallang MRT station near the park connector), which hints that the first 8 ~ 9km will be between Ang Mo Kio to Kallang, and the remaining half of the line must go to the Marina areas, which will be wasteful of trains for not linking them up. I can forsee that the middle platform in Ang Mo Kio will be used for trains going towards Kallang via Boon Keng (Left doors open, facing the Marina Bay bound via Dhoby Ghaut) and those Jurong East bound train that comes from Boon Keng might open the doors on the Jurong East bound, which is the "right door, in the previously mention direction's point of view" --- or it might not because that is wasting resources (Or rather may causes the trains to jam up when approaching / leaving Ang Mo Kio since the track split is rather far).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do note that my Plan 2 specluation, is a bit impossible, but that might be the case if they want to Interchange with Mountbatten.<br>Ang Mo Kio, Bishan Depot (All the way baby, the above solution will involves a "JEMP" in BSD, named as "BDMP -- Bishan Depot Modification Project" so as to add a new crossover towards Toa Payoh East but with this Plan 2, most likely will not need it), Interchange with Lorong Chuan, Interchange with Woodleigh, Joo Seng, Kallang Pudding / MacPherson Road (Not to be confused with CCL MacPherson station) --- which is where the Aljunied Park resides, Sims Drive / Geylang East [near the junction there?], Interchange with Aljunied MRT station, Interchange with Mountbatten, Interchange with ERL's Tanjong Rhu and continue the plan above mentioned.</p>

              <p>No CHD and UPD can hold 30 trains, that gives 60 trains and
              adding that with BSD's 46 trains slot, it means 106 trains can be
              hold in 3 depots.</p>
              <p>We got 66X C151, 19X C651 and 21X C751B --&gt; 66 + 19 + 21 =
              106, just nice!</p>
              <p>But yes, Tuas Depot can hold 60 trains (Became main depot
              liao!), minus 22X of C151A, there will be 28X of new trains, which
              I think that will be enough to use it for Kallang Extension (I
              predict that Kallang Line will not be built, instead, being part of
              Kallang Extension, which connects Ang Mo Kio, Toa Payoh East,
              [might not be] St Michael / Whampoa, Boon Keng, Kallang Bahru -
              Kallang Basin, Kallang MRT (Initally was planned to interchange
              with Lavender according to 1996 LTA whitepaper), Stadium (If
              interchange with Lavender, then Nicoll Highway should be the
              choice, but...... and Mountbatten is simply too far swing le as it
              is more closer to Aljunied despite there people in non SGF
              speculating it as the Mountbatten's location was a bit weird in the
              middle of the road junction, which will be described later in Plan
              2), Marina East (Interchange with one of the Eastern Region Line
              station along there, or possibly ... Tanjong Rhu), Marina Pier (And
              return to existing NSL).</p>
              <p>Look, initally they plan to extend the NSL from Marina Bay
              further South to Marina Pier and then go backward Northwards to
              Marina Barrage (Yes, the extension was like a U shape, if u look
              from Marina Bay point of view). But, that will means too near to a
              space-less Promenade and "infertile / impotent" Nicoll Highway (Due
              to the collapse, I think unless I am the Transport Minister, Nicoll
              Highway will not be an Interchange station ever as announced.) and
              from what I look from the concept plan (1996 LTA whitepaper) ,
              Kallang Line was a planned line with 16km, with the fact that
              between Bishan Park to Kallang MRT station is about 6800m (I saw
              that on Kallang MRT station near the park connector), which hints
              that the first 8 ~ 9km will be between Ang Mo Kio to Kallang, and
              the remaining half of the line must go to the Marina areas, which
              will be wasteful of trains for not linking them up. I can forsee
              that the middle platform in Ang Mo Kio will be used for trains
              going towards Kallang via Boon Keng (Left doors open, facing the
              Marina Bay bound via Dhoby Ghaut) and those Jurong East bound train
              that comes from Boon Keng might open the doors on the Jurong East
              bound, which is the "right door, in the previously mention
              direction's point of view" --- or it might not because that is
              wasting resources (Or rather may causes the trains to jam up when
              approaching / leaving Ang Mo Kio since the track split is rather
              far).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do note that my Plan 2 specluation, is a bit impossible, but
              that might be the case if they want to Interchange with
              Mountbatten.<br> Ang Mo Kio, Bishan Depot (All the way baby, the above solution will
              involves a "JEMP" in BSD, named as "BDMP -- Bishan Depot
              Modification Project" so as to add a new crossover towards Toa
              Payoh East but with this Plan 2, most likely will not need it),
              Interchange with Lorong Chuan, Interchange with Woodleigh, Joo
              Seng, Kallang Pudding / MacPherson Road (Not to be confused with
              CCL MacPherson station) --- which is where the Aljunied Park
              resides, Sims Drive / Geylang East [near the junction there?],
              Interchange with Aljunied MRT station, Interchange with
              Mountbatten, Interchange with ERL's Tanjong Rhu and continue the
              plan above mentioned.</p>

              <p>LOL. Seriously I pity those living near MRT tracks without any buffer (Multi-story car park). Lol, its crazily loud. aprox 350m away from the tracks at Sims Place can hear.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW Tuas Depot can hold up to 60 trains. Maybe UPD might become NSL property LOL. Actually maybe its for future if there is higher demand. With the new trains, we can achieve 2 mins frequency. But when NSL and EWL extensions are done, I doubt we can keep to 2 mins frequency maybe 2.5 mins is the minimum. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Using the middle track? Thats pretty useless. Its duplicating NEL, A LRT will be feasible since it doesn't pass through the highly dense areas. Sims seems pretty ulu lol. </p>
              <p>With the JEMP done, they could do another modification for it to extend southwards but maybe its a waste of $$. See the trains are seperated by 1 track. If the trains arrives at the other side, must go concourse and go up again. =.= </p>

              <p>1st: It will not be possible for NSL to extend it Southwards from Jurong East because even if they change the new track to go below EWL (Distance consideration will tell u not feasible), it would be simply too near to International Business Park's building. Given the noise of the train can make, a common sense will tell you that it will not be possible even if there is such demand. (A Jurong Region LRT would be possible)</p>
              <p>2nd: In what way will this Kallang Extension duplicates NEL? (Maybe the Kallang Basin - Kallang Bharu yes, but others leh?). Oh yes, the tour guide in the LTG tour (16 June 2010) did asked me one question when I asked her on this idea,: "Do you think that there is such demand?" For hell sure that I dont live there and so I dont know the demand. (Yes, she mentioned maybe that sector is more feasible for LRT than a MRT system --- .......?)</p>
