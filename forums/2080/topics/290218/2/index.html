It's just how people understand it.<br><br>Airbus mentioned about the turnover of trains at Yishun, which I find it VERY reasonable. Would you like to wait 2 minutes at a stop in the heartlands, or 7 mins in the CBD area? Many people do not understand why SMRT used Yishun as a stopover point.<br><br>Firstly, Yishun has a side track, which allows trains to change direction while main services are still going on. Note that when they built Yishun stations and it's tracks, they had already guessed that due to the large number of housing estates like TPY, AMK and YIS, passenger volumes would be very high at this section after CBD area. Thus they built the side track even before they had announced that trains would begin turning over at Yishun during peak hours. If you ask me, that's a genius way of thinking.<br><br>It gets really irritating when a Yishun-bound train stops at YIS only to see people REFUSING to alight. I've even seen people pretending to sleep until the train officer blows the whistle at him. Then he walks out of the train with a long and ugly face as if someone had offended him. Come on, trains have to be on schedule. Unless you don't want 8 or 9 mins intervals again, continue doing that. Singaporeans are really shooting their own legs. They did something morally wrong, then they claim fault on SMRT. SMRT has a schedule to follow, and when commuters messes it up, train intervals increases. Although it may seem like SMRT was at fault, if we can turn the tables around, we can see how selfish commuters really are. Especially the YIS scenario.<br><br>I'm really not siding SMRT; they do have their flaws, but at least I've seen enough on the Singapore railways to know that Singaporeans are really selfish and stupid, because they can't use their common sense and think out of the box.</div>

Sure if Airbus gets fed up and he makes a fuss out of it, bans me, DO I CARE? At least I've achieved something in my life. I did my best to rebut someone. It doesn't matter if I lose, because I know that my points are valid.<br><br>Mind you, if Airbus can use something really good to win my arguments, I will say sorry; but if he uses forum power to win me, he is no less childish than a 3 year old kid, who can't accept losing. So it's up to him. I don't care if I'm banished from this forum; I can go somewhere else.<br><br>P.S.: For tintinspartan... different case lah.
