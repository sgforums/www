If other countries can maintain their train system well, why can't SMRT ? Look at the tube system in London  and the MTR in HK. Low ridership? Please tell me you are kidding with me. Have you ever taken MRT during peak hours? Have you taken MRT from yishun to sembawang when some of the trains terminate at Yishun ? Bullcrap !</div>
