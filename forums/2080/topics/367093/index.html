              <p>not sure if u guys experience this before, but in underground stations, it seems that when the outer doors close, there's this really huge gust of strong wind that just blows out from the doors or something......</p>
              <p>can anyone explain?! i'm not sure if all underground stations have this effect, but tanjong pagar mrt which i use everyday seems to have it.</p>
              <p>if you want to experience, then around 6:30 PM, wait there for half an hour and i can guarantee you'll experience it a few times at least.</p>
              <p>the wind is comparable to very strong beach winds......something like a wind tunnel with immense winds blown into it.</p>
              <p>not sure if this is due to the mrt propulsion system?!!!! maybe some expert can clear this thing up. the wind is strong enough to destroy your gatsby hairstyle.</p>

              half an hour and i can guarantee you'll experience it a few times
              at least.</p>
              <p>the wind is comparable to very strong beach winds......something
              like a wind tunnel with immense winds blown into it.</p>
              <p>not sure if this is due to the mrt propulsion system?!!!! maybe
              some expert can clear this thing up. the wind is strong enough to
              destroy your gatsby hairstyle.</p>

              <p>2nd, if there's already a medication for it, it's no longer any strange illness... tons of research would have been put into it! tat's such an oxymoron or r u just a moron? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> </p>
              <p>and u mean to say if there's medication for it, it's okay to have that illness???!!! so in your 'logic', since there's tamiflu for H1N1, so it's okay for u to get it lor? oh but wait, u're not taking the medication cos u don't believe in the useless medical research done by those "goon-doos"...</p>

              <p>don't get me wrong.....what i said is, if there's medication for an illness, then when you get that illness, at least it's not so bad since still got cure.</p>
              <p>imagine you get AIDs (choy!).</p>
              <p>you go see your family clinic doctor.</p>
              <p>he gives you injection because there's already a cure for AIDs.</p>
              <p>at night, u feel so well and alive and healthy again.</p>
              <p>that's an example above. i'm sure most people won't be even scared of AIDs even if they get it, as long as there's a cure (like your normal fever or flu, where u see family doctor and get well in 1 days time etc).</p>
              <p>of course, we know currently there's no cure for AIDs due to the "very efficient work of those highly talented scientists". just an example.</p>
