              <p>Sorry for late reply to posts and concerns in this forum.</p>
              <p>I agree to the point that some folks here raise question about frequent posting and such. Foremost, I deal mostly in technical aspects of railways. Frankly, when talking about STARIS and local MRT, I have little to talk about. But its all about trains, and diversity isn't it? Having moderators who deal with train deployment and operational aspect, I feel that this forum needs a person who can be a cornerstone for the technical side. Hence this is why I raised my hand and offered myself.</p>
              <p>I trust that there are folks who can answer technical stuff as well, but face it, these information normally do not surpass what is obtained on the Internet and mouth-to-mouth level. I have done research into train mechanics for little over 4 years, answering automobile and train mechanics questions is a daily matter even to school, layman or enthusiasts. Based on experience, I would feel the maturity of knowledge at this level versus the age. I am not a professional yet, and I won't be attaining that level unless I work with those machines everyday.</p>
              <p>Yes, knowledge on local context may still be limited, but its all about learning, isn't it? I learn everyday, people correct me and I gladly absorb. Life long learning, this is how its supposed to be, and hence when offering myself as this position, I also make it a point to have a concentrated technical thread for folks who have random questions to ask or answer so everyone can learn. Everyone can answer and learn at the end of the day.</p>
              <p>I hope folks who have not seen me in-person or posting around here can give me a chance to help out in the various duties and questions here.</p>
              <p>At local level, its the usual track and rolling stock technical aspects. At international level, I concentrate on Japan railways, rolling stock, signaling, diagram scheduling, accident records and investigations, safety devices and history.</p>
