              <p>Well,the problem is a moderator is to moderate the forum and not necessary to push the forum's rank up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think the forum owner has his reason to put the mods in place. So, my suggestion is to allow new moderators such as wenjie639, BATL and possibly smrt3099 and even to people like youyuan and Khairiano while retaining all existing moderators (To respective TF's forum owner's decision). Regarding NickLim and Interception_7, I think that they are deserved as well (For helping in Train forums, including taking FOSMRT forms and managed to organized a depot tour), but they have IRF (So should respect the 2 intention as well) !</p>
              <p>Sometimes, a mod just do a backbencher job. And most of the time, the forum is quite peaceful and the flamewars previously happened was quickly edited / locked within a day. (Either by user's self-restraint or with the mod's intervention or both). Well, dont forget that there is SGWiki on trains. Prehaps the Train Forum's owner can check who is contributing more on SG Trains Wiki (I dont contribute much btw, it is not kind of self-praise or what)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(Just like a CSO being too inactive le, usually they do not drive the C830s)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents thought, if BusSpeeder is removed from mod post, then SBS9899U should be removed from TF's owner post as well. Reason being both of them are too MIA. (Not possible right? So not fair to BusSpeeder in the first place)</p>

              <p>Inactive =/= mod? Come on, there are other forums with same situation. What's the big deal? Instead of kpkb about the "inactive" mods, why don't you guys even encourage them to be more active or provide pleasant suggestions than to overthrow their positions?</p>

              <p>I dont quite agree on "Knowlegeable doesn't mean you must be a mod". This is because I think it is a way to retain talents and obviously, increase that person's credibility. But yeah, I agree that all mods should be retain as mod unless there is evidence saying that he / she is breaching the rules of the forum / abuse power or they show no more interest in train or have RIP.</p>

              <p>You cant say them childish, because some of these acts are illegal (Boarding DNB / how to get into depots / unopened stations without permission) while there are others are more grey areas (Photo / Video taking, some staffs do it differently, and it is definitely going to cause unhappiness de.)</p>

              <p>As I say, flamming in all forums do exist, just that for certain niche hobbies forum, be it a car, train, bus spot or a pet forums is less likely to have trolls and flame wars compared to sensitive issues such as politics and religion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But that does not mean we need no mods. It is just Singapore is less likely to be attacked by other country as we generally take a diplomatic approach to most / all countries, does not equate we do need to have an army. (Ok, dont flame on the use of our army when the security is so lousy where people can anyone go in and out of protected areas and do whatever they liked, including but not limited to depots to vandal a train)</p>
