              <p>WORK has started on the second phase of the Downtown Line (DTL), which will connect residents in Bukit Panjang and Bukit Timah to the city.</p>
              <p>Transport Minister Raymond Lim launched the start of construction on Friday morning in a groundbreaking ceremony near Beauty World Plaza.</p>
              <p>The 16.6km DTL2 will have 12 stops and is expected to be completed by 2015. It starts from Bukit Panjang, passes through the Bukit Timah corridor and runs to Rochor.</p>
              <p>From there, it will link up with the first phase of the line, which loops around the Marina Bay area and the Central Business District.</p>
              <p>The new line is expected to cut travelling times by up to 30 per cent.</p>
              <p>Speaking to an audience that included Bukit Panjang and Bukit Timah residents, Mr Lim said: 'Those who live, work and go to school in this area will enjoy a completely new way to travel.'</p>
              <p>Residents, however, would have to put up with a series of road traffic diversions as the stations are constructed.</p>
              <p>Upper Bukit Timah Road, for example, will be realigned from as early as the fourth quarter of this year for the building of Beauty World station.</p>
              <p>However, the Land Transport Authority stressed that traffic capacity will not drop as diverted roads will go through a lane-for-lane replacement.</p>
              <p>'As with other major rail construction projects, there will some disruption and inconvenience... I seek the understanding of residents, motorists and other commuters in this area,' said Mr Lim.</p>
              <p>The $12 billion Downtown Line is being built in three phases and will be fully completed in 2016. The third phase will eventually run to the eastern part of Singapore, passing through Macpherson and ending at Expo.</p>

              <p><strong>Work on MRT Downtown Line phase 2 starts</strong></p>
              <p><a class="reply_topic" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/440220/1/.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/440220/1/.html</a></p>
              <p> <span>SINGAPORE: Work on phase two of the MRT Downtown Line (DTL2)
                  started on Friday. When DTL2 opens in 2015, residents and students
                  along the Bukit Timah corridor can enjoy faster access to the city
                  area.
                  <br> <br>The S$12 billion Downtown Line consists of three phases. Phase one
                  of the line (DTL1) is on schedule to open in 2013, while tenders for
                  phase three of the line will be called next year.
                  <br> <br>The ground-breaking ceremony for the start of construction for the
                  DTL2 was held near Beauty World Plaza, one of the first sites to begin
                  work.
                  <br> <br>Transport Minister Raymond Lim was the guest-of-honour at the
                  ceremony. Representatives from six firms which won part of the 10 civil
                  contracts were also present to give their pledge for work safety.
                  <br> <br>DTL2 will run from Bukit Panjang, along the Bukit Timah corridor
                  and terminate at Rochor Station, where passengers can connect at Bugis
                  to DTL1.
                  <br> <br>60,000 students from 32 schools along DTL2 will also benefit when
                  it opens six years later. The schools include Zhenghua Primary and
                  Fajar Secondary at the northern end, and Lasalle SIA College and the
                  Singapore Management University (SMU) in town.
                  <br> <br> All 12 stations will be built underground, each with unique designs.
                  <br> <br>Due to the presence of hard granite rocks at the depot area, the
                  Land Transport Authority (LTA) had carried out blasting work for over a
                  year, and it will employ the use of tunnel boring machines for the rest
                  of the line.
                  <br> <br>LTA CEO, Yam Ah Mee, said: "We are using 19 tunnel boring machines
                  to get the work done, all underground with minimal disruptions."
                  <br> <br> But certain disruptions are unavoidable, especially when stations are built using the cut-and-cover method.
                  <br> <br>Mr Yam said: "We also plan to minimise inconvenience to residents
                  by having very comprehensive engagement with the community as well as
                  very comprehensive traffic diversion plan at each of the areas when
                  work is being done."
                  <br> <br>LTA says the Rochor and Beauty World stations will have the most
                  extensive work, with Rochor Canal and Upper Bukit Timah Road to be
                  realigned.
                  <br> <br> But residents and merchants are happy that work on DTL2 has finally begun.
                  <br> <br>Currently, residents along the Bukit Timah corridor will have to
                  take the bus and ride on the North-South or East-West Line to get to
                  town or the east.
                  <br> <br>However with the completion of DTL2 in 2015, their journey will be
                  reduced by 5 to 25 minutes, or up to 30% of the total travelling time.</span></p>
