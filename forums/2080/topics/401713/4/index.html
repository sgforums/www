              <p>I think it's good to make thing clear. May be rude/disturbing</p>
              <p>If you want to have such an interview, maybe its good to inform more people, and as you know, more views are better than that 7 or 8. Not good to only tell people of what happens after it's over. Or finding out thru third party sources.</p>
              <p>If you want to organize things, maybe be more open to ideas, have more people. I think if this kind of unopened things are organised, then might as well cancel it all. Its The END, of all activities!</p>

              <p>I totally agree with this. If you plan to only make this known to a few people, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">please</span> do not announce it in a forum or a medium where everyone is able to see it.</p>
              <p>Since the interview was over before the creation of this thread, why is there a need to post this here. This equals to a redundant thread. In addition the interview only featured very few people.</p>
              <p>This will give the wrong idea to fellow forumers seeing this thread that there's an upcoming interview and they can try participating. However, after viewing the thread, it totally gave the wrong impression and people will be very upset and furious.</p>

              <p>Having read The Sunday Times this morning, it really intrigued me to come on this forum to take a look. It certainly impressed me that there are so many teenagers who are so enthusiastic about trains. </p>
              <p>Yes, I am a female. I wouldn't say I am a train enthusiast or a train fan. However, having been working in the train industry for about 5 years, I should say I know the trains quite well. I would say, at least 40% of my department and the train design department are females. Our knowledge on trains are not just knowing the train number, the year that it is made, the colour of the seats and the sound of the train. </p>
              <p>Before buying of new trains and open for tender, a whole team of staffs will hold numerous meetings to discuss on the design and specifications of trains require. Even simple control and mechanism of closing and opening of doors will take weeks to discuss. After that, contractors will submit their designs and members will have to review each and every design documents submitted before deciding which contractor to be awarded to. Factors like the energy consumption, the efficiency of the brake and propulsion system, the safety features, the signalling and communication equipments onboard the train and even spares and warranty. After the trains are shipped to Singapore, countless testing and commissioning are conducted before they are announced fit for revenue. The biggest challenge comes after the testing is to maintain the whole fleet of trains. The trains in Singapore are made by different contractors and they are made from different era as well, ranging from 1987 till 2009. The diversified technologies and sub systems are definitely a challenge for the maintenance team.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, I know the female comment is just a casual remark cos I've dealt with the media before. They always like to have 'sparks' and 'dramatic' reports. </p>
              <p>You will be coming down to KCD on Friday? So I think I will be seeing you there cos most likely my staffs will be in charged of the tour.</p>
