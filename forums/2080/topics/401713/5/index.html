              <p>anw, thanks for everything. I apologise for some miscommunication. All this is coming to the end i supposed.

              <p>Having read The Sunday Times this morning, it
               really intrigued
                                      me to come on this forum to take a look. It 
              certainly impressed me
                                      that there are so many teenagers who are so 
              enthusiastic about
                                      trains. </p>
              <p>Yes, I am a female. I wouldn't say I am a 
              train enthusiast or a
                                      train fan. However, having been working in the 
              train industry for
                                      about 5 years, I should say I know the trains 
              quite well. I would
                                      say, at least 40% of my department and the train
               design department
                                      are females. Our knowledge on trains are not 
              just knowing the train
                                      number, the year that it is made, the colour of 
              the seats and the
                                      sound of the train. </p>
              <p>Before buying of new trains and open for 
              tender, a whole team of
                                      staffs will hold numerous meetings to discuss on
               the design and
                                      specifications of trains require. Even simple 
              control and mechanism
                                      of closing and opening of doors will take weeks 
              to discuss. After
                                      that, contractors will submit their designs and 
              members will have
                                      to review each and every design documents 
              submitted before deciding
                                      which contractor to be awarded to. Factors like 
              the energy
                                      consumption, the efficiency of the brake and 
              propulsion system, the

               the whole fleet of
                                      trains. The trains in Singapore are made by 
              different contractors
                                      and they are made from different era as well, 
              ranging from 1987
                                      till 2009. The diversified technologies and sub 
              systems are
                                      definitely a challenge for the maintenance team.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, I know the female comment is 
              just a casual remark
                                      cos I've dealt with the media before. They 
              always like to have
                                      'sparks' and 'dramatic' reports. </p>
              <p>You will be coming down to KCD on Friday? So I
               think I will be

              <p>Actually I hope to see CCL4 and 5 open by March 2011, because CCL3 open on May 2009, CCL 1 and 2 open on Apr 2010, so it got some logical pattern.</p>

              <p>BTW, if that is the case, will it be opening at the same date with Woodleigh as well? (Its a pity that Woodleigh is not an interchange with CCL, if not epic win le)</p>
