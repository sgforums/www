              <p>U cannot say like that. People who choose to suicide is not because they like it, it is more like a moment cannot handle the load of stress, u tink being adult so easy ah? In schooling age (Secondary / Poly etc), u just worry of Plan A and "C" where A = Academic and C = Career (Bad grades = No career in future, and poly students may not get industrial attachments, this is subjective and OT) and possibly "Plan B" (Which is the "something extra", go figure it youself.). But adult is not that simple. So, u get what I mean, these suiciders should really seek professional help such as counselling etc.</p>
