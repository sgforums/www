              <p>For East Coast Park, we have Eastern Region Line to serve in Marine Parade areas (By 2020)</p>
              <p>For Changi Village, most likely it would be served by North Shore / Coast Line by 2025 (They would announce it after Eastern Region Line, well, that was planned in <strong>1996</strong>)</p>
              <p>For Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal, you got 35 (Damn long but lucky now got aircon) and most likely it would be covered by Eastern Region Line and possibly Downtown Line Stage 3 Extension (Stage 4a? --- Stage 4b / 5 would be the Bukit Panjang - Kranji link along the Woodlands Road and I think there is no reason to link DTL to Yew Tee in terms of Geographically.) in order to enhance the inter-connectivity of ERL.</p>

(Bold refers to line along Kallang River and more likely to be built, the Lavender sector is unlikely to be granted thanks to the collapse but they could always change it to Kallang, Stadium / Mountbatten, Tanjong Rhu, Marina East, Marina Pier and link back to existing NSL!) Another thing would be on Tanjong Katong Road, so that Paya Lebar middle track is put into full use. (Both are also concepted in <strong>1996</strong> whitepaper)</p>

              <p>Huh? What is that? A NSL branch line? I thought Simpang or Canberra would be the station "NS12" between Yishun and Sembawang?</p>

              <p>Or could that be an Yishun / Sembawang or Simpang LRT OR it would be part of North Shore Line? Nobody knows. Sengkang Punngol LRT case is a failure, just like Sengkang Punggol Football club. How come they dont want to do a direct LRT shuttle service, it would be nice to see in terms of scenery and cost efficient (Not sure when DBTF comes in) and it is a pity for Punngol North spur line NOT to connect in PE4 and act like a B shaped in the Punngol (North) East side which could have saved the need to have a new platform in PW2 and middle track in Punggol (Covered by the dunno what that makes the platform looks so wide).</p>

              <p>IDK. The Punggol North part whoever who design it should be sacked 100 times from any job he takes. He fails seriously. Make that _ _ _ _ ing split after the station towards Punggol Point not before you _______________ . A "B" shape LRT would affect frequencies instead. The curve from Coney Island station back to PE4 would be too great unless you could make a roller coast 180 degree turn. </p>
              <p>The middle track at Punggol LRT Station is not to affects train coming from behind.</p>
              <p>Trains going to Punggol North (Coney Island) can only enter from PTC and not from Punggol Point, therefore, trains need to reverse. They would need to reverse without affecting normal frequencies. If you think its a failure in your opinion, Its all right. But the BPLRT is a bigger epic fail </p>

              <p>Actually I have thought of Ang Mo Kio's middle track to be used for Zoological Gardens Branch line, but for suggestion in Zoo / Mandai / Central Catchment areas, Thomson Line is your answer (By 2018).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I agree NTU needs a MRT line, probably it is</p>
              <p>A) Jurong Region LRT (Most likely)</p>
              <p>B) North West Region Line (Tuas, Yunan / NTU, Lim Chu Kang, Kranji) --- Only to be implemented when the Lim Chu Kang is going to re-developed to a new HDB town</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>NUS? You got Circle Line Kent Ridge station by 2011 August. (Second half -- my personal guess: Open CCL 4 / 5 together with Woodleigh) Not enough? Then I hope for West Coast LRT to serve the entire Pasir Panjang / Kent Ridge / "Clementi South" --- near West Coast Plaza areas lor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope that Pulau Semaku and some of the Southern Islands have MRT, best if that is a North East Line MRT extension, so that we can see the current HBF slidings areas without the use of DNBs (I doubt so even Pulau Semaku is fully land-filled by 2050 which then will be redeveloped as recreational areas that was reported years ago as I saw the power supply like thingy right on the end of the tracks on one of the DNB train, since then I never got to see HBF DNB train)</p>
