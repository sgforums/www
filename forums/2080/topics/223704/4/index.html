Previously, any accident would result in massive disruptions and delays.<br><br>The sad fact is that pple must choose something built for convinence to take their own lifes. I guess the only way forward is too install gate barriers on the all above-land  stations.<br><br>The S'pore Govt will surely do it as it is the only way we can ensure our "fine" city.
