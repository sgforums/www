            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Second man hit by train in four days</strong></span><br><br>Wednesday Â• December 6, 2006<br><br>ABOUT 21,000 commuters were held up yesterday morning when a man was hit by a train at Yishun station. According to the police, the deceased was an Indian man. He had fallen onto the tracks of the south-bound train around 6.50 am. Train service resumed about an hour later, at 8am.<br><br>In its statement, SMRT said south-bound trains were turned around at Sembawang station and some north-bound trains were turned around at Yishun station. Passengers who were affected were travelling from Sembawang to Yishun. Ms Shaliha Rashid, a webmaster who was travelling to work from Woodlands station, was one of them. She told 938LIVE: "I had to wait for 10 minutes before the train services returned to normal but, at every station, the train stopped for two to three minutes before moving off."<br><br>SMRT said passengers who were unable to complete their journeys due to the disruption could claim a full fare refund from the passenger service centre in any of its 51 SMRT stations, over the next three working days. Police have classified the case as unnatural death. Investigations are ongoing.<br><br>This is the second such case in a week. Last Saturday, the south-bound train service was disrupted when a man, believed to be a Chinese man in his mid-20s, was hit by a train at Admiralty station. Some 6,000 passengers were affected by the incident.<br><br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/pda/158976ag.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/pda/158976ag.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Something interesting through Google..., interesting news article, recommend for reference...<br><br><blockquote><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STOPPING THE SUICIDE TRAIN</span></strong><br><a href="http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2004-04-15/news_feature.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2004-04-15/news_feature.php</a><br><br>Torontonians know little about subway suicides because, <span style="color: red;">as a rule, the media, police and TTC do not publicize the tragedies. But Ontario Coroner's figures suggest there have been between eight and 22 subterranean suicides in the past four years.</span> Less known but more alarming are the number of failed attempts.<br><br>...<br><br>Every day, Wayne Moore hopes it won't happen again. <span style="color: red;">In his 28 years as a TTC subway operator, he's been involved in 13 subway suicides. In 1999 alone, three people were crushed by Moore's train.</span> While the first incident involved a man who fell to the track after suffering a heart attack, the second and third were suicides, leaving Moore so badly shaken he needed muscle relaxants to sleep. "<span style="color: red;">But other drivers have had it worse," he says. "Some have seen as many as 25 or 26 suicides in a 30-year career.</span>"<br><br>...<br><br>Although the exact number is unclear, Bruce Bryer, a TTC ticket agent for 23 years, says that on average one person jumps every week. "Something needs to be done, because we can't ignore it any longer," he says.<br><br>...<br><br>Canada isn't alone in being worried about this issue. <span style="color: red;">A 2002 study on railway safety in England found that about 200 people commit suicide annually on the country's railways, costing the industry approximately Â£300 million a year, including 2,000 days off a year for staff suffering from trauma-related sickness.</span><br><br>TTC chair Howard Moscoe doesn't want to sound insensitive, <span style="color: red;">but says $6 million is too much money Â– money the TTC doesn't have Â– to consider the proposal seriously.</span><br><br>Moscoe says he's not against experimenting. "<span style="color: red;">If they find the barriers workable and successful, then we can look into investing more over time,</span>" he says.<br></blockquote><blockquote><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wiki</span></strong><br>Another interesting trend related to train suicide is to <span style="color: red;">wear a brightly colored cap (orange) to help shield your face. This is done out of concern for the train conductors, so that they may not be caused any trauma by seeing the face of the person about to be hit.</span> It is also useful as a sign that the person is indeed intending to commit suicide, and that no one should risk their life in order to save them.<br><br><span style="color: red;">The costs to the surving families by the railway companies' "delay fee" is often in the 100 million yen (approx. 850 thousand U.S. Dollars) range.</span><br></blockquote></div>
