The significant number of falls onto train tracks over the past few years, and the widespread disruption this causes to thousands of commuters, should make SMRT think twice about resolving this problem.<br><br>It may still be a cheaper alternative, in the long run, to erect protection screens on MRT station platforms.<br><br>There are only two conclusions we can draw from the seemingly regular suicide jumps onto MRT tracks in front of an oncoming train Â— either our MRT stations are designed to be so unsafe that it is easy to fall onto the tracks, or there is something not right in our society that people would choose to end their lives in this highly visible method so as to cause the maximum amount of chaos for others.<br><br>Either reason is a blight on Singapore's reputation. Suppressing such news may prevent copycat suicides, but the root causes of such desperate suicidal behaviour must be tackled vigorously and remedied.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Letter from Joshua Chua</span><br>I refer to the letter, "Disrupted trains a security threat" (Dec 6). I seriously doubt there would be mass-suicide plots at our stations. Perhaps it's time we stop treating these jumpers as "victims" Â— they are, in fact, perpetrators against the law.<br><br>It's time potential jumpers realise how their acts are really anti-social, lacking in civic mindedness, not to mention costly.<br><br>The authorities should increase the fine for disrupting train services and impose it on the jumper's family members after the misdemeanour.<br><br>This may deter copycats who have to then consider what extra financial burden it would put on their family to die in this fashion. Build platform screens, and tackle the root cause It is anti-social behaviour, and must be deterred.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Installing gates have become some impossible reality as I can see. Some platforms on the Tokyo's Hanzomon line just got screen doors last year, but suicide rates are equally high in Japan.<br>Those JR lines in the west areas, special limited express trains go up to 130km/h and people just get sliced without the driver knowing immediately. The lights are just normal tungsten lights and there would be no warning until a bang or something hits the windscreen.<br>Sounding the horn, building doors, these are just some methods that can stop in last minute, not the root of the problem.</div>

Those American locomotive also got sound the horn when approaching near the station or level crossing. That's a good habit to ensure that those want to take their own life can think twice.</div>
