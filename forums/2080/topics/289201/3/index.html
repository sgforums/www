            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Speedy, safe' recovery a priority</span><br>SMRT provides notices, bus rides to minimise delays</strong><br>Weekend TODAY Â• November 10, 2007<br><br>Letter from Kuek Chor Ling<br>Manager, Corporate Marketing and Communications, SMRT Corporation<br><br><img src="http://i13.tinypic.com/6slummv.jpg"><br><br>I refer to the letter "Don't leave passengers stranded" by Chua Kim Choo (Nov 3-4).<br><br>SMRT places priority to ensure normal train service resumes in the shortest time, while keeping commuters informed of the situation where possible during a service disruption.<br><br>On Nov 1, at 6.13pm, south-bound train services from Newton to Marina Bay MRT stations, and north-bound train services from Marina Bay to Raffles Place MRT stations were disrupted. The disruption was caused by a cable short circuit along the track at Dhoby Ghaut MRT station. Normal train services resumed at 7.13pm.<br><br>While we did our best to recover train services, SMRT was mindful not to compromise the safety of our passengers. During the incident, Dhoby Ghaut MRT station staff and SMRT maintenance engineers, together with Singapore Civil Defence Force personnel were on site to manage the recovery to ensure normal train service resumed quickly. We needed to assess the situation and its impact on train services before the correct information could be disseminated to commuters.<br><br>Once the expected duration of the train service delay was determined, passengers were informed of the stations affected by the service disruption and free bus-bridging services. These were disseminated either through train and station announcements, notices, rail travel information system in the stations or electronic signboards at stations' entrances.<br><br>With reference to Ms Chua's point that shuttle bus services should be activated quickly, we would like to share that SMRT has a plan to provide commuters with alternative travel.<br><br>We deploy our limited spare buses and if necessary, pull out buses from existing services near the bus terminals of affected stations. These buses will ply routes along the MRT stations affected by the train service delay.<br><br>Before the buses are deployed, the recalled bus drivers will be briefed to ensure they are familiar with the routes. Finally, the time taken for the bus to reach the pick-up point is dependent on road conditions.<br><br>On the day of the incident, bus-bridging services were activated at 6.48pm to ferry passengers between Newton and Marina Bay MRT stations. The first bus departed the pick-up point at Newton MRT station at 7.16pm.<br><br>We agree that there is room for improvement in handling a service disruption and we will continue to look at ways to enhance our service.<br><br>We thank the writer for her feedback and assure commuters that SMRT will take all necessary steps to minimise service delays.</div>
