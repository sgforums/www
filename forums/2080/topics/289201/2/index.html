And since some of us depend almost entirely on the trains to commute, we have no idea which bus services would get us home.<br><br>Under such emergency situations, SMRT should activate the shuttle bus system quickly.<br><br>During ThursdayÂ’s incident, when the north-south-bound trains screeched to a halt, Â“dedicatedÂ” buses to shuttle commuters to the main housing estatesÂ’<br>MRT stations, or to the nearest operating MRT station, should have been organised promptly.<br><br>As these shuttle buses are only deployed during emergencies, perhaps special service numbers should be allocated to these buses, indicating the individual housing estates they serve.<br><br>Whenever there is a breakdown in train services, the most important thing on the commutersÂ’ minds is to find alternative transport to reach their destinations, and not how to seek a refund.<br><br>But in the midst of Thursday eveningÂ’s chaos, there was an MRT officer at Raffles Place station telling commuters where to get their refunds and the way out of the MRT station!<br><br>He could not offer any assistance when we asked about the shuttle bus services or alternative bus services to get home.</div>

But hang on...<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by brotherchen1982:<br><strong>DonÂ’t leave passengers stranded</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">When MRT services are disrupted, provide alternative transport quickly<br>Letter from CHUA KIM CHOO</span><br><br>But in the midst of Thursday eveningÂ’s chaos, there was an MRT officer at Raffles Place station telling commuters where to get their refunds and the way out of the MRT station!<br></blockquote>The person is a MRT officer. Not any bus operator or bus operations control centre. MRT officers are trained to deal with problems originating from the train system. That's why they are called MRT officers.<br><br>Secondly, there is a System MAP and a Road MAP in each station. The MAP is so darn bloody big, the author of the letter can't see? The Road MAP tells us which buses are available from that particular station and where is the destination of the buses. SMRT purposely put it there so that commuters and foreigners can refer to the MAP to see which buses to take. MRT officers are supposed to deal with problems within the MRT system itself.<br><br>I really feel that the author of the letter is purposely trying to find fault with SMRT. Sure, there has been some technical fault with the tracks, but can't the author find for the MAP to find for the way out? Instead of just asking the MRT officer. The officer is already busy enough trying to usher commuters out and help them get their refunds, and if everyone were to be like the author, pumping questions at the MRT officer about which buses to take, what do you expect him to do? The MRT officer is obviously not a bus guide; the Road MAP and System MAP is one.</div>

Unless SMRT did mention that there would be no shuttle services provided, WHICH SEEMED HIGHLY IMPOSSIBLE, you can always get your refund, get out of the station, board a public bus or cab, or wait for the shuttle services.
