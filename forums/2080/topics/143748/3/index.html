            <div class='col-md body'><strong>WHERE ARE THE PASSENGERS?<br><span style="font-style: italic;">SBS Transit loses $1m a year keeping station open</span></strong><br>By Tan Mae Lynn<br>15 October 2007<br><br>THEY wanted the station opened, and they got it. They wanted feeder bus services, they got those too.<br><br>But they still didn't use Buangkok MRT station on the North-East line.<br><br>Their excuses: Sengkang and Hougang stations have shopping malls while Buangkok, which lies between these two, has just one convenience store.<br><br>Also, since not many people are using the station, they don't feel safe.<br><br>Now the question is: When will the excuses stop and the very people, who campaigned hard for the station to open, begin using it?<br><br>The New Paper had reported last February about the poor ridership at this station.<br><br>Things haven't improved after all these months.<br><br>Responding to queries from TheNew Paper on Sunday, SBS Transit revealed that in the 21 months since it opened, it saw daily ridership grow from a meagre 900 to 2,600 last month. That's still short of the 3,500 per day it expected to get when the station opened.<br><br>Not surprisingly, SBS Transit said the Buangkok station is its worst performer of the 15 NEL stations. It accounts for less than 1 per cent of the total daily ridership of 270,000.<br><br>SBS Transit said it costs more than $1 million just to keep the station open.<br><br>The station had been in the spotlight in recent years because it remained closed for about 21/2 years, even after the NEL line began operating in 2003.<br><br>SBS Transit eventually relented and opened the station to much fanfare last January after residents in the nearby Hougang, Buangkok and Sengkang estates, together with their MP Charles Chong, lobbied hard for it.<br><br>Then, some 6,000 people had pledged to use the station.<br><br>But they don't seem to have kept that pledge.<br><br><strong>TAKING MEASURES</strong><br><br>SBS Transit's director of corporate communications, Ms Tammy Tan, told The New Paper on Sunday that they are taking pro-active measures to attract more commuters to the station.<br><br>They have leased out four retail outlets - a convenience store and three educational centres.<br><br>She said: 'The rental is kept relatively low here in comparison to other stations. Here, we only charge about 10 per cent of what we charge at Sengkang station as our intention is to draw residents to the shops here and boost ridership.'<br><br>But Mr Mohamad Rafeek, 27, who helps his uncle run the convenience store, said business has been poor.<br><br>He said: 'In the mornings and up to about 5.30pm, there are fewer than 50customers. It is only in the evenings that it gets a bit better.<br><br>'In the afternoons it is very quiet... Maybe it will be better at the end of the year when more people move in to the area.'<br><br>Ms Tan said it could be because residents are unwilling to walk the distance and they prefer to take buses which stop closer to their homes.<br><br>The New Paper on Sunday spoke to some residents in the surrounding Sengkang and Hougang areas, and found that most were happy that the Buangkok station had opened.<br><br>But some admitted that they don't use the station regularly.<br><br>Housewife Madam Teo Chin Geoh, 60, said: 'I use both the Buangkok and Hougang stations. It depends on which feeder bus comes first.'<br><br>Madam Teo lives along Hougang Avenue 8, which is a seven-minute walk to Buangkok station.<br><br>She said: 'There are no trees or shelter from the sun when you walk to the Buangkok station. If it rains, it's also a problem.<br><br>'If I have to walk, when I miss the bus, I would rather walk to Hougang - at least there's shelter.'<br><br>Some residents also say even if they take the MRT, it's difficult to hail a cab at the station after that.<br><br>Ms Anne de Souza, 32, said: 'When it opened, I thought I could use the station and enjoy a short cab ride back.<br><br>'But the road there is so quiet you can't get a cab from there... I've tried it before, I ended up walking home.'<br><br>Others, however, have simply got used to travelling to other stations like Hougang or Sengkang.<br><br>Mr Tan Ah Chai, 50, said his wife and children either commute by bus or use the Hougang station even though Buangkok is closer.<br><br>He said: 'They tell me they're more used to it, and it's livelier at Hougang too. Buangkok is only a little bit closer, but you have to walk there.<br><br>'My wife prefers Hougang because she can take the feeder service just in front of the block, and it's only two bus stops away.'<br><br>For others, there's also the shopping factor.<br><br>While Buangkok has only one convenience store, both Hougang and Sengkang stations have malls.<br><br>Due to the lack of crowds, residents also avoid stopping at the station at night.<br><br>Accounts clerk Madam Sharon Tan, 38, said: 'I've tried to stop at Buangkok before, but I don't like it. There's still a lot of construction going on around there, I don't feel safe walking home alone, especially at night.'<br><br>The station is surrounded by construction sites and a piece of land about the size of 30 football fields.<br><br>It needs a ridership of 5,000 a day just to break even.<br><br>The station, which was built at a cost of $80m, costs $1.2m a year to operate. Even Punggol station, which has the second lowest ridership along the NEL, operates with almost three times the number of rides - 7,800 - a day.<br><br>Dhoby Ghaut interchange is the busiest with a daily ridership of 48,000.<br><br>The other train operator, SMRT, has an average daily ridership of about 1.2million people on its network of 51stations.<br><br>A check with HDB indicates that Buangkok may soon see happier days.<br><br>Since January last year, an additional 1,300 HDB flats have been completed and some residents have moved in.<br><br>That comes up to more than 3,500housing units in the vicinity of the station. Another 1,000 flats next to the station are due to be completed by end of next year.<br><br>And 625 condo units at The Quartz, located next to the station, also expected to be completed in 2009.<br><br><strong>UNFAZED</strong><br><br>That's also why Mr Chong is unfazed by the poor ridership.<br><br>He said: 'It's increasing, and as the blocks there get more populated, eventually it would be a happy situation for SBS and everyone.'<br><br>It's only a matter of time before it becomes profitable, he added.</div>

People were crowding around and trying to look and take photos of her," said a friend, one of her schoolmates at Northview Secondary School.<br><br>The friend said that because of the jostling crowds, she might have been unable to see where she was stepping. She remained "quite calm" throughout and did not appear to be too badly hurt, he added.<br><br>Using hydraulic spreaders to widen the space between the train and the platform, the paramedics took about 10 minutes to get the girl out, who was not bleeding or visibly hurt, said the SCDF.<br><br>She was sent to the Singapore General Hospital for treatment, and train services resumed at about 5.15pm.<br><br>In January, in a similar incident, a woman had her leg trapped between a train and the platform at Clementi station, causing train services to be disrupted for more than 20 minutes.<br><br>This, along with other accidents involving commuters, caused concern among some TODAY readers, who wrote in urging SMRT to take more action to monitor passenger safety at the stations.

              non—underground retail space — Choa Chu Kang Xchange, at the junction
              of a bus interchange, MRT and LRT stations.</p>
              <p>This follows the Raffles and Dhoby Xchanges, both of which are in the city.</p>
              <p>Covering close to 1,000 square metres, all 42 shops at Choa Chu Kang Xchange have been leased out.</p>
              <p>SMRT
              Corporation president &amp; CEO Saw Phaik Hwa said, five years ago
              "when we started off for only retail, we used to... make about S$20
              million in terms of rentals. Today, I think this year, we should end in
              excess of S$40 million. So, it’s more than doubled in terms of revenue
              from rentals alone."</p>
              <p>Despite some recent problems with tenants at
              the Dhoby Xchange, who felt they were not getting enough exposure, SMRT
              said things have since turned around there and there are now many new
              tenants and the occupancy rate has hit over 90 per cent.</p>
              <p>SMRT said retail space in the heartlands does not necessarily mean lower rentals.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Saw said, "It is not location. It is the passengers that you bring to
              the location. So we have tens of thousands, sometimes 100,000
              passengers, in certain exchanges like Boon Lay, (which) is very highly
              used. Here (Choa Chu Kang) is very highly used."</p>
              <p>Some shops at
              the Xchange have been able to balance—off higher rentals with higher
              profits, but smaller neighbourhood shops, which do not have such high
              passenger volume, are feeling the heat.</p>
              <p>"Ever since that place
              opened, our business has gone down by half, so we try to keep our
              prices low," said a neighbourhood cake shop lady.</p>
              <p>Work is also
              underway at two other Xchanges in Boon Lay and Tanjong Pagar, which
              should be ready by the first half of this year. — CNA/ac</p>

              <h1 class="clr">SMRT and SBS Transit raise peak period train frequencies</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Starting 4 February, the journey to and from work for commuters is expected to be quicker.</p>
              <p>Both SMRT and SBS Transit announced on Friday that they will be increasing the number of train trips per week.</p>
              <p>SMRT,
              which operates the North—South and East—West lines, will run 83
              additional trips during the morning and evening peak periods. It said
              this will cut average waiting times by as much as 1.5 minutes.</p>
              <p>The
              change is expected to benefit passengers travelling southwards from
              Yishun, and westwards from Boon Lay during the morning rush hours.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, northbound and eastbound commuters in the evening peak period may similarly expect a quicker, less crowded journey.</p>
              <p>SBS Transit, which operates the North East Line (NEL), will add another 10 trips each week.</p>
              <p>It
              said the move will cut average waiting times from four to three minutes
              during the morning peak period, and from five to four minutes in the
              evening rush hour. — CNA/vm</p>
