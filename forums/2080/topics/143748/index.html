            <div class='col-md body'>March 13, 2006<br><span class="large"><strong>Groundwork begins for new MRT lines </strong></span><br>LTA checks for station locations and soil conditions for Eastern and Bukit Timah lines<br><br>By Christopher Tan<br><br>THE Land Transport Authority (LTA) has started preliminary work on two new major MRT lines - the Eastern Region Line (ERL) and the Bukit Timah Line (BTL).<br><br>They are expected to add about 60km to Singapore's current rail network of 178km.<br><br>The ERL will be a 40km rectangular loop around the Jalan Besar area and the East Coast, while the BTL will be a 20km line linking Upper Bukit Timah and the city.<br><br>Both will intersect with existing lines as well as the Circle Line, now under construction, and both will flow into the New Downtown.<br><br>LTA rail director Lim Bok Ngam told The Straits Times work could begin within six months of the Government giving the final go-ahead on the budget and the alignment of the routes.<br><br>When will the green light be given? Transport Minister Yeo Cheow Tong yesterday said it depended very much on the demand for housing and other developments in those areas, so that there was a viable load factor for the line.<br><br>'We don't want to build something that turns out to be under-utilised.' He was speaking to reporters at a community event a day after work started on the latest MRT project, the $436 million Boon Lay MRT extension.<br><br>In the meantime, Mr Lim's planners and engineers are already looking at possible station locations, as well as the soil profile and some of the engineering challenges that may crop up along these two lines, he said.<br><br>He said the LTA was likely to tackle the two projects in phases, just as it had done with the Circle Line.<br><br>The Straits Times understands that the upper loop of the 40km ERL is likely to be built first. This section will pass through the Jalan Besar area and onwards to parts of Bedok and Tampines.<br><br>Mr Lim, a 30-year land transport veteran who has long been in charge of road projects, succeeded former rail chief Rajan Krishnan last year. Mr Rajan left the LTA in the aftermath of the Nicoll Highway cave-in in April 2004, in which four people died.<br><br>The University of Singapore-trained engineer reckons that if work begins by 2010, when the Circle Line is due to be completed, the Bukit Timah Line will be completed by 2016. By 2020, the first stretch of the Eastern Region Line would be ready.<br><br>What's next? There is the Thomson Line, which will be the MRT equivalent of the Central Expressway - the highway that now links northern Singapore and the Central Business District.<br><br>There are also plans for a line to thread through the northern housing estates of Woodlands, Punggol, Seletar and Pasir Ris, possibly with a 10km line which will join the existing Punggol and Pasir Ris stations.<br><br>By 2030, the Government envisages a rail network of 540km - more extensive than London's 408km Tube system.<br><br>Mr Lim is confident this can be achieved. But for now, he is not looking beyond the Bukit Timah and Eastern Regional Lines, as plans do sometimes change.<br><br>For instance, the Jurong Region Line, a light rail system originally planned for the same time frame, does not currently seem viable.<br><br>In fact, Mr Lim says there are currently 'no plans to expand the LRT network further'.<br><br>'If there is a new township that's going to be very heavily built up, we'll do so,' he said. Otherwise, the LRT's role can be fulfilled by feeder buses.<br><br>But with more tracks laid, rail ridership will rise. Public transport ridership is now skewed heavily towards buses, which account for 2.5 million daily rides. The trains provide 1.2 million rides a day now. When the Circle Line is up, ridership will go up to 1.5 million a day.<br><br>The ERL and BTL may eventually tilt the balance in favour of rail.<br><br>All in favour of the BTL is Madam Halimah Yacob - an MP for Jurong GRC whose ward includes the areas around Beauty World Centre in Bukit Timah - as it will ease congestion along Bukit Timah Road.<br><br>She added: 'Having an MRT in the area has been the request of shopkeepers and residents there for some time now. So I hope the LTA will speed up in building the line.'<br><br>christan@sph.com.sg<br><br>ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY THERESA TAN<br><br>Copyright Â© 2005 Singapore Press Holdings.

One of the results of the power trip was that the operation of the platform screen doors was affected and if the platform screen doors cannot operate, passengers cannot board or alight from the trains."<br><br>Although service on the southbound track was affected for about 11 hours, on the opposite side of the platform, things were working fine.<br><br>In fact, this was used in the shuttle service that served the four affected stations.<br><br>SBS Transit says there is no guarantee such a failure will not happen again.<br><br>If it does, commuters may face the same disruptions as there is no back-up power supply.<br><br>Said Mr Goei, "We will investigate into the causes of why the wires broke and from the causes we'll look at how we can prevent it. We would certainly want to minimise train service disruption arising from what happened yesterday."<br><br>The other train operator, SMRT, says that although it uses a different third rail power system, it too does not have an alternate power supply.<br><br>But the operators say having a backup power supply may not help if the problem lies with the power cable.<br><br>Imagine having a generator in your own home. With a severed power cable, even if with two or three back up systems, there is no way the generators can power your home. - CNA /ct</div>

Both SBS Transit and SMRT have applied to the Public Transport Council to increase their bus and train fares.<br><br>The application came just hours before the deadline to do so expired at the end of Tuesday.<br><br>The proposals for the fare hikes, if accepted by the PTC, will be announced next month and will kick in by October.<br><br>This year, there has been a slight change in the dates.<br><br>The deadline to apply for adjustments was pushed back from May to August because the PTC said it needed time to implement changes to the Act, such as introducing new service standards.<br><br>Fuel costs have been rising for the two big bus companies, by as much as over 40 percent just in the last year.<br><br>SBS Transit says that diesel is its second biggest cost item after manpower.<br><br>So it has decided to ask for a fare increase after much deliberation.<br><br>With the formula imposing a 1.7 percent cap, SBS Transit says that most adults travelling on its buses and trains would see a one-cent to two-cent increase in fares.<br><br>If the maximum is approved, that will yield SBS Transit almost $10 million a year.<br><br>SMRT is also planning an increase averaging two cents, affecting mainly adult and senior citizen stored-value EZ-Link cards.<br><br>In many ways, the fare increase was widely expected.<br><br>When the new formula for calculating fare increases kicked in last year, the government said small and regular increases were preferred to big jumps every few years.<br><br>So, fare adjustments will probably be annual affairs now.<br><br>And both SBS Transit and SMRT have already hinted they would do so.<br><br>Both companies also say that they are mindful of the problems the fare increase would impose on the not so well off.<br><br>Hence student fares and concession passes will be unaffected.<br><br>Both companies will also have funding schemes for the lower income groups to offset any burden posed by fare increases.<br><br>But will commuters accept these arguments?<br><br>"They have the reason for raising their fares. Because of the oil.....they have to have a coverage. So I think it is ok," said a commuter.<br><br>"First, it was the oil price increase, and then the bus fares, and then the taxi fares. It all came so suddenly. It's not the amount, it's like all at once. It kind of adds up for us," said another.<br><br>"What will be, will be. But when fare increases, there will be upgrading of services and it's useful for upgrading," said a third commuter.<br><br>"Students, older people and the poor people would probably need more help," said a fourth.<br><br>The new head of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Transport, Cedric Foo, told Channel NewsAsia that the companies should also consider discounted rates for poor school children, off-peak rates for retirees and issuing a limited number of free passes for the unemployed who need to commute for job interviews. - CNA/ir</div>
