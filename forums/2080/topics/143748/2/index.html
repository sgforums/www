In three years, Singaporeans may be able to take a train and zip across from Woodlands to Johor in less than three minutes.<br><br>SMRT and a Johor construction company are in talks to erect 3-4 km-long monorail track linking Singapore's MRT stations at Woodlands or Kranji to Johor Baru's new RM3 billion monorail system.<br><br>If the plan goes through, the monorail - for which construction is scheduled to begin next year - will be elevated across the Johor Straits and curve into the Kranji area.<br><br>A deal between SMRT Corporation and Johor transport construction company Jalur Mudra Sdn Bhd (JM) - which will build the Johor monorail - could be clinched within the "next couple of months", JM's executive director Nebojsa Novakovic told TODAY.<br><br>An SMRT spokesperson added: "We are open to various forms of partnership and are waiting for details regarding the project from Jalur Mudra Sdn Bhd for our consideration."<br><br>Among the issues that need to be ironed out will be the customs and immigrations procedures - all-seater trains have been suggested to simplify matters - as well as the structure of the deal itself.<br><br>SMRT has already submitted a letter of intent to JM, indicating that it is keen to be part of the project.<br><br>There have been no political roadblocks so far. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had recently remarked on the "mixed signals" coming out of Johor over Singapore's participation in its mega development project.<br><br>"JM has informed the Johor State Government of SMRT's proposal and there has been no objection so far," said Mr Novakovic.<br><br>Nor will the past disputes between Singapore and Malaysia over the Causeway and a proposed bridge stand in the way, he indicated.<br><br>According to sources, SMRT has offered to take up an equity stake of up to 45 per cent in the project. However, they say the Johor State Government is likely to cap SMRT's stake at 15 per cent.<br><br>The project will be 30% owned by the Johor Baru City Council (MBJB), which will provide the land and right of way, but not money, said Mr Novakovic.<br><br>To make things simpler, this initiative will be privately funded.<br><br>"It has to be financially viable as it is politically doable. This fits very nicely into the master plan of SMRT and JM. There is no government funding from either side. So far there has been no stumbling blocks," said Mr Novakovic.<br><br>Another possibility is for JM to engage SMRT as a technology partner or business consultant.<br><br>"It's most likely to be all of the above options," said Mr Novakovic.<br><br>JM is now waiting to sign official concession agreements, after which it will try to hammer out its deal with SMRT, subject to approval from authorities.<br><br>Analysts think it's a lucrative project.<br><br>"This will be a profitable line because of the traffic. Everyday, you have 50,000 people commuting across the Causeway. With the monorail, even more people will cross the Causeway during the weekends," said a transport analyst at a foreign bank. - /dt<br><br>FACTS about the Johor Baru Monorail:<br><br>The Johor Baru monorail, which travels at a speed of 100km per hour is faster than Singapore's MRT and will be based on the "maglev" or magnetic levitation technology. In this, magnetic forces lift, propel and guide trains over an elevated guideway.<br><br>The monorail will initially serve a 13.5km stretch from the state capital to AEON Tebrau City in the proposed logistics hub. Another 50km of railway lines will be added subsequently to serve other parts of the state. The Singapore link will be about 3km-to-4km long.</div>

This is a pilot so we will do improvements along the way. When we have studied how best to do this, we will extend it along the way," said Transport Minister Raymond Lim.<br><br>The 400-metre radius will not be fixed and the barrier-free extension will depend on the facilities and the services required.<br><br>Meanwhile, the older stations within the North-South and East-West lines have been upgraded to become user-friendly and barrier-free.<br><br>The six-year project, costing more than $80 million, will be carried out at 46 MRT stations.<br><br>"I feel that it is fantastic and that the government is actually taking steps to make barrier free facility for the handicapped and the elderly. However, I feel that the handicapped and the elderly must actually justify the placement of these facilities by actually using them and coming out to take the public transport to show that, yes it is effective. Also, the able bodied can be a bit more generous and courteous by not obstructing the pavements by placing their garbage bins or potted plants along the way," said Jeremy Lim, a student.<br><br>Speaking to reporters, the Transport Minister said the LTA is assessing the effectiveness of installing platform screen doors and other safety options at MRT stations. It would then weigh it against the additional cost that may be imposed on commuters.<br><br>On the JB Monorail system, Mr Lim explained it is a commercial decision SMRT has to make and that it is awaiting details.<br><br>As for the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur air-route, he said officials from both sides would meet in mid-January to discuss the liberalisation of the air services agreement between the two countries. - CNA /dt</div>

Her credit card company, ABN AMRO, has just tied up with taxi company, ComfortDelGro, to scrap the 10 percent administrative fee that customers have to shell out when they use their credit cards to pay the taxi fees.<br><br>Ms Lee says it is an ideal option unless she is rushing for time as that would mean she has to spend extra minutes waiting for the transaction to be processed and to sign on the charge slip.<br><br>ABN AMRO wants to increase its credit card business by grabbing a slice of a market estimated to have grown 30 percent a year for ComfortDelGro for the past 10 years.<br><br>The business is said to be worth S$35 million last year.<br><br>Pamela Tan, Head, Consumer Finance, Consumer Client Segment, ABN AMRO, says: "With the partnership with ComfortDelGro, we will be able to bring in another 20,000 new customers. I believe we are projecting a minimum of 20 percent incremental in terms of revenue this year."<br><br>But the market potential is bigger. Credit card Mastercard says payment for transportation currently represents a small proportion of money spent on its card. The company adds that this means cards have a huge opportunity to expand because two years ago, Singaporean consumers spent S$14 billion on transport.<br><br>And banks are not just working with taxi companies.<br><br>Train operator SMRT wants to get more people onboard its trains and taxis by working with Citibank.<br><br>They have introduced a Citibank EZ-Link card which offers cashless payment for SMRT train and bus rides.<br><br>In turn, the bank gets access to strategic location of train stations where it plans to build 10 branches in places like Ang Mo Kio, Tampines and Jurong.<br><br>Chan Sow Han, Marketing Director, Citibank Singapore, says: "SMRT has the largest network of train stations and these stations are spread throughout all the 51 stations. This gives us natural access to the commuters out there."<br><br>Teo Chew Hoon, Vice-President, Commercial Business, SMRT Investments predicts the venture will help generate at least 20 percent of revenue for SMRT.<br><br>The train operator hopes the partnership will also help to boost the falling number of public transport users.<br><br>Ms Teo says: "The convenience, as well as the added value, would encourage the public to use public transport."<br><br>Predictions show this market is going to expand, with benefits for both businesses and savvy credit and debit card users.
