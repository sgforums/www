              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I'm new to this forum. Can I ask if anyone has observed recently that the C751B trains are more jerky and screech? I experienced this recently but did not note the car number and location. Hope to check if anyone has similar experiences, not sure if it is a specific car only. Thanks...</p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Train operator SMRT said there was a 30-minute train 
              service delay between Pasir Ris and Tanah Merah MRT stations Friday 
              evening. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This was due to a fault on a westbound train between Tampines and Simei station.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SMRT said the train travelling behind the stalled train was used to assist it.<br><br>Passengers
               on board the stalled train alighted at Simei station at 7.36pm, while 
              passengers on the assisting train alighted at 7.43pm.   <br><br>The train operator added that announcements were made at all affected stations.<br><br>SMRT
               said that eastbound passengers between City Hall and Pasir Ris MRT 
              stations would have experienced a general service delay for a 20 to 
              40-minute period, as the high train frequencies operated during the rush
               hour can lead to a congestion when there is a train fault. <br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Circle Line disruption caused by power supply failure</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The service disruption on the Circle Line, which 
              began at 7.40am on Wednesday, was a result of a failure in the power 
              supply to the communications network at Botanic Gardens Station, said 
              SMRT.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Speaking to 
              MediaCorp Radio's 938 Live, SMRT's senior vice president of 
              communications and services, Goh Chee Kong, said this in turn 
              interrupted the transmission of the signalling system that controls the 
              safe operations of the trains. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>As a result, the stretch between one-north and Marymount stations in both directions was affected. <br><br>The fault has been isolated and rectified, and full service resumed at 10.10am.<br><br>SMRT said its engineers, together with LTA, will continue to investigate the cause of the problem to prevent a recurrence.<br><br>It
               added that it had put out information on the service disruption on 
              several platforms, including Traffic Watch, SMRT Twitter, SMRT's 
              corporate website, SMRT Connect and digital screens at stations as well 
              as SBS Transit's website and Iris platform.<br><br>SMRT said its Rail 
              Incident Management Plan was activated at 8.15am. 70 buses were deployed
               when the free bus bridging services between Bishan and one-north were 
              activated at 8.35am.<br><br>In addition, free travel on passing buses 
              from both SBS Transit and SMRT was activated, while 80 extra staff were 
              deployed on the ground to help direct affected commuters. <br><br>SMRT 
              said passengers who were not able to continue with their journey because
               of the disruption, or had to exit an SMRT train station without taking a
               trip but had their fares deducted, can get a refund at the Passenger 
              Service Centre in any of SMRT's 83 stations in the next 14 days.<br><br>- CNA/al</span></span></p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Bukit Panjang Light Rapid Transit (LRT) service 
              was disrupted on Sunday afternoon due to a train fault between Bukit 
              Panjang and Senja stations.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The disruption occurred at 4.45pm and affected Services A and C.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Operator SMRT said 
              one train running Service A -- which starts and ends at Choa Chu Kang 
              station via Senja station -- stalled before it entered Senja station.<br><br>There were 11 passengers on board then.<br><br>SMRT
               said within five minutes, its staff attended to the affected 
              passengers, while the air-conditioning and lights remained on 
              throughout. <br><br>Accompanied by staff, the passengers left the train 
              and walked on a 1.5-metre-wide emergency walkway for about 150 metres to
               Senja station.<br><br>SMRT said the walkway is safe and is regularly used by its staff for maintenance work. <br><br>Passengers
               on board another affected train were detrained at Bukit Panjang, so 
              that the train could be used to push out the stalled train. <br><br>Service C departs and terminates at Ten Mile Junction station via Bukit Panjang and Senja stations.<br><br>SMRT
               said announcements were made at all LRT stations in English, Mandarin, 
              Malay and Tamil. It also gave information via Twitter, to update 
              commuters throughout the incident. <br><br>Staff members were deployed at affected stations to assist passengers.<br><br>Service A was restored two-and-a-half hours later.<br><br>SMRT has apologised for the inconvenience caused. <br><br>- CNA/wk</span></span></p>
