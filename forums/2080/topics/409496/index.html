              <p>a1) I do not see a difference between LRT and overground platforms - both are overground platforms! These two generates the most noise, although the actual amount of noise produced is based on multiple factors including station design, amount of passenger, and frequency of trains, amongst others.</p>
              <p>a2) I do not believe they have done anything, nor do they even need to do so. Our trains are already quieter than other countries which uses diesel trains.</p>
              <p>a3) Peak hours?</p>
              <p>b) I do not know about Alstom trains (C751A and C830) - no accurate measuremnt can be made as these trains are underground. As for the other two (C151, C651, and C751B), I personally find them roughly the same.</p>
              <p>c) Barriers between train viaducts and the suroundings may help. Also, the estates could be designed to either have multi-storey carparks, or common corridors facing the viaducts, acting as barriers.</p>
              <p>Hope this helps~</p>

              <p>Station doesnt really matter unless you stay directly beside,the noise from the announcement will probably be the problem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a3)Probably when passing by the cross-over track.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>b) For SMRT(C151,C651,C751B), it roughly evens out over time with C651 and C151 probably the same. C651 when starting up is the noisiest(higher pitch sound) but once the gear changes, it becomes quiet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>c) Hard unless there probably is a big budget.(You know?!?!?! The G......)</p>

              <p>1a. Should be thhe underground given the speed of the train that arrived at the station and the noise that cannot be easily dispersed inside the tunnel as compared to the elevated platform and the LRT in open field.</p>
