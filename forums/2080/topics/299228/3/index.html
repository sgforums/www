But within minutes, it was disrupted again. This time, there was an incident at the Marsiling MRT station, one stop away from Kranji MRT station.<br><br>At 11.12am, witnesses saw a man fall onto the tracks at the station.<br><br>The man lost part of his leg after being hit by a train.<br><br>Cleaner Abdul Malik, 48, was near the platform when he heard screams and turned to see the train stop abruptly.<br><br>He said: 'The train had just pulled into the station but halted. I think someone punched the emergency buttons.<br><br>'I looked over the platform and saw a man's leg from the knee onwards on the tracks near the front of the train.<br><br>'My first thought was this man must have been crushed and died.'<br><br>But the man survived the hit.<br><br>Witnesses described him as being in his late 40s. He was conscious while being carried out on a stretcher.<br><br>An SCDF spokesman said: 'Our officers searched the scene and we found a man trapped under the train. A part of his left leg was already severed by the impact. SCDF officers immediately removed him.'<br><br>The man was rushed to National University Hospital (NUH). The severed left leg was retrieved and packed in a bag of ice and also sent to NUH. At the hospital, his wife and teenage daughter were too distraught to speak.<br><br>The disruption caused frazzled nerves on Christmas day. SMRT estimated that 5,400 passengers were affected. Buses were deployed to ferry passengers out of the affected stations.<br><br>SMRT said those unable to complete their journeys because of the disruptions can claim a full refund from the Passenger Service Centre of any MRT station within the next three working days.<br><br><strong>GET HELP</strong><br>Samaritans Of Singapore 18002214444<br>Seniors Helpline 18005555555<br>Singapore Association for Mental Health hotline 18002837019<br>Family Service Centre 18008380100<br>Care Corner Mandarin Counselling Centre 18003535800<br>Touchline (Touch Youth Service) 18003772252<br>Tinkle Friend (for children) 18002744788 on weekdays<br><br>Copyright Â© 2005 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.</div>
