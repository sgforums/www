              <p>I guess Japan's situation is different - their population and urbanisation levels are much higher than Singapore's. I don't know how frequent their trains are, so I can't comment much, but I assume that they have tried running more trains to alleviate the crowd; no-one there probably wants this kind of situation.</p>
              <p>As for Singapore, I sometimes wonder if SMRT is delibrately running less trains so that this kind of situation can happen in our city eventually - 5 minutes is definitely unacceptable for the crowds I witnessed.</p>

              <p>Regards to your blog post,</p>
              <p>I was wondering when the train is coming in, is the orange light lited? It is located above the emergency door, if it is lited than it is in manual if not it is in ATO. As far as I know when it comes to manual, the braking is usually more unpredictable though trains will travel faster, for ATO the braking will be very hard, thus the reason why ATO is able to stop a train travelling at 65 - 70km/h within 6 car length as compared to manual. From what I can conclude is that you are angry with the trains braking too strong causing you too fall, well the thing is that as long as LTA thinks that ATO is good than it will stay and means strong braking will stay too. I dislike ATO generally hence I am always happy that trains are travelling in manual but I prefer ATO's smoothness in non-peak hours, peak hours is horrible. In regards to frequency, you must know that SMRT do not have enough train to provide 2 minutes frequency properly for the whole journey hence some were to terminate at Yishun though I still don't get the idea why is it logical to let train run the other way almost empty. I am not trying to protect SMRT or what but what I am trying to say is SMRT is new to this high frequency thing and you don't expect them to deliver excellent result like HK's MTR which has been doing so for years. Time will justify its cost. Also in case you do not know, tender has been submitted to buy more trains so to fix the insufficient train problem which means that there won't be anymore terminating at Yishun soon and 2 mins frequency will come.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>ATO anytime is best for me. CM is actually slower, worse if it's due to rain cos every station can +15secs then you see PTO rushing to close doors to catch up with schedule.</div>

              <p>SMRT is not new to high frequencies, back in 1990s (or before SPH came into picture), trains were running at 1.5 mins during peak hour, and the current SMRT finally is willing to give back the 1.5 mins thing, although its for a shorter period of time. (and also more people are getting home later)</p>

Also you must remember that they changed their CEO once in 2000s</p></div>
