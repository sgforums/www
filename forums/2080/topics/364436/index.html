              <p>LTA has officially confirmed the names of DTL stage 1 &amp; stage 2 station's names together with 2 of circle line stations. Sorry if it has been double post.</p>

              <p>I am personally fine with the names of stage 1's names but for stage 2, some names are really controversial especially Tan Kah Kee station. So the HCI's students has managed to get their founder name on a Public station name and than I wonder what will be the design of the station? A huge statue of their founder at all exits? I personally do not like the name and I seriously do not know why LTA allow this going by how they hate naming station after people's name unless it reflecs the area itself (eg. Yishun). Tan Kah Kee has nothing to do with that area at all, only the school from what I know. I thought this was a public station and not a memorial. It is like calling a forest, Singapore Zoo when in the current time it is a forest and just because it was once Singapore Zoo doesn't justify it to call it Singapore Zoo.</p>
              <p>Anyway than there will be confusion with Bukit Panjang Station (BPLRT) and Bukit Panjang Station (DTL). Imagine the announcements. "Bukit Panjang Station, passengers continuing their journey Bukit Panjang LRT towards Bukit Panjang please board at platform x and Choa Chu Kang on platform y. (assuming they will connect the LRT and MRT station together to form a station, than it will have 4 platforms)</p>

              <p>Sadly for you, majority of the people who voted didn't share your sentiments. And you are blatantly contradicting yourself within a self-contradictory sentence - "Tan Kah Kee
              has nothing to do with that area at all, only the school from what
              I know". Much as you cringe, you can't deny that the school is the most prominent landmark in that area. :) Ergo, him being the founder of the school, definitely made an impact on that area's landscape.  And mind you, he isn't just a founder of Hwa Chong Institution - he is a philanthropist who should be lauded for his honorable deeds of donating <strong>large</strong> sums of money for overseas Chinese who, during that time, lack basic education. Besides, he did other charitable acts which I shall leave you to <em>wikipedia</em> or <em>google </em>yourself. Unless, of course, if your unhappiness stems from personal dislike or infantile jealousy of the school, then I've nothing to say. :D</p>
              <p>Thanks for all who voted for Kah Kee Station! ^^</p>

              <p>Nah I have no problem with the school, it just that I strongly feel that a public station should reflect the surroundings and not some place that does not even have its name on the street directory. So what if he donate alot of money and it is honored, Benjamin Henry Sheares is our president, shouldn't that be even more honored? Promenade station was feedbacked by public to be called Sheares station as it is located near the bridge but it cannot be called cause it was located in Marina Promenade. Well between Marina Promenade and Benjamin Sheares Bridge, which is more prominent? I would say the bridge but since it is in Marina Promenade, it have to be rejected cause it reflects the area. Also sorry for me not checking but HCI is not just the prominent school there but so do NGH.</p>
              <p>I just feel that LTA is stuck with naming stations especially in hugely private-estate areas, I wonder how are they going to name the Tuas Extension. Also I wonder did LTA really kept to its principles while deciding the names of these stations. For those who want more, Downtown &amp; Petir Station are also terrible names to be honest.</p>
              <p>And I am not alone to complain about the names.</p>

Three names were chosen <br>for each station for this public polling exercise. <br><br>The three names proposed for the station right in front of our <br>school are: Duchess, Watten and Kah Kee.<br><br>LTA has decided that no MRT station would be named after a school. <br>Although the station is built on our land, they are not prepared to <br>name it Hwa Chong Station. Hence we feel that the next best thing we <br>could do is to try to name it after our founder Mr Tan Kah Kee, who <br>bought this piece of land for our use about 90 years ago. All of you <br>have benefited from his vision and generosity, I hope you would <br>agree with me that we should honour him by naming the station "Kah <br>Kee Station".<br><br>LTA is currently seeking public opinion on the final proposed name <br>for the station, at http://talk2lta.lta.gov.sg (Click "Surveys"). <br>The closing date for the public polling is 30 October 2008.<br><br>Pls invite your parents to participate in this voting exercise as <br>well.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Hon<br></span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I am not amazed that HCI will make all ways to vote for it. They seems to forget what is the meaning of a public station. Also they really should read up their history on their founder &amp; "their piece of land". I find this naming of their station after their founder is really more like a permanent advertising for their school. No offence to HCI's students, staffs, ex-students &amp; ex-staffs. But I just expressing my own thoughts.</p></div>
