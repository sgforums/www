              <p>Sure, no problem. :)</p>
              <p>Personally, I find that your arguments are firmly established by impressionistic ideas and many of them, very subjective.</p>
              <p>Firstly, you feel that Benjamin Shears should be more honored. Fine, no problem. But there is no way that you can measure the public sentiment statistically, if Benjamin Shears is more honored or Tan Kah Kee is more honored. Anyone can easily say Tan Kah Kee should be more honored. <em>(Go and ask those older generations)</em> Besides, you hardly knew about Tan Kah Kee, as you've admitted in the first place! How can you callously arrive at your thoughts that <em>"So what if he donate alot of money and it is honored,
                                      Benjamin Henry Sheares is our president, shouldn't that be even
                                      more honored?" ?<br></em></p>
              <p>Secondly, you said that the Shears Bridge is more prominent. Sorry, but I personally feel that the Marina Promanade as a whole is much more prominent. So that renders your 2nd argument very flimsy too. If you look at the radius of the Watten estate/ Duchess estate + HC, where the MRT is built, which is the most prominent "area" there? Duchess estate? Watten estate? Come on, are they as "prominent" as the plot of land where Hwa Chong sits in? <em>(Of course, if you insist that Duchess and Watten are more well-known than Hwa Chong, I've nothing to say. -_- )</em></p>
              <p>Could I also kindly direct you to check-up on the exact location of the MRT station lest you reveal your ignorance inadvertently again. Let's not talk about the school, but the plot of land the station is built on. Where is it? A plot of land holding HC or NYGH? It is HC. So please do not digress to mention other schools, because the MRT is located just outside HC campus, and it so happens that the immediate plot of land which the MRT is built on is very "prominent", hence the naming.</p>
              <p>Of course if you didn't graduate from Hwa Chong, I wouldn't blame you if you see this as an act of permanent advertising, but unfairly preaching that "they
              really should read up their history on their founder &amp; "their
              piece of land", when you yourself hadn't done so in the first place, really stinks of hypocrisy. Besides, what makes you think they hadn't done their reading up?</p>
              <p>No offense meant, and thanks for reading my thoughts. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
