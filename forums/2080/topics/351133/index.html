              <p>i am a poly student that uses bus and mrt concession. like i do every month, i went to renew my concession today for both buses and trains. Afterwhich i went to take the train at YCK mrt station without realising that i had not scanned my card properly.</p>
              <p>At YCK mrt i realised i cound not go out and so i went to the control station .</p>
              <p>ME: excuse me. i cant go out. can u check my card for me pls.</p>
              <p>MRT Staff: u owe 0.16 cents. thats y cannot go out</p>
              <p>ME: but i just bought concession. i even have the receipt.</p>
              <p>MRT Staff: u got receipt u go out la.</p>
              <p>after which i tried to go out again but to no avail.</p>
              <p>ME: still cannot</p>
              <p>MRT: of cos cannot la u owe money wat.</p>
              <p>ME: but i always can go out with my concession. when did this system change?</p>
              <p>MRT Staff: since the new ez link system has been implements ( nice answer huh? lol)</p>
              <p>ME: ok i top up.</p>
              <p>after she topped my card i proceed to go out but the light still flashed red so i went back to her again.</p>
              <p>ME: erm i still cant go out</p>
              <p>MRT Staff: wait i check for u. u nv scan properly. wat station did u come from?</p>
              <p>ME: so its not about the top up at all la. is i nv scan properly.</p>
              <p>MRT Staff: it is both. u need minimum 10 cents or 5 cents to go out. gere i help u already.</p>
              <p>If its really bout the 16 cents that i owe, how come i can go in and out without any trouble for the past few months. thats not all. when i tapped out my card i realised they charged me for my trip. even though i had concession! so i went back to her again</p>
              <p>ME: they charged me for the trip but i have concession</p>
              <p>MRT Staff: OK I DO FOR U NICELY! u go ticket office and collect ur refund ok!</p>
              <p>and so i finally went out  of the station after paying 10 dollars and getting scolded even though its not entirely my fault. yea. sure i owe 16 cents. bu i have been able to go in and out so u gotta admit that the lady is at fault too. she just kept insisting its because i owed money and didnt want to check what was the problem properly. if its really bout the money i would have been not able to go in and out months ago and i would be able to go out after i topped out. Nice customer service huh. i was angry but i kept clam and speaked to her nicely but got shouted and blamed at for nothing.</p>
              <p>infact, i went to the ticket office as instructed and after 10 minutes of clicking on the com, the guy gave me a receipt and ask me to collect one week later. the best part about all of this is that the value claimed on the receipt states $0.00 . nothing. zero. lol. when i asked wat amount i was owed, the guy said he doesn;t know and ask me to check 1 week later. so do i check 1 week later and see myself embarased again because i tried to claim nth? wat a "nice"  train trip and served by such "good"  service huh. lol.<br><br>what do u guys think of this matter?</p>

              <p>TS why u bother to waste time talking to them. U must show them attitude and not them showing u who is boss.</p>
              <p>Next time, if happen again, tell them "what is your name, i will complain u" then u will see whether they still show attitude or not. Bloody shit customer service i read from your post.</p>

              <p>i think i also got scolded for having a drink that is actually empty...camoflauged as a McDonald's drink outside but inside it's long empty, just that I couldn't find a dustbin. So I just told the lady that it's empty and get your f*cking facts right before scolding.</p>
              <p>I even emailed to their boss. Maybe she got scolded by her boss that's why she's venting on you...</p>
