              <p>Chay, I did managed to smuggle in and I can try to help only if you provide me a video camcorder during the show.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: Some of the stations are more easier to smuggle compared to others, and to take pictures from harder stations requires a courage to take test trains without get caught at all. It is always recommended to take a few by a time and do a hit and run approach, unless you are someone like Bruce Lee (When I am not), runs very fast and you just ran in to the stations, where I can just manage to run into any stations I liked to.</p>
              <p>If you run in via the security post, most likely they will call the test train to stop and prevent any one to board it, what a waste!</p>

              <p>Stations involved: Paya Lebar (Smuggle in) &amp; Nicoll Highway (Get my arse out).</p>

              <p>With the skills of boarding non service train, this is getting fun (But possibly illegal)</p>

              <p>May not, since the Paya Lebar station shows that Paya Lebar Interchange will only be operational @ mid 2010. By the way do inform me when the test train starts from Bartley to Dhoby Ghaut (Previously up to the day I entered Paya Lebar CCL without authorization on end of Nov did have tests of trains, i think was 825, is having the route from Dhoby Ghaut to Tai Seng)</p>

              <p>Chay, I did managed to smuggle in and I can try to help only if

              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: Some of the stations are more easier to smuggle compared to
              others, and to take pictures from harder stations requires a
              courage to take test trains without get caught at all. It is always
              recommended to take a few by a time and do a hit and run approach,
              unless you are someone like Bruce Lee (When I am not), runs very
              fast and you just ran in to the stations, where I can just manage
              to run into any stations I liked to.</p>
              <p>If you run in via the security post, most likely they will call
              the test train to stop and prevent any one to board it, what a
              waste!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Stations involved: Paya Lebar (Smuggle in) &amp; Nicoll Highway

              <p>With the skills of boarding non service train, this is getting
