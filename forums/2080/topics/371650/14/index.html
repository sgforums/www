              <p>yes. Kim Chuan will not serve DTL till DTL3 is up and running. DTL MRB depot will be supplemented by Gali Batu when DTL2 runs.</p>

              <p>time to clear a little air on the DTL speculation a bit, highly likely DTL line  will be under the present lower platform. as for the extension..it remains unknown.</p>
              <p>btw, i think many of you have forgotten something on the trains, for the C830s and the DTL trains, both would likely be able to run on the same track. but at present this is already done on the NSEW line for a long time already, i think i have to remind some here any reason why a a kawasaki train or a seimens train need a different track?? the answer is obvious-no.</p>
              <p>so kinda put it into simple- the DTL trains could run in combo with the CCL trains, just like the kawasaki and seimens trains running in NSEW now.</p>
              <p> a likely sceneario is MRB will temp house the DTL trains when DTL 1 is operational but when DTL:2 is still undergoing construction, it might also serve as  a terminus for the CCL trains for a possiable shuttle service from Promenade to MRB.</p>

              <p>Nope. My guess is that the tracks will be fitted in just before they open Stage 6 to have a Dhoby Ghaut - Somewhere shuttle. Not sure about the layout of Marina Bay and Bayfront so can't comment yet. Before that, it will be a Promenade - Marina Bay shuttle.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Red: </span>Isn't that what I said? But Dhoby Ghaut to Marina Bay may pop up once the Circle Line becmoes a full circle. There already is provision for a right turn from Esplanade to Bayfront, and a left turn from Bayfront to Esplanade.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Blue:</span> Between Promenade and Esplanade stations, the bend is actually slightly more than 95 degrees. The curve is okay, you only need to think of the train's maximum turning radius, which requires the calculation of the turning angle of the bogie, coupler and the radius of the centre point of the circle to the circumference which is the track.</p>

              <p>Yes, you have understood my question.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the line ply between Changi Point to Marina Bay, I would believe that they can use a trailer to put the train into the overrun sectors in Changi Point by digging an extreme big hole to do so. But please, Chinatown to Bugis? Where got place to house the big trailer and etc to put the trains into either overrun?</p>

              <p>Er, there is a thread called CCL Discovery 4th April, so whatever above should belong to that thread.</p>
              <p>BTW, it is not eactly possible for the Bombardier Movia C951 to run on CCL, because they will have Active route map info installed, that will only be on DTL, while C830s will have the CCL map only. So unless there is a solution to that, I still feel its not possible yet. There may be some compatibility problems too.</p>

              <p>yes it seemed able to lead to CCLe, except it kind of doesnt
              make sense since the provisional tunnel looked like it is coming
              from an angle and not straight. but again I didnt manage to get a
              very close scrutiny on it thus I said I am not too sure.</p>
              <p>IIRC Nicoll Highway is supposed to be Bukit Timah Line (DTL2)
              terminus and Promenade to serve Circle Line Downtown Extension
              (DTL1). so you are sorta right about the "cramming". it is also the
              cause of the uncertainty right now.</p>
              <p>EDIT: after a little thought, the angle of the tunnel is just
              too weird. I suppose it is really part of some older plans. it
              doesnt even fit into the schematic below.</p>

              <p>High chance. Coz they do not want a modification project to Promendae, which I feel what the heck they buy a track without slanted X crossover when approaching to a junction of the other platforms. And seriously, Jurong East got their modification project after 21 years (1988 operational - 2009) or about 13 years, if you counted only from Full line NSL and exclude the era of Branch Line (1996 - 2009)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And given that the CCLe opening date is at 2012, and CCL opens at 2010, there is only a gap of 2 years, which is simply too short to change the tracks already.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So I believe the 2 platforms has 3.5 possibilites of fate:</p>
              <p>1: CCLe, but that will render my above theory wrong</p>
              <p>2: Abandoned, but why they would use wooden planks instead of a concrete wall?</p>
              <p>3: Used for a future line, but not DTL. If that is going to happen, then, chances are, the track towards Bayfront is a dead end becoz there wont be a overrun which will need to make a junction. I doubt the feasibility to do so given that the terminus are usually given a great length of overrun in case of emergency / train faults. (Unless they are going to have a modification project -- Hell, why dont they use it for DTL NOW!? This is what I meant an additional 0.5 possibility)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: DTL is confirmed to have a new station and new platforms, just like Outram Park or Dhoby Ghaut. It cannot be a Raffles Place or City Hall in any case.</p>

              <p>Also, my personal opinion (Due to lack of facts given out) is that IF the 1st possibility of the above post is proven Wrong (And my theory of JEMP time gap is correct), then, the Extension line will come into these possiblities:</p>
              <p>1: Through line between Marina Bay - Harbourfront (But the amount of trains to handle Peak Hours can be an issue)</p>
              <p>2: Marina Bay - Stadium / Mountbatten Shuttle train. If the train terminates at Stadium, then it will be like Yishun peak hour train. If the train terminates at Mountbatten, then the train from Stadium, will crossover to the slidings heading towards Mountbatten before approaching Mountbatten station in the face of towards Dakota and terminate there. Then, the train will "switch side" just like any terminus, and proceed back to Marina Bay via Stadium as per normal.</p>
