              <p>If Circle Line were to relieve CBD interchanges, why are there
              people still transfering to the NSL NB while going to bishan or
              upwards. Usually the trains are just plain empty, even the
              platforms. Look at Paya Lebar CCL Station, the platform is so small
              yet even getting a seat @ the platform or the train is easy. Look
              at NSL/EWL, you can't even get in, even if there is a slight delay,
              the whole station would be crowded. </p>
              <p>CCL is to relieve CBD interchanges, yes, but why are City Hall
              and Raffles Place so crowded? Despite its just 1 station away to
              transfer, People rather take the trains directly back home instead
              of beating the crowd. Like example, I would like to beat the
              massive crowd at City Hall and Raffles Place, I would like to go
              from Eunos to Clementi, I take a train to PYB and go to DBG, then I
              transfer to NEL, I go to Outram Park transfer to EWL. It doesn't
              have good East-West connectivity, only North-East and North-West.
              People still rely on EWL to get to the other side of Singapore from
              East to West</p>
              <p>There are many major schools along the Bukit Timah corridor,
              DTL2 serve that area, but its too late, There are too many cars
              already, the demand is too high, they should had started planning
              long ago, knowing that the northwestern area of Singapore is
              starting and SMRT is unable to fulfill the demand. The
              construction should had started way back, right when NEL was
              completed. The stretch DTL 3 serve have good connectivity but the
              buses are unable to upkeep it, Even if it goes along Bedok
              Reservoir road where thousands are living there, No new buildings
              were built , only a few condominium, the buses are so crowded,
              DTL3 would serve more than 10 schools. The middle platform @ Tanah
              Merah was to accommodate the DTL but with the recent
              opening on the branch , it moved to Expo. </p>
              <p>Eastern Region Line would serve the whole East Coast but, is
              East Coast that populated? I wonder is it?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>No, the middle platform in TNM had never meant to serve the DTL 3, becoz, looking from the alignment, it turns right towards Changi Depot / Expo instead of Left, which would had been running parallel with the Simei - Pasir Ris sector.</p>

              <p>While CCL is meant to save time, I cant see much savings in time when you travel from PYL to DBG via CCL and transfer to NEL to OTP and transfer back to EWL towards Western areas of Singapore. In fact, it wastes more time (I tested before)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, the most benefital is those from BNV or PYL - BSH, where only a quarter of the circle is involved. The second most benefital should be HBF - BNV, which logically looks faster compared to HBF - OTP and OTP - Western part of EWL stations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Other than that, unless CCL6 is really built (Or Marina Bay Extension extended to Harbourfront, completing a full Circle, which is a long term plan), I cant see any use of CCL 1 and 2 apart of the stations in between. (I mean CCL 1 and 2 are useless in transfering to other trains, they are in fact slower)</p>

              <p>Benefits pple at Bishan and Serangoon the most. e.g. Serangoon to Buona Vista/Jurong, no need to take purple line anymore. if from east want to go to west stations, just take green line direct, no point taking CCL. Also, Serangoon to Paya Lebar, direct instead of transferring twice at dhoby and city hall</p>

              <p>if there should be a CCL Stage 6 to dhoby ghaut, then it should have an interchange station near tanjong pagar mrt station, such that there is a walkway (not sure if underground or overhead) that links the tanjong pagar railway station. i prefer CCL6 as it would enable CCL1 &amp; CCL2 to be fully utilised, at least those in west and north of singapore can benefit. east side i'm not sure.</p>
              <p>as for marina bay extension to harbourfront, forget it until at least 2027, as psa's lease on tanjong pagar port expires the same year.</p>

              I am sure CCL's benefits are mainly for those intending to transfer between the radial lines. I can get to Ang Mo Kio and Bishan much faster than currently when CCL4/5 finally opens. many people are also using it to transfer from PYL to BSN/SRG.
              
              CCL doesnt seem to be designed to be taken in a loop though, it mainly provides opportunities for faster transfers.
              
              do agree CCL1 may see greater use if the segment between HBF and DBG is connected.

              Having trains running in circles are not practical. 
              
              If you have a line in continuous loop, there is no termination station. Terminals are important. Trains stopping at terminal stations stop for a while, as you probably know. 
              
              Whenever there is a delay somewhere on the line, it will take forever to remedy and recover as there is no waiting at terminals. Trains pile up behind, leaving a black hole ahead of the delay, and there is no way to recover time, as there is no time left to recover. 
              
              A solution is for trains to run in circles, but, stop somewhere along the line, and then reverse direction.

              <p>Paya Lebar is the best choice, terminate at middle platform for trains going clockwise, trains going anti-clockwise terminates at Promenade Platform B.
