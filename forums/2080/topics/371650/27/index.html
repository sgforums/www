              <p>AFAIK, the middle track at Paya Lebar leads to a dead end shortly after the station, unlike the leaked track diagram for DT27's middle platform which is more like Ang Mo Kio style (Paya Lebar is unique and no stations with 3 tracks can be used as comparison) where the middle track leds to depot and both sides can connect to middle track (Paya Lebar only 1 side can go to middle platform, that is from MacPherson DBG bound).</p>

              <p>Thus, I doubt it can extend further, because the converging curves comes soon after (So that Dakota is not as wide as Paya Lebar) the station in DBG bound.</p>

O -- while the lack of housing development and a big spacious space on a side of the Upper East Coast Road could be used as depot, but can it be as big as KCD / GBD -- the DTL Stage 2 depot? I doubt so. How about Changi (Point) Depot? While the proximity to existing EWL Changi Depot makes me feel like preferring a CHD, but CCL should have used BSD if this theory were to hold true. Changi Point Depot might be another option for ERL depot, but the proximity to Changi Airport and Changi Navy Base, do you think it is a good choice? I think it is like putting all eggs in one basket. One place kena terrorist strike = gg!. Thus, to me, I feel like having a spare depot to use during crisis, which is this purpose.)</p>

              <p>No, it cant be. Given from what LTA had announced, the future ERL 21km has 12 stations in a straight line without a branch line link. This is fact. The previous post and analysis is more like personal's wish and hope with the reasoning.</p>
              <p>I think if there is such extension, it can only be used when crisis or major issues (Major train fault) that small depot in Bedok South / Siglap or Upper East Coast (1 of the 3 would likely to have a depot, based on my prediction again, if not it would be at Changi Point, but that can have more security risk by putting all eggs in 1 basket.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But, we have to consider the space in KCD (Can keep 77 trains, CCL took 40 of it, and the rest should be for DTL) can make this proposal difficult.</p>

              <p>No, it cant be. Given from what LTA had announced, the future ERL 21km has 12 stations in a straight line without a branch line link. This is fact. The previous post and analysis is more like personal's wish and hope with the reasoning.</p>
              <p>I think if there is such extension, it can only be used when crisis or major issues (Major train fault) that small depot in Bedok South / Siglap or Upper East Coast (1 of the 3 would likely to have a depot, based on my prediction again, if not it would be at Changi Point, but that can have more security risk by putting all eggs in 1 basket.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But, we have to consider the space in KCD (Can keep 77 trains, CCL took 40 of it, and the rest should be for DTL) can make this proposal difficult.</p>

              <p>Its still better to link ERL up to EWL/CCL somewhere in the midpoint. even though its not announced, they should consider doing that in future. unless they feel the bus link is sufficient(Marine parade to Dakota/PYL station a few bus stops away)</p>

              Hi Youyuan, thanks for the video..........indeed the annoucement is really messy should follow like the NSL. Should sae "This train service terminates at Paya Lebar Interchange" then approaching Paya Lebar should go like this " Paya Lebar Int...This train service terminates at this station, all passengers please alight, passengers who are continuing their journey, please proceed to the EWL or board the next train to DBG Int.....Paya Lebar Interchange....please mind the platform gap."
