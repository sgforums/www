              <p>3: Used for a future line, but not DTL. If that is going to
                  happen, then, chances are, the track towards Bayfront is a dead end
                  becoz there wont be a overrun which will need to make a junction. I
                  doubt the feasibility to do so given that the terminus are usually
                  given a great length of overrun in case of emergency / train
                  faults.</p>

              <p>Edit: If that will be the case, a MRT terminus without overrun, it would be like a Bukit Panjang LRT at Choa Chu Kang except without an approaching track cutting to its direction. But is that LRT a CBTC system or what?</p>

              <p>This is what I would like to say as well. Between Mountbatten &amp; Stadium got a middle track sliding all the way, just like Farrer Park &amp; Little India (Not really EWL Outram Park). This is why Mountbatten can be terminus for the daily last train AND I specluate, there is a chance either Stadium OR Mountbatten can become CCLe Shuttle terminus, apart of Marina Bay.</p>

              <p>Possible. Just to add on, the siding looks like it's about 200m long. If there are 2 ATP blocks, it might actually accomodate 2 trains at once.</p>

              <p>The line really curves after the station. I might be right after all, or yet another possibility is that it links to DTL.</p>

              <p>My 2 cents thought.</p>
              <p>If  the Bayfront leg is to be eventually placed under DTL, there would be not rational to have Stadium - Bayfront kind of leg, it will only confuse people as DTL commences revenue.</p>
              <p>Also schedule wise, it's going to be messy just like wat happened to CGA line before it was downgraded into a spur feeder line.</p>

              <p>this diagram isnt conclusive since it isnt a full-fledged technical schematic illustrating the routes of tunnels on both platforms. if we were to try and infer anything from here, it is that the current platform being used now has a Y-split. and the unused platforms have nothing.</p>
              <p>in the schematic that I posted, the unused platforms are shown as empty with no tunnels running out of it. so where that tunnel leads remain unanswered. from its angle it may be a cross-track onto DTL but it is really just my guess. remember that this tunnel isnt designed for DTL nor CCL use right from the start.</p>
              <p>and yes I understand trains from both lines can inter-operate if signals are compatible. the question now is we cannot confirm if CCL and DTL are using compatible signalling. if I have to make a guess again, I will say yes, reason being Alstom and ST Electronics, the turnkey contractor for CCL, will be doing E&amp;M for DTL as well.</p>

              <p><br>Dhoby Ghaut leg will become a spur shuttle unless govt goes on to link up HBF &amp; Promenade into a real 'circle'.</p>

              <p>Wow this is a complicated debate...</p>
              <p>Here's my take after reading... According to Samuel, DTL is going to have a new platform and according to one of the plans I saw earlier, DTL is even lower than the current platform we saw during open house.</p>
              <p>I conclude that the boarded up platform is for CCLe (or stage 6 I would too presume).

              <p>As for the mysterious boarded up platform, could there be services that just run in a circle? (gg round the whole circle without gg to DBG via ESP) I'm just making this up as i go along. So this full circle thingy could be sort of a 3rd service.</p>
              <p>Am I making any sense here? shoot me down if I'm talking gibberish =) But I do think that would be quite a feasible way to run the circle line as there are 3 different services to ply every direction.</p>

              <p><br>For continuous circle, trains will still use the current platform A &amp; B because the unopened platforms have no link to Nicoll Highway station.</p>
              <p>Which means a great probability for trains to/fro BayFront &amp; Esplanande to share the current platforms A &amp; B.</p>
              <p>It is up to LTA to plan something out for the unopened platforms.</p>

              <p>Not really. I would read it as Harbourfront via (IF CCLe / Stage 6 is fully constructed as a full circle) Marina Bay via Bayfront is CCK then Promendae is BPJ. Dhoby Ghaut - ESP will be Ten Mile Junction. But there are certain things that is cannot be using BPLRT as direct comparison.</p>

              <p>PS: It is not possible for Bayfront to turn to Esplandae without via Promendae, as there is no provisional crossover for that.</p>

              <p>Look carefully when travelling from Esplanade to Promenade to your right just before the train turns left. It's a flat wall. Before that there's a green fence. No tracks yet, maybe no tunnels yet. But I'm sure there's a use for it. since it's quite odd for the tunnel wall to curve nicely away from the track.</p>

              <p>It's a diagram. *facepalm* Not a geographically-accurate representation. Grr. In fact, I tried to make it so that the way the track turns can be visible to the untrained eye. Real track diagrams have no main lines running vertically, only horizontally and diagonally.</p>
