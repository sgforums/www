              <p>CCLe and DTL tunnels run parallel under the river and are
              already completed! (DTL1 newsletter/no. 10) The diagram in the
              newsletter is specific; CCLe left and DTL1 on the right.</p>
              <p>You might think it does not make sense for Circle Line (Marina
              branch) and Downtown Line to run parallel. But during planning,
              they would have considered<br> <br> (1) saving the pain of passengers having to change around again at
              Promendae since both lines are heading to different ends of the
              island OR/AND<br> (2) do a Raffles Place style track swtiching, since Bayfront would
              be the middle of the Downtown Line (if you take Stage 3 into
              consideration).</p>

              <p>Given from what you have posted, it seemed that although the other side of CCL Promendae platform is also another unused platform, which the forumers here know, but the verdict is it is a useless platform for a very long time. Sad.....</p>

              <p>To NickLim: Nice effort, but, not meant to offend you, that the diagram is incorrect, given the sgbuses' LTA map shown a marking of A4 is "Proposed Promendae Station", this shown clearly, that DTL station cannot be at the same spot as CCL, as if it is a City Hall or Raffles Place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But, if your DTL is drawn below than the CCL (B4 or even B5), and put the DTL Promendae station on the right, I believe, chances are, you have got it right.</p>

              <p>It's possible. From what I observed while travelling from Esplanade to Nicoll Highway, the current track do not meet with the unused tunnel after Promenade station. This means that the tunnel just ends there, or curves left. If DTL will use a new station, this means that this is a shuttle platform with a buffer at the end, as I have predicted and posted in my Facebook album.</p>
              <p>With this edit, please ignore the left turn after Promenade station towards Bugis, and use the brown lines as the Promenade - Marina Bay shuttle line.</p>

              <p>Yes, the 2 new tracks have no link to Nicoll Highway and Stadium stations.</p>

              <p>The reason why CCL trains cannot run on NEL, is becoz of the power supply used is different. CCL uses 3rd rail, just like EWL / NSL while NEL is the so far only Singapore MRT uses pantographs.</p>

              <p>BTW, even if you managed to steal / manufactured a C151 train, and you can attempt to fit into NEL tracks, becoz they are standard gauges.

Of course, you can put a C151 onto CCL, and most likely can drive it, but dangerously under manual mode (Due to different security systems used)</p>

              <p>BTW, even if you managed to steal / manufactured a C151 train, and you can attempt to fit into NEL tracks, becoz they are standard gauges. But due to NEL does not have 3rd rail, so the C151 cannot move. Of course, you can put a C151 onto CCL, and most likely can drive it, but dangerously under manual mode (Due to different security systems used)</p>

              <p>To the trained eye, you'll see that this idea makes no sense at all as the shuttle trains would have to either consolidate services to 1 level of the station, or have alternate trains arriving at alternate platforms (a la JEMP).</p>
              <p>I have decided to extend the overrun to allow alighting on B3 and boarding on B2. This is to allow passengers going in the same direction ease of transfer. This might also be the actual case since the tunnel seems to turn left after Promenade. (Anyone with a video of the ride between Esplanade and Promenade can help me with this haha.)</p>

              <p>This method is widely used in Hong Kong as most of the line's terminals are also interchanges.</p>
              <p>With this, should Stage 6 pop up (HarbourFront to Promenade), the shuttle train going towards Dhoby Ghaut would go towards Bayfront and Marina Bay instead of Promenade as believed.</p>

              <p>Makes sense too. But its gonna be quite chaotic and slightly confusing this way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I personally feel that DTL is going to have another platform, due to planning. You see ar, they would have planned for the station ages ago and definitely should not have planned for the CCL-DTL thingy, so what I said firstly should have been wrong. Of course, as a commuter, I would be glad if they did it in the CTH manner, but its just very hard as they are using 2 different models of trains, that are so far unlikely to crossover to the other line, as I believe the specifications, the signals and some of the new technologies may not match, so if the track were to be shared, it would be quite confusing.</p>

              <p>this is actually a diagram made by me over at SSC.</p>
              <p>anyway further discussions on that side has proven that the CCLe platform indicated here is unlikely to materialise.</p>
              <p>this is because the current Promenade platforms in service now has a Y-shaped split to serve both the CCLe and CCL1 towards Esplanade. and if the currently unused platforms are to serve CCLe, this makes the segment a level junction (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_junction">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_junction</a>), which LTA has been trying to avoid.</p>
              <p>the final nail in the coffin would be that these platforms were originally designed to serve the then-Bukit Timah Line (BTL, now DTL2). this original provision is destroyed along with the Nicoll Highway collapse. this also resulted in the DTL1 (back then the CCL Downtown Extension) interchange shifting from Nicoll Highway to Promenade, resulting in the current plans we see in the picture above.</p>
              <p>this CCLe platform indicated above will thus never serve DTL1 as well, since the DTL Promenade station is already under construction as we are discussing here and is probably of incompatible signalling.</p>
              <p>because of historic reasons, what will most likely happen is that CCLe and the CCL1 services will share the current two platforms. </p>

              <p>anyway further discussions on that side has proven that the CCLe platform indicated here is unlikely to materialise.</p>
              <p>this is because the current Promenade platforms in service now has a Y-shaped split to serve both the CCLe and CCL1 towards Esplanade. and if the currently unused platforms are to serve CCLe, this makes the segment a level junction (see <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_junction">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_junction</a>), which LTA has been trying to avoid.</p>
              <p>the final nail in the coffin would be that these platforms were originally designed to serve the then-Bukit Timah Line (BTL, now DTL2). this original provision is destroyed along with the Nicoll Highway collapse. this also resulted in the DTL1 (back then the CCL Downtown Extension) interchange shifting from Nicoll Highway to Promenade, resulting in the current plans we see in the picture above.</p>
              <p>this CCLe platform indicated above will thus never serve DTL1 as well, since the DTL Promenade station is already under construction as we are discussing here and is probably of incompatible signalling.</p>
              <p>because of historic reasons, what will most likely happen is that CCLe and the CCL1 services will share the current two platforms. </p>

              <p>So you trying to say that the platforms behind those walls will never be used or what? What a waste.</p>
