              <p>LOL. I boarded the same train but going DBG. Stood by the TO, listened to the walkie talkie and looked at the cabin. The walkie talkie says there is a train stuck at PYL. The TO inside communicates with KCDEP, unable to activate CM, then had to use RM. Then there was a spare at KCDEP entrance, so the KCDEP personnel also told all to prepare for the receiving. Train service resumed at around 7:28 am. Train frequencies srewed totally.</p>

              <p>Not <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>if</strong></span></em> you are not mistaken, because, you are correct.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The middle track in PYL leads to a dead end right after the station a bit heading Dakota without any connection, and soon after the station, the other 2 tracks has a converging curve as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So there are 2 speculations on this middle track:</p>
              <p>1: More likely but not what I wished: It is a true dead end without any use unless a PLMP is made (Paya Lebar Modification Project), where I dont know why the people in LTA had designed PYL in such a way!?</p>
              <p>2: Less likely but this is what I wished: Between the converging curve on the non middle track in PYL, this track could have gone downwards, and connect to Eastern Region Line in somewhere near Mountbatten Road / Tanjong Katong Road (South) junction. Because I kept wondering the upcoming Eastern Region Line's depot location, where I think a major depot like Kim Chuan can only be possible at Changi Point, which may not be the best location, considering the proximity to existing EWL Changi Depot and more importantly, the Changi Airport and Changi Naval Base nearby, which is something like putting all the eggs in one basket, that obviously is a bad choice. Think, what if a terrorist attack managed to succeed in either one of the 3?</p>
              <p>The Marina area indeed have such a space, but if they would intend to do it (And forget about Marina Development etc), they would have done it now instead of constructing a maintenance facility in Marina Bay instead, for the upcoming Downtown Line Stage 1 (Gali Batu depot is not ready yet, and there is no link from Kim Chuan to Downtown Line as well, because the Downtown Line Stage 3 is under construction as well)</p>

              <p>Even I noticed the schedules ends up the SWT has to wait for 1 full trip train in between before moving off.</p>

                  announced (SMRT said) that Promenade will be future built in
                  Raffles Place orientation, so we can be sure that the opposite

              <p>SMRT expressed, Promenade station will be developed into an interchange station, connecting to Downtown Line.

              <p> However, even if it is really a DTL purpose, then what about CCLe? I think that there is a chance where DTL is away, and the other direction (Unused platform) is CCLe. If it is going to be like Raffles Place (Or City Hall) style, then it means that CCL trains can ply on DTL and DTL trains can ply on CCL as well, which is what the initial announcement of Downtown Extension (And not Downtown Line by then). And by doing so (The unused platform is DTL / CCLe), it means that the existing tracks need to change. (A so called PMMP? Promenade Modification Project)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW, I remembered that there was a disruption for a day or 2 between Outram Park - Harbourfront due to Circle Line, was that involving the change of tracks layout?</p>
              <p>Also, just a question, is there a chance that actually the unused platforms, did linked to Nicoll Highway, except, it was the old collapsed station instead of the current NCW because I did not see anything different between Promenade and Nicoll Highway.</p>

              <p>I think its unlikely. from what I read, at the point of collapse, the cut and cover segment of tunnel after Promenade and the river crossing to Stadium was completed, thus a new set of tunnels were mined.</p>

              <p>A bit of my views. Has anyone noticed that the interchange for cross-platform stations are denoted by a <strong>o</strong> while interchanges requiring you to walk are denoted by an <strong>o-o</strong>? Excluding MRT-LRT interchanges. That being said, could Promenade and Bayfront be cross-platform interchanges then?</p>

              <p>I was quite confused with CCL RATIS.. as the next train arriving in mins can somehow "jumped" around.. next train is 2 mins, becomes 6 to 3 to 5 and to 4.. Then the train has arrived alr..</p>
              <p>secondly is if the train is bounding to DBG or  PYL.. also likes to jump around..</p>

              <p>I've tried to make this look to-scale.

              <p>Similarly, CCL will operate the same way, by stopping at its Platform B. Passengers will alight on the left for transfer to NEL, and the right to VivoCity. If it proceeds on to the TBS and Platform A, allow passengers to stay on the train. But if the crossover before entering the station is a scissors/diamond/tandem crossing, this method will prove difficult and it may be as dumb as JEMP.</p>
              <p>To add on: This method was used in Hong Kong's Nam Cheong station to connect the Tung Chung Line with the West Rail Line, which was built 5 years apart. Too bad LTA didn't plan for this, as seen on the signboard posted in HarbourFront Centre.</p>

                  go to Vivo on the left and for cases that are overstopped, they
                  have to transfer to another (probably same lah) train via concourse
                  (Climbing Up &amp; down exercise via esclators / stairs / lifts
                  ....?).</p>
              <p>So the CCL will work the same way as well.</p>

              <p>Got. In fact, the tracks for both lines are swee swee east-west oriented. Also the same depth.</p>
              <p>Hmm I think you mean alight on the right? Because my proposed platforms has no link with the concourse. No space upstairs. Or maybe there is but I haven't noticed.</p>

              <p>Diamond is another word for scissor crossing. The diamond part is the centre of the X. Hard to explain in words but I think you know what I'm talking about. Tandem is like Pasir Ris, Boon Lay, Joo Koon, Choa Chu Kang (LRT).</p>

              <p>I was quite confused with CCL RATIS.. as the next train arriving in mins can somehow "jumped" around.. next train is 2 mins, becomes 6 to 3 to 5 and to 4.. Then the train has arrived alr..</p>
              <p>secondly is if the train is bounding to DBG or  PYL.. also likes to jump around..</p>
