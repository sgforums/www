              <p>this is because the current Promenade platforms in service now
              has a Y-shaped split to serve both the CCLe and CCL1 towards
              Esplanade. and if the currently unused platforms are to serve CCLe,
              this makes the segment a level junction (see <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_junction">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_junction</a>), which
              LTA has been trying to avoid.</p>

              <p>Well, it could be for the trains to change tracks. I'm not too sure about the signalling part, but they share Kim Chuan Depot's stabling area, which means the 2 lines' tracks meet in there. MTR's Tung Chung and Tseun Wan lines also use different signalling but the tracks are still linked.</p>
              <p>But if the platforms will really never be used, why did they use wooden planks to cover it?</p>

              <p>CCLe is part of a greater "Stage 6" plan to become full circle, so it cannot be a shuttle using the unused platforms. not in the long run at least.</p>
              <p>the most feasible plan now is when CCL becomes full circle. the dhoby ghaut to promenade stretch can then potentially form a new line terminating at promenade (since the platform end in a buffer at the unused platforms)</p>
              <p>but promenade certainly is a weird place for a city terminus for any new rail line so I have no idea how LTA is going to modify their plans now.</p>

              <p>well since the platforms are already built, I think it is better if LTA tries to plan a future line to use them than to really put it to death.</p>
              <p>however this future line is very unlikely to be CCL or DTL.</p>

              <p>I think you got your perspective wrong haha. Okay, now we travel from Esplanade to Promenade, front view. The train starts to turn sharply to the left. At the start of the turn, there is a gap to the right. This is the tunnel I'm talking about. If you continue the turn, there's a green fence to your right and the empty trackbed on your left. Continue summore and you'll see the point towards Bayfront before entering the platform.</p>

              <p>I think you got your perspective wrong haha. Okay, now we travel
              from Esplanade to Promenade, front view. The train starts to turn
              sharply to the left. At the start of the turn, there is a gap to
              the right. This is the tunnel I'm talking about. If you continue
              the turn, there's a green fence to your right and the empty
              trackbed on your left. Continue summore and you'll see the point
              towards Bayfront before entering the platform.</p>

              <p>Nope. My guess is that the tracks will be fitted in just before they open Stage 6 to have a Dhoby Ghaut - Somewhere shuttle. Not sure about the layout of Marina Bay and Bayfront so can't comment yet. Before that, it will be a Promenade - Marina Bay shuttle.</p>

              <p>then our guess is somewhat on the same page. I think it has the potential to be part of a future line that would most likely go beyond Dhoby Ghaut's buffers.</p>
              <p>but this is definitely a deviation from original LTA plans so in a way, this segment is anybody's guess.</p>

              <p>Okay, just finished redrawing the diagram. With a buffer at the
              end of the track, it should look something like this.</p>

              <p>To the trained eye, you'll see that this idea makes no sense at
              all as the shuttle trains would have to either consolidate services
              to 1 level of the station, or have alternate trains arriving at
              alternate platforms (a la JEMP).</p>
              <p>I have decided to extend the overrun to allow alighting on B3
              and boarding on B2. This is to allow passengers going in the same
              direction ease of transfer. This might also be the actual case
              since the tunnel seems to turn left after Promenade. (Anyone with a
              video of the ride between Esplanade and Promenade can help me with
              this haha.)</p>

              <p>This method is widely used in Hong Kong as most of the line's
              terminals are also interchanges.</p>
              <p>With this, should Stage 6 pop up (HarbourFront to Dhoby Ghaut),
              the shuttle train going towards Dhoby Ghaut would go towards
              Bayfront and Marina Bay instead of Promenade as believed.</p>

              <p>Sorry, even if that Stage 6 exists, it is only from Harbourfront to Promenade Via Marina Bay. This is because:</p>
              <p>Fact 1: Dhoby Ghaut overrun is facing a dead end, in a direction towards Somerset (Based on the station map)</p>
              <p>Fact 2: There is a NEL direct service plying from Harbourfront to Dhoby Ghaut, I dont see a need to do that again.</p>

              <p>yes it seemed able to lead to CCLe, except it kind of doesnt make sense since the provisional tunnel looked like it is coming from an angle and not straight. but again I didnt manage to get a very close scrutiny on it thus I said I am not too sure.</p>
              <p>IIRC Nicoll Highway is supposed to be Bukit Timah Line (DTL2) terminus and Promenade to serve Circle Line Downtown Extension (DTL1). so you are sorta right about the "cramming". it is also the cause of the uncertainty right now.</p>
              <p>EDIT: after a little thought, the angle of the tunnel is just too weird. I suppose it is really part of some older plans. it doesnt even fit into the schematic below.</p>
