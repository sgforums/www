              <p>interesting... as i have expected. firstly, i thought is dhoby ghaut-Paya lebar</p>
              <p>then when i think back, the demand when people transfer CCL-EWL is higher than going to CBD (CCL)-EWL</p>

              <p>Went for open house today but had very little time to explore. Thanks for the vid! I didnt notice the branch to the left side as I was intrigued by what went on on the right...</p>
              <p>Same direction as the vid I was travelling from ESP to Promenade. I noticed when the train was going very slowly, there was a track that branched RIGHT into a dead end and after awhile, another dead end would branch back to the line... Did anyone notice? I have a feeling this one is for DTL (possible crossover) and the closed platform is CCLe.</p>
              <p>From the vid I can't see where it branches out but at 2:25 can see one track branch back in.</p>

              <p>No, black dotted cant be Promenade to Dhoby Ghaut given that considerations must be made to existing Harbourfront Via Bishan / Marymount will then how?

              <p> </p>
              <p>But I believe, if Bayfront is NOT a stack, then there is a great chance that daily first train from Promendae to Marina Bay is using the current platform (Towards DBG), go straight instead of right towards Bayfront &amp; Marina Bay. Then, it returns to Promendae like my second diagram, and use a new, opposite of current platform. BUT the issue is, there does not seemed to have provisions for that :( , so it might jolly well as a wasted platform.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My personal view is that, since between Marina Bay - Harbourfront Via Bishan is not feasible due to amount of C830s, and the track diagram does not allow trains from Dakota to Paya Lebar using Middle Platform (Only from MacPherson, too bad), and using Promendae as terminus of the Marina Bay Extension may not be the choice, due to the need to replace the existing tracks to "slanted X shaped crossover", where the age of changing the tracks, is simply too new to do so, I think the authority may choose to ply trains between Marina Bay - Mountbatten, and when the train leaves Stadium, it uses the middle track towards Mountbatten, and terminates the train at Mountbatten Dhoby Ghaut bound. Of course, they may do a "sliding method" like present LTE, such that they get everyone alight at Stadium, terminates the train in the middle track, and resume service on Stadium towards Marina Bay.</p>
              <p>In Summary, the feasible options on top of Dhoby Ghaut - Harbourfront Via Bishan Full train are:</p>
              <p>1: Promendae - Marina Bay shuttle train</p>
              <p>2: Marina Bay - Harbourfront full train</p>
              <p>3: Marina Bay - Stadium / Mountbatten (BTW, the last train from Marymount terminates at Mountbatten)</p>

                                              trains between Marina Bay - Mountbatten, and when the train leaves
                                              Stadium, it uses the middle track towards Mountbatten, and
                                              terminates the train at Mountbatten Dhoby Ghaut bound. Of course,
                                              they may do a "sliding method" like present LTE, such that they get
                                              everyone alight at Stadium, terminates the train in the middle
                                              track, and resume service on Stadium towards Marina Bay.</p>
              <p>In Summary, the feasible options on top of Dhoby Ghaut -
                                              Harbourfront Via Bishan Full train are:</p>
              <p>1: Promendae - Marina Bay shuttle train</p>
              <p>2: Marina Bay - Harbourfront full train</p>
              <p>3: Marina Bay - Stadium / Mountbatten (BTW, the last train from
                                              Marymount terminates at Mountbatten)</p>

              <p>CCLe and DTL tunnels run parallel under the river and are already completed! (DTL1 newsletter/no. 10) The diagram in the newsletter is specific; CCLe left and DTL1 on the right.</p>
              <p>You might think it does not make sense for Circle Line (Marina branch) 
                                          and Downtown Line to run parallel. But during planning, they would have considered <br><br>(1) saving the pain of passengers having to change around again at Promendae since both lines are heading to different ends of the island OR/AND<br>(2) do a Raffles Place style track swtiching, since Bayfront would be the middle of the Downtown Line (if you take Stage 3 into consideration).</p>
