              <p><strong>Next phase of Circle Line to open on Apr 17</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The second phase of the Circle Line will open to 
              passengers on April 17. The 11-station stretch, from Bartley to Dhoby 
              Ghaut stations, will start operations almost a year after the first five
               stations were opened to the public last May. 
              <br> <br> With this new opening, about half the Circle Line or about 16 stations 
              will connect commuters to places like the new Sports Hub through Stadium
               Station, to Suntec via Promenade Station and the museums via Bras Basah
               Station. 
              <br> <br> Transport Minister Raymond Lim said: "This is a significant thing for us
               because now you have these direct connections. So if you are on the 
              eastern side, north-eastern side, you have a direct line that connects 
              you instead of having to go to the city centre." 
              <br> <br> So a commuter going from, say, interchange station Paya Lebar to Bishan 
              can shave off about 18 minutes or half his travelling time, said the 
              Land Transport Authority. Commuters can bypass the busy City Hall and 
              Raffles Place stations.
              <br> <br> Building the Paya Lebar Station was not easy. One of the challenges that
               engineers faced in building this interchange station was that they had 
              to connect an underground line to an existing above ground station. 
              <br> <br> For commuters who also had to endure congestion during road diversions, 
              the opening has been welcomed. 
              <br> <br> Said one man in the street: "The transportation was very bad and there 
              used to have jams all over and time taken from one place to another was 
              very bad. Now of course, there are a lot of changes." 
              <br> <br> "It saves time, like when we are rushing to meet friends and family, it 
              will be much more better," said another commuter. 
              <br> <br> Transport authorities now expect the Circle Line ridership to spike to 
              about 200,000 daily. 
              <br> <br> Also operating will be the station that caused a delay to the opening of
               the Circle Line when the site at Nicoll Highway collapsed. 
              <br> <br> Sim Wee Meng, group director, Rail, Land Transport Authority, said: 
              "Nicoll Highway, we have built at the new site which is 100 metres away 
              from existing site. It's now completed and will open as part of Circle 
              Line 1 &amp; 2." 
              <br> <br> As for the possibility of bus rationalisation, Mr Lim said: "The LTA 
              will have to work with the operators to see whether they need to 
              streamline any of the services in order to feed into the Circle Line." 
              <br> <br> The final phase of the Circle Line, which will link up the western parts
               of Singapore to the line with stops in places like Botanic Gardens and 
              Holland Village, is expected to be ready next year.     - CNA/vm</span></p>

                      the
                      public last May.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">3. About 200,000 people are expected to use the 16 
                      stations
                      from Dhoby Ghaut to Marymount every day.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Enhanced Connectivity and Greater Travel Time 
                      Saving with
                      CCL</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">4. The orbital CCL will enhance connectivity with the 
                      existing
                      MRT lines and provide significant travel time savings for commuters. 
                      Please
                      refer to <a href="http://www.lta.gov.sg/images/Travel%20Time%20Savings.pdf">Annex
                      A</a> for several examples of travel time savings.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">5. With Paya Lebar Interchange Station joining CCL to 
                      the
                      existing East-West Line, passengers travelling from the eastern parts of
                      Singapore can now bypass the busy City Hall and Raffles Place 
                      interchanges to
                      get to the city and northern parts of Singapore. The same holds true for
                       those
                      travelling from the north and north-east commuting to the city and the 
                      eastern
                      part of the island.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">6. The new stations are located at the doorsteps of 
                      various
                      entertainment and recreational facilities, so commuters can now travel 
                      straight
                      to these destinations with ease. For examples, the arts enthusiasts can 
                      alight
                      at Bras Basah Station to visit the Singapore Art Museum and the National
                       Museum
                      of Singapore; sports fans can get off at Stadium Station to enjoy the
                      surrounding sports, entertainment and leisure facilities at Singapore 
                      Indoor
                      Stadium, Arina Stadium Waterfront and Leisure Park Kallang.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Residents and Businesses Welcome New Line's Opening</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">7. Residents and business owners along the new MRT 
                      line are
                      eagerly waiting for the eleven stations to open.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">8. Ms Lily Teo, a 58-year-old student care teacher who
                       stays
                      and works in Mountbatten, is ecstatic about the impending opening of the
                       new CCL
                      segment. Ms Teo is pursuing a part-time diploma at an educational 
                      institute in
                      Queenstown and currently takes the bus to connect to the East-West Line 
                      to the
                      school. "I have to rush like crazy every time I knock off from work to 
                      go
                      for my studies. With CCL, I can take my time and still won't be late for
                      classes!" said Ms Teo.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">9. Mr Siow Kee Lin, 66, operates a sundry shop at the 
                      Old
                      Airport Road Market &amp; Food Centre and is thrilled that Dakota and
                      Mountbatten Stations are opening soon. "The new stations will bring more
                      crowds for makan at the food centre and to my shop," said Mr Siow.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>LTA Launched CCL Fan Page on Facebook</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">10. On 5 Jan 2010, the Land Transport Authority

              <p><strong>11 CCL Station Open April</strong></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MRT line will have 16 stations over 16km linking suburbs to city</span></p>
              <p>THE next leg of the MRT Circle Line, which connects the suburbs to 
              the downtown area, will open on April 17.</p>
              <p>Transport Minister Raymond Lim made the announcement on 
              Tuesday morning at a visit to the line's Stadium and Paya Lebar 
              stations. The 11km stretch from Tai Seng in Paya Lebar to Dhoby Ghaut 
              via the Suntec area consists of 11 stations. They join a 5km, 
              five-station leg linking Marymount to Bartley which opened last year.</p>
              <p>Minister Lim said with this half of the Circle Lim opened, 
              commuters will enjoy significant time-savings. The latest stretch of the
               orbital line offers train commuters a new interchange: Paya Lebar, 
              which links the Circle Line to the East-West Line.</p>
              <p>This allows residents living in the north, north-east and 
              east to head to the city and back without having to pass the busy City 
              Hall and Raffles interchanges. Likewise, commuters travelling between 
              satellite towns can bypass the two hubs, opting to change trains at 
              either Dhoby Ghaut or Paya Lebar. Other operational interchanges on the 
              Circle Line the Serangoon and Bishan stations.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim said the rest of the 33km Circle Line will open next 
              year. This final stretch links the northern and western parts of 
              Singapore, with stops at notable places such as Botanic Gardens, Holland
               Village, and HarbourFront.</p>
              <p>The Land Transport Authority expects Circle Line ridership 
              to soar from April 17: from an average 30,000 rides per day today to 
              200,000.</p>

              <p style="line-height: 15px;">For instance, a Serangoon resident travelling to SingPost's Eunos office currently goes by bus, which takes around 25 minutes. From April 17, the same trip by train will take 12 minutes (excluding walking time to station).</p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px;">And someone living in Ang Mo Kio heading for the Old Airport Road hawker centre currently go on a 40-minute bus ride. With the Circle Line, the commute will take 25 minutes - including transfer at Bishan station.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 15px;">
              </span></span></p><p style="line-height: 15px;"><strong>Paya Lebar Station</strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px;">* The Paya Lebar station is an interchange station that connects the circle line to the East-West Line.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px;">* It is the first interchange station integrating above-ground and underground lines.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px;">* Commuters can gain access to the station from three new entrances located along Paya Lebar Road.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px;">* Connectivity is a key consideration for the station's design. It is seamlessly bridged to the East-West line station via two passageways designed to move high volume of human traffic safely and efficiently.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px;">* The station is designed inhouse by LTA.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px;"><strong>Stadium Station</strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px;">* The station is designed to accommodate surge crowds from nearby facilities with its open-air concourse and plaza with entrances at both ends.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px;">* The concourse and plaza are naturally ventilated, and facilitate air flow.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px;">* A central skylight creates an attractive, day-lit platform. Openings above ground allow views down to the platform from the ground level plaza.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px;">* The station won the International Architecture 2008 Award conferred by the Australian Institute of Architects for its functionality and aesthetics.</p>
