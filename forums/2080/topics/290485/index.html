But good advice for those first timers. Ya not much changes actually on the merger, but there goes the 100 years old KCR. Sad. They released a book on the KCR 100 years entitled "A century of commitment, The KCRC story". Bought it at HK $188 @ the commercial press bookshop. Will share some videos on my joyride on MTR and KCR after i convert into my comp.</div>
