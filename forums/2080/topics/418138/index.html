            <div class='col-md body'><p>As an avid transport / MRT fan, let me try my prediction for now:<br><br> <br><br>ERL is known to have 12 stations unless the plans have changed:<br><br> <br><br>So my guess:<br><br> <br><br>1 - Marina Barrage<br><br> <br><br>No explanation required, except the guess is how the track is facing which determines the Marina East and Tanjong Rhu station.<br><br> <br><br>2 - Marina East (It will be within / very close to the existing golf course. This is because if it is located away from golf course, it will detour away Tanjong Rhu).<br><br> <br><br>2a – Promenade<br><br>Remember the existing CCL the other side is NOT use for DTL. Hence, it is either a screwed / f***ed up design by lousy designers (Remember Nicoll Highway incident. Hell, the Downtown line should not have been there!) OR there is another plan Or actually both. Well I assume there is another plan but there are a few theories to it, such as "Holland Line" or CCL Marina Bay extension because there certainly need a new platform there unless the train from Marina Bay terminates at Stadium (There is no crossover until Stadium slidings) or Dhoby Ghaut (More likely a new crossover after PMN but at a cost of skipping PMN and goes Esplanade straight OR the train switch direction on PMN which is .....).<br><br> <br><br>2b – Marina East<br><br>Seriously, that area is so undeveloped until now except a golf course. Unless they want build a disneyland resort there, I cant find justification to build a station there, unless building a "Mandai station" (Shell station along TSL, much like DT4 on Hume Ave). Maybe the golf course will move out but this is uncertain.<br><br> <br><br>Summary: This depends on the ERL Marina Barrage station's facing on which direction.<br><br> <br><br>3 - Tanjong Rhu<br><br> <br><br>3a -- Tanjong Rhu on Rhu Cross<br><br>Only if ERL is interchanging with PMN, it makes a sensible distance to make a stop there. (About 700m away from PMN but separated by a river)<br><br> <br><br>3b -- Tanjong Rhu Bridge that links to Stadium<br><br>If ERL’s Marina East station is located after the golf course, then a station located on Rhu cross will require a turn that is potentially capable to break the train. This spot seemed to have more open space and it is the middle of Tanjong Rhu estate.<br><br> <br><br>4 - Fort Road<br><br>There is a chance that it shift a bit inside to Meyer Road and call it Meyer station. I think it is a strategically good position to put a MRT station to serve the nearby HDB blocks (Quite further down in Kg. Arang Road), students from Dunman High School and the private estate surrounding it.<br><br> <br><br>4.1 - Tanjong Katong South (Seaview)<br><br>Honestly speaking I find the distance from Fort Road to Parkway is simply more than 2km which is unlikely to be true. Yes, this is inner Meyer or Jalan Seaview area surrounded by private properties. I think they may make a shell station if it is not possible / justified to add one such by 2020. Personally, I see a need of station there not only ERL in between station distance only, but see it as an interchange station that links up with "Circle Line Branch Line" [Extend from middle track of PYL as it is a dead end now.] that connects upwards to Paya Lebar (And between Paya Lebar and this station will call Tanjong Katong, located somewhere near Tanjong Katong Girls)<br><br> <br><br>5 - Parkway<br><br>Tell you what, most likely LTA will name it as Marine Parade (Me too). But there will be people suggesting names like Amber too. 3 names for it have suggested. Bingo! There is a chance that this station will be an interchange for "Circle Line Branch Line" if it exists because the usage will certainly higher than "Tanjong Katong South" station mentioned previously.<br><br> <br><br>6 - Telok Kurau<br><br> <br><br>This station is named after the station is located near Telok Kurau Road junction with Marine Crescent. This is the station that is nearest to my house. No, they won’t name after a Police / Fire station or Hospital anyway and hence Telok Kurau is by far the best name.<br><br> <br><br>7 - Siglap<br><br> <br><br>The station is possible to stay close with Victoria School because it benefits the students there and I dont see much potential development along the hilly areas in Siglap Shopping Centre except private apartments which is less likely to have comparable usage than one near Victoria School and the Mosque.<br><br> <br><br>8 - Bayshore<br><br> <br><br>Chai Chee Sec is close (next) to Bayshore Road. In between Siglap and Bayshore I really cant see any sense to build a station as it is well served by bus without massive development. This will be one of the Yio Chu Kang ~ Khatib station<br><br> <br><br>9 - Bedok South<br><br> <br><br>About 3 bus stops away from Bayshore, here’s another station to serve Bedok South residents, Temasek Pri + Sec students. It is potential interchange station to interchange a DTL branch line from Bedok Town Park, if the plan of having it a 3 track station still exists.<br><br> <br><br>10 (9a) - Upper East Coast<br><br> <br><br>By 2020, it is hard to predict but expects that Upper East Coast bus terminal will be integrated with a MRT station based on the design on that terminal. (I think that is only one terminal with such big "bus" logo). The distance is a bit too short with Bedok South (1 bus stop) and hence it is likely to be shifted somehow to Bedok Junction / Eastwood  and Bedok Camp has to be moved. Hopefully by then, the terminal is upgraded to a full-fledge bus interchange.<br><br> <br><br>11 – Tanah Merah Pier<br><br> <br><br>Instead of going straight towards Xinlin / Changi South, the map shown on the press seemed to hint that it moves southwards after some distance away from Bedok South. I expect the distance between the 2 (Between Upper East Coast to this station) stations to be about 3.2km and largely run below the existing golf course which is impossible to add stations there and even if they move out, the development of the area still won’t justify even a LRT system. Perhaps this is another Yio Chu Kang ~ Khatib case? The reason for not using Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal (TMFT) as the name is because of the word “Terminal” that may makes passengers confused, especially foreigners (TMFT’s ferry goes to Indonesia and Malaysia) that this is the end of the line. “Tanah Merah Ferry” or “Tanah Merah Coast” (Derived from the nearby road name) does not sound nice to me either.  Inspired from Marina Pier, hence the name comes into it.<br><br> <br><br>11a – Changi Airport Terminal 4<br><br> <br><br>I am certain that between Tanah Merah Pier and Aviation Pier is a big gap that another shell station has to be filled in. This will be the station that interchanges with Changi Airport Extension if present Changi Airport station gets to be extended. But I hope that this station can be named as Changi East station.<br><br> <br><br>12 – Aviation Park<br><br> <br><br>Inspired by Outram Park, the next station away from Tanah Merah Pier should be near to Aviation Park Road. If we can have Farrer Road station, so this name is certainly possible. This position fits the press’s image of the arrowhead position with the future possibility to extend it towards Changi Village, and intersect future North Shore Line in Loyang if North Shore Line interchanges at Changi Airport. If ERL goes to Changi Airport Cargo, it would have to interchange with Changi Airport station, which is unlikely. By the way, when viewing north-eastwards towards Pulau Ubin, the left of it is Loyang and not Changi Village, which is right above Changi Airport. This means even North Shore Line, to connect Changi Airport to Changi Village then Loyang and Pasir Ris towards Punggol and Sembawang will involve a big left U turn in Changi – Pasir Ris sector. Personally, I think it would be better off using it as ERL extension to North Shore Line. An alternative name to it is Nicoll Drive station (Or “Nicoll station”) which I avoided it to prevent potential confusion between this and Nicoll Highway station.<br><br> <br><br>13 – Changi Village<br><br> <br><br>This is a speculated future station extension. It will integrate with Changi Village Bus Terminal and will only be built after North Shore Line is completed (Or along with North Shore Line).<br><br> <br><br>14 – Loyang<br><br> <br><br>This is a speculated future station extension that interchanges with North Shore Line. It will be near the junction on Pasir Ris Drive 3. I doubt in between station 13 and 14 is ever justified to have a station. It will only be built after North Shore Line is completed (Or along with North Shore Line).<br><br> <br><br> <br><br>Depot: (It can be a combination of multiple depots, but smaller in size)<br><br>1)      Changi East Depot<br><br>Right after “Tanah Merah Pier” station the line has to turn and run parallel with Changi East Drive in order to approach Aviation Park. This area is relatively undeveloped and has the potential and space to build a depot. The only downside is it is too close to Changi Naval Base and Changi Airport that poses a security risk of putting all eggs into a basket.<br><br>2)      Bedok South Depot<br><br>Further south from Bedok South that runs parallel along with Upper East Coast Road has a big grass patch. It might be cleared for a depot purpose. The only downside is the available space might not be sufficient to hold all ERL trains and additional depot might be required.<br><br>3)      Tanjong Rhu Depot<br><br>Most likely won’t be too near to Marina East. It will be located right after Fort Road. Similar to Changi East Depot option, but the only downside is this area might be a prime location and it would be a waste of land.<br><br><br> <br><br>Any other ideas?<br><br>[Update]: Theres also some saying LTA dont want to face signal interference, rojak between lines, so no use of the other side. It is possible that this theory holds true, but that wont warrant a death to PMN because they simply can go B6 / B7 as Marina East is really like no demand to even justify LRT line even if a station on Rhu cross sounds "stupid".</p></div>
