              do you find that sometimes the mrt train ride, the driver stop suddenly, then restart again after 1-3 seconds.
              
              I encounter this mrt driver, stop, start, then stop and start again. quite irritating sia.
              
              I would appreciate if the driver stop suddenly and park there for 1 min or so, pls announce it to the passengers on what is going on. some people might be in a hurry for work, appointments.

              can complain to MRT, tell their drivers dun brake suddenly, like suddenly there is a rabbit in jumping up in front of the track.
              
              the drivers like dunno how to drive a train.so bad driving skills.if u want to stop, stop gradually la. u know when u stop suddenly, alot of standing passengers are going to fall down.

              <p>feel sorry abt ur bad experience on the train man. well, i suppose ur not so familiar with how the system works i believe. Unlike buses where drivers can gradually stop the veheicle when seeing another veheicle infront, a train is normally running on Auto mode in layman terms auto pilot during dry weather or normal condition. in other words, the job of the driver is only to open n close the doors and press a button for the computer to take over and start moving the train out of the station. Braking and acceleration are all carried out by the on board computer of the train.</p>
              <p>the sudden braking u experinced is mainly due to the ATP (Automatic Train Protection) system that kicks in when the train ur in is too close to the train infront which is around 1.5 - 2 min interval time. When the ATP system kicks in, force of braking might be rather high is order to stop the train asap to prevent any collision from happening. i hope im correct, the lao jiaos here correct me if im wrong.</p>
              <p>so dun blame the driver la, blame the system haha. maybe we might need to change the system for a smoother braking maybe coupled with a increase in fare for overhauling the system?ã€€haha Im sure u wont want so just suck thumb n endure loh.</p>

              I think it's more of he did research on it before or something.
              
              zhlow: IMHO, I don't think SMRT will upgrade the system to driverless as there's external constraint as well, such as raining. During raining, the braking distance of the train is greatly increased and because of this, there's a high chance that the train will overrun or underrun the station, which causes the system to jam up or whatsoever. Also, I personally feel that it's better to keep it semi-auto as it sort of provide a source for incomes for the driver. Look at japan, though they are running on full manual on most of it's line, they are able to achieve 30 to 60 seconds frequency. So in conclusion;
              -Upgrade system to handle tighter frequency: Yes
              -Convert to full driverless system: No

            <div class='col-md body'><p>yea do agree with  E5's view. i over-looked the point on raining conditions that may cause over/under-run. But i think it still can be done. just look at  both of our LRT systems which operates above ground . Mayb the sensors n systems may differ for MRT n LRT but im sure smth lyk tht could be work out in the near future. Nevertheless, i still feel more secure to travel on a train with a driver on board..still remember years back when a car went onto the tracks over at lentor ave when a train was approaching? wonder wad would happen if it was a driverless train. *shivers*</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LRT is different because there's wheels to drain out the layer of water between the wheel and track. But MRT does not have this property which in turns, create a layer of water between the track and train wheel and this causes the wheel to spin freely as it lost contact with the track, which is the cause of why sometimes you will encounter 'jerks' whenever the train accelerate and decelerate during a rain.</div>

              IMHO, EWL and NSL train only come to a sudden halt for 3 reasons;
              -ATP is in effect, another train is in front.
              -TO exceed the current speed limit allowed on a specific section of the track, causing ATS(Automatic Train Stop) to come into effect, meaning E-brake kicks in and put train into complete halt. It always happened when train is in CM if the TO is not cautious/newbie.
              -TO apply E-brake in CM to avoid overrun
                          
              There's a few place in NSL and EWL which has tendancy for ATS to activate (I rarely took EWL so won't be able to provide you the location for it), they are namely;
              -Between Yio Chu Kang and Khatib NB, downslope from above ground to ground level.
              -Between Sembawang and Yishun SB downslope
              -Between Ang Mo Kio and Bishan SB downslope and Bishan crossover NB.
              -Downslope immediately exiting Marsiling Station NB
              -Slope between Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Gombak NB and SB.
                          
              The pneumatic sound you heard is most likely the sound of compressed air gushing out when E-brake is engaged.

              <p>feel sorry abt ur bad experience on the train man. well, i
              suppose ur not so familiar with how the system works i believe.
              Unlike buses where drivers can gradually stop the veheicle
              when seeing another veheicle infront, a train is normally running
              on Auto mode in layman terms auto pilot during dry weather or
              normal condition. in other words, the job of the driver is only to
              open n close the doors and press a button for the computer to take
              over and start moving the train out of the station. Braking and
              acceleration are all carried out by the on board computer of the
              train.</p>
              <p>the sudden braking u experinced is mainly due to the ATP
              (Automatic Train Protection) system that kicks in when the train ur
              in is too close to the train infront which is around 1.5 - 2 min
              interval time. When the ATP system kicks in, force of braking might
              be rather high is order to stop the train asap to prevent any
              collision from happening. i hope im correct, the lao jiaos here
              correct me if im wrong.</p>
              <p>so dun blame the driver la, blame the system haha. maybe we
              might need to change the system for a smoother braking maybe
              coupled with a increase in fare for overhauling the system?ã€€haha Im
              sure u wont want so just suck thumb n endure loh.</p>

              <p>zhlow, so TO's job is just maintain the train when it come to ATP mode? Control of the doors too? Is it difficult to control the train? Is like, when you pull down the brake, will the train slow down like those normal vehicle or it takes time to slow down? I play before those train stimulator game, when i want to slow down or stop the train, it take quite sometime to fully stop, is it same as those normal MRT?</p>

              It largely depend on what train you drive as all of them has different characteristic when accelerating and braking. The following is the difficulty of driving C751B, C651 and C151 from easy to hard;
                  
              C751B -&gt; C651 -&gt; C151
              
              TO don't drive ATP; ATP is a system, TO only drive in CM(Coded Manual)
                  
              What train simulation game do you play anyway?

              <p>sure it work as the same as the car? when it depress the brake, the train will also start to slowly slow down like the car too? Not like the train simulation game? Did you try playing?</p>
