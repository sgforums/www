              <p>Enjoyed myself today, just a detailed story of my trip.</p>
              <p>Coz I was at Eunos at around 1.30pm, so I took 93 to harbourfront and changed to MRT, to Serangoon. Then I was thinking if I can take the free train to save money on the 158, as I booked Bartley, then they say 4:30 then can go in, CRAP right?</p>
              <p>So I walked to Serangoon Int to take 158, and caught 2637, and alight at the wrong stop, was the exit of the station. It was like.....LOL when i asked the staff. So I walked up and crossed the overhead bridge and gave my confirmation form to the staff. I wored my wristband and walked into the station.</p>
              <p>When I walked into the station, saw the thingy blocked the entrance. So the staff opened, and I walked down to the platform. Seeing ppl solving the MLRT Syatem map, I asked the staff then I went up and play. After playing, I recieved a badge written "A HAPPY JOURNEY STARTS LIKE THAT"  The staff say " Wah sei, break record seh...."<br><br>I went to the platform and boarded the trainset through the last door, should be trainset 25 or 52 if I am not wrong. I took the whole ride(with looping) and recorded them down. If you see me holding a Olympus black cam, that's me, also saying out the announcements at the same time.<br><br>At Marymount from Bartley, I played some games, should be the matching game, I focused on the puzzle, and finally my turn to go up, I so "kia-su" that I opened two at a time -_-" Then I recieved a big bunch of sovenirs.<br><br>Then I went to Serangoon and din do much, forgotten what I did<br><br>I went to Lor Chuan and played the so called "Tic Tac Toe", must answer question then can do a move one, I won a cute little kid LOL</p>

                              <p>When to CCL Discovery at Serangoon 1330 hours.There are three
              problems that the trains has encounter.First when the train at
              Marymount was crossing over to Bartley-bound , the train suddenly
              stop with Emergency brake.I was at the front and taking a video at
              that time and the staff drive manually to CC15 Bishan and the train
              was back to normal.</p>
              <p>Second,when the train had approached Bishan station,the Platform
              screen doors could not open but the train doors could open.Took a
              picture of it.</p>
              <p>Last,at Bishan station again,the train underrun by
              about half of a carriage.I did not take pictures or videos and I
              was at the last carriage so I noticed it.</p>
