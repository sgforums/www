            <div class='col-md body'>Due to heavy rain late December, the soil and roadbed at the tunnel entrance/exit have became loose, and some SMRT engineers were seen doing works at the tunnel portal on Bukit Batok side.<br>I started seeing them last week, and yesterday (13th) many engineers came down and trains have to be slowed down at the area. Notice as follow was placed in the rack at the platform for TOA reference.<br><br>(marker written)Inform TSC when<br>soil movement detected<br><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">SPEED<br>RESTRICTION<br>AHEAD</span></span><br>(marker written)40/39<br>at NW498<br><br>Such was the notice.<br>And so was the soil movement so great that you can feel on the train? Well, I tested out and took 053 train 222 to BGB, and other than slow entry, nothing else was out of ordinary, neither did anything happen when I took 074 train 205 back, other than stopping to 0 speed in the tunnel twice and seeing the engineers waving the train past. However, the signal 40/0, signaled by a loud beep sound (I not sure, but I can guess its absolute zero speed command) was issued after 205 passed the portal and the TOA braked hard. After which it was reset with communications to 'TSC' and we continued on the journey.<br>You can too try out if you are free!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On the platform at Bukit Gombak station (did not copy down due to shortage of time; rushing for work), the notice said that if the '40/0' signal was encountered, then the train must be stopped immediately and alert the 'TSC' ppl, so I guess when the beep sounded in the cab, the driver did just that, as of which a conversation on the radio followed and an all clear was given...<br>Today, no one was at the 're-construction' area, but trains and TOAs were very vigilant on the lookout for debris/signals, and several trains passing by had to stop to absolute zero signals. Trains heading to Jurong East have more problem; the TOAs cannot see the tunnel portal sides clearly, and hence a tunnel journey of about 10 seconds might last up to half a minute and subsequently more stops might occur after the train leave the tunnel itself due to some other signals...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With more rain yesterday (Sunday), I am not too sure if there would be any commuter delays and complains today, as I heard several last week naming 'train delays', 'long waits' and 'long travel time' in newspapers and radios...<br>Do hope there would not be anyone late for school/work this week (seemingly some had such experience) as trains would still likely be under Coded Manual mode with regular doses of 40/0 signals.</div>
