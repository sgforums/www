              <p>Locally, being a TO is generally pretty easy during Auto mode, just that you need to be alert during your duty. Driving in manual mode is a bit more difficult (Well most of the train are not easy to operate to begin with) but nevertheless, with sufficient and the correct training, one can say human can surpass computer when it comes to train operations, which when placed in local context, is a bit "lacking".</p>

              <p>Once, I took the eastbound train and the train was exiting the tunnel before Kembangan when the emergency brakes came on and everyone was pushed around. It came to a stop and then the announcement came on "We apologize for the sudden stop due to a train's technical problem. The train services will resume soon". The train started moving and when it was about to enter the station, it stopped again.</p>
              <p>Also another time, I was taking the southbound train on the North South Line to school in the morning. I always take advantage of the Yishun turnaround and take the empty train. When the train was pulling into Yio Chu Kang Station, I think the driver braked a little too late and he overshot the platform. In the end, he had to reverse a few metres and then stop to open the doors. It was so hilarious! LOL :P</p>
