Reason is that at that point of time when they were still in the planning stage, Marina Bay wasnt inside the plan in the 1st place.. The problems lies at Raffles Place Stn. Due to the fact that it would be an interchange station, there would be problems of changing tracks so as to move back to Yishun in the opposite direction.
