            <div class='col-md body'>Potong Pasir should not be closed. firstly, if that happens, then u have 2 consecutive stations closed, will much more inconvenient.<br><br>potong pasir station is also near the PIE, pple could use that station as a point to transfer to many buses there(some may need more walking), e.g. 966, 985, 23 etc which go the express route, and vice versa. also it is near the macpherson rd/bendemeer road/serangoon rd/upp serangn rd junction, and for such a busy junction, many buses from diff directions will meet close together,so that people could make use of potong pasir station after transferring from buses or vice versa.<br><br>and from what i know there are pple who live near B04 sgoon ave 2 do take 133 to potong pasir station to take mrt because there is still no direct to serangoon station, if potong pasir is closed then they have to be force to walk to MRT or take bus along boundary road like 22,53,853 but it will more walking than 133.<br><br>and since woodleigh station is already closed if u close potong pasir those residents there i cant imagine what their reaction, plus those living near woodleigh will get more frustrate.<br><br>however, it does seem that potong pasir station is not as busy as some others like serangoon. perhaps i is there at the time when theres not much pple.<br><br>clarke quay personally i do not think it should be closed. pple from funan centre/treasury who live along NEL could use that station to take a direct train instead of going to city hall and take one stop then transfer, it can be quite inconvenient compared to a direct train. the distance from funan to clarke quay is still walkable, but funan to chinatown would be a little too far.<br><br>anyways it is just a 'if' topic, i dont think they will closed anymore after closing buangkok and woodleigh.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe Dover only open during the school term while the other times, the station can close to cut operating costs. (Like what i have suggested for Marina Bay.)<br><br>However, the suggestion for Marina Bay is easier to carry out as the SMRT personell can ask all passengers to clear at Raffles Place while the train driver continues on to Marina Bay or change at Raffles Place.<br><br>The Dover one may be harder to carry out as the public needed more education on when the station closes as there are much more passengers going to/from Dover than Marina Bay.</div>
