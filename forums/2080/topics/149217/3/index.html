            <div class='col-md body'>Since the infrastructure is already there, I'd not consider closing any stations. Instead, to work with other authorities to increase usage of these stations; eg developing or improving developments around these stations.<br><br>But I'm wondering if SMRT try using 3-car train sets for the Changi Airport line, when demand is lower, to save on electricity and costs. (Of course use back the six-car trains when there's exhibition at Expo). The shorter train can stop in the middle of the station's platform. That's what Melbourne's suburban railway is doing. And these Melbourne trains consists of typical 3-car sets, and can be easily attached to another 3-car sets to form a 6-car train during peak hours, and easily detached for off-peak service.<br><br></div>
