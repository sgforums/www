              <p>When all 3 operators were separate entity, SMRT Corp has the freedom to utilise any bus company, be it SBS or TIBS, during disruption. During major disruptions like the 1999 derailing at Bishan, both companies were activated. However, then they became multimodal, they are responsible for their own bridging services, which SMRT shows serious lapse due to lack of buses and drivers.</p>
              <p>At the very least, we should give credit to SMRT for asking SBS Transit to help during the 21 Jan disruption. If not I think the situation would have been worst with the fleet size of bridging services halved.</p>

              <p>I do believe that the topic on "which is better" comes from personal opinions. There is no absolute hard concrete evidence to show that SMRT sucks and SBST rocks. Even for the January incident, how far can one show that SMRT sucks?</p>
              <p>I believe, the only way to show how good a company is is to conduct public surveys on the general public. I'm not sure how the public have perceptions of both transport companies, but their feedback is like gold for any company that wishes to improve their service.</p>
              <p>True enough, people request for more trips during peak hour and lunchtime, SMRT gave it to them.</p>
              <p>In the past there were people complaining about SBST's frequency too. SBST implemented them too.</p>
              <p>However, do note that SBST's 7 minute block frequency can be so accurate due to their computerised systems. SMRT drivers base on a system that only shows them the timing they should arrive at the next station that is in the driver's cab. If the TO stops too long at a station due to a vast amount of passengers boarding, he'll be late the rest of the journey.</p>
              <p>I'd like to open a question here, to anyone, if they have seen how SBST trains operate, and how they are able to achieve this 7 minute block-frequency so accurately (of course, not mentioning their dual-communication system between train and OCC).</p>
              <p>I'm not trying to glorify SMRT's name here, neither am I condemning SBST. They do have their own flaws and good sides, but it is just that how the public perceives them. I've said it before, many many times, that there are a fixed number of trains running on service on the NSL or the EWL. So if Train A and B have a long waiting time apart, Train B and C will have a shorter time. Someone asked a stupid question before, to me, and asked if trains do disappear halfway through their journey, during off-peak, that is. Answer is NO. A big NO NO. The number of trains on the NSL during off-peak <strong>that runs full round trips</strong> remain at 19 since last year, I'm not sure if it has been increased. So it does not make any sense if anyone were to be so biased enough and say that SMRT operates trains at 10-minute frequency throughout. The whole length of the NSL (in terms of minutes) is 61x2 + 2x2 (stopover time at terminus stations) which is 126 minutes. Divide that by 19 trains running throughout and you get an average of 6.63 minutes. Hence if a train differs from the next by 10 minutes, the next will differ from the next next by 7- (10-7). It works both ways.</p>
              <p>Someone pointed out before that yes, SMRT trains fetch a larger percentage of the population to work than SBST trains, and I have to admit that SMRT has not been able to see that their 7 minute block frequency is outdated. It's high time they reduce it to 3.5 to 4.5 minute differences. </p>
              <p>To many, it seems that everytime they ask for more trips, it doesn't come immediately. I can understand their frustrations, but a point I wish to highlight is that SMRT only has 106 trains running throughout 3 lines (NSL, EWL and CGL) and at any time of the day, like buses, there will be at least 2 in each of the 3 depots that are doing servicing, and following the refurbishment plan 4 will be in Bishan Depot at any time. It means 10 trains will be off the list, which gives 96. Minus that by 2-3 trains on the CGL and you get 93. 93 to be shared by 2 lines gives 46.5. <strong>Note that this is the maximum number you get assuming no train otherwise suffers breakdowns</strong>.</p>
              <p>46 trains per line can operate, but the cost will be very high. I believe the ideal number during off peak should be set at 25-29, with peak hours an addition of 10. 29 trains for off peak means that trains operate at 4.3 minute frequencies which is already very good.</p>
              <p>So my point here is, it will take some time for SMRT to evaluate the situation and give the best and most beneficial and effective change to the train system to try to help resolve the crowding problems. Of course people argue that "why not just put trains running throughout the whole-day", but my question is, "are you willing to absorb the rise in cost"? SMRT has to think of dual effects on their decisions; 1) the passengers and 2) their shareholders. By absorbing $5 million from the addition of 360 train trips during lunchtime it is already a disadvantage on them. If they were to run full day train trips on 3 minute frequencies it would totally kill them. Yes, they earn massive amounts of profits every year, but they go to 1) maintanence of trains and tracks, 2) salaries for their employees and 3) payout to shareholders. There can be more, I assure you.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Note that I use NSL as an example because it is deem more populated than the EWL because it gives direct links to the city.</em></span></p>
              <p>To ZP (sBs_boy): Your 90-second frequency claim has to be either when SMRT just started and only had very few stations to operate or you were talking about peak hour. Peak hour possible to have 90-second frequency for a stretch of stations, but off-peak it isn't possible for full round trips. Your response to SBS2695H seems to imply that in the past, SMRT operated trains whole-day at 90-second frequencies. Which is not possible <strong>unless you were talking about in the 1980s or early 1990s </strong>when train service just begun and there was lesser number of stations throughout. Even so, they only had 66 C151 trains and their C651 trains only came in during the period of 1994-1995. Not possible otherwise simply because if you were to add the total travelling time on both lines (126 + 128 on the EWL in minutes) and divide that by 1.5 minutes you get 169 trains, which exceeds the 106 train-fleet SMRT has.</p>

              <p>SMRT may have bumped up the number of train trips during the lunchtime hours from noon to 2.30pm.</p>
              <p>However, most commuters exiting at Toa Payoh say they don't feel a difference in waiting time.</p>
              <p>Of the ten MRT passengers travelling on the North-South line between
              Ang Mo Kio and Marina Bay stations, only two said they felt that the
              waiting time was cut short.</p>
              <p><strong>
              </strong></p><p><strong>About four minutes. It is a bit spacious and more frequent from Novena to here.</strong></p><strong>
              </strong><p></p>
              <p>The other eight said the additional train trips made little or no difference.</p>
              <p><strong>
              </strong></p><p><strong>There wasn't any difference because I basically waited about three
              minutes, which was the normal waiting time anyway. But there was a
              difference in the sense that the trains were not as packed as
              previously and that could have resulted from the fact that they've
              increased their frequency la. If like what they've said, that they've
              increased their frequency by don't know how many trips? Then there
              should be a great difference. It should be a minute or two or something
              like that. That should be the maximum we should wait.</strong></p><strong>
              </strong><p></p>
              <p>SMRT is running 700 more train trips than usual from today so as to ease crowded train cabins and to cut short waiting times.</p>
              <p>They've dedicated the bulk of the additional rides, that's about 350
              extra trips, to the lunchtime slot on the North-South line and on the
              East-West line between Aljunied and Outram Park.</p>
              <p>They're also adding more trips to the morning and evening peak hours.</p>
              <p>Such extra trips will cost them about $5 million a year, but SMRT says the cost will not be passed on to commuters. - 938 Live</p>

              <h1 class="clr">SMRT adds 700 extra train trips a week, costing it S$5m annually</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: SMRT is increasing the number of train trips by at least 700
              a week to cut commuters’ waiting time and provide them with a more
              comfortable ride.</p>
              <p>A common complaint by MRT passengers is that it gets very crowded at
              peak periods and on many occasions, commuters are not able to get on
              the train.</p>
              <p>In February, 83 more train trips per week had been added. Now, SMRT is introducing even more trips.</p>
              <p>More
              than 50 per cent of these will be during weekday lunch times
              (noon—2pm), when waiting time will be halved to just three—and—a—half
              minutes, SMRT said.</p>
              <p>Improvements are also expected for those who go home later after work and those who go out on Friday evenings.</p>
              <p>Vincent
              Tan, Vice President, Rail Operations, SMRT Trains, said: "We have added
              train trips where possible so that the average trainload is not more
              than 1,200 passengers.</p>
              <p>"The added services will also mean that
              the trains will arrive within five minutes or less if the passenger
              loads are within 1,000 and 1,200 passengers."</p>
              <p>SMRT said they are
              already operating at the best intervals of two minutes at the peak
              within peak and cannot improve this any further, for now.</p>
              <p>However, a few commuters were concerned that fares would go up with the increased trips.</p>
              <p>In a month’s time, SMRT plans to increase frequency on weekends, for those travelling to and from town and the suburban areas.</p>
              <p>SMRT promises that there will be a train arriving every five minutes when trains are packed.</p>
              <p>The
              additional train trips have been rolled out at the most congested
              stations during lunchtime — between the Ang Mo Kio and Marina Bay
              stations on the North—South line, and the Outram Park and Aljunied
              stations on the East—West line.</p>
              <p>The additional train trips are expected to cost SMRT an additional S$5 million yearly. — CNA/vm</p>

              <p>This is actually another point that can explain the efficiency on SBST and SMRT.</p>
              <p>SBST does not require train operators; only station operators to look after many trains at a go. However SMRT requires TOs to manage the trains in terms of doors and announcements even though the speed, stopping distance and other technology are computerised. With the advantage SBST has, it can actually deploy more trains without fear of having manpower shortages whereas SMRT has to look into shortages of manpower. Unless SMRT can figure a way to let all their trains be fully computerised, this manpower problem will continue to haunt the respective three depots for a long time.</p>

              <p>The above discussions have so far centred on the achievable frequencies, calculated based on run times and train fleet size.  Other discussions picked on SBST's ability to maintain an optimal off-peak frequency (6 mins) and taking offence with SMRT's 7 mins. </p>
              <p>We've been focusing on the hardware required to operate the trains, but nobody has mentioned on the manpower requirements.  With the extra train trips, SMRT too is facing a shortage of train operators, just like our buses.  The 7 min frequencies could be due to them cutting away full day shifts (which requires 2 operators) and replaced them with a single split shift.  And SBST, being a driverless system, faces no such limitations and hence does not require such measures.</p>
              <p>A 90-sec peak frequency is possible going by the hardware, but not when manpower is concerned unless all of us here become train operators.</p>

              <p>I think u have forgotten that SBST do have to deploy 1 Customer Service Staff onboard each train. No matter what, if they want to increase the additional trips, they do face the problem of manpower too.</p>
