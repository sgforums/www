              <p>Agreed. At least SMRT has tried their best to improve train service by reducing waiting time and adding more train trips. Why SBST cannot do the same thing for its NEL train service? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>Charles, please tell me you're joking too. SMRT is already trying every possible way to improve on its frequency. They could have just sat down and watch people squeeze, but then, why did they introduce 700 train trips per week during lunchtime and peak hours?</p>
              <p>At least they did something. Not as if they did nothing. It's very similar to your thread on the OC500LE posters &amp; advertisements. They did something, not nothing. Even if it did not work out well enough, the fact is they DID SOMETHING.</p>

              <p><br>Sorry. Next week SMRT will start asking all TOs to leave their doors open for 5 minutes to let people board.</p>
              <p>Let's just say that, the faster the train clears the station, the more fluctuated the train system becomes. You want a train to wait at a station for 1 minute during peak hour, and jam the rest behind? After all, people want more trips, SMRT add liao, but then they need to balance off with stopover time at the stations. There is no such thing as everything you want. Even if they sound buzzer immediately, they can't close the doors if people are boarding, right?</p>

              <p><br>Sorry. Next week SMRT will start asking all TOs to leave their doors open for 5 minutes to let people board.</p>
              <p>Let's just say that, the faster the train clears the station, the more fluctuated the train system becomes. You want a train to wait at a station for 1 minute during peak hour, and jam the rest behind? After all, people want more trips, SMRT add liao, but then they need to balance off with stopover time at the stations. There is no such thing as everything you want. Even if they sound buzzer immediately, they can't close the doors if people are boarding, right?</p>

              <p>Thing is, you need to look at demand and supply, and I think SBST is better in handling this</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes some people can't board from Boon Keng and below, but at least its better than having people from AMK and below not being able to board for several trains. Try waiting for a train at Toa Payoh (the first satellite town along NSL) and Serangoon (First Satellite town along NEL) at 8:00am and you'll see the difference.</p>
              <p>And the difference gets larger for evening peak and off peak. SMRT needs to know that its system has more people patronising per station on average than NEL. This means that the 7 mins (which can jump to 10 at times) frequency it has for off peak is simply pathetic. SBST has a 6 mins (which can jump to 7) frequency even during off peak. And there is always space to move around (and even find a seat during off peak) in SBST's trains during off peak and evening peak. And SBST also have crowd controllers at busier stops advising people to go to the end cars, while SMRT don't even have a single staff at the platform doing this (Transit security does nothing like such), not to say that even the end cars are packed during evening peak, nights and Saturdays and Sundays at least between Eunos and Clementi/Jurong East, AMK and City.</p>
              <p>It used to be possible to find a lot of seats on NSL and EWL on Saturdays and Sundays, but its almost impossible unless you are on CGL or at/near the terminating stops.</p>
              <p>SMRT under SPH makes the 90 sec frequency of 2000 and before look like an antiquated idea. SMRT has a very good cost savings scheme indeed, basic dd and ss management all haywire, econs ideas all thrown away, just left business ideas.</p>
              <p>If you are really giving a more comfortable ride, provide a first class car (like what HK's ex-KCR/MTR East Rail has) and have first class seats inside. For the record its quite well used by HKers who are unwilling to squeeze with the Mainlanders (which is quite useful for Boon Lay).</p>
              <p>Do note that I am a frequent rider of both systems.</p>

              <p>In the morning, try taking the NEL then you transfer to the EWL. You can see whole lot of difference.</p>
              <p>Yes, SMRT did try to do something.. More train trips ?? i do agree theres more. BUT....</p>
              <p>Before : <br>@ BB Stn during Evening Peak <br>6mins Freq <br><br>Now : <br>@ BB Stn During Evening Peak <br>7mins - Marina Bay <br>4mins - Yew Tee <br>7mins - Marina Bay</p>
              <p>Many times, there is no way that you are able to board the 1st train bound for marina bay. Usually u have to wait for a few trains before u can board. So, by adding in more trains that are doing SWT, does it actually help a communter ? I would say no as majority of the ppl are travelling beyond YT (from BB that is). They use to have SWT that ends at AMK. Not now.. Instead of helping communters to enjoy a more "comfortable" ride, it actually makes communters suffer even more.</p>
