            <div class='col-md body'>I only tried measuring trains in Japan, where they are more used to these weird things.<br>Measuring a train, taking tons of photographs and asking the train conductor about the specifications of the train is not considered abnormal in Japan. They are more than willing to tell you.<br>Some extra sharing, just bought the book I have been 'chasing' after for some time, on the 25th April 2005 train derailing disaster at Amagasaki, Western Japan.Its really a good publication as it provides vital information about physical effects as the train enters a turn, many pictures and diagrams. All of it is in Japanese, but I would still consider it a good buy as Japan is more or less the 'train paradise' in Asia and in the world.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not very possible, as Kawasaki or any other companies would look on this as trade secrets. Information would be made known when they are supposed to be. Otherwise we would have to wait or try to search on our own. However, many info about these trains were already made public.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To my understanding, the maximum speed of the trains are set at 80km/h. This works like the speed limiter in cars and all vehicles in Singapore. The true gearbox maximum should be around 100-120km/h, but it is not necessary as acceleration is not fast. Gearbox is made by ZF.<br>The weight of the car is indicated as 30700kg per car, but we do assume that for motor cars it is more heavier. The arrangement of power is 4M2T, meaning 4 motor cars and 2 trailers, but they are merely the front and rear most cars, with controls.<br>Built around the Japanese system of ATO (Automatic Train Operation), the 'driver' does not really need to control the speed, but the train is accelerated to the maximum permissible in that zone. If there is a train in the zone ahead, the train would start to decelerate in command increments of 10km/h, until 0. Hence on normal operations, the 10 lights from 0 to 100km/h (I peeped the maximum speedometer reading) would light up.<br>These information are no means classified, but some enlightenment from my research on trains. I am more into Japanese rail system although you can tip me on other systems worldwide.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can only find the train diagram of another Kawasaki EMU,<br>C321 from TRTC(Taipei Metro, Taiwan), which is similar to our C151.<br><br>(Left click to preview &amp; Right click to download)<br><a href="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/ptr/tramcar1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/ptr/tramcar1.jpg</a><br><a href="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/ptr/tramcar2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y85/ptr/tramcar2.jpg</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for sharing. Anyway these designs by Kawasaki company are one of the best I have seen. Metro trains in Tokyo or in Japan have the same problem; they are too lightweight, making them prone to derailment. Weight is sacrificed for acceleration, whereas speed is not the real demand in this case.<br>Bullet trains have the same weight as our MRT train, about 30-35 tons. This characteristics, plus the standard gauge of 1435mm makes them safe.<br>Many trains in Japan weighs like 24 to 26 tons, which is considered light. At high speeds like 120-130km/h it becomes very dangerous. Examples are the Series 207, 120km/h (which image was tarnished by the 25th April accident last year at Amagasaki) and Series 223, which maximum speed was 130km/h, the highest in all the 'local' trains in Japan. Series 223 runs on Special Rapid services, which I have tried when I was in west Japan. I too took the Series 207 (even the immediate sistership to 207-17, 207-16, which was the first car in the Amagasaki accident) and found that 207 have the most lateral movement, like shaking from side to side, enough to throw a person off balance!<br>The first time I took Series 207 was in 2004, then in December 2005 when I visited Japan again, I took the Series 207 puposely to check on the conditions of the trains after the accident. Drivers of the 207 trains (I presume) were briefed not to exceed 115km/h, so I never saw the real capability of the train. But Series 223 was different, as there had been snow in the area and delays were frequent, drivers drove right up to 130km/h, sometimes exceeding it! However, I am lucky to have survived overspeeding trains, taxis and buses, but accidents would not happen when such things do not at the first place!</div>
