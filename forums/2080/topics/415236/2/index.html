              <p>I'm not sure if this has ever been discussed before, but here
              goes...</p>
              <p>Sometime ago I kept having persistent dreams of strange, unknown
              MRT tunnels running around in Singapore. A few days ago, while
              thinking about it, I realised that there indeed are what I could
              call "phantom" MRT stations around Singapore - and I don't mean
              Woodleigh either.</p>
              <p>Most of you already know about the empty boxes lying at Punggol
              and Changi Airport MRT stations, intended for the future North
              Shore (or North Coast) Line. I have also started to hear rumours
              about already-existing provisions for the Thomson Line to hook up
              with Orchard, with ION floor plans revealing hints of a MRT station
              (that is <strong>not</strong> Orchard Station) nearby. I have seen
              it myself and I was quite surprised to see what clearly appears to
              be a floor plan of an MRT station in the basements of ION Orchard,
              hidden away from the main shopping area - complete with what
              appears to be an island platform. I sometimes wonder about it when
              I'm at ION Orchard, just thinking about what's hidden behind all
              those walls.</p>
              <p>After seeing this and thinking about it, I suddenly realised -
              our government, being the far-ahead thinkers they are, could had
              built such phantom stations and even tunnels elsewhere, to sit
              empty and dark for years or even decades until the lines that use
              them are announced and built.</p>
              <p>Apart from the known boxes at Punggol and Changi Airport, and
              the suspected one at ION Orchard, I wonder if there are other such
              "phantom" MRT stations or even whole tunnel segments already built
              somewhere around the island, sitting unused and unknown to most of
              the public right now, waiting one day in the future to become
              eventually used...</p>
              <p>With earlier URA concept plans showing a huge mass of MRT lines
              all over the island, I won't be surprised if the authorities,
              following the concept plans, built provisions for some of them a
              long while ago. I could, for example, easily imagine a phantom
              station sitting right below the North-South MRT Line between Yew
              Tee and Kranji, where the future Sugnei Kadut station will
              supposedly go - remember, what we now know as the Downtown Line
              stage 2 is shown in earlier URA concept plans to have it's
              north-western terminus exactly at where this unbuilt station could
              go.</p>
              <p>Other places that could potentially be home to such "phantom"
              stations and tunnels include the missing NE2 station - they could
              have had put in a few columns and pillars there, in addition to
              strengthening the tunnel walls, when they built that stretch with
              the idea of a future station being built there later in mind - and
              possibly, around and above the Esplanade MRT station, as well as
              the large four-way underpass near Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay
              that links to it as well as CityLink Mall nearby. Esplanade station
              itself has an unused elevator shaft, the concourse area is
              strangely divided into two, and that four-way underpass fishily
              looks like an MRT station without the MRT to me when I first saw
              it. Also, remember the blueprints for Esplanade MRT station showing
              an "Arts Centre Line" crossing it? Who knows, LTA may had already
              built a bit of it when they built the Circle Line...</p>
              <p>I know this all sounds like I'm going crazy, but the evidence
              for the existence of some of these "phantom" stations and tunnels
              are already there. Any thoughts?</p>

              <p>For provisions in future lines. To make space out of it. Well, you may think that new lines are entirely new, not going to touch each other, unlike HK MTR, in the instance of NEL does not go to EWL sense (There is unconfirmed rumour of NEL before Harbourfront from OTP has a crossover from the left which is coming from CCL, most likely it is a screwed up planning + evidence supported by a HBF - OTP disruption in 2005 where there was a shuttle train on the other side (PGL bound) every 13 mins.), but if they never do such tunnels first, 10 years later they go build office building / shopping centre and 5 ~ 15 years later after that and feels a need to build the line interchange it again and then can say "Shit, this place is right on the building's structure".

              <p>With regards to that crossover, that crossover is going over to the other track that is going towards Punggol (or maybe a middle track?), but not to the left of the track. You can confirm it when the tunnel lights are on, then you can see that while there is a crossover, it's going to the right of the train, not towards the left ...</p>
              <p>That kind of crossover can easily explain why the trains can keep on running even with the disruption in 2005 ...</p>

              <p>Wrong counter-reasoning. Well, why they DONT build a tunnel / walkway linkway underground when they build this damn failed LRT? Outram Park needs a longer linkway then this BPJ, so whats so hard about it? I think if I am not wrong, neither Outram Park nor Newton has [used] the phantom tunnels and are newly created ones. Yet they can link together. Shame on BPJ LRT. Well, unless one speculated that BPJ LRT will be rebuilt when the tender expires in years time, given that they did not use scrapped Changi's skytrain and no news of refurbishment given their 11 years old train.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #800080;">2. LRT: If you go to PG road end and turn into Punggol Seventeenth Ave and go straight, turn your head left and you notice the Punggol West Loop.

              <p>What we know is that DTL Promenade lies deeper than CCL and besides the "reserved platforms" in CCL.</p>
              <p>Hence, most likely that the B3 is the tunnel linkway (Now staff area) OR B1 will be linking to each other.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>As far as my PMN project is concern, when I go there during CCL2 open house, I saw nothing like present Harbourfront, post NEL pre CCL era of DBG where there is a knockout panel just like the reserved platform / tunnel there outside the paid areas. Hence, I guess DTL is integrated with CCL for this sense [Eh, then how about MacPherson?]</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Regarding the present reserved platforms, several theories have formed:</p>
              <p>1: Dead forever and LTA will never admit it. Well, it is possible given that the left side (Present CCL platform) turns right so sharp without any crossover reserved there to provide a turn - straight junction. There is a crossover between PMN - ESP but that is further away a bit, which is similar to JUR WB -&gt; SB (Marina Bay bound) and NB (JUR bound) -&gt; EB.</p>
              <p>2: Other line reserved for future use (Future knockout panel), as indicated on one of the old DTL PMN schematic diagram. The line would highly be Holland Line or sort of. [But if a post 2020 line share with a Y2000 line, is it a bit outdated then??]</p>
              <p>3: CCL Marina Bay extension. Advantage is that one side is DBG bound, the other side goes to HBF or sort of AFTER the loop is closed. For now, it saves the hassle of train plying from Stadium to Marina Bay (Since there is NO crossover between PMN - Stadium slidings if that unused platform is not used for this) OR Dhoby Ghaut - Marina Bay via the crossover mentioned on point 1.[A bit stupid, NSL fake one ah?]</p>
              <p>3a: Some said that another platform on the left will be build for CCLe but I think it might be wrong [Imagine JEMP facing EB]. Come on, isnt this way involves a sharp turn in CCL again? [That makes PMN to have 2 present reserved CCL on the right platforms, 2 DTL platforms, 2 present CCL in used platforms, 2 additional present CCL platform on the other side and 2 new CCLe platforms to make it 10 platforms including the potential dead ones with the existing CCL one having 4 platforms, 2 on each direction!!]</p>

              <p>Source please? I never seen or hear such thing before, but Punggol is definitely extenable, unlike Harbourfront even if they go landfill Semaku or anything like that because right after HBF, the X-shaped crossover dead end, is a PG intake with staircase access on the side.</p>

              <p>Wikipedia is actually edited by the train fans. Well, I dont agree on "<span><span style="font-size: small;">Stacked Island ((U/C) Track have not been layed
              yet</span></span>)" because technically this is called a provision and not a U/C status.</p>
