              <p>I'm not sure if this has ever been discussed before, but here goes...</p>
              <p>Sometime ago I kept having persistent dreams of strange, unknown MRT tunnels running around in Singapore. A few days ago, while thinking about it, I realised that there indeed are what I could call "phantom" MRT stations around Singapore - and I don't mean Woodleigh either.</p>
              <p>Most of you already know about the empty boxes lying at Punggol and Changi Airport MRT stations, intended for the future North Shore (or North Coast) Line. I have also started to hear rumours about already-existing provisions for the Thomson Line to hook up with Orchard, with ION floor plans revealing hints of a MRT station (that is <strong>not</strong> Orchard Station) nearby. I have seen it myself and I was quite surprised to see what clearly appears to be a floor plan of an MRT station in the basements of ION Orchard, hidden away from the main shopping area - complete with what appears to be an island platform. I sometimes wonder about it when I'm at ION Orchard, just thinking about what's hidden behind all those walls.</p>
              <p>After seeing this and thinking about it, I suddenly realised - our government, being the far-ahead thinkers they are, could had built such phantom stations and even tunnels elsewhere, to sit empty and dark for years or even decades until the lines that use them are announced and built.</p>
              <p>Apart from the known boxes at Punggol and Changi Airport, and the suspected one at ION Orchard, I wonder if there are other such "phantom" MRT stations or even whole tunnel segments already built somewhere around the island, sitting unused and unknown to most of the public right now, waiting one day in the future to become eventually used...</p>
              <p>With earlier URA concept plans showing a huge mass of MRT lines all over the island, I won't be surprised if the authorities, following the concept plans, built provisions for some of them a long while ago. I could, for example, easily imagine a phantom station sitting right below the North-South MRT Line between Yew Tee and Kranji, where the future Sugnei Kadut station will supposedly go - remember, what we now know as the Downtown Line stage 2 is shown in earlier URA concept plans to have it's north-western terminus exactly at where this unbuilt station could go.</p>
              <p>Other places that could potentially be home to such "phantom" stations and tunnels include the missing NE2 station - they could have had put in a few columns and pillars there, in addition to strengthening the tunnel walls, when they built that stretch with the idea of a future station being built there later in mind - and possibly, around and above the Esplanade MRT station, as well as the large four-way underpass near Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay that links to it as well as CityLink Mall nearby. Esplanade station itself has an unused elevator shaft, the concourse area is strangely divided into two, and that four-way underpass fishily looks like an MRT station without the MRT to me when I first saw it. Also, remember the blueprints for Esplanade MRT station showing an "Arts Centre Line" crossing it? Who knows, LTA may had already built a bit of it when they built the Circle Line...</p>
              <p>I know this all sounds like I'm going crazy, but the evidence for the existence of some of these "phantom" stations and tunnels are already there. Any thoughts?</p>

              <p>Oo That's quite surprising to know - Ang Mo Kio was built way back in the late 1980's and they already have provisions for a line that isn't even announced yet.</p>
              <p>If I pass by Ang Mo Kio again I think I will try looking for the escalator you mentioned.</p>
              <p>If Ang Mo Kio already has such provisions, then such phantom tunnels and stations could be more common than we think. Anyone has the different iterations of URA's concept plans? I think it might provide clues to more of such provisions and phantom stations.</p>

              <p><br>   Look at this smug supreme IDIOT !  He honestly believes he knows better than ALL people who have seen spirits He simply decided that he knows better without actually having a clue.Though the world has had atheism pushed everywhere the fact is that there is an ever increasing number of cameras. Things are getting filmed now as security cameras also are everywhere. Try  youtube. Look up  rods,orbs,angel  etc... some are obvious fakes but many are not.</p>
              <p>    If one reads the book   Supernatural  by Graham Hancock which doesn't push any beliefs but merely document scientific evidence even an atheist might find atheism hard to believe. If one wants to find a haunted place he/she might want to explore the old abandoned army hospital ono Jordon Road Kowloon, Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>   Yes Hitidiot has decided he is smart but really he doesn't have a clue what he is argueing about. He doesn't have any of the knowledge in the book Supernatural for example. So Hitidiot,...do you always argue about topic you don't have a clue about ?</p>

              <p>Paya Lebar CCL. After the middle track there leads to a dead end with a big hollow box. Only thing is the width between middle track and "live track" (CCL Main line) to see the possibility of digging it south and downwards for any such extension (Towards Marine Parade).

              <p>if im not wrong chinatown's DTL station box was built together

              if the original tunnels between promenade &amp; stadium stations
              are still in place, after the tunnels were re-sited along with the

              <p>Those destroyed tunnels due to collapse were put in place (Known as no demolishment is made) but a wall had put there (With no visible difference) and re-bore / dig the tunnel to current CCL. I think they did not demolish the tunnel on a fear of collapse it further. WTF. I dunno why they dun wan to re-dig and keep it at the same location.</p>

              <p>It's NS<strong>11</strong> Sembawang; NS10 refers to Admiralty station.</p>
              <p>Anyway, it's unlikely that Woodlands may have box tunnels, as it already has a underground bus interchange. While it's not impossible for the NCL to have an interchange with NSL at Woodlands, transfers between the two lines would be quite a hassle: imagine going from level 2 (NSL platform) to (possibly) level B3 (of NCL platform) ...</p>
              <p>If anything, then maybe Sembawang has them. But then again the NCL will not be built so soon, so any planned things can still change ...</p>
