              <p>Entertainment: Feasible.</p>
              <p>Food: Best to have sit-down tables only, set up like a bar. Drinks will be good. Don;t bother about the regulations first. Just throw out ideas.</p>
              <p>Internet: Not uncommon. But bear in mind that those with iPhones and bought a plan already and those with plug-in modems for notebooks can access the internet without you needing to provide it.</p>
              <p>Books: Personally I wouldn't read on the train, but the idea is feasible.</p>
              <p>Payment: Depending on how many passengers you expect o use this service, I suggest placing the reader at the gangway(s) of the coach (but you need to install a door there), and on the sides of the current doors like a bus. A ticket checker will be on board to check tickets randomly. (Something like what bus conductors do to your card on the bus.)</p>

              <p>I see, so it is approximate on average of 35km since there is a branch line. Looks like it might be possible to implement a similar stuff in Singapore (Through to JB lolx!)</p>
              <p>Well, it is not longer than NSL / EWL, so it is feasible to install improvements on NSL / EWL. But the problem is people who dont pay fares (Yes, the existing ones are simple to do so, commonly termed as piggy backing. Indeed the situation is improving as NEL / CCL are much harder but not impossible but until the new fare gates are installed in all NSL / EWL station, such proposal with additional preimum train cars is not feasible since people may just pay normal fares and cheat along it -- best of all, none payment on first class train.)</p>

              <p>no food, for a healthy and pleasant journey. some eat like pigs and the food smell irritaes, left overrs attracts pests and create discomfort unhygienic travelling experiences for other commuters. furnishings other than sits take up space and not practical to what the trains serves as. internet access all add cost to the transport fares. those who wants it can subscript to ST or SH mobile internet on their own. wnat to read get your own book, wnat to borrow go library. premuim carriage can be 100% when you take trains that are meant for touring purposes.</p>
              <p>i don't want  such service. did you do a survey if this type of system work or not, how much people willing to pay for it? if its a dead end why even kickstart such a project?</p>

              <p>For example, for entertainment, we will be proposing that some
              of the carriages will be providing services like playing PS3 and
              Xbox.<br> Think of the cost.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Food wise, we were thinking of serving deserts only. There will
              be both normal and standing tables.<br> Stnading tables must have grab poles or hand rails. And non-slip
              surface. And the no eating rule.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Internet access will be provided.<br> Wi-fi is good...</p>
              <p>Commuters will also be able to read/borrow magazines/books
              provided.<br> How can you ensure they return it?</p>
              <p>Payment wise, commuters will tap on the carriage door to gain
              entry to 'Premium' carriages.<br> The carraige door is like 1.5 m wide. I tap once, then, how do you
              ensure only ONE persone enters, I can tap once, and a whole bunch
              of people enter...</p>
              <p>We are not really sure if our ideas are practical and as we have
              yet to develop it.<br> Think of the finer details first.</p>

              <p>I rather the local train operators spend this (limited) money in upgrading their system, making trains run faster, upgrading information systems on trains etc.</p>

              <p>TV Mobile closed down liao. That was a epic failure. Consider that Singapore is a multi-racial / cultural society, playing all of them is simply impossible, and playing Chinese TV / Radio might irriate the Tamil / Indian pax (And so does playing Indian musics on train might irriate the Chinese etc. Playing things in English will ended up few people watching it becoz not everybody are proficient in English.)</p>
