            <div class='col-md body'>all i can say is this:<br>many S'poreans don't know how to appreciate our transportation system. we may not be the best in the way, but i would say it is satisfactory, at the very least. but don't be too harsh with them lah, many people have not seen transportation in other countries and don't have anything to compare with.<br>for the guy who complained abt the BC being rude to him, just ignore the BC lah! not like he insulted the guy's parents or wat.<br>and many stompers love to point out small matters which they are not happy with, which are not in the least newsworthy. I'm talking abt majority, bcos a handful of submissions are decent enough at least.</div>
