              <p><strong>Hooligan Treatment by MRT Station Manager - </strong>28-06-2010, 01:03 PM</p>
              <div id="post_message_436177" class="vb_postbit">I had a terrible experience taking the MRT to work this morning and I will share it here in the forum. <br><br>For the last decade I have hardly taken any public transportation in Singapore. I was living overseas for the earlier part and when I came back I have my own transport. I decided to the MRT to work this morning because my car is at the workshop and I do not want to ride bike to work today because I have to dressed up for an appointment in the morning. So I use my son's blue color farecard and took the MRT from a station in the West to Eunos.<br><br>I arrived at about 8:50am at Eunos MRT. At the exit, I placed my farecard on the RFID reader pad at the gantry but the swing gate did not open for me. Then, I approached the Station Control for assistance. There were three SMRT staff at the station control, an Indian lady, a middle age man who is busy working on something below the desk and a Malay lady. <br><br>Over the window, I told the Indian lady that the exit door would not open for me and then I passed her my farecard for verification. Throughout my entire conversation with her, she sat about 2 metres away from the glass window, I could barely hear her and I had to bend and arch my body towards the window to communicate with her. The lady then told me that there is not enough money in my farecard and that I have top up $10 before I am allowed to exit. <br><br>I then ask politely for the reasons and she told me that I have only $2.57 in the farecard which is insufficient. Confused, I told her that it should be more than enough since the a single trip cost only $2 and that I have more than that plus whatever cash deposit there is. I also checked with her if the money could have already been deducted and it was some error that caused the door not opening. Then she told me (in manner that anyone would consider to be rude when speaking to a customer) that I should have known that $3 is minimum and then she threw both her hands in the air and said to me that everyone should know that. I am offended by that but kept my composure. I told her I really do not understand her and since I entered the station with the same farecard, boarded a train to arrive here with no issues. She then ignored me and went on to look at the computer screen. Then the middle age man who was very polite and professional told me to pay for a single-trip fare instead and instructed the Indian lady to check on the fare. <br><br>I obliged to that and ask the Indian lady how much do I need to pay and I told her that I have only some coins with me, hope that is enough, if not I will need to withdraw cash from any ATM nearby. At this moment, she looked frustrated (from her facial expression and body language) with me. Then she proceeded to attend to another customer who is queing behind me. I saw station control staff exchanging some words but I could not hear what they were talking about. I waited for about a minute or two and then proceeded to ask the again what is going on but the said lady just replied "you wait" and then turned away from me. <br><br>I waited till about 9am, feeling impatient because I am late for the appointment and frustrated by the lack of service from the people, I then tell the Indian lady that it is ridiculous to keep me waiting for not telling me reasons and they should not make me wait because of whatever is going on with their system. Not knowing when or what is going to happen next, I then told her I will go now and will come back to settle. Then I walked through the handicap exit gantry beside the station control and carry on my walking journey to the my office. <br><br>About 10 meters from the station control and opposite a crowded coffeeshop, I was stopped from behind by the Station Manager of Eunos MRT and five heavily armed policemen. I was shocked and I was surrounded by them. Station manager started shouting aggressively at me as though he has just caught a terrorist or something. Then I saw the policemen have their hands on their weapon and standing in a standby position. Oh ****, what have I done? I ask myself. <br><br>I was treated like a big time wanted criminal. After exchanging some angry words, the police officer then requested me to follow them back into the station which I agree. I was being escorted back to the station like a terrorist or some pervert that has taken upskirts pictures. Upon reaching the station office, the Station Manager left and I explained to the police what had happened. I also spoke to a number of other policemen too.<br><br>Five minutes later, the Station Manager barged into room and rudely shouted at me acusing me of cheating and says he is going to issue me summons, TWO summons, he shouted proudly in front of the policemen there. He was gesturing at me, pointing fingers, talking loudly and saliva bursting out all over. One of the senior policeman then told the Station Manager to calm down and speak properly. <br><br>Station Manager insists that I cheated on purpose and that everyone in singapore knows about the $3 rule. He told me not to pretend that I do not know anything about this rule. I am angry and argued my case and explain the fact that I hardly ever took public transport. This angered him further, ignoring my explanation, Station raised his voice at me many times, he was very rude, not listening to me, told me to "SIT DOWN and LISTEN!" and he was pointing his fingers at me and constantly shouting and acusing me for cheating. Throughout the conversation, the police officers witnessed it but did nothing. The summons were issued and I took the tickets and left. <br><br>Pardon me for the long story, I needed to be clear and precise about what had happened and I want to let you know the kind of **** I went through. This came as a shock to me and that I am still angered by the language, tone and words used on me. <br><br>Yes, maybe I should not just leave the station like that but I have already explained the situation to the station control staff, I have offered to pay but not knowing how much to pay and they just made to wait for no apparent reasons. I have sufficient funds in the farecard to pay for the trip, there is no reason to say I am cheating. Why do I want to cheat and ruin my morning for $2? The exit door would not open for me and I tried to seek assistance from the station control but nothing is done. I am not obliged to wait for no reasons given and that is why I left the station without settling the due.<br><br>I am still affected and aggrieved by the treatment. What have I done to be treated in such a manner? Could things have been simpler if the staff at the station control were more helpful and customer oriented? Is there anything wrong with the RFID reader? Or improve the screwed logic of payment ?<br><br>The reaction from SMRT staff at Eunos station was totally uncalled for. No one should be treated in such a manner. We are customers.</div>

              <p>CEPAS sucks. In other countries, your farecard value can be in the negative before you need to add more funds onto it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>As for the station manager, that's awful. I know some really friendly station managers (the one at Clementi especially), but there's definitely some nasty SMRT staff out there, and I was hoping none of them were station managers. It baffles me how they hired someone like that to take charge of an entire station. Sorry you had to experience such atrocious service (not like that's anything new here, anyway, though... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">).</p>

              <p>Heavily armed police officers? How heavily armed can police officers be? GPMG machine gun, MP5, rocket launchers?</p>
              <p>I can only imagine that they carry revolvers (normal armed police officers) Sense a bit of exaggeration.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Minimum $3 rule should be enforced when you attempt to board the train, i.e. the door won't open for you to board. For this case, TS somehow managed to board and got stuck at the destination station. Probably because of accidental double entry when passenger in front of TS was tapping the card.</p>
              <p>the mrt personnel can just ask you where you board and deduct the fare manually for this, as the card has no entry records (not the proper way.), but the case became complicated because of the $3 issue, so activate the station manager to resolve.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Agree that the station manager seems to be over reacting.</p>

              <p>cut this guy some slack, he hasn't took public transport for a decade, and he probably doesnt know the card is a CEPAS card.</p>
              <p>and because he hasn't travelled on public transport for so long, he probably knew nothing about the $3 entry rule, which was something that is implemented not too long ago.</p>
              <p>his son can be an adult, so nothing wrong with that. he didnt say its a concession card either.</p>
              <p>parts about heavily armed transit security officers are probably not true though. they mainly carry revolvers.</p>
              <p>the station manager is overreacting and failed to manage his staff well for not explaining and guiding a passenger who is making his first public transport trip in a long time.</p>

              <p><strong>Hooligan Treatment by MRT Station Manager - &lt;!-- status icon and date --&gt;&lt;!-- status icon and date --&gt;</strong>28-06-2010, 01:03 PM</p>
              <div>I had a terrible experience taking the MRT to work this morning and I will share it here in the forum.<br><br>For the last decade I have hardly taken any public transportation in Singapore. I was living overseas for the earlier part and when I came back I have my own transport. I decided to the MRT to work this morning because my car is at the workshop and I do not want to ride bike to work today because I have to dressed up for an appointment in the morning. So I use my son's blue color farecard and took the MRT from a station in the West to Eunos.<br><br>I arrived at about 8:50am at Eunos MRT. At the exit, I placed my farecard on the RFID reader pad at the gantry but the swing gate did not open for me. Then, I approached the Station Control for assistance. There were three SMRT staff at the station control, an Indian lady, a middle age man who is busy working on something below the desk and a Malay lady.<br><br>Over the window, I told the Indian lady that the exit door would not open for me and then I passed her my farecard for verification. Throughout my entire conversation with her, she sat about 2 metres away from the glass window, I could barely hear her and I had to bend and arch my body towards the window to communicate with her. The lady then told me that there is not enough money in my farecard and that I have top up $10 before I am allowed to exit.<br><br>I then ask politely for the reasons and she told me that I have only $2.57 in the farecard which is insufficient. Confused, I told her that it should be more than enough since the a single trip cost only $2 and that I have more than that plus whatever cash deposit there is. I also checked with her if the money could have already been deducted and it was some error that caused the door not opening. Then she told me (in manner that anyone would consider to be rude when speaking to a customer) that I should have known that $3 is minimum and then she threw both her hands in the air and said to me that everyone should know that. I am offended by that but kept my composure. I told her I really do not understand her and since I entered the station with the same farecard, boarded a train to arrive here with no issues. She then ignored me and went on to look at the computer screen. Then the middle age man who was very polite and professional told me to pay for a single-trip fare instead and instructed the Indian lady to check on the fare.<br><br>I obliged to that and ask the Indian lady how much do I need to pay and I told her that I have only some coins with me, hope that is enough, if not I will need to withdraw cash from any ATM nearby. At this moment, she looked frustrated (from her facial expression and body language) with me. Then she proceeded to attend to another customer who is queing behind me. I saw station control staff exchanging some words but I could not hear what they were talking about. I waited for about a minute or two and then proceeded to ask the again what is going on but the said lady just replied "you wait" and then turned away from me.<br><br>I waited till about 9am, feeling impatient because I am late for the appointment and frustrated by the lack of service from the people, I then tell the Indian lady that it is ridiculous to keep me waiting for not telling me reasons and they should not make me wait because of whatever is going on with their system. Not knowing when or what is going to happen next, I then told her I will go now and will come back to settle. Then I walked through the handicap exit gantry beside the station control and carry on my walking journey to the my office.<br><br>About 10 meters from the station control and opposite a crowded coffeeshop, I was stopped from behind by the Station Manager of Eunos MRT and five heavily armed policemen. I was shocked and I was surrounded by them. Station manager started shouting aggressively at me as though he has just caught a terrorist or something. Then I saw the policemen have their hands on their weapon and standing in a standby position. Oh ****, what have I done? I ask myself.<br><br>I was treated like a big time wanted criminal. After exchanging some angry words, the police officer then requested me to follow them back into the station which I agree. I was being escorted back to the station like a terrorist or some pervert that has taken upskirts pictures. Upon reaching the station office, the Station Manager left and I explained to the police what had happened. I also spoke to a number of other policemen too.<br><br>Five minutes later, the Station Manager barged into room and rudely shouted at me acusing me of cheating and says he is going to issue me summons, TWO summons, he shouted proudly in front of the policemen there. He was gesturing at me, pointing fingers, talking loudly and saliva bursting out all over. One of the senior policeman then told the Station Manager to calm down and speak properly.<br><br>Station Manager insists that I cheated on purpose and that everyone in singapore knows about the $3 rule. He told me not to pretend that I do not know anything about this rule. I am angry and argued my case and explain the fact that I hardly ever took public transport. This angered him further, ignoring my explanation, Station raised his voice at me many times, he was very rude, not listening to me, told me to "SIT DOWN and LISTEN!" and he was pointing his fingers at me and constantly shouting and acusing me for cheating. Throughout the conversation, the police officers witnessed it but did nothing. The summons were issued and I took the tickets and left.<br><br>Pardon me for the long story, I needed to be clear and precise about what had happened and I want to let you know the kind of **** I went through. This came as a shock to me and that I am still angered by the language, tone and words used on me.<br><br>Yes, maybe I should not just leave the station like that but I have already explained the situation to the station control staff, I have offered to pay but not knowing how much to pay and they just made to wait for no apparent reasons. I have sufficient funds in the farecard to pay for the trip, there is no reason to say I am cheating. Why do I want to cheat and ruin my morning for $2? The exit door would not open for me and I tried to seek assistance from the station control but nothing is done. I am not obliged to wait for no reasons given and that is why I left the station without settling the due.<br><br>I am still affected and aggrieved by the treatment. What have I done to be treated in such a manner? Could things have been simpler if the staff at the station control were more helpful and customer oriented? Is there anything wrong with the RFID reader? Or improve the screwed logic of payment ?<br><br>The reaction from SMRT staff at Eunos station was totally uncalled for. No one should be treated in such a manner. We are customers.</div>

              <p>CEPAS sucks. In other countries, your farecard value can be in

              assistance. There were three SMRT staff at the station control, an
              Indian lady, a middle age man who is busy working on something
              below the desk and a Malay lady.<br> <br> Over the window, I told the Indian lady that the exit door would
              not open for me and then I passed her my farecard for verification.
              Throughout my entire conversation with her, she sat about 2 metres
              away from the glass window, I could barely hear her and I had to
              bend and arch my body towards the window to communicate with her.
              The lady then told me that there is not enough money in my farecard
              and that I have top up $10 before I am allowed to exit.<br> <br> I then ask politely for the reasons and she told me that I have
              only $2.57 in the farecard which is insufficient. Confused, I told
              her that it should be more than enough since the a single trip cost
              only $2 and that I have more than that plus whatever cash deposit
              there is. I also checked with her if the money could have already
              been deducted and it was some error that caused the door not
              opening. Then she told me (in manner that anyone would consider to
              be rude when speaking to a customer) that I should have known that
              $3 is minimum and then she threw both her hands in the air and said
              to me that everyone should know that. I am offended by that but
              kept my composure. I told her I really do not understand her and
              since I entered the station with the same farecard, boarded a train
              to arrive here with no issues. She then ignored me and went on to
              look at the computer screen. Then the middle age man who was very
              polite and professional told me to pay for a single-trip fare
              instead and instructed the Indian lady to check on the fare.<br> <br> I obliged to that and ask the Indian lady how much do I need to pay
              and I told her that I have only some coins with me, hope that is
              enough, if not I will need to withdraw cash from any ATM nearby. At
              this moment, she looked frustrated (from her facial expression and
              body language) with me. Then she proceeded to attend to another
              customer who is queing behind me. I saw station control staff
              exchanging some words but I could not hear what they were talking
              about. I waited for about a minute or two and then proceeded to ask
              the again what is going on but the said lady just replied "you
              wait" and then turned away from me.<br> <br> I waited till about 9am, feeling impatient because I am late for
              the appointment and frustrated by the lack of service from the
              people, I then tell the Indian lady that it is ridiculous to keep
              me waiting for not telling me reasons and they should not make me
              wait because of whatever is going on with their system. Not knowing
              when or what is going to happen next, I then told her I will go now
              and will come back to settle. Then I walked through the handicap
              exit gantry beside the station control and carry on my walking
              journey to the my office.<br> <br> About 10 meters from the station control and opposite a crowded
              coffeeshop, I was stopped from behind by the Station Manager of
              Eunos MRT and five heavily armed policemen. I was shocked and I was
              surrounded by them. Station manager started shouting aggressively
              at me as though he has just caught a terrorist or something. Then I
              saw the policemen have their hands on their weapon and standing in
              a standby position. Oh ****, what have I done? I ask myself.<br> <br> I was treated like a big time wanted criminal. After exchanging
              some angry words, the police officer then requested me to follow
              them back into the station which I agree. I was being escorted back
              to the station like a terrorist or some pervert that has taken
              upskirts pictures. Upon reaching the station office, the Station
              Manager left and I explained to the police what had happened. I
              also spoke to a number of other policemen too.<br> <br> Five minutes later, the Station Manager barged into room and rudely
              shouted at me acusing me of cheating and says he is going to issue
              me summons, TWO summons, he shouted proudly in front of the
              policemen there. He was gesturing at me, pointing fingers, talking
              loudly and saliva bursting out all over. One of the senior
              policeman then told the Station Manager to calm down and speak
              properly.<br> <br> Station Manager insists that I cheated on purpose and that everyone
              in singapore knows about the $3 rule. He told me not to pretend
              that I do not know anything about this rule. I am angry and argued
              my case and explain the fact that I hardly ever took public
              transport. This angered him further, ignoring my explanation,
              Station raised his voice at me many times, he was very rude, not
              listening to me, told me to "SIT DOWN and LISTEN!" and he was
              pointing his fingers at me and constantly shouting and acusing me
              for cheating. Throughout the conversation, the police officers
              witnessed it but did nothing. The summons were issued and I took
              the tickets and left.<br> <br> Pardon me for the long story, I needed to be clear and precise
              about what had happened and I want to let you know the kind of ****
              I went through. This came as a shock to me and that I am still
              angered by the language, tone and words used on me.<br> <br> Yes, maybe I should not just leave the station like that but I have
              already explained the situation to the station control staff, I
              have offered to pay but not knowing how much to pay and they just
              made to wait for no apparent reasons. I have sufficient funds in
              the farecard to pay for the trip, there is no reason to say I am
              cheating. Why do I want to cheat and ruin my morning for $2? The
              exit door would not open for me and I tried to seek assistance from
              the station control but nothing is done. I am not obliged to wait
              for no reasons given and that is why I left the station without
              settling the due.<br> <br> I am still affected and aggrieved by the treatment. What have I
              done to be treated in such a manner? Could things have been simpler
              if the staff at the station control were more helpful and customer
              oriented? Is there anything wrong with the RFID reader? Or improve
              the screwed logic of payment ?<br> <br> The reaction from SMRT staff at Eunos station was totally uncalled
              for. No one should be treated in such a manner. We are
              customers.</div>

              <p>    Well actually TS was co-operative despite him using his son's " fare card " to board the train , ok so since he has not used the public transport for many years so we can forgive him for not knowing abt the $3 rule . But the moment he uses the side gate next to the gate machines . He is in big wrong already . Because that gate is only for staff to use and to facilitate handicapped pple or those needy persons as and when the station staff deem fit . Not for TS to use as " normal " adult  just for the excuse of rushing . </p>
              <p>  No matter which station you go , as long as the moment you use that gate to get through , i can assure you that you will stand 50% chance of being questioned  or even scold you for using it .</p>
              <p>   Just because you are in a rush doesn't give you the right to use the gate . Everyone is in a rush in the peak hrs , so can they use the gate too ?If this was your companys property do you like pple to do that too ?</p>
              <p>  Since you seldom take public transport , then you should take this as a lesson learn abt the rules . As for the police being " heavily armed " , i believe their " stuff " are abit heavy but not to the extent that you have written . As for being rude , well go ahead and complain , this is your right to complain so go ahead .</p>
              <p>   If the police are indeed heavily armed , all tourist in sg whom sees them will definitely fly back home and tell pple that sg needs heavily armed police to maintain order . And you also won't see so many FT around .</p>
