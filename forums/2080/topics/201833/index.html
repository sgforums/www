            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>NEL trains resume full service after Monday's shut down<br>By Dominique Loh, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 25 July 2006 1337 hrs<br><br>SINGAPORE : Full train services on the North East Line resumed at 6am on Tuesday.<br><br>SBS Transit is still investigating the actual cause of Monday's breakdown, which shut down part of the train system for nearly half a day.<br><br>The company estimates that about 60,000 commuters were affected.<br><br>Early morning commuters arrived at the Outram Park MRT Station as the first train on the southbound track rolled into service.<br><br>Seventy engineers and service crews worked overnight to get the entire system running smoothly again.<br><br>The disruption was one of the longest in the history of Singapore's underground train system.<br><br>At fault was the copper power cable that runs at the top of the tunnel; it supplies the electricity that drives the train.<br><br>The power cable is tensioned, or stretched like a rubber band.<br><br>When it broke, it fragmented into pieces, which were scattered along the tunnel.<br><br>Service crews had to first clear the debris before moving the trains and making repairs.<br><br>Said Alex Goei, director of rail operations, SBS Transit, "Because the power line is tensioned like a rubber band, when it breaks it can potentially affect other cables in the tunnel; so we had to do those checks to cables, to the track. One of the results of the power trip was that the operation of the platform screen doors was affected and if the platform screen doors cannot operate, passengers cannot board or alight from the trains."<br><br>Although service on the southbound track was affected for about 11 hours, on the opposite side of the platform, things were working fine.<br><br>In fact, this was used in the shuttle service that served the four affected stations.<br><br>SBS Transit says there is no guarantee such a failure will not happen again.<br><br>If it does, commuters may face the same disruptions as there is no back-up power supply.<br><br>Said Mr Goei, "We will investigate into the causes of why the wires broke and from the causes we'll look at how we can prevent it. We would certainly want to minimise train service disruption arising from what happened yesterday."<br><br>The other train operator, SMRT, says that although it uses a different third rail power system, it too does not have an alternate power supply.<br><br>But the operators say having a backup power supply may not help if the problem lies with the power cable.<br><br>Imagine having a generator in your own home. With a severed power cable, even if with two or three back up systems, there is no way the generators can power your home. - CNA /ct</blockquote></div>
