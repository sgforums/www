              <p>I took the trains in several seating configurations.</p>

              Barau</span></p>
              <p>I commence on this ride on a cushion seat cabin. The seats are
              releatively fine but several problem exsisted. Firstly, the seats
              are a little dirty and some micro-organism may have been infested
              the seats. Secondly, the air-conditioning are not so "power".
              Finally, the cabin looks are like it had not been renovated for
              years.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapura-KL</span></p>
              <p>On this ride, i took the First Class Cabin (Without Toilet). It
              had been with a double decker bed and a washing tap. This room was
              a breeze and is quite cosy and comfortable.</p>
              <p>However, when i went to the meal car, the meals served there are
              rotten already.....i am not kidding.</p>
              <p>Therefore, I felt that a plane or ferry is better than KTM.</p>

              <p>Sorry to hear about your experiences. May I ask how long ago was this ride?</p>
              <p>You took the second class seats on your Singapore-JB leg. The seat design is still the same but I must say that they have been cleaned up now with new headrest towels, repainted seatbacks and all. Plus they've changed the TV to a Samsung 32" LCD one.</p>

              <p>For your Singapore-KLS leg, you took the 2 PLUS coach (ADNFB). First class is 2 beds, 2 seats (bottom bed) TV and shower. Oh and free breakfast too, haha. The buffet coaches have been recently refurbished (new air-con etc.) along with new caterers. I have not tried the new food so I'm sorry I cannot tell you much about it yet.</p>

              <p>Blue Tiger is capable of hauling more than 100 BCFs (Bogie Container Freight) should the newly upgraded track allow if I'm not wrong. This is evident in other countries such as Europe. Hence it's not economically-viable to use then on, say, 4 car passenger trains like the Kembara.</p>
              <p>The cost of double-tracking and electrifying has more than increased 5-fold in the past 10 years. Moreover, doucle tracking is not possible in Singapore. Think Bukit Timah Railway bridge, Ten Mile Railway Crossing, AYE, Buona Vista tunnel etc. Anyway, LTA doesn't like overhead catenary wires which is what KTMB is using now.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess, KTM uses the overhead wire is because, people usually cross over the the other side by walking on the rails, what we call, shortcut. They can put a third rail to power the EMUs(Electric Multiple Unit), but first, they have to fence up the whole electrified line to ensure that no one can enter the dangerous area.</div>

                  Yes, I know about that. We arent referring to that, we are talking abt the catenary, like what the NEL use. 
                  
                  The wires at the side is the communication wires. Those are the stuffs that made communication possible between a crossing to another crossing.
                  <br>
                  An example will be, Bukit Timah station have to send a train to the crossing, which is Gombak. The station master will then ring using the magneto telephone and will tell the gatekeeper, okay, this train is approaching. Close all the gates now. After gombak receive the message, they will pass the message to the rest of the gatekeepers.
              From Bukit Timah -&gt; Gombak -&gt; Bukit Panjang -&gt; Mandai -&gt; Sungai Kadut -&gt; Kranji -&gt; Woodlands(CIQ). They will call each other 3 times. The first is call is to inform the gatekeeper what train is coming, for example, the Ekspres Sinaran Petang, which is Train 6. So they will inform, okay, Train 6 is on the way. The second bell is to notify the crossing to get ready to close all the barriers and let the semaphore down. The third bell means, the train has pass the crossing, and now approaching the next crossing. 
                  <br>
                  I will give an example.
                  <br>
                  Gombak -&gt; BP: Hello, Train no. 6 is on the way now. Please do get ready.(1st bell)
                  Bukit Panjang -&gt; Gombak: Okay, Train no. 6 noted. 
                  Bukit Panjang -&gt; MandaI: Hello, Train no. 6 on the way ok.(1st bell)
                  <br>
                  Gombak will then ring the the phone again.
                  Gombak -&gt;BP: (2nd bell)
                  BP -&gt; Gombak: Noted the 2nd bell, and reply it buy returning the bell again.
                  Gombak -&gt; BP: (3rd bell) Which means, the train has reach the crossing and now informing BP to close all barriers and give the green signal to the driver.
                  BP -&gt; Mandai: (2nd bell)
                  Mandai -&gt; BP: Replied the 2nd bell
                  BP -&gt; Mandai: (3rd bell)
                  Mandai: Close gates.
                  <br>
                  It works something like that. :D

              <p>Ah nice insight into the signal system... Shall share some foreign information on this system.</p>
              <p>If I recall correctly, the system is called the absolute block system, there were once such systems in Japan (where most of my train reseach is based on, in fact over 90 percent), used in crossings and stations alike. For a sparse traffic like KTM in Singapore, this system has no problem in maintaining safety; unless there is a guy sleeping at the work and dispatched two trains in opposing directions!</p>
              <p>In Japan's case, it was a different thing. Train traffic was high and such systems cannot cope with it. The token system (also under the absolute block system) was used until the 50s-60s, when the ATS (Automatic Train Stop) system took over. There were still non-nationalized (in the past was Japan National Railways, now Japan Railways and privatized) railways in the country using the absolute block system. One example that lasted till now and went through a serious accident was the Shigaraki Highland Railways (ä¿¡æ¥½é«˜åŽŸé�µé�“) in the Kansai Region (near Kyoto).</p>
              <p>On 14th May 1991, an accident related to the absolute block signal system and crew error occurred on the line. JR had earlier started operations into the private line in lieu of the high passenger load the previous month. There were 18 round train trips per day in both directions on normal days, increased from original of 16, after a new signal station with a side track has been set up between the first two stations which covers the longest distance, and a modified Special Absolute Block Signal system was used. JR West added to the trips by putting additional 6 round trips to help out due to a pottery fair at the region. It was a recipe for disaster; a single track system, new staff at a recently privatized JNR line, and JR West staff who are not sure of the line structure.</p>
              <p>On the first few days of service (April 1990), the staff did not notice anything wrong. They dispatched trains as much as the system could handle, making trains pass by each other at stations and the new signal station. There were near misses, especially at the new signal station where JR West trains would wait for the Shigaraki Railways train to pass by.</p>
              <p>On 14th May itself, the JR West train was dispatched from the main line into Shigaraki Highland Railways, with a 4 car Shigaraki Railways train (SKR-200 lightweight diesel local type train) running on the opposite direction from Shigaraki towards the main line. The two trains were supposed to pass by at the signal station.</p>
              <p>In the process, the SKR-200 4 car train was delayed, as the Shigaraki Highland Railways staff could not solve the problem with the special absolute block system signals that were supposed to tell the JR West train to stop at the signal station, and give the SKR train a green signal. They were recieving a red signal instead.</p>
              <p>What they not know is that the system has put priority for the JR West train to proceed to the second station of the line before the SKR train can be dispatched towards the first station. <strong>It did not utilise the signal station for that train trip.</strong></p>
              <p>Under frustration and possible serious delay, <strong>the SKR train was dispatched from the second station towards the main line/first station with a red signal.</strong> The JR West train was also somehow dispatched (staff error on the main line side), <strong>after the staff on both sides have resorted to let the signal system solve the problem of stopping the trains.</strong> This was an obvious human error case and nothing was made to stop either party; the JR West side thought that the Shigaraki Railways side have solved the signal problem, and the SKR side thought that the signal system would stop the JR West train anyways.</p>
              <p>The JR West train passed by the signal station, its crew surprised to see no SKR train in the side track and that the signal to the next station is green. Due to delay on the side of the JR West train (it was waiting on the main line to let the SKR staff to clear the problem), the train crew increased speed (estimate was about 80 km/h, maximum for the small line) towards the next station.</p>
              <p>At a large wooded area with a gradual bend, the two trains collided head-on, the JR West train at about 80 km/h and SKR train about 60 km/h, combined collision speed of 140 km/h. The SKR train was immediately crushed, the second carriage bending upwards with the sheer force. The JR West train had its front crushed as well, but due to a stronger construction, survived rather intact. 42 persons were killed, 30 on the JR West train due to its slight overload, and 12 on the SKR train, including 5 SKR staff. 614 persons were injured in this worst train accident on a private line involving JR and private trains.</p>
              <p>The lesson learnt from the Japan train industry was that lightweight trains are often made without a solid chassis; engine and bodywork are all that maintain the train in shape. Regulations were revised to include the safety standards of these lightweight train models, however, the 2005 Amagaseki train accident taught us that crash protection are still not sufficient. As a gauge, the JR West (former JNR) Kiha 58 weighed 35-38 tons per carriage, for the engine equipped version (Kiha 28 for non-engine/trailer), the SKR-200 only weighed 25.7 tons.</p>
              <p>The signal system was one big lesson as well; never to rely on a automatic system as it is not failsafe. What exactly went through the minds of those operating the system that day was not known, but one thing can be sure, it took a serious accident to prove that any type of signal system are also vunerable to errors that may lead to large damage bills and loss of life.</p>
              <p>The Shigaraki Highland Railways is still in operation now, using the same system as the the day of the accident, but the automatic component have since been removed from it. Trains now have to use the traditional absolute block system and phone confirmation from the next station to proceed. The signal station was also disused.</p>

              <p>Sorry to hear about your experiences. May I ask how long ago was
              this ride?</p>
              <p>You took the second class seats on your Singapore-JB leg. The
              seat design is still the same but I must say that they have been
              cleaned up now with new headrest towels, repainted seatbacks and
              all. Plus they've changed the TV to a Samsung 32" LCD one.</p>

              <p>For your Singapore-KLS leg, you took the 2 PLUS coach (ADNFB).
              First class is 2 beds, 2 seats (bottom bed) TV and shower. Oh and
              free breakfast too, haha. The buffet coaches have been recently
              refurbished (new air-con etc.) along with new caterers. I have not
              tried the new food so I'm sorry I cannot tell you much about it
              yet.</p>

              <p>Its the money problem...</p>
              <p>For a big country, it would be hard to divide out all the money in everywhere. Just filling up road potholes in Malaysia would take decades, and then the holes are created again!</p>
              <p>Same goes to the railway system. For a limited budget and long distances, it would be hard to manage, and also hard to fully electrify the network. Expertise from foreign countries would be needed also, if not, local research and development.</p>
              <p>Japan, then again, has a vast network and good budget, but there are much lines which are not heavily utilised, so they go without electricity. Diesel for those mountainous lines are slightly better than electric, due to the high power needed. Train cars can also 'go alone' into forests and uninhabited areas. They are similar to the Rail Car of KTM in the past.</p>
              <p>With strong diesel motive power, locomotives can go 3000 plus
              horsepower and 6000 or more for double engines (on a single loco), and
              diesel cars (or DMU) in Japan have 500 horsepower for a train of GVW
              about 40 tons.</p>
              <p>With electricity, substations providing electricity is needed. A line cannot run hundreds of kilometers on one power station and substation! As a gauge, a DC powered railway need a substation every 5-20 kilometers to maintain supply of current. An AC powered railway would only need 20-80 kilometers, mainly due to the voltage and frequency difference.</p>
              <p>Planning a country and its transport infrastructure is like playing Sims City, minus the revert functions!</p>
              <p>So that accounts to lots of development!</p>

              <p>He wasn't talking about overhead electrical wires, but the communication one. There isn't any overhead electrical wires on the KTM in Singapore, KTM uses diesel trains down here. I pass by their track so often but I don't see any overhead electrical wires. The closest place I can think off in the whole of KTM's network is KTM Komuter.</p>
