              <p>I think the train accident which happened between Khatib station and Yio Chu Kang Station should not be labelled as a horrific accident because the Train Captain (whatever you call them) handled the incident well.</p>

              <p>The only horrific accident I would consider as really horrible is the one, as Scania said, the 1993 Clementi accident.</p>
              <p>The derailment incident was due to a Siemens hitting a faulty track switcher, derailed at AMK area.</p>

              <p><br>You can try the reference library at National Library, though I have no clue either.</p>
              <p>Only thing that I know was, the train behind could not brake in time and crashed into the train in front. Not even the numbers.</p>
              <p>As for the Siemens derailment, 227/228 was heading to Bishan off service that time. 3227 came off the rails, and caused a super long service disruption.</p>

              <p><strong>Author</strong><br><strong>Tan Lay Yuen<br></strong><br>A front-to-back collision between two trains at the Clementi Station on 5 August 1993 was the first major accident on the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system since it started operation in 1987. This first MRT accident resulted in 156 injured commuters.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Description</strong></span><br>At 7:50 am on 5 August 1993, an East-bound train from Jurong stopped at the Clementi Station for two minutes longer than scheduled due to a technical fault. It was then hit by another train. Operations at the three affected stations, namely, Clementi, Buona Vista and Commonwealth resumed within a day after intensive checks were carried out by Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (MRTC) engineers to ensure that the tracks, signals, power and other installations were functioning properly.<br><br>The train, comprising six carriages, had a full capacity of 1,800 passengers. The peak-hour collision injured 156 commuters. Several passengers were flung against panels and steel railings of the train or piled on top of one another, suffering multiple injuries.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cause</strong></span><br>Immediately after the accident, an independent inquiry panel was set up by MRTC to investigate the cause of the accident and to review the operating procedures and safety measures of the MRT system.Â  The inquiry panel was chaired by Chua Koon Hoe, who was then Deputy Director-General of the Public Works Department.Â  Besides Chua, the inquiry panel comprised of two members, Chang Meng Teng, then Deputy Chairman of the Public Transport Council, and Dr Natarajan Varaprasad, then Principal of Temasek Polytechnic, and a secretary, Low Tien Sio, then MRTC's General Manager.Â  TheÂ  inquiry panel issued a report on its findings on 19 October 1993.Â  The report revealed that the accident was caused by a 50-litre oil spill from a maintenance locomotive which was carrying out maintenance work at about 5 am on the day of the accident.Â Â  According to the findings, a broken rubber ring caused oil from the locomotive to drip on part of the tracks stretching from Buona Vista to the Ulu Pandan depot.Â  Although a cleaning crew was alerted of the oil spill, cleaning was delayed because the station masters were changing shifts and there was also some confusion over who was in charge of the cleaning.Â  The inquiry panel pointed out that the accident could have been prevented had the staff understood the gravity of the situation and dealt with the oil spill "sufficiently aggressively or promptly".</p>
              <p>Following the findings of the inquiry panel, train operator Singapore Mass Rapid Transit Ltd (SMRT) revised its operating procedures to require station masters to inspect the platform tracks for oil, and in the circumstance of an oil spill, the train at the station preceding the oil spill must remain at the station until the train ahead has left the station.</p>
