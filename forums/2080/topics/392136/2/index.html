              <p>The MRT network is not exactly what I call world-class. Firstly, the infrastructure on the older lines is aging. The older stations, especially those on the west side, are really starting to show their age and out-of-date-ness. They could use a facelift.</p>
              <p>However, I think the biggest two flaws on the MRT are its users and its frequency. I'm not saying that <em>no one</em> is kind on the MRT, but there could be a lot more. A flood of people age 60 - 70+ gets on a crowded train, and what does everyone do? Fall asleep, especially those in the priority seats. Yesterday, on my morning commute to school, a staff member on the eastbound Clementi platform needed to yell at someone sleeping and listening to deafening music in the priority seat to give it up to a pregnant woman carrying a decent amount of shopping. Some mode of awareness must be attempted that has a much more serious tone and better impact than their Courtesy Trains and PCK stickers.</p>
              <p>The frequency on the MRT could see some MAJOR improvements. I missed a train on the way home a couple weeks ago and timed the wait till the next train with my watch. Nine minutes and 22 seconds is what I got, and the train that came, like all trains that I take at 3PM+, was no different than the one I took in the morning during peak hours in terms of how many people were inside. Increasing frequency will also reduce this crowd. There are always quite a number of trains idling in the depots - get them out and use them! Go to London, Hong Kong, Taipei, Bangkok, New York City, Seoul, Tokyo... I have personally been to all of those cities in the last five years and during off-peak hours, there were always seats on the trains, and with the exception of maybe London, the trains would arrive in five minutes or less. Taipei and Hong Kong have an average wait time of FOUR minutes during off-peak hours. Why can't Singapore?</p>

              <p>Can Singapore sure can. It just that they need to buy more trains and I wonder if the 3 depots (Changi, Ulu Pandan and Bishan) are fully utilized (I.e: No additional slots for any trains, it is either built a entire new depot or no new train at all -- PS: They are going to build a depot near Tuas Checkpoint when it extends to the Tuas in 2015. BUT, isnt the new C151A trains will come at 2011 where the new depot is not ready yet?)</p>

              <p><br>well if you have seen Bishan station on the NSL and CCL, i could consider it a facelift, maybe you might have a chance for EW  and CCL PYL too.</p>
              <p>i count it as a facelift cause for some cases, most of the interior has be revamped, and most of the CCL stations in these areas are merged with the existing line station thus making it look bigger.</p>
              <p>i not quite sure on your POV of your version of facelift.</p>

              <p>And if you calculate the average amount of money each people have over at China, are they still rich?</p>
              <p>Population in China: About 1,200,000,000 or 1.2 billion<br>China's GDP: About $4,911,000,000,000 or $4.911 trillion<br>Per capita: $3,696</p>
              <p>Population in Japan: About 127,000,000 or 127 million<br>Japan's GDP: About $4,910,000,000,000 or $4.910 trillion<br>Per capita: $38,457</p>
              <p>Population in Singapore: About 4,900,000 or 4.9 million<br>Singapore's GDP: About $181,939,000,000 or $189.939 billion<br>Per capita: $38,972</p>
              <p>GDP is not an accurate gauge of a country's coffer due to the fact that each country differs from one to another in terms of land space, population and some other factor. Thus, per capita would be a better gauge to compare IMHO.</p>

              <p>For your information, it's the local authorities that set the specifications of the train. Japan merely follows the specification as stipulated by the authorities in charge and built the trains accordingly. Even Alstom Metropolis and the upcoming Bombardier Movia also build their train according to the specifications stipulated.</p>

              <p>The MRT network is not exactly what I call world-class. Firstly, the infrastructure on the older lines is aging. The older stations, especially those on the west side, are really starting to show their age and out-of-date-ness. They could use a facelift.</p>
              <p>However, I think the biggest two flaws on the MRT are its users and its frequency. I'm not saying that <em>no one</em> is kind on the MRT, but there could be a lot more. A flood of people age 60 - 70+ gets on a crowded train, and what does everyone do? Fall asleep, especially those in the priority seats. Yesterday, on my morning commute to school, a staff member on the eastbound Clementi platform needed to yell at someone sleeping and listening to deafening music in the priority seat to give it up to a pregnant woman carrying a decent amount of shopping. Some mode of awareness must be attempted that has a much more serious tone and better impact than their Courtesy Trains and PCK stickers.</p>
              <p>The frequency on the MRT could see some MAJOR improvements. I missed a train on the way home a couple weeks ago and timed the wait till the next train with my watch. Nine minutes and 22 seconds is what I got, and the train that came, like all trains that I take at 3PM+, was no different than the one I took in the morning during peak hours in terms of how many people were inside. Increasing frequency will also reduce this crowd. There are always quite a number of trains idling in the depots - get them out and use them! Go to London, Hong Kong, Taipei, Bangkok, New York City, Seoul, Tokyo... I have personally been to all of those cities in the last five years and during off-peak hours, there were always seats on the trains, and with the exception of maybe London, the trains would arrive in five minutes or less. Taipei and Hong Kong have an average wait time of FOUR minutes during off-peak hours. Why can't Singapore?</p>

              <p>Since this is the normal class train, seats are as usual, comes in a first come first serve basis, though there're priority seats as well. There're special case though for some trains.</p>
              <p>Take for example, the first two picture i posted, which belongs to the Keikyu 2100 series. When running as Rapid Limited Express, all seats are free-for-all and standing permitted. But when running as the Keikyu Wing at evening peak hour, passengers taking the train will have to reserve a seat and pay an extra fee to board the train as;</p>
              <p>- All seats are reserved (A seat is guaranteed for those who reserve first, though on a limited scale)<br>- Those without ticket are not allowed on board (Premium service as no standing is allowed)<br>- Train skip more station compared to Rapid Limited Express (Wing skips 30 stations compared to 9 stations on Rapid Limited Express from Shinagawa)</p>
              <p>Oh by the way, the train of the 3rd and 4th picture has a toilet. Again, no need to pay extra fares...</p>

              <p>Then there is a AMK thingy. No, this is not a train fault, but rather another "LTE" (Not a proper term, since the timing is not within weekdays, 12pm - 2pm that consituites a Lunch Time Express, LTE). I am not sure if Jurong East bound AMK train will return to Marina Bay (Just like LTE). However, I am sure that Marina Bay bound AMK train from Jurong East will terminate at AMK and the next stop is....... Bishan Depot. (I have tried this before and can attest it)</p>

              <p>I miss the days when train service was really a service, rather than a brand as it is now... When waiting times were naturally at most 5 minutes on NSL off-peak, unlike flaunting the fact about adding "really a lot of" trips to improve frequency now when something really wrong happened somewhere some time ago...</p>
              <p>Those days were around 2001, + or - 1 year... before NEL started.</p>
              <p>Those were the days when 7 minutes (or longer) waiting time most probably meant the train was delayed.</p>
