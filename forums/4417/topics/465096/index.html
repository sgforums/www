              <p>why not?</p>
              <p>it's been our rules since the beginning till now.</p>
              <p>why can't it been done?</p>
              <p>What we are asking is to treat everyone especially the ladies with respect as of how you would treat your own friends.</p>
              <p>What we are aiming for is to create an environment whereby the ladies will feel safe and the guys in the group will protect the ladies if anyone is trying to take advantage of the ladies. And that is why we came out with the rule. As of rule number 3, we usually RSVP table and there is a min spending per table. any increase or decrease of people will affect the total cost for each person.</p>
              <p>If you think it's hard for anyone to comply after my explaination, then please tell me what's so hard to comply with the rules?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I repeat again, our aim is very simple. we just want to gather like-minded people to join us to dine, drink and dance in a clean, fun, and safe environment.</p>
