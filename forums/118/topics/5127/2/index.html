Remind me of some ___ forum....<br><br>1st and foremost I would like to thank []GLT[]Owen for starting this topic where everyone kan here and there and some ppl from other clan might be think that []GLT[] is really splitting up... Thanks you very 'much'.<br><br>Well... wat beckham says abt diff ppl have diff type of life. It's quite true but wat I hope is that whenever there is a clan match just post in here lar.. Or else i go apply this bloody forum for wat?? Now wat Razor match thing whatever fuck thing I also duno. Even though my <strong>SKILL</strong> is not good enuff but I wish to be updated also mah. Everything go settle among our ownself, no wonder so many #%#@% here and there. Now everyone is so busy or tired with work, NS, gf, ....etc etc, of coz there will be less commitment mah. Like me as a clerk now also kan busy also, even now my new year clothes also dun have time to go buy. Owen dun anyhow say wat []GLT[] splitting up lar. Nabei u go NS I see wat bloody time u have for ur precious CS. As wat I had just said in the previuos post "<strong>Everyone is just tired of CS and wanting to take a breather in something else and not just CS alone. Not like u almost everyday CS here CS there so siao on....</strong>"<br><br>Well, that's all what I wanna say only. Only from my point of view and I know not everyone will agree with me coz I actually type without thinking what will be the end result of my stupid post here. Anyway I hack care liao also...<br><br>------------------<br>Once A NewBie.. Forever A NewBie.....<br>But this NewBie Rulez....~!!!!!</div>
