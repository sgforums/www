            <div class='col-md body'>If you're thinking is like CS is still on sat... then you go ahead lor. Everytime also cs... you must think of greg and brian, churong and maggie. They don't play CS!! What we can do on sat which everyone can do.. is sit down tok kok, EAT! and watch show! Although it's not as interesting and exciting as CS but still can live with it right? Maintain a good friendship through this way is better also right? Or else later becos of getting frag, u buey song me I buey song u.<br><br>Dono's skills? Trust me.. he is better than me... I never see him.. his commando on my head. Welly... artic is god damn bloody good! Better than jarvis! Jarvis lost to him on 1v1 when they were playing online! Lawie and Dono type /kill to see show!!!<br><br>Abt $$$... You earn how much I also earn how much right? You wan to spend everything on serene.. how to eat and come out with us! Benny's friends? Only thomas and GZD dun come out with us. Handsen and shaoqiang is coming out with us more and more frequently liao. You cannot see it for yourself?<br><br>LAN shop eat grass? Those kids cannot play during weekdays like us! Under 16! Remember last time we all chiong cineleisure everyday during 97? Cos got nothing to do on sat for them... You're 20 and I'm 22 .. I dun believe u cannot understand my thinking.<br><br>Gun's skills? Everyone has his own personality and feelings towards the gun. I like carbine so I always use carbine. Darren like scout tats y u can see he always headshot with it. Lawie likes P90 and princess like mp5. Everyone is as good as me in out group. The only problem lies with you is u always camp camp camp... if you camp.. how to get frags like us? If lawie and I were in your team.. you think u can get frags? Now even that rugal learn to play like me. Chiong all the way to gain frags. Frags is just numbers.. dun hav to train everyday.Now I always go ussc is to entertain rugal. He jio me I go. 2 more weeks he's going back. Lynn dun like me to go ussc everynite... she will nag nag nag... cos i cannot wake up the next morning. Even if i go.. around 9-9.30 i go home liao.<br><br>Tournaments? I said I WILL NEVER JOIN EGAMES's TOURNAMENTS! Cos the way they manage sucks... once is enuff. E-station i got play also right? Cause it's fair... I draw my lots... not others.<br><br>Different people got different opinion. But i still must stress.. Sat is a gathering for us. I call u, u wan to come or not.. dun say bo jio.<br><br>Mervin: Hobby ?! Kao! I play game since 1985!!! I know rugal for damn 16 years! Play games together. Playing game is also my hobby! But I know when to stop and when to start.<br><br>Lastly.. You wan clan match.Fine but ask everyone first lar. Or else something crops up... u see how u gonna manage it.<br><br>PS: Darren lost his password... Thats y he cannot post.<br>------------------<br>Strive for perfection even if others must suffer.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rampage (edited 21 January 2001).]</div>
