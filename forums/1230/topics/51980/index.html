            <div class='col-md body'>Felt lost? Felt moody, need someone to tok to but dunno who &amp; how. Is either he has too many friends but none are close enuff to b a Zhi Ji or he has already lost touch with most of them. He got a problem, He wanna to say it out, but cannot find a listener. He dunno who to trust and he had totally lost hope in friends. When he is alone, he think too much and wish to have sum1 by his side who is able to gif care n concern to him, but when he is wif sum1, he felt dat he shd b left alone, cos dat sum1 does not understand him, &amp; e problem he is facing! How many friends u have can b there for u when u are down n out, how many sincere friends are there who are willing to lent u a listening ear or even a shoulder to lean on when u need one! He dun need ur pity, all he need is genuine!<br><br>Ppl always thought he is at happy Â– go - luck guy who dun have any worriesÂ… always happy, able to joke ard, always full of nonsense, always toking crap, not are at serious in wad he say n wad he do but have u ever realize dat he seldom see him sad, moodyÂ… Why?? Dat bcos he kept all things inside his heartÂ…all e problem he face upon in his life, be it work, relationship, or financialÂ…u can say he is postive, able to take in all negative comments or setbacksÂ…always able to look on e bright side no matter wad happenÂ…  always put on a happy face mask to an extreme dat u seldom @@ him get angry or sadÂ…even no matter how u treat himÂ…even if he were to get angry or sad, it jus temporary, he will recover in no timeÂ… it take no effort, soon he will be see him back to his usual self but is e problem solve ?? e root of e problem is always not solve as he did not bare it all to any1Â…instead it grew deeper n bigger inside e heartÂ…SoonÂ…1day, when it all burst out dat when it endsÂ….. (felt better but is tis e end or e beginning?)<br><br>Hmm.... Happy Birthday to himÂ…well seem like not so happy after all...............<br>oops:</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How high can a ball bounce? E more u bounce it, the higher it goesÂ… as time goes by, it either dies off or it gif way. Every of us have our own problems, is jus how we face it. We can either solve it or run awayÂ… but wad if we canÂ’t solve it? Run? Wad happen if u keep on running? Sooner or later, youÂ’ll have to stop for a restÂ…Then thatÂ’s when all ur problems catch up wif uÂ… What happen next?<br><br>Have u ever wonder wad wld u do if u had a chance to turn back e time? Where wld u go? Wad wld u change? If u will to have a 2nd chance to do it all over again, wld u choose e same path? Why is it that we always regret for e things we had done. Isit there any ways to salvage it? Why do we keep making e same mistake over n over again? Haven we learn our lesson?<br><br>How abt, if u had a chance to get away from tis familiar environment? Get away from all e ppl u noe? Let say to a different dimension, a different country, a different culture, a different environment and with a new identity. Ur old self doesnÂ’t exist anymore! No one knew abt ur past, ur identity and who u are. U can have anew life, a new start, a new future! Well, dat wld be great! But of cos, youÂ’ll have to start all over again, making new friends, new career. But overall I definitely wouldnÂ’t mind that!! But if u will to do dat, wad happen to ur close ones? Do u bear to leave them? Are u heartless enuff to leave behind everything, including, ur close ones, ur reputation, ur identityÂ… What is holding us back? Love? Memories? Or u are jus too relax in ur comfort zone, too lazy to venture into e unknown world. Is e fear of failure really too much for u to handle or u jus lack of guts!<br><br>Why dat we had memories? Why canÂ’t we forget those unpleasant things? Why does our memories keep coming back to haunt us? Why do humans have feelings? Is being too emotional gd or bad? What happen if u are too sentimental? Isit gd or bad? Why canÂ’t we let go? Letting go has never been easy and holding on can be as difficult. Yet strengths measured not by holding on but by letting go. So e question is hw strong u are?<br><br>What is life? What is our purpose here? Is making people happy our main purpose in life or making ourself happy? Why does happiness always end so fast? Why does sadness always linger even after a period of time? People once say that our heart is like a fragile glass, it crack easily. Once it cracks, u will never be able to mend it. E crack will be there forever. They say time can heal all woundsÂ…..but take how long to heal? Sometime, I really wish I could get amnesiaÂ… tis way I do not worry so muchÂ…I would be much happier.<br></div>
