            <div class='col-md body'>Dear diary,<br><br>I am forever curious about relationship between a guy and a girl. 2 decades of my life &amp; I never dated a single female. Which is why every time I see a couple out there, I get many weird feelings. Envy, jealousy, sour, hurt. I always yearned to find that special someone, someone who can share my happiness, my pain &amp; everything else.<br><br>Throughout my life, I have liked different girls on different occasions: 1 childhood friend, 1 from secondary, 1 during polytechnic. But I really donÂ’t have the guts to tell them I am interested in them. I was young, ignorant of what is called Â“loveÂ”. I was unsure what response I would get. Most of all I fear Â“rejectionÂ”Â…<br><br>Every time I see the girl I liked, I would notice what she does, her attire, her language, her every single movement. I couldnÂ’t help it. I really canÂ’t. I can only have a Â“friendlyÂ” chat with her. I donÂ’t dare to tell her, Â“I like you.Â” For fear I get rejected &amp; in future it will be embarrassing whenever we meet.<br><br>Every time I get to know what she did, where she goes or who she is with, I wished I was there too. Seeing what I missed out, I felt some sort of pain, envy &amp; jealousy in me. This may not be a positive attitude, but I couldnÂ’t help it. I mean, what am I in her eyes? No more then a mere friend. If that is the case, why am I so fussed up?<br><br>Many times I tried to suppress this feelings, I tried consulting in my buddy, asking my friends about their relationships with girls, reading books related to this, even tried to keep myself occupied to forget this. No matter what I did, how my buddy gave sound advice, how much information I collected, the feeling keeps appearing.<br><br>Those whom I once have feelings for are now gone. I now live life as usual, but I fear such feelings may arise again. I fear I may once again have fancy for a girl and history repeats itself. I can blame no one for this except for myself. I am too suspicious &amp; emotional. I can hardly take things easy as my buddy had advice me to do.<br><br>What should I do? What can I do? I don't believe I will be single the whole life, but I am also not confident. Am I really what I described myself, "Ming Fan Ku Xing"? Have I offended "The Lonely Star"? Give me a sign...</div>
