            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Diary,<br><br>Relationship problems surround me. No, not mine, just seems like everyone else's.<br><br>Thank goodness I know of couples that are truly happy. Or rather they seem truly happy, because no one else really knows whether they are except themselves right?<br><br>My faith that I will eventually be happy as part of a couple is waning. You know me well, dear diary, that while I am idealistic especially when it comes to love and all that bullsh[/i]it, I'm not deluded. True love CAN be found, and I've experienced it! So why not again? And anyway I'm not really worried about myself, but the amount of relationship problems that blow my way from other people worries me, alot.<br><br>It worries me such that I'm now a little unsure of the faith I have in, I dunno, love? people? singaporeans? girls? (I am still heterosexual, as of now). Tell me, you've been written in so many times by distraught couples, what is your take on it? Has things just somehow gotten worse? Or that for decades, humans have always made "mistakes" when it came to relationships and it's only now that I've realised?<br><br>Nope, I still think despite all the seeming sorrow couples seem to go through, hope is still big, bright and shining within me. Help me to keep that hope alive. Also, help me to help instill this hope in my fellow humans that I so give a sh[/i]it about.</div>
