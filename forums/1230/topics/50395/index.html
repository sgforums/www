            <div class='col-md body'>this is both a diary entry and a message to someone who actually reads my diary....this person will have to know what i'm thinking....i do not wish to be misunderstood....<br><br>over the years that i've stayed on in sgforums, i've been thru ups and downs, my life has alwiz been revolving around the forums, and that's when the politics of forum life revolve around me....<br><br>there were certain times, when i let myself enter this politics, only to understand that it's a painful experience......<br><br>after about a few times of falling after being involved.... i'm somehow shapped into what i am now....<br><br>i pursue my own kind of justice, for i do not like the "norm" that we have all been living in. i've come to conclude that there's no right, nor wrong, for it's all subjective to personal ideals and the "norm" of lifestyle.<br><br>i've tried to live my life following this concept, which unfortunately, backfired at me very very drastically. and that set me thinking again, abt my so called "concept"<br><br>ideals, and dreams, are there, but they have to "blend" into the "norm" of the society, or else the person to suffer is the one who seeks out the "ideals and dreams"<br><br>now i still think that there's no right nor wrong, but i do believe in doing the "right things", to which ppl who still have the same mindset of following the "norm" will find as harmless.<br><br>ppl usually do not gossip or talk abt a particular person if he is deemed "good", mostly they talk abt the "bad" points. so i ended up seeking my justice and following alongside the "norm". and things seem ok until today... nothing too volatile....<br><br>to the person i wish to dedicate this entry to, pls try to understand the responsibilities of making a decision, we can't be selfish until we ignore the "norm", it will only make our lives more miserable.<br><br>you know who you are, my dear.....</div>
