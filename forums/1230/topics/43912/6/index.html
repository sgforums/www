            <div class='col-md body'>Diarina,<br><br>I've always heard from an astrological point of view, that people with aquarius in their charts fear intimacy... I wonder if that is true... I am not sure that I fear intimacy, not sure that i don't. Just that I cannot get close to a person. Everytime. Always. I will forever end up feeling and getting hurt. I wonder why...<br><br>Maybe I expected too much. Everytime. None of my close friendships last. Another friendship about to go into the drain, I fear... Sad. Looking for answers. Waiting for answers. Will I finally know what goes on? Or will it escape me yet again. Answers... Setting a deadline for the friendship, setting a deadline for myself, setting a deadline for fate.<br><br>Maybe I'm wrong in doing so... Still... If I get hurt now, it'll sting really bad. Yet if I continue waiting, watching, it'll hurt more in the future when the friendship really goes, as all signs pointed that it will... Sunday night. Midnight. Is it too rushed? Will i get an answer before then...? Will i ever be able to trust another again? Everytime I really feel that I can open my heart, I get hurt. Everytime I really trust someone really deeply, again, I get hurt. Is it worth it? Should I ever trust again...? Do they care?<br><br>Sunday night'<br>En'</div>

Actually, got A LOT of chocolates today~ Was at the cold storage in Holland Village, when saw the novelty chocolates for hallowe'en!!! Bought some last year and lurve them, so i am planning to get some more this year! Wahahaha! Chocola~cious! I especially love the one with the sour-sweet filling!!! Yum!!! Anywayz, I only bought two packets this evening, and i've already finished them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> So much for my diet <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I bought a dress the other day, material is similar to lycra. Fits like a second skin. Accentuate my assets but also shows all my flaws... Was planning to wear it on my birthday, thus was on a diet... Though right now... erm... I'll leave that dress to next year bah... Find something else nice to wear, coz after all, it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">my</span> special day!

Well, it's succeeding, that's for sure...<br><br>Confused again, and i thought i had everything figured out... Grrrgh...! Something's gonna happen soon, good or bad, i don't know...

Then, had chocs and chips for lunch... More junk for dinner, mainly coz i was lazy to go out and i didn't quite feel like dining alone... Big mistake. Can feel world war 3 in my tummy right now... Extremely nauseous... arrrgh...<br><br>My four due assignments are completed. Now left with one project due tml and one on tue... Surprise, surprise!!! I don't even comprehend a single bit... It's dictionary hugging night tonight... grrrgh...<br><br>Still lost, feeling confused. Thought everything would become clearer. It didn't. At least i don't feel so emotionally constipated anymore. Pardon the crudness i am and will continue to display, i'm nauseous, stressed and grouchy, and am suspecting it's the onset of another bout of PMS. I do wonder what i am gonna do next, wondering and fearing... What might happen next...? Prolly nothing, duh~! Oh well... My fren's coming over, at least i'll have some company while i'm sick... Though i do feel kinda sorry for her, coz i'm not very good company at this very moment... Maybe i can even get her out to eat with me later... that is if the different junk in my tummy decides to sign a peace treaty.<br><br>No need sleep tonight le, fin tml project. No need sleep tml too, fin proj for tue... Hope for some r&amp;r on tue, i need that... Nowadays sleep less than 4 hours can automatically jump up liaoz... at least i managed to sleep the whole day today, other than woke up to eat of coz... Darn but life is good!

Meanwhile, study, study, study.<br><br>I can have a very intense concentration, just focusing on a singular thing that i choose to. Study will be the word of the day~! Erm.... Start Monday bah, I think i deserve a little rest! Mwahahaha  oops!  Though I wonder if i might be too distracted to focus even, but then again, i just might get lucky... I've always been lucky <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> I might even pass!<br><br>Answers are elusive, always have been, always will be. It should not matter, yet it does. I wonder if the answers i hold for me are the right ones. For right now, whether the answer is right or not, it doesn't quite seem to matter anywayz...

I actually studied today!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Hahahaha, well, i did spend 5 hours on one book, glancing through most of the chapters, realising that my notes are incomplete, and fretting about exam, but i actually got through two to three chapters and (the amazing part :arrow<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> i actually understood it!!! (Well, most of it anyway...) Now don't you laugh, it's not nice to laugh at another's accomplishment! And believe me you, it IS an accomplishment, to me at least... Though wat the heck, I actually managed to study!!! Gosh~ Still can't get over that!<br><br>Was walking to westmall today, it was drizzling, and i though i had the answer i needed... It all just felt right, in place, comforting... Just felt nice... cold, but... felt right. Once i step into the mrt shelther, the rain poured! It was like the rain held out for me, waiting for me to get into the shelther before it's release. Normally, I'd love to have danced in the rain, ok maybe not dance, strolled more like. Especially with the thunder and the type of slashing rain today, but i was meeting a friend, and i dun especially fancy meeting a fren drenched. Not in my normal state of mind anyway.<br><br>Then... I wasn't so sure of my answer anymore. It's just like a gamble, want to, but am hesitant to, never quite sure where i stand, never quite sure wat i want. The win is not that fantastic, but i never liked to lose, and i never lose. Either i bet and win or i leave the table, but sometimes, i just get tempted, and play the game even when i know i have a lousy hand and will lose anyway. Just for the thrill of it, maybe? I don't know. I lost the game, but walk away with some wisdom, some insight. That why i never lost. In fact, no matter what you do, in this big <strong>big</strong> game called life, you can never ever lose. You'll do well to remember that, but then when the payment gets painful, even i'll need a lil' reminder too~! I hope i get the answer soon, it's really driving me crazy, or maybe i should just forsake my initial bet and leave the table. At least that way, i'll have a peace of mind. Right? Though i do wonder if i will regret that i do, coz then, i wouldn't know wat might have happened and wat lesson i'll gain.<br><br>Long entry. As usual. Crazy me. Am gonna go try study!!! Maybe i'm not that hopeless after all. Gonna start my counters again!<br><br>Counting'<br>En'<br><br>2 days then hallowe'en<br>3 days to birthday<br>4 days to comedy on chn 8 (life's sad enough already, be grateful for a laugh :twisted<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>5 days to start of exam<br>9 days to end of exam<br>and<br>10 days to hols!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Diarina,<br><br>Just sorta woke up... Don't ask. Actually, i also dunno why... Usually when stressed or feeling down in the dumps, or even just slightly under the weather, i can just sleep for hours. And I mean long, long hours. Now I feel very stressed and not very well, and cannot sleep somemore. This is reaaaalllly bad.<br><br>Living in my own reality with my own distorted mind, a general lack of time and a screwed up biological clock. Nosebleed two nights in a row. So confused that war seemed like a routine for gymnastics. Gee, but isn't life all fluffy and flowery right abt now? I'm whining again, i know...<br><br>Gotta start thinking more materialistically... Last time when my school days were practically worthless, still can enjoy myself. During 'O's still can go ice-falling. (So termed coz i'd strap on the skates and land on my butt once i step on the ice, without fail, everytime <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ) My frens did try to teach me to ice-skate, but never really succeed, nah it was too graceful a sport for a clumsy sports-hater like me! Ahhhh, the good old days. Now ar, just an exam mah, dunno why also, i stress until like that. Fail also not the end of the world, so wat's the big deal? Big deal is coz i'm bonded, i think. If i grad one sem later, meant my bond ends one sem later, meaning i'm stuck in this rut called life for one sem more!!! Depressing thoughts? You bet! That's supposed to motivate me to study, but it's giving me the reverse (read- moping and b*tching) effects instead.<br><br>Then my comp monitor burned out just now, lucky now can work again. Mouse still not working. You'd have think that it'd deter me from going online, tough luck! Anywayz, practically half of my sch material is online <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Wonder wat they have the school for!!! With or without the lecturers, it's unlikely that i'd understand or even study for them! Oh well, in case you wonder how i survive the last two years, save your breath and don't ask. B'coz, really, i do wonder myself... If you're feeling gracious enough for a lil' charity, wish me luck for my exam, diarina, coz i'm seriously gonna need all that i can get.<br><br>Lucks'<br>En'<br><br>Counting...<br>18 hours to hallowe'en<br>1 day to b'day<br>2 days to comedy<br>3 days to the end of the world<br>8 days to a rebirth<br>9 days to the first day of the rest of my life!

            <div class='col-md body'>Diarina,<br><br>It's Hallowe'en!!! Finally~! The long awaited day in the year is finally here! Goodness, but I dun get to go celebrate this year!!! Sad huh... haiz~ Oh well, always a next year I suppose!<br><br>Some friends are gonna come over. Not very sure if I wanna see all of them. Hate crowds. Would rather be at a ritual, but... Oh well...! One of my fren is working as a make-up artiste at Coyote ugly. She's complaining that the crowds there are rude and nasty, very unappreciative... Oh well, that's singaporean's for you, rude and unappreciative. At leaste their nasty, shows that they are learning to stand up for themselves, which I don't think the gov will think is a good thing. Still is none of my biz, so wat the heck?!<br><br>I just suddenly don't feel like celebrating my b'day anymore. I mean, wat's the big deal? It's just another day <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Still, I really liked my presents this year, and I haven't even get all of them yet!!! Mwahahaha  oops. Let's see, I got a lil' cash, and a wallet (which I'm pretty sure is imitation, and will prolly only use it tml before switching back to my trusted furry pouch), two bars of chocs, a candle-snuffer which really comes in handy, an amber square that smells really glorious and a book by Marion Zimmer Bradley. That book was fantastic! I know, where do I have the time for reading story books when I don't have the time to study right...? Well, see... I can't quite figure that out yet...<br><br>Might be walking around tml, might be sleeping at home. I don't know. Don't quite feel like going out... Still... Oh well, see my mood later bah... My friend said that she got a choc cake, a dangerous pressie (I hope it's a weapon of some sort, an antique looking dagger would be really coolz~), chardonnay and beer. Talk about wierd combinations. I'll be lucky if I dun get stomachache later... Better go prep now, get some chips and sodas, and see wat'll happen. I think i'll be going out tml, get my b'day pressie for myself... Hmmm... What should I get for me...? Hmmmz... Hahahaha. Till next time then diarina, gd nitez~!<br><br>Lurve'<br>En'<br><br>1 day to comedy<br>2 days to distruction<br>6 days to the first glimpse of hope<br>7 days to freedom!<br>and counting!!!</div>

Really???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Went to Genting for the weekend. Just came back. The moment I reached the hotel, I fell violently sick... My tonsils acted up again. One of the worst episodes ever, vomitted both nights in a row and didn't get to go on any rides or walk around... Just cooped up in the hotel room... On the bright side, I didn't get a fever (I hate fevers~!) and I got ice-creams 3 days in a row! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Well, my throat was so sore that all I could endure is anything that could numb the pain, and ice-cream works best! So... Though the doc did say no cold food or drink for me... Yeah... I spent my walking hours waiting in a clinic in genting... Sad huh!<br><br>Good news and bad news, diarina... Good news first okie? I passed my exams!!! I cleared everything!!! Yeay me!!! Don't ask me how I passed! I'm just glad I did! Wahahaha, and I did study this time... Well, at least for the first part of my study week...? *ahem* Still, Is better than nothing right??? I passed, I passed, I passed!!! And I was so worried, coz I almost had no idea what paper I was sitting for... Ok, so maybe I am exaggerating, I did know that I am sitting for papers related to my course of study... I just didn't know how to respond to it... Still, I passed! Now the bad news... I think I'm burning up... Hate fevers!

Met so many new people and had so many fun... It's surprising really, how you know someone for less than a year yet felt as though you had known them for like a quarter of your life... Made many friendship and learned a fair deal of lessons... Healed a lil more, know myself a lil more, and gotten a lil more closer to finding what I seeked. Will always remember the tuesdays, skipping of school, somewhere/something in the middle of crazy september, and of coz~ X'mas...<br><br>Gonna move house soon, well... tml actually. and i'm supposed to be packing. Somehow, think I'm gonna be learning salsa. Think I need to work on my reading, work on my depth and improve my accuracy... Update on school- study only 7 weeks this sem, then is free labour time  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br>Anywayz, second day of school and I skipped classes~ On the bright side, at least I waited till the second day right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>About time I pack my stuff, till next time then diarina...<br><br>Princess pink~<br>~*~    En'   ~*~</div>
