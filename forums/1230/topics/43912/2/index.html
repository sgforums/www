            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Diarina   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ,<br><br>I had a marvelous time today! Went to a holistic fair and had such a lot of fun! I bought a packet of sage for $5.50 . Not too outrageously expensive, but far from cheap either... Oh well, at least it smells great!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Oh, the holistic fair was held at the fort canning park, and the way up was... well, tiring (I'm a couch potato, wadd'ya expect  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> )  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  and very very gorgeous! The leaves are full of rich colors, shades of green and hues of gold, the sky is of the mystic clear blue, with all of those fluffy white clouds, just like out of a painting. Just like a dream come true...<br><br>Some ladies were belly-dancing at that area, and they were rather good, swaying their bodies in a most alluring and tempting way, that left, if I must say, the guy's jaws hanging  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Then a group nearby had a drumming circle, and wierdly enough, the tempo was just right for the dancers, everything just fit together, and it just felt right!<br><br>At around dusk, the blue of the sky darkened and settled upon the ground, like a blanket around a sleeping child, almost like a fog, but much much clearer, like just a viel of blue blanketed over us... The street lamps were unlike those you'd see beside the road, but rather those you see in gardens, and they were lit up... The whole effect was mystical, very calming and very very faerie and magical... The serenity, peace, and feeling of belonging was there so clearly that I could almost taste it!<br><br>Then we went to the back of the fort canning center, one level below the fair was a cafe, unfortunately closed. So we stood by the steps and I had a chance to steal my eyes over a huge land of rolling greens of grasses and trees... And I almost felt that I was not in singapore at all, instead, with the beauty of it all, the whole time, I had this feeling that I had for a rare moment, stepped into faerieland, or surely, some other land that was just as mystical and magical...<br><br>I can say the whole of today was beautiful!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  And the feeling of belonging, of peace, of serenity and of acceptance was with me the whole time...

Let me start from the beginning... Haiz~ and so the story goes...<br><br>I had insomnia again last night... When I was finally falling asleep, around 2+ am, my classmate sms me, saying she just woke up, asking me if I studied...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  That got me so stressed, I couldn't sleep for quite a while, however I didn't study either... Darn, I mean I was lying in darkness, feeling so... snuggled against the blanket, and the air-con was so cold (I like it cold  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) who in their right mind would want to on the light and study!!! It was in the middle of the night for goodness sake...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  So when she finally stop sms-ing me, it was already around 3am. Sleep was creeping in again, and I welcomed it with open arms... Suddenly my handphone beep again, disturbing the serenity of the night and scaring precious sleep away from me... So I just told her I was going to bed... and after some time, I did finally fall asleep...<br><br>My radio went off at 5.40am this morning, I wanted to catch the sun in taurus, 15 deg. Do a little reading and perhaps a little scrying and if I had the luxury of time and luck, converse with a fae or two... But I woke with a darn headache that totally disrupted my mood to do any readings... I was told that any reading done while the veil was the thinnest between the worlds were supposed to be very accurate, and that it was much easier to contact other entities during this period of time... Plus, it was beltane! I could have easily done some workings that could improve my self-love or confidence! And I missed it!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  B'coz I went back to bed! can you believe that!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Then is the exam, first paper today...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  Thinking abt it makes me so super upset! If I weren't so scared of heights, I'd have fly myself out of my bedroom window!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  Darn, I have six short answer question, worth 10mks each! My answer range from the longest, 5 sentences to the shortest, 2 sentences! Duh~ okok so this part of the misery, I bought it upon myself! If I pass this semester, next term I'll really study!!! I'll also try my best to not kip more than 1/2 of the lessons... kay? Think I can pass...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Next paper on thur 8th may...

So it's only 2 1/2  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ) and that's like 50+ chapters  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  so I'll need 100+ hours to cover all?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  Although the saddest thing of all, this paper consists of 60% so unless I want to repeat (Which I <strong>don't</strong>) I'll have to pass it... erm, and coz I flunk the presentation, I'll have to work harder...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>I just reach home!

Through that green field, the sky was dark just now, adequately so, and I could see quite a number of stars winking at me from above  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  The moon is waxing, full on next wed or thur, and it's already half moon now, so beautiful!!! Even the buildings seem right, coz their lights gave the field a slight orange cast, and a feeling of optimisim and hope for life! They just mowned the field today, and while walking home just now, the smell of the fresh-mown grass was so strong, and so pure! And the songs of the cricket only added to the cacophony of nature  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  I've always been alone, as long as I could remember... That is perhaps why every chance I have now, I'll be very dependent, lean heavily on others, coz I feel if I do not do so, they will leave me alone again, even though with them around I still am alone... I hate feeling lonely, yet it is the main emotion ruling my heart, since I was a very very young girl. I've always knew and I have gotten hurt over a lot of things, taht is why I indulge in my dreams, bcoz' even when I get hurt I knew I had a whole lot more than the other girls, coz they do not have the dreams (and through that- experiences) that I have... Yet tonight was one of those rare nights that I do not feel lonely... Alone but not lonely, wat a wonderful feeling it is!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Counting down to end of exams<br>1 day standing~ (Sheesh~ how do you study for 3 books in a day?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> )<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Lurve'<br>En'</div>
