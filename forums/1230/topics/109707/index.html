            <div class='col-md body'>AD2004.<br><br>This has been a year of quiet but dramatic changes for me.<br><br>Reviewing the year in a nutshell, I guess I can safely say that I have made small but steady steps towards my goals. There had been of course, a series of pretty trying and difficult huddles which I have had to overcome. The issues had been long dragging and their ultimate concluding end - already known.<br><br>We are just waiting for Time to eventually close down the drapes of the theatre curtains of the long standing entanglement before writing on the birth of a new chapter.<br><br>Hopefully while we wait, Time will be merciful and grace us the time that we need for the comprehensive preparations that has got to be done.<br><br>The past twenty years had belonged to an era known to feng shui fans as something vaguely translated as the '7th Luck Era'.<br><br>I couldn't really tell if the era had been a favourable one for me, or whether it had been bad.<br><br>But this era, heavily influenced by the 'Po Jun' star and in particular, favoring high risk ventures, manufacturing breakthroughs, characterized much under it's influence with a thrilling dash of dynamic ups-and down.<br><br>Since the era's commence in 1984, we have seen a similar 'violent' beginning which had marked the end of those whom have flourished under the earlier '6th Era'.<br><br>In 1984, the economy of Singapore underwent into a recession.<br><br>Having experience perhaps the biggest economic challenge since it's independence, it might be true to say that virtually everyone took a severe beating during that time.<br><br>It is noteworthy to mention however, that in anticipation with theories, great fortunes exchanged hands during the change of such twenty year eras. And just as massive fortunes could have been wiped out in 1984, new tycoons sprang forth in the local scene like fresh blood spurting out from a lacerated artery.<br><br>As if mirroring the events of 1984, the changes in both pre-2004 as well as early 2004 were also incidentally characterized by a same trail of effect as the era changed hands once more from 7th to 8th.<br><br>Regional economies underwent seasonal contraction first before regaining their slow and cautious pace back into gradual normative levels.<br><br>Interestingly, there had also been a trend of national leadership changes/reappointment both in the Asian region, as well as on the international arena.<br><br>At a personal level, I do sit back and observe these phenomena with awe. Frankly, I do not know if we can attribute all the above changes to a feng shui theory.<br><br>But when new of researchers in Singapore making waves all over world first with the alternative mythology to clone stem cells and more recently, a very much long awaited new system of medicine to effectively destroy cancer cells, I do wonder if these are mere coincidences or the invisible influence of a greater something that is simply beyond my immediate comprehension.<br><br>If there is truely the promise of success for me in this new Era, when will my adventure begin?<br><br>As we all try to stay relevant in a world that is now commonly characterized unpredictability and uncertainly, everyone thinks about a simple but intriguing question:<br><br>From where I am today, where will the tides of change bring me to tomorrow?<br><br>And if they do move me as they would; Do I resist, or do I drift along?<br><br>This is a question that I reckon no one could possibly know nor answer.<br><br>For me, I too am very much undecided.<br><br>I reckon I would most probably have to wait until next year for Reflections : 2005 to see what are the choices that I have made and whether I would be breathing relief or regret about them, before I can safely comment on the above.<br><br>In the meanwhile, all I want to say is that surving this year had not been easy. And I sincerely hope that the next one ahead of me will be a much relaxed, much better and much, much more happier one.<br></div>
