            <div class='col-md body'>Sum 41 to roar in Singapore<br><br>Canadian punk rockers will be the first int'l act to perform a concert in Singapore since The Rolling Stones!<br><br>Sum 41 will unleash its rambunctious brand of power punk pop at Fort Canning Park in Singapore on Wednesday, July 30th. The killer band will be one of the star attractions of the Singapore Roars events lined up by the Singapore Tourism Board to get the word out to the World that the island nation is free of the virus. Just last Saturday (June 21st) Sum 41 headlined a Sars benefit show in its hometown with Avril Lavigne in front of 70,000 fans.<br><br>"The Singapore Tourism Board is pleased to support this exciting concert as part of our Singapore Roars campaign. This will be the first international act we welcome to town since the Rolling Stones concert in March. In the month of July, both Singaporeans and tourists will be able to enjoy world class parties and concerts with ZoukOut Singapore Nokia Remix and Sum 41 happening back to back over a week." says Deputy Chairman &amp; Chief Executive of the Singapore Tourism Board, Mr. Lim Neo Chian.<br><br>Also working with concert organizer, LAMC Productions are MTV Networks Asia and the band's record label, Universal Music Group. Mr. Mishal Varma, Vice President of Programming/Talent &amp; Artists Relations, MTV Networks Asia, says: "MTV has always been committed in bringing quality music and entertainment to Asia. We are pleased to work with LAMC, the Singapore Tourism Board and UMG to present Sum 41 in Singapore. We are confident that their performance will delight many and it is a show that should not missed."<br><br>Ms. Laurietta Alaabons of LAMC Productions says: " We are very fortunate to have such a high profile group as Sum 41 come to Singapore, while other bands are still hesitant about coming to Asia. This is a big coup for Singapore." Furthermore, she says "Sum 41 will kick off a series of high profile gigs organized by LAMC Productions entitled Rock 'n' Roar Singapore. This will be a first of its kind for Singapore, an ongoing concert series featuring only the hottest artistes, contemporary and classic, from around the world.<br><br>Formed in the summer of 1996 in Ajax, Ontario, Sum 41 took its name from the fact that its four young members formed it exactly 41 days into the summer of that year. Its blend of infectious melodies with monster riffs from a mighty guitar section and manic rhythm proved irresistible to young people weaned on Green Day and Blink 182.<br><br>Sum 41 released its first album, Half Hour Of Power, in 2000. It then hit the charts with its follow-up, All Killer, No Filler, produced by Jerry Finn, who previously worked with Green Day and Blink 182. Its first single, Fat Lip, was a smash on MTV and radio. The band's other popular songs include Still Waiting, What I Believe, In Too Deep, and Rhythms.<br><br>With worldwide sales of more than 3 million albums under its belt, Sum 41 released it's highly anticipated follow up called Does This Look Infected? in late 2002. Awarding four out of five stars, Britain's Q magazine rave about its "sleek, pummeling anthems of teenage joy and confusion..." Sum 41 also contributed the song What We're All About to the Spider-Man soundtrack, and its music has been featured on the soundtracks to American Pie 2 and National Lampoon's Van Wilder.<br><br>In short, Sum 41 adds up to one of the most anticipated concerts of the year!<br><br>Tickets for Sum 41's gig are on sale now at all TicketCharge outlets in Singapore and Malaysia.
