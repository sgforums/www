            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Do not jump to conclusions concerning your romantic partner. People trying to entice you to join in will be less than trustworthy. You could be disillusioned if you let relative in on your emotional thoughts.<br>You will have difficulties spreading yourself between your work and your home. Think before you act if you wish to avoid friction. You can make financial gains through your unique and creative approach to business.<br>It looks like itÂ’s time for a bit of a clear out in your room or home, Libra. Because Mars has shifted into Sagittarius youÂ’ll be in an ultra dynamic mood, but there is a danger that while youÂ’re ruthlessly discarding what you donÂ’t need youÂ’ll end up throwing out something you do need!
