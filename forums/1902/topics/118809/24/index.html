            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Red tape could be impossible to clear up today. New friendships will develop through group events. Exhaustion combined with overindulgence could result in minor health problems.<br>Don't make excuses. Don't trust a deal that looks too good, or a lover who appears to have it all. Consider a conservative investment that will stay solid when everything else goes sour.<br>If it seems that the emphasis is a little too much on the old duties and responsibilities today then take heart. The challenging aspect making you feel low will fade late this afternoon, but in the meantime a piece of citrine will help keep things in perspective, and a fun evening will lift your mood no end!</div>

You need some rest.<br>YouÂ’ll have a fresher, easier day today, thanks to the moon, but donÂ’t be surprised if you feel the need for a constructive clear- out of your room, attic, or house.
