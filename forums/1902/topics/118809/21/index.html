You may have the day off but your thoughts will be on your work and your cash situation.<br>If you feel overcome with shyness today blame it on the position of your ruling planet and on the aspects influencing it. Besides, your friends, or your partner, will regard this less certain side of you as rather appealing, since they all too often only see the airy, bubbly side!</div>
