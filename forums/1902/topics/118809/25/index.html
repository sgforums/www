            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>You need to be careful not to make promises that you can't fulfill. Try not to let your emotions interfere with the completion of your work. Go out with friends.<br>You would be wise to consider attending lectures that will broaden your awareness concerning your professional direction. You will be uncertain of your feelings. You can expect the fur to fly on the home front.<br>The need to have some fun will absorb your time and energy today almost to the exclusion of all else, as youÂ’ll feel a desire to let off some steam after the last few demanding days. So go ahead and arrange something with a bunch of friends; just donÂ’t overdo anything or youÂ’re likely to regret it!</div>
