            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>You need to spend some time with individuals who have more experience than you. Overindulgence will be a problem if you are out in a social setting. You have two choices; Get out on your own, or bend to your mate's whims.<br>Take the time to sort out your personal papers and double-check your financial investments. Avoid being intimately involved with clients or colleagues. Try to keep your opinions to yourself.<br>There is a very real chance of promotion at work today. If you are still at school then the planets indicate that you are going to be singled out for some particularly high praise. One close friend is feeling rather down today so try to find some time for them in the midst of your celebrations.</div>

Whatever happens wonÂ’t quite be to your satisfaction, which could create tension. Keep a piece of blue agate with you to soften your mood.</div>

Talk to someone you trust if you need advice about broaching the subject.<br>Go on business trips if at all possible. Find out all the facts before you jump to conclusions. Don't lament to a friend about any grievance regarding your mate, or it may be hard to rectify your relationship.<br>While cash matters are looking favorable today your judgment is looking a little too scattered, thanks to Neptune, and for that reason you should avoid the mall, and avoid spending.
