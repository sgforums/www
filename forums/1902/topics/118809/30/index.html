            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>This is a great day to spend with family. Keep your eyes and ears alert for any evasive or deceptive statements. Refuse to get involved in idle chatter; it will only make you look bad.<br>You should consider getting your whole family involved in a project at home. Dig deep to find out how costly a new venture will be before you sign on the dotted line. Be sure to think twice before you say something that might hurt your partner's feelings.<br>Your horoscope today will be almost the exact opposite of VirgoÂ’s, in that youÂ’ll find that youÂ’re in a very go-getting mood, with an aim to achieve, achieve, achieve! Just remember to gently explain to friends or colleagues that youÂ’re not feeling too sociable at the moment!</div>

Don't let your family put demands on you.<br>Your ruling planet, Venus, has shifted out of Capricorn and has moved into Aquarius, but you wonÂ’t be able to appreciate the effects until the challenging aspect from the moon fades.

Romantic opportunities are evident if you get involved in large groups or organizations. New romantic relationships will develop through group activity related to sports events.<br>You may be thinking of starting your own business. You may be emotionally unstable if you let someone you care about get away with verbal abuse. Be sure to catch up on overdue correspondence and help those you love find solutions to their dilemmas.<br>Sentimental feelings will be in danger of overflowing today and so it will be important to keep a check on your emotions today. This is especially true in the work place or at school at a piece of blood stone or jasper will help to give you the inner reserve that you need to maintain at least until the evening.</div>
