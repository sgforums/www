            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Stuck in the Attachment/Courting Stage?</strong><br><br>In some couples, neither partner moves beyond the first stage. When this happens, the partners will find one of two maladaptations: either the "Happy" Couple or the "Frequent Fighters" (adapted from Bader &amp; Pearson, 198<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">:<br><br>The "<strong>Happy" Couples</strong>: These couples tend to be VERY anger/conflict avoidant and to function in their relationship in ways that keep any differences from emerging. If differences do emerge, they are accompanied with intense anxiety and fears of abandonment. These couples are inseparable and very dependent on each other for their identities which are developed only in relation to each other. Consequently, any threat of loosing the other triggers intense anxiety and is experienced as a devastating loss of self or as psychic disintegration.<br><br>Maintaining the relationship is the primary goal of these couples and is accomplished at the expense of individuality. There is a high level of passivity (looking to the other to make decisions/define experience) and adaptation (excessively meeting the partner's needs at the expense of one's own). Partners in this type of relationship loose more and more of their individual identity over time. There is an intense merging and blurring of interpersonal boundaries with a resulting expectation that they speak for each other. Talking to one is seen (by partners) as being as good as talking to both.<br><br>These couples are very good at obscuring their differences. They rush to problem-solving to avoid any conflict between them. They are also very good at using non-verbal communication to silence each other. <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">These partners fear loss of the relationship if the differences surface and come to treatment because they are uncomfortable with the amount of sameness required to maintain the relationship.</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>"Frequent Fighters": </strong>These partners tend to be "anger-habituated" and to use conflict &amp; aggression as a means of maintaining a sense of connectedness -- as well as a way to attain greater emotional distance.  Unlike the "Happy" couples, these partners use anger and conflict to fiercely defend their boundaries and avoid merger. In the early days of courting, these partners carry the belief that they have finally met the "one &amp; only" person who will be able to give them the love they missed during childhood. As reality sets in, each partners' anger and rage (at having their fantasy betrayed) emerges.<br><br>Each experiences his/her own needs as taking precedence over any distress felt by their partner with little awareness of the impact their actions have on the other. Complicating this is the unrealistic expectation (that their partner be the "all-giving" parent) is a contradictory (and frequently unconscious) belief that receiving nurturance is not deserved and so it is rejected and pushed away.<br><br>These couples do not ask directly for what they need. Instead, partners are expected to know by reading "between the lines" and failures at mind-reading may be responded to with anger and rage.<br><br>Even the most benign confrontation is often perceived as a "global attack" and quickly escalates out-of-control as each over-reacts to the other. Often this pattern of using conflict results in violence. Due to these individual's lack of a cohesive sense of self -- even constructive criticism may be perceived as manipulative or rejected because it was "too little, too late." Each sees him/herself as the victim of the other and stays focused on "what you are doing to me".<br><br>These couples have very poor negotiation and problem-solving abilities; issues that arise within the relationship are never adequately resolved. In addition, each may harbor resentments and frequently draw in old unfinished business, derailing discussion of the original topic. This is further complicated by their tendency to 1) project disowned parts of self onto their partners and to treat their partners with the same shame-based judgment that they avoid by disowning this aspect of his/herself and 2) draw assumptions about (mind-read) what their partner is thinking and react to that belief as though it were true and without ever checking out its validity.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Stage One: Attachment/Courting</strong><br><br>The first stage in any relationship is attachment and/or courting which leads to the blissful experience of "falling in love." The task of this stage is to create a bond strong enough that the relationship will hold up under the intense conflicts of the next stage as well as subsequent stages. Interpersonal boundaries blur as prospective partners begin a process of intense bonding and merging of their lives and personalities. There is a shift away from other outside relationships and a focus on similarities (rather than differences) -- which helps to establish a sense of "we" and "us."<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Stage Two: Dealing with Differences </strong><br><br>A partner enters this stage when he/she begins to self-reflect and discover subtle differences in thought and feelings and ideas. As these differences emerge, the task for each partner becomes the establishment of a healthy style of managing conflict. Interpersonal boundaries are re-established and conflict increases as each begins the process of acknowledging and learning to handle their newly emerging differences.<br><br>When both partners are in this stage at roughly the same time, this process evolves into a cooperative working together to manage these differences and clear areas of authority and responsibility are defined.<br><br>If one partner remains behind in the attachment/courting stage, the differentiating partner will experience pressure from his/her mate to return to a focus on sameness (similarities) -- to stop "rocking the boat." The partner who has entered this stage will fear loosing the relationship if he/she continues to express his/herself more openly and may experience anger that this new expression of self is not supported; the other partner fears abandonment and feels betrayed because his/her partner has stopped obscuring the differences that exist between them. Continuing to express these differences should pull the lagging partner into the next stage unless that individual is at an impasse due to unresolved individual issues.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Stage Three: Identity Formation - Development of Self in the Outside World</strong><br><br>This stage begins for a partner when his/her focus shifts away from the relationship to developing his/her identity in the outside world. This partner now asserts his/her independence is asserted by excluding the other. Requests for time spent together are experienced as engulfing; and, negotiation and compromise feel like a loss of self. A support system outside the relationship is more easily developed during this time. There may also be a renewed focus on educational and/or career goals which lead to a blossoming of the individual in the outside world as s/he learns to creatively express him/herself in it. This is accompanied by an increase in self-esteem for that partner.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Stage Four: Balance - Attaining Deeper Levels of Intimacy</strong><br><br>There is now a return shift to a greater desire for intimacy and emotional nurturing from the relationship with a increasing balance in movement between the relationship and the outside world (including use of one's extended emotional support system). There is a continually deepening of intimacy within the relationship as partners feel increasing safety in sharing their most private thoughts, feelings, etc. Negotiating skills developed earlier continue to be used but with greater ease. Due to the developing trust that one's needs will get met, there is an increasing capacity to give to one's partner even when inconvenient to do so.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm, I dunno...for the one I am currently in, I definitely need to develop my own self in the outside world, think I have been doing that and he has been doing the same thing, because right now we are physically apart. So can't really be with each other all the time ma, I got my own circle of friends here and he has his own circle of friends over there. We do try to spend as much time as possible talking to each other, but sometimes it is hard...so need to have an outside world as well.
