            <div class='col-md body'>On the heartwarming scale this rates as a positive scorcher.<br><br>A forlorn tigress, heartbroken because her own cubs have died, is fooled into adopting a litter of piglets when zoo officials in California wrap them in tiger skins.<br><br>Such a thing had never been tried before, according to the email which accompanied these pictures as they were sent around the world.<br><br>Unfortunately, there was a twist in the tiger's tale.<br><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/12_01/tigerpigsDM3011c_468x242.jpg"><br><span class="small">High on the hog: Five piglets in their tiger-skin coats doze peacefully across their surrogate mother at the zoo in Thailand. The tigress suckled and cared for the brood</span><br><br>Though the pictures have not been faked, an animal welfare pressure group investigated and discovered they were actually taken at a zoo in Thailand.<br><br>The Sriracha Tiger Zoo, an hour's drive from Bangkok, has been accused of causing its exhibits unnecessary suffering, and of using stunts to gain publicity.<br><br>These pictures must have been part of such a set-up, say experts, because it was unnecessary to wrap the piglets in their cute little tiger-skin coats.<br><br>It is apparently common practice in Thailand for tigers to suckle pigs, and for pigs to adopt orphaned cubs.<br><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/12_01/tigerpigsDM3011b_468x329.jpg"><br><span class="small">Pork scratching: A persistent piglet nuzzles up to the tigress as it tries to sleep</span><br><br>The tigress in these pictures was herself brought up by a sow, and sees pigs as family.<br><br>Though she had been given these babies to bring up, it is unclear whether she had lost a litter of her own, as the story claimed.<br><br>In another twist, the zoo has been investigated for allegedly breeding tigers for export to China - where tiger parts command high prices for use in traditional medicines.<br><br>Sommai Temsiripong, one of the zoo's owners, was charged with breeding tigers without a licence. On another occasion 23 tigers died of bird flu after being fed infected raw chickens.<br><br>Critics say that behind the scenes tigers are bred in poor conditions and the the London Zoological Society has been critical of Sriracha's animal husbandry.<br><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/12_01/tigerpigsDM3011a_468x714.jpg"><br><span class="small">Piggy in the middle: One baby takes cover</span><br><br>Adam Roberts, an investigator with Animal Welfare International, the respected American pressure group which investigated the pictures, wrote in its quarterly magazine that the zoo - with more than 400 tigers, a handful of Asian elephants, of crocodiles, camels, snakes and other exotic animals - had many troubling exhibits.<br><br>It also houses a circus, he said, where he saw tigers leaping through rings of fire, walking across a double tightrope, parading around the ring on hind legs, and riding on the back of a horse.<br><br>"Up close, however, one could clearly see the animals' debilitation and fear," he added.<br><br>"All of the animals awaited their turn to perform in a gated tunnel, keepers constantly poking them with a steel pole through the iron mesh."<br><br>Behind the scenes, bored elephants swayed at the end of 2ftlong chains anchored to the ground.<br><br>One had a long, deep scar across his ear - another was scarred across her trunk.<br><br>"After the show, the elephants stood in frot of the seats taking money from people with their trunks and passing it to the trainers astride their backs," Mr Roberts reported.<br><br>The zoo denies any wrongdoing.<br><br><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=498789&amp;in_page_id=1811" rel="nofollow">source</a></div>
