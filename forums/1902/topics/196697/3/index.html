In your work, there is possibility of a promotion or honorific distinction. Stay home this evening and try to determine clearly what you really want in life. In your affective life, you'll prefer keeping secret your most tender feelings, but don't: It's necessary to express them.<br><br>27 Jul 06<br>What you'll write will be convincing, so renew ties with persons whom you haven't heard from in some time by sending them a small letter or even simply a postcard. This astral climate will allow you to feel well at ease and to experience the joy of living. You must, however, beware of certain euphoria and smug optimism, which might induce you to carelessness. You must above all resist the impulse to spend, to buy quantities of things that will reveal themselves not useful at all.</div>
