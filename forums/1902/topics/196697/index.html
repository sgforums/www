            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b330/meepop/misc/12_pig.gif"><br>Contrary to its rather negative reputation in the West, the Pig of Chinese Astrology may be the most generous and honorable Sign of the Zodiac. Pigs are nice to a fault and possess impeccable manners and taste. They have so much of the perfectionist in them that others may be inclined to perceive them as snobs, but this is a misconception. Pigs are simply possessed of a truly luxurious nature, one that delights in finery and riches (in surroundings, food, lovemaking and otherwise). This Sign believes in the best qualities of mankind and certainly doesn't consider itself to be superior. Pigs also care a great deal about friends and family and work hard to keep everyone in their life happy. Helping others is a true pleasure for the Pig, who feels best when everyone else is smiling.<br><br>A Pig with no one around to appreciate its giving nature is a sad sight. Pigs are so magnanimous they can appear almost saintly; this can lead some less-than-well-intentioned souls to stomp all over this Sign, and the bad news is, the Pig will take the blows! Pigs make great companions in part because of their refusal to see the more negative or base qualities in a partner, but that rose-colored view can lead to this Sign's allowing itself to be taken advantage of. Contrary to their seemingly benign dispositions, however, Pigs can be quite venomous in response to being crossed by a lover, friend or business partner.<br><br>Pigs are highly intelligent creatures, forever studying, playing and probing in their quest for greater knowledge. They can be misinterpreted as being lazy, however, due to their love of reveling in the good stuff; this Sign could happily spend hours on end making love, napping, taking a long bubble bath or dallying over an incredible spread of rich foods. Pigs tend to make wonderful life partners due to their hearts of gold and their love of family. Even so, Pigs can be rather exclusive, choosing to spend time with those who will appreciate them most and ignore the rest of the populace. Pigs would do well to realize that there's more to life than being needed. When they open up their world to a diverse group of people, they will truly bloom.<br><br>The most compatible match for a Pig is the Rabbit or the Goat.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Famous Pigs</span>: Arnold Schwarzenegger, David Letterman, Winona Ryder.</div>

Natural homebodies, they are generous and devoted to their family and loved ones. Optimistic and industrious, they can become extremely successful in business. They get along well with most people and often have a wide and varied circle of friends. Boars tend to be naive, and it may be east to take advantage of their gullibility. </span><br><br>The Pig is: Honest, a spendthrift, a peacemaker, truthful, indulgent, reliable, giving, large sense of humor, generous, loving, a hard worker<br><br>Suited as a doctor, chemist, researcher, engineer, musician<br><br>Suited with the Goat, Rabbit, Rat, Tiger, Dog</div>

Your standing out this year may lead to better things, too - promotions, increments or increased responsibilities may happen for the lucky Pig! Though this is the case, you may find difficulty in communicating with peers and subordinates. Work a little harder on this, and you will enjoy a very prosperous 2006!<br><br>Love<br>There's love in the air for the Pig this 2006! The female pig is likely to meet a potential partner this year, and those in committed relationships may find the opportunity to get married this year as well!<br><br>Even married Pigs will be tempted to stray this year - third parties will suddenly emerge from the woodwork to seduce the married Pig. Keep your will strong, Pig, and do not succumb to a moment's urge this year. Keep communication between you and your partner open and warm, and you will see a blossoming of love, respect and fidelity for your partner.<br><br>Health<br>This year, the Pig's health will be on top form, but he or she may be susceptible to mood swings and general bad behavior - don't be surprised if there are some slurs cast at your direction! You will find yourself being rude and worse to others. The best way to deal with this situation is to just ask for personal space from friends and family. They will understand.</div>

You'll have chance but it will be brought about more by others than by yourself -- it's they who'll come up to you, proposing to you a job, love or other things. Be careful in your relations with your superiors, as this astral ambiance will incite you to a rebellious attitude that you'll have difficulty controlling.</div>

You may have problems with your close ones: you'll be more secretive than ever and you'll withdraw into your shell; your taste for criticism will increase.

            <div class='col-md body'>29 June 2006<br>This time you will not be able to solve your amorous problems by appealing to your physical capacity; you will realize that love is a much more sentimental, rather than physical, affair.

            <div class='col-md body'>1 Jul 06<br>All that concerns financial questions must be studied carefully; avoid money conflicts, which would draw you into unhappy situations. Also avoid too large expenses on the personal plane. Your nerves may be somewhat strained. You'll have the impression that all that you undertake fails, and this will be apt to throw your mood down. You'll be exposed to a powerful temptation of a purely sensual order; you may meet a person who'll profoundly stir you or will exercise an almost irresistible attraction on your senses.</div>

Family discussions might take a very stormy turn if you do not show more tolerance and understanding. In your couple, don't let certain of your relationships with members of the opposite sex mingle with your private life; otherwise there are sure to be problems! A friend of yours may need help; heed their appeal, don't escape it!<br><br>3 Jul 06<br>You will receive excellent news concerning your family life or your finances. You may meet someone who will make your heart throb deliciously, but don't neglect your health despite your present euphoria. Beware of errors due to carelessness and haste: You'll be so much in a hurry to reach your objective that you'll attempt to cut corners, forgetting that a slapdash job has always to be done again!<br></div>
