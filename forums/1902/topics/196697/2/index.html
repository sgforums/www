You'll be right in having the will to pursue what you've undertaken; although you'll have to cope with delays, resistances and obstructions of all kinds. Beware of food poisoning!

If you're free, you'll meet your ideal soul mate; if you're living as a couple, your mutual relations will deepen. On the professional plane, expect some difficulties, but you'll finally triumph if you're patient and methodical. One of your children may need your help or advice but is too shy to ask for it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>7 Jul 06<br>Money is not everything, you'll say, and you'll be right to think so; but is this a reason for throwing your money out the window or to conduct your pecuniary business contrary to common sense? Relationships between spouses or mates will be very fine; all possible domestic squabbles and disputes will end in romantic reconciliation. You'll be somewhat anxious for no apparent reason; be reassured, for nothing really unfortunate can happen to you if you make use of courage and patience.</div>

You'll experience happiness in sharing unforgettable moments with your near ones. No more anguishes or fears, which have seized you often and without valid reason. This sentimental climate is both explosive and tender; a real set of fireworks: You'll love with ardor and passion, and you'll lose your reason and heart for it.

            <div class='col-md body'>9 Jul 06<br>Spare your body, otherwise you'll feel abnormally tired; control your diet. Don't hurry, otherwise you'd only commit errors upon errors. You'd be wrong to put your confidence in certain persons who are trying to be kind to you at this time. A great professional success seems to be very hypothetical; you'd better keep a low profile. Your couple life will be harmonious, and if you're single, love at first sight will befall you before the stroke of midnight.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>10 Jul 06<br>If you deem that your present sentimental situation is not entirely satisfactory, profit by this favorable astral ambiance to improve it; in any case, remember that to love is to give much more than to receive. You may have the desire to avenge somebody for an insult; try to dispel this desire, otherwise you'd only nurse your wounds and make yourself unhappy. Risks of temporary digestive troubles, eat more fruits and green vegetables, and drink much plain water between your meals.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>21 Jul 06<br>The friendship you'll acquire today deserves to be tended with the utmost care, as a delicate plant. Be careful in all your financial transactions, for there will be cheating in the air. If you must travel to a third-world country, be sure to get yourself vaccinated beforehand. Reduce your consumption of foods rich in sugars and fats. You may be exposed to the hostility of certain coworkers or superiors; keep a low profile in order to avoid conflicts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>22 Jul 06<br>Discouragement can't overcome you, for you'll have enough force of will and lucidity to draw useful lessons from your recent failures. You should make a decisive sentimental encounter this time, and you'll realize that you have much common ground with this new person; with them you'll rapidly form projects for the future. Your sleep may be somewhat agitated; a walk or some relaxation exercises will prove very useful to you. This time you'll need to recover all your calm and serenity so as to be able to fulfill all your obligations.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>23 Jul 06<br>Restraint and moderation should be your mottoes this time, as you'll tend to react badly to minor events and expend much energy uselessly. Beware of making much noise for nothing. If you haven't met your soul mate, this will very probably be done this time. Frequent an environment where you feel at ease, show yourself under the most favorable light. How it's difficult to follow the diet which you've decided to adopt! You'll be very much tempted to let yourself go!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>24 Jul 06<br>Your intellectual faculties will reach a level that will even astonish you. You'll be in a position to make fruitful agreements; but beware not to let yourself be dragged into a hazardous financial venture. Under the present astral influences, love affairs may be a source of illusions for many single natives of the sign; if these persons want to pursue their relationship of the moment, they must make things quite clear with their partner. Those who are married will be more relaxed than usual and can establish a pleasurable mode of relations within their couple.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>25 Jul 06<br>Your sleep may be slightly troubled; one hour of sport or walking will certainly help you relax and prepare for a good night -- absolutely refrain from sleeping pills. In any case, your state of health will very closely depend on your morale. You'll be compelled to accept non-wished-for changes, but your good common sense will help you adapt yourself rapidly to the new situation. The contracts signed this time will have great chances of prosperity; but beware of your impulsiveness and excessive outspokenness.</div>
