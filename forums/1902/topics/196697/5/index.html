A quiet day in your work; only those in tourism and show business will know great activity, and money investments, speculations and acquisitions will be favorable to them. Renounce certain activities that are too futile and that you continue solely by the force of habit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>19 Sep 06<br>Good health, but beware of food excesses. Be tolerant and understanding in your couple life and your efforts will be well rewarded. If you have to solve an inheritance affair or any other problem concerning your family belongings, you'll be particularly favored; on the whole, being well inspired, you'll manage your budget judiciously. You'll realize the benefits of a good balance in all fields and will actively look for the golden mean. Think of pampering yourself a little instead of always being on the go.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>20 Sep 06<br>You who began to doubt love will this time have a reawakening. Your children will reproach you for being a little too serious. If your business affairs evolve as you wish, don't change anything in their present course. If that's not the case, try to find out the causes and analyze them carefully before making any decisions. You'll have the will to succeed in your career, but show prudence and discernment.</div>

Some health concerns due to nervous fatigue; you're rather overworked so, above all, learn to relax and to rest. The stars will help you to put certain of your dreams into concrete form, to bring to a successful conclusion certain projects that many deemed unrealizable. Don't be too assertive in the expression of your opinions; modesty will pay. In work, your reputation and prestige will be on the upswing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>22 Sep 06<br>If you've had a dispute with your relatives, the moment will be propitious to a reconciliation. Drive away your black ideas before they can do you harm. Your nervousness will pop up where you least expect it, either in the form of skin problems or in the form of floods of hurting words that you'll have difficulty holding back. In your work, your patience will be put to test; but things will end up straightening themselves out. Beware of certain of your friends who try to draw you into ruinous ventures.</div>

If you're single, you'll have passionate, exalting love affairs. Eat a balanced, organic diet. Astral influxes very favorable to students and intellectual workers; a particular piece of good luck for those who must undergo examinations or interviews.

            <div class='col-md body'>24 Sep 06<br>Rather animated discussions will flare up among members of your family; be careful not to take part in them, otherwise you'll run the risk of a dispute. On the other hand, try to solve a disagreement with diplomacy. There'll be for you love at first sight, an unexpected amorous encounter, a vigorous sentimental renewal or extraordinary passionate fervor. Very lucky day for those who begin a career.

Possibility of rheumatism, gout and pains in the hips. Understanding within the couple will be mediocre; this will not be the time to have important discussions with the spouse or mate. If you do not concretely show your feelings for the loved one, he or she might believe you're indifferent.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>26 Sep 06<br>In love, resist your current desire to engage yourself thoughtlessly. In business, luck will be with you: speculate, ask for a loan, etc. You'll be well inspired and your ideas will be worth gold; you'll succeed in giving free rein to your creative imagination without losing sight of the practical and concrete aspect of things. If you surf on Internet, you'll have an excellent chance to find elements that will prove very useful to your work. Predisposed natives of the sign will suffer from swellings and pins and needles in their legs.</div>

You'll have the benefit of a good climate of understanding and agreement; profit by it so as to harmonize your friendships. You can also without danger try to expose your ideas or make your viewpoint on certain things prevail; don't be either too absolute or authoritative.

You'll adore status symbols; if your means allows it, you won't hesitate to offer yourself the car or apartment of your dreams. Think more toward the future. In society, you'll have the possibility to shine and to find yourself a good place in the sun. Don't live your love in a vacuum; the contact with others will make your couple evolve positively.</div>

Some family problems, which demand to be solved with calm and method. Beware of your tendency to complicate the most simple facts.

            <div class='col-md body'>9 Oct 06<br>Think to balance your meals better by reducing the quantity of meat and by eating more pasteurized dairy products, fresh vegetables and fresh fruits. Single natives of both sexes, profit well by the idyllic climate of this day to discover an affectionate and stable mate; refrain from judging them too severely. The Moon will give you real lift and will incite you to action; the projects that were pending will take on importance -- in summary, everything can be done easily and brilliantly.</div>
