              <p>WASHINGTON – Scientists looking for lost penguins stumbled upon an effective method: Follow their poop from space.</p>
              <p>In remote <span id="lw_1243938673_0" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Antarctica</span>,
              about one-and-a-half times bigger than the United States, researchers
              have been unable to figure out just where colonies of emperor penguins
              live and if their population is in peril.</p>
              <p>It's harder still because emperor penguins, featured in the film "<span id="lw_1243938673_1" class="yshortcuts">March of the Penguins</span>," breed on sea ice, which scientists say will shrink significantly in the future because of <span id="lw_1243938673_2" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">global warming</span>. Because the large penguins stay on the same ice for months, their poop stains make them stand out from space.</p>
              <p>Scientists at the <span id="lw_1243938673_3" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">British Antarctic Survey</span> found this out by accident when they were looking at <span id="lw_1243938673_4" class="yshortcuts">satellite images</span> of their bases. A reddish-brown streak on the colorless ice was right
              where they knew a colony was, said survey mapping scientist Peter
              Fretwell.</p>
              <p>The stain was penguin poo —
              particularly smelly stuff — and it gave researchers an idea to search
              for brown stains to find penguins. They found the same telltale trail,
              usually dark enough to spot from space, all over the continent, said
              Fretwell by telephone from England.</p>
              <p>Using
              satellite data, the scientists found 10 new colonies of penguins, six
              colonies that had moved from previously mapped positions to new spots
              and another six that seemed to have disappeared. Overall, 38 colonies
              were spotted from above, according to Fretwell's paper, "Penguins From
              Space" in the journal Global Ecology and <span id="lw_1243938673_5" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Biogeography</span>.</p>
              <p>"It's a very important result scientifically, even though it's a lighthearted method," Fretwell said Monday.</p>
              <p>Even
              though Antarctic sea ice hasn't melted so far, scientists predict it to
              shrink by one-third by the end of the century, potentially threatening
              the birds, Fretwell said.</p>
              <p>The research is
              "incredibly useful," because the only time to see emperors are during
              breeding in winter when weather makes it nearly impossible to get to
              the colonies, said longtime penguin researcher William Fraser, who
              wasn't involved in the study. Fraser noted that salty penguin guano
              "over time will corrode your boots," adding that he has lost nearly a
              dozen pairs to poop in 35 years of penguin research.</p>
