            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Chinese Astrology Elements - Introduction</strong><br><br>Astrology's naysayers are often silenced when reminded that this age-old art is based on math and science. Such is certainly the case where the Chinese Elements are concerned.<br><br>Ancient Chinese astrologers favored a 60-year cycle, a tendency common to both Eastern and Western astrology. In this cycle, each 60-year span is a third of the "Great Solar Cycle" of 180 years. It is also equivalent to the number of years it takes to assign each of the five Chinese Elements to one of the twelve animal signs (5 x 12 = 60).<br><br>As such, the Chinese Elements add an extra layer of meaning to each of the animal signs. Whether it's reinforcing a stern disposition or mellowing a happy-go-lucky mood, the Elements of Metal, Water, Wood, Fire and Earth serve to put our basic "animal" characteristics in a sharper light.<br><br><img src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b330/meepop/misc/yrelements.jpg"><br>* <span class="small">Dates shown are estimates and do not take into account the exact handover time of seasons (which may be important for people born on certain days) </span></div>

You make everyone feel special, noting and praising each person's unique talents.<br><br>Your inherent pliability, the fluid calm that makes you so appealing, can also make you sometimes too passive, too willing to be what someone wants you to be. You tend to take the shape of whatever container you're poured into. Rather than letting others dam up your energies, let yourself flow freely!<br><br>Creative Water Signs always make a splash!</div>

The purpose behind the grouping is the three group animals have identical thinking according to Chinese scholars. Despite the variable facets of the individual animals, the style of understanding and thinking is aligned.The four groups are:<br><br>First Group- Rat, Dragon, Monkey<br>All these animals are action oriented ones, they have positive thinking and are high class competitors and are true to their core and character. Rat is timid and a coward, Dragon is full of courage and self-confidence and of high thinking. He has the ability to understand the intelligence of the Rat and the cunningness of the Monkey. Monkey needs the intellignece of the Rat and the courage of the Dragon. Due to the above said factors they are complementary to each other.<br><br>Second Group- Ox, Snake, Rooster<br>These are deep thinking animals who continue to dwell upon one aspect or the other. They are always conscious about attaining their objective. Ox is strong and sturdy, but desires to possess the diplomacy of the Snake. The Rooster aspires to possess Snake's alertness and the Ox's strength.<br><br>Third group- Tiger, Horse, Dog<br>They love freedom and hassle free movement. All these animals are quadrupeds and believe firmly in situations of personal ego. Horse requires Tiger's exciteability and Dog's transparency, Tiger needs Dog's sense of duty towards its master and the transparencey and it also needs continuous mobility of the Horse.<br><br>Fourth Group- Rabbit, Goat, Pig<br>These are all peace loving animals and believe in mutual co-operation. They are neither too zealous and active and do not believe in accepting challenges and risks as they are highy sensitive animals. They also have great ability to elicit and seek sympathy, hence they are considerate, love and sympathise with each other. Pig requires Rabbits's crafty ability and Goat's civility and humility.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>West Meets East: Western / Eastern Horoscope - The Rat<br><br>Aries Rat<br>The Aries rat is fully confident in their abilities, and is always trying to test themselves. Bold and adventuresome, the Aries Rat is very charming and courteous, but can sometimes be cranky and curt. Those who can't keep up with our dynamic Rat or are prone to disagree with them are often quite familiar with this short-temper.<br><br>Taurean Rat<br>These people are impressive by nature. While they may appear to be slow and ordinary on the surface, one must remember that appearances can be deceiving. The Taurean Rat is very vigorous on the inside. They are quick-witted, and never lose sight of what they want. They are influenced by money and wealth, these being the primary forces motivating them.<br><br>Gemini Rat<br>These people are witty conversationalists. The Gemini Rats are quite good at expressing what exactly they want, when they know what it is they want. They are intellectually quite strong, and very quick and clever. This emphasis on thinking quickly can often lead to Gemini Rats that are easily bored. They love multitasking and are always looking for new challenges.<br><br>Cancerian Rat<br>The Cancerian Rat likes to stand against the current. They treasure their individuality and never loose sight of who they are. They take comfort in the material world. Money and possessions are comforts, but would quickly be sacrificed by the Cancerian Rat if it would give them a stable loving family.<br><br>Leonine Rat<br>The Leo influence gives the Rat a charming charisma that immediately draws others. This Rat will experience a dynamic enthusiasm that will bring them qualities of attentiveness &amp; generosity. Their future is guided by their ability to make the correct decisions in tricky situations. They are very wise and should not be underestimated.<br><br>Virgo Rat<br>The Virgo Rat loves detail. They love to look, analyze and analyze again! Their career will most definitely flourish if it requires this diligent examination into areas others may find mundane. They sometimes give off an aura of naivete, and this will undoubtedly attract some lame companions.<br><br>Libran Rat<br>The Libran Rat is appreciates all things lavish. They are suave conversationalists and revel in the world of the sophisticated &amp; refined. They are supporters of the arts, and will find success in careers that reward smooth operators.<br><br>Scorpio Rat<br>If they had to be summed up in one word, it would be: intense. These people are very emotional, which isn't to say that they always reveal their feelings. Their emotions run deep, and they use this to channel and intensify their energies. Driven by their emotions they often come off as the strong silent type.<br><br>Sagittarian Rat<br>These people love to move. They appear to act on the spur of the moment, but in actuality they see what they want, analyze the situation and act, long before anyone would suspect. They are graced with ample portions of luck and wisdom.<br><br>Capricorn Rat<br>The Capricorn Rat is straight forward and direct. They work hard at what they do, and for whom they love. They are not particularly dreamers, or very romantic, but they are very industrious and absolutely faithful.<br><br>Aquarian Rat<br>These Rats are blessed with that easygoing Aquarian charm. Often they are outside the norm, leading to some spontaneous actions, but their intentions are good. They are more selfless than most other Rats, and they work hard for the benefit of all.<br><br>Piscean Rat<br>These people are tender and affectionate. They make the most out of opportunities that involve working with people. They have strong artistic and creative potential, but this is often overshadowed by their own self-doubt. They long to be part of the team.</div>
